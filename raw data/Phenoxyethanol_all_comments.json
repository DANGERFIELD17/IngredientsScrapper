    "body": "Hey everyone, \n\nI had a couple of extra tryptic soy agar plates at work so Friday I swabbed some stuff and took some pics yesterday, thought you might be interested!\n\nHere's the whole pictures of [plate one](https://imgur.com/RMQCfyp) and [plate two](https://imgur.com/7qDvceK)\n\nI did:\n\n- [my beauty blender that I always put back in my makeup bag while it's still wet](https://imgur.com/068wU1I)\n\n- [an eyeshadow brush that was last cleaned at Christmas](https://imgur.com/v5r2aA8)\n\n- [the oldest lipgloss I have](https://imgur.com/immDztI)\n\n- [my three year old Dipbrow](https://imgur.com/kA4htOs)\n\n- [a seven month old mascara](https://imgur.com/KGe3lM5)\n\n- [a misc use sponge brush](https://imgur.com/CaatsyZ)\n\nI was really surprised by the growth on the Dipbrow since it's pretty dry, I also thought it was interesting that the mascara had the least growth because I always hear to throw them away at three months and I never do haha. I wonder if it's the composition of the makeup or which part of the face it's used on that causes some of these to have a lot of species and the others to have just one, I'd love to hear your thoughts!\n\nQuick note - don't be too freaked out by these, this just shows that bacteria are present, which you probably already knew. It doesn't tell us what's there because I didn't isolate colonies, and it doesn't tell us if they're harmful. The majority of them are likely commensals that were picked up off your skin and are nothing to be worried about :) \n\nEDIT: More info for ya! \n\n**Thank you all for sharing your knowledge and nerding out with me here <3**\n\n- /u/jenntotheferr has some possible species ID if you're wondering\n\n\"I used to work in a micro lab at a hospital and identified a lot of bacteria and yeasts. It looks like a lot of staph neg to me, and the yellow wet colonies are probably staph aureus. I'm torn between those spready yellow dry colonies being staph aureus doing something weird versus being a micrococcus (just more skin flora). The small dry white colonies are probably corynebacterium sp while the larger, white, creamy colonies are more likely yeast (candida albicans is a normal skin flora). On that second picture there are large wet colonies that kind of look pinkish, and I'm thinking those are a gram negative rod based on how big and wet looking they are. Someone mentioned propionobacterium and honestly unless this was incubated for a few days I'm not sure they would show up, usually they grow better anaerobically but I have had some outliers show up slowly aerobically first.\nEdit: just noticed a dry spready white one on the beauty blender pic. I think that's a diptheroid/corynebacterium as well. So fun to look at.\"\n\n- /u/cassquesadilla has some assurances if you're worried!\n\n\"Just want to add my two cents as a biologist who loves makeup as well. Makeup is allowed to have a certain number CFUs of both bacteria and fungus (Of certain types, some indicator organisms are not allowable). At my job I test bioburden and things of that nature for non-sterile products (basically anything that’s not injected) and see this all the time. Finding bacteria in unused/sealed makeup is normal and safe. For example, I always find that vaginal suppositories for yeast infections always seem to be positive for fungus, kind of ironic.\"\n\n- /u/CBingRun 's comment about regulations and chemistry because I think it's cool\n \n\"Hi! Cosmetic scientist in Regulatory here (BS in microbiology).\nI love this stuff! It would have been interesting to isolate the colonies. It’s probably normal skin biota, but the nerd in me loves understanding more.\n\nJust as an FYI, the ISO 22716 standards for cosmetics are:\nStaphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella are all at <100 CFU/g\n\nHowever the standard for Yeast and Mold is absence.\n\nEdit: also there is always a strong preservative system in place in mascaras. Most brands use phenoxyethanol for antimicrobial properties. The eye is so susceptible to infection, it’s good to have one even if anhydrous.\n\nI don’t know what your lipgloss was, but I’m sure it was anhydrous so no preservative system.\"\n\n",

    "body": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. \n\n",

Yellow dye appears to have been added to the lotion to give the appearance of fully evolved retinol being an ingredient as retinol usually makes creams look yellow.\n* The peptides used claim to target fine lines and elasticity, but only proven by in-vitro studies (i.e. in controlled lab environments) vs. in-vivo (i.e. on living organisms)\n\nThank you for this in-depth review, skincare\\_chemist19!

You seduce and beguile me with your promises of retinoids, of copper peptides, of new and enticing vitamin C derivatives. And yet - AND YET - you won't tell me how much of them are included.\n\nI do not demand your entire formulas, no. I am aware that would be revealing too many of your secrets. I don't demand that you break down for me the supporting ingredients, the amount of panthenol and sodium hyaluronate you include so you can tell me that \"soothing, moisturising\" ingredients are included. I ask only this: if you include an ingredient in the name of your product, tell me how much of that ingredient is in the product.\n\nThis goes out to Mad Hippie, who ignored my message inquiring after the % of vitamin A in their Vitamin A Serum. This goes out to Pixi, who told me that the amount of retinol in their Retinol Eye Cream is a trade secret. This goes out to every Vitamin C Toner that may contain anywhere between 2% and 10% of vitamin C; every definitely-not-blue copper peptide serum; every cica spray with Centella asiatica so far down the ingredients list that it may as well just be water.\n\nDon't make me guess. Don't make me pore over the INCI looking for phenoxyethanol to act as a 1% marker, or go digging through strange blogs in case some influencer's publicity pack told them something that you won't tell me. It's not a problem if there isn't much of the star in there! Maybe I don't want very much! Please, just be honest with me.\n\nCosmetics industry, I have spent so much on you. I'm sure we can get past this. Just give me this one little thing. All I need is your honesty. Is that too much to ask?\n\nWith loving exasperation,\n\nTansy\\_Blue\n\nPS - stop telling me that \"1% RetiStar\" is a powerful retinol (actual percent retinol: 0.05%), or that your product is \"3% encapsulated retinoid\" (actual percent retinol: 0.3%). And for goodness sake stop saying that retinyl palmitate is an effective anti-aging agent. What is it about retinol that brings this out in you? Stop misleading me or making me guess how much of this powerful, potentially dangerous compound I am putting on my face.",

However, we can confirm that we used the highest concentration possible of each ingredient to give the best results, without irritating your skin.*\n\nIt honestly came across as so patronizing. I didn't ask about their exact ratios - I asked about the vitamin C percentage which many other companies freely share but theirs is apparently \"top secret\"? As an informed consumer, I am well aware of the highest concentration of vitamin C skin can tolerate before irritation occurs - don't just reassure me with empty words and no real information. \n\nI did not end up purchasing their vitamin C serum.\n\nEDIT: it appears Glossier has changed their ways since I interacted with them last year and they now provide the percentage of the vitamin C on the product page.

I don’t mind that much for my own personal use because I like playing with different skincare products. But, for a client, I want to be able to provide them with proper products, so it just kind of sucks. When brand representatives come in, I usually try to ask about %. Usually they will say they don’t know, and how the brand does not know/will not say how much it is. Or they flat out say they’re not allowed to tell us. When asked why they don’t know or won’t tell us, they say it’s because the brand (usually) believes that the % does not matter. Rather, when in combination with the other ingredients, it will work amazingly. For example: a 5% vitamin C in conjunction with turmeric will work better than a 20% vitamin C. (Just a random example, not saying this is true). So I’m thinking the brands who won’t mention it, USUALLY are pretty low in percentage, or they can’t fully prove the percentage? I don’t know. From a selling perspective, it is a bad choice. Clients always go towards the products with clear percentage. They should consider that.",

        "body": "Someone working in a cosmetics company here: FYI the 1% Phenoxyethanol marker may not be as trustworthy as you think. The regulatory limit in Europe for this is 1%, that doesnt mean companies are actually using at 1%. If formulated correctly, it may only be needed at <0.5%, also depending on the product type and if you have any other preservatives or boosters present in the formula. So although alot of people use this marker to check if an active is above or below 1%, it could actually be present alot lower than this.\n\nThe company i work for are bringing out Vitamin C and Retinol products and I made it clear that if we bring these out, we need to be able to tell the consumers how much of the active will be present. For Vitamin C it will be on pack (10%) and the Retinol we are actually restricted to 0.1% as per market regulations in certain countries we sell in. It's better to be transparent to customers than to pretend its a 'trade secret' or not letting people know because you're worried what they'll think when they find out its present alot lower than we make it out to be. (If it's that low in the product why bother releasing it in my opinion). With actives tho you'll normally see 'clinically/scientifically proven' claims, so we have to do tests to make sure that the percentage we're using actually works. We cant just stick that claim on there as markets will require proof of testing before registering the product there.\n\nI saw a comment about Retinol, Vitamin C as well as hyaluronic acid derivatives: how can you claim it contains 'Retinol/Vit C/'Hyaluronic Acid' when it actually contains the derivatives that are less potent? I have questioned this and unfortunately there doesnt seem to be an regulatory framework around it, so companies can claim what they like as long as you can provide proof that you are using a 'form' of Retinol/Hyaluronic Acid/Vitamin C, etc in the product.",

I've written a post about Retinol a while ago as well:  [Why retinol percentages can be misleading..](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/fr5275/misc_why_retinol_can_be_misleading/)\n\nSome ingredients that can be helpfull to spot the 1% line: Carbomer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic acid (especially when other thickeners like xanthan gum are present, most often <1%), Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Bisabolol (usually <0.5%), Benzyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Peptides, Ceramides, Retinol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (most formulas I see have <1%), Pentaerythrityl Tetra-DI-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Levulinic Acid, to name a few. Very often you just see the standard blends that they've used as well.\n\nNow look at some PC Antioxidant Serums with these 1% line markers in mind, and as a consumer you basically can't say for sure they contain an effective concentration.   \nMany brands also refer with their percentage to a tradename mixture they've added to a formula, not the single active, so for the Inkey List: 2.5% \"Lipo Hyaluronic Acid solution\", 1% \"RetiStar\", 0.5% \"Granactive Retinoid\", their C-50 treatment, with 5% \"Stay C-50\",  I think that's confusing because consumers don't know the composition of these mixtures. Their moisturizer with vitamin B, C and E, they claim the actives control excess oil, brighten skin, sooth redness, I mean look at the ingredient list, seriously there's barely anything in there. \n\nIts annoying that companies try to get the 1% line very high on the ingredient list, then under 1% list the actives first, and make all kinds of claims about these ingredients, while we have no way of verifying wether they are present at an effective concentration. Just list everything from highest to lowest concentration, that would already be much better. I know it's not mandatory for them to disclose percentages, but well if you buy a sunscreen you also want to know wether its SPF10 or SPF50, and the same applies to skincare in my opinion, you want to have some way of telling wether the ingredients are present in an effective concentration.",

    "body": "\nNgayong araw i-rereview ko ang Hikari Ultrawhite Sunscreen. Bago pa na-i-launch yung tinted sunscreen ng same brand, sobrang hype nito sa Tiktok, at marami na ding mga content creators sa Tiktok ang nakapagreview dito. Magbabahagi lamang ako dito ng point of view ko bilang isang cosmetic chemist at titingnan at magkukumento ako sa mga technical na detalye na nakapaloob dito sa produkto na ito. \n\nBago ang lahat, binili ko itong product sa legitimate na distributor ng brand sa Tiktok. Marami na kasi akong napanuod na videos nung CEO ng brand na kung saan sinabi nya na pinepeke daw ang product na ito. Gusto ko lang na lehitimong product ang gagawan ko ng review. Saktong sakto din na fresh batch yung dumating kong order, dahil kita naman sa batch code nito na nitong April 2025 lang ito na-produce. \n\nPagkabukas ko pa lamang ng product, ang unang bumungad sa akin ay ang fragrance nito. May kalakasan ang fragrance nito na may floral at milky scent. Maaring di akma ang produkto na ito sa mga end user na may sensitivity sa mga fragrance. \n\nSunod kong napansin ay yung kulay nito. Makikita nyo sa pic na kulay pink itong product. Mahalaga itong property na ito ng sunscreen kaya balikan ko ito mamaya. \n\nKapag inilagay na sa daliri yung product para sukatin ito bago ipahid sa balat, napansin ko na medyo nagtutubig or nagiging runny. Babalikan ko din ito mamaya pagdating natin sa analysis ng ingredient list nitong product. \n\nKapag ipinahid na ito sa balat, lightweight naman ang texture nito. Madaling ma-blend at walang white cast, na ok para sa moreno kong balat. Wala din akong napansin na pilling o paglilibag during application nitong sunscreen. So far, so good. \n\nNgayon, tumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list:\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Octyl, Methoxycinnamate, Dimethicone, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Polypodium Extract, Baicalin (Scutellaria Root Extract), Phenoxyethanol, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Carbomer 940 & Fragrance\n\nKung nabasa nyo na yung previous review ko sa Hikari Premium Sun Perfect Tinted Sunscreen Broad Spectrum, lahat ng typographic errors  at maling INCI name ng ingredient na nasa ingredient list ay nandito din sa Hikari Ultrawhite Sunscreen. Ang kinaibahan lang, yung tinted, may Niacinamide at Vitamin E. \n\nNgayon, balikan natin yung kulay nitong sunscreen na ito. Sa ingredient list, wala akong makita na ingredient na naging dahilan kung bakit naging kulay pink itong sunscreen. Walang colorant na ginamit. Sa mga nakalistang ingredients, walang isa jan ang kulay pink. So kung ano man ang nakakapagpa-pink jan ay hindi nakadeclare. Bakit kaya? \n\nBalikan naman natin yung napansin ko na nagtutubig yung product kapag in-contact na sa daliri. Marami akong nakitang users na sa Tiktok na nagtataka bakit daw watery or nagtutubig yung sunscreen. Dahil yan sa carbomer (ito ang tamang INCI names hindi  Carbomer 940). Ano ba itong carbomer na ito? Itong ingredient na ito, kapag ihinalo sa tubig at inadjust ang pH sa 5-7, pinalalapot nito ang tubig at nagiging gel. Ito gel na ito ay inherently na nagbe-break kapag ito ay napadikit o nalagyan ng ions. And since sagana ang ating balat sa ions (mula sa pawis, at naiiwan sa balat kahit natuyuan na ng pawis), expected talaga na magbe-break yung gel at magtutubig. \n\nNabanggit ko na din lamang na kailangang i-adjust ang pH ng tubig na may carbomer para lumapot, bakit kaya hindi nakalista sa ingredient list yung mga neutralizing agents (halimbawa: sodium hydroxide, triethanolamine) na normal namang ginagamit kapag may carbomer sa formulation? Napansin  ko din ito dun sa tinted version ng sunscreen ng Hikari. \n\nIsa pang napansin ko sa magkaparehong sunscreen ng Hikari, bakit hindi nakalista yung emulsifier na ginamit? Papaanong nabuo itong gel cream na ito kung walang emulsifier? Kasi kung walang emulsifier sa mga sunscreen na binanggit ko, hindi mabubuo at maghihiwalay lang yung water at oil phase ng mga unscreen na yan. Baka naman meron, pero di lang inilista? Kung meron man, dapat nakadeklara yan, alinsunod sa Cosmetic Labelling Requirements ng ASEAN Cosmetic Directive. This applies din dun sa mga nauna kong binanggit (yung nagpapapink dito sa sunscreen, at yung neutralizing agent na ginamit para sa carbomer). Paano kaya to nakalusot sa FDA? \n\nNgayon punta naman tayo sa mga product claims nito na may concern ako:\n\n* UVA/UVB SPF 50 PA++++\n* Non-comodogenic\n* Repairs sun damage\n\nItong sunscreen na ito ay gumagamit ng tatlong UV filters:\n\n* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (ganito ang tamang INCI name) \n* Zinc Oxide\n* Titanium Dioxide\n\nAng Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate at Titanium Dioxide ay parehong UVB filters, samantalang ang Zinc Oxide naman ay UVA/UVB filter. Ang tanong ko lang, papaanong pumalo ng SPF 50 ang rating nito at may PA++++ rating pa, samantalang mas mababa pa ang concentration ng zinc oxide at titanium dioxide sa phenoxyethanol? Assuming na isinagad sa 1% yung phenoxyethanol, ibig sabihin nito, mababa pa sa 1% yung zinc oxide at titanium dioxide. Papaanong papalo yan ng SPF 50 at magkakaroon ng PA++++ sa ganyang kababang amount? Napapaisip tuloy ako kung SPF tested ba talaga to. May pinakita na bang SPF test result para sa sunscreen na ito, pati na din dun sa tinted? Kasi diba ganun ang uso sa mga local brand owner ng sunscreen, kanya kanyang lapag ng SPF test report as part of their marketing? \n\nDoon naman sa NON-COMODOGENIC, please lang, uso ang mag proof-read bago mag-approve ng packaging layout ha. Kasimple-simple e. \n\nSa claim na \"Repairs sun damage\", bawal yang claim na yan dahil ini-imply na may physiological effect (repair sun damage) ang sunscreen na yan, na dapat wala, dahil iyan ay isang cosmetic product. Yung mga claims na ganyan na may physiological effect e papasok na sa drug category, at hindi na sa cosmetics. Paano kaya nakalusot to sa FDA? \n\nFinal words:\nMula sa formulation, claims, at ingredient list, napansin ko na ang daming problema nitong product na ito (maging yung tinted version nito). Sana naman e ma-review ito ng brand owner para ma-address yung mga punto na nabanggit ko dito. \n\nSa FDA naman, wag naman sana basta-basta approve ng approve ng CPN ng mga cosmetic products ng hindi na-a-assess ng maayos. Kaya bumababa ang kumpiyansa ng mga tao sa locally produced cosmetics e.\n\nAyun lang, maraming salamat sa pagbabasa. ",

Due to a recent posting of misinformation being spread on here, excessive worrying over ingredients, and people PMing me for advice I figured I would just make a post about this to help other people with similar questions\n\nFor background, I am a chemist- in particular a biochemist. I used to work in a research area that focused on mineral/ion- skin absorption. I'll try to hit the ones that aren't in the side bar already and separate them out by category for easy viewing. Let me know if I missed any big ones!\n\n**Emulsifiers - keep oil/water based chemicals from separating in products**\n\nMost common products I see contain polysorbates, laureth-4, glyceryl monostearate (also pearlescent agent)\nlauramide DEA (also foam booster), or potassium cetyl sulfate. There's also stearic acid that also helps with cleansing. These aren't necessarily bad for you nor are they good for you. They're kinda meh ingredients that exist to make the product work \n\n**Preservatives- extend their shelf life and are anti microbial**\n \nparabens- these get a lot of flack but there isn't that much research confirming their 'toxicity'. The [original study] (http://www.dr-baumann.ca/science/Concentrations%20of%20Parabens%20in%20Human%20Breast.pdf) that brought them into the spotlight was over hyped by the media and dozens of other studies done afterwards have yet to find a definite link to cancer or other diseases. These are however very great preservatives\n\nBenzyl alcohol containing products has been known to dry some people out due to it's status as an alcohol. Aside from a preservative it's also used as a ph balancer\n\nformaldehyde- if you see this in a product, you may want to be wary. The World Health Organization has determined this to be a carcinogen; however whether trace amounts are as bad for you is still unknown\n\n tetrasodium EDTA/ disodium EDTA- normally these are used to draw metals out of the blood, but in terms of skincare, both work to stabilize the product by binding other chemicals. Only concern with this one is that it's an environmental hazard \n\nPhenoxyethanol -  an antimicrobial \n\nethylhexylglycerin - helps with eczema and also works for some people with rosacea \n\n**Moisturizers : Lipid thickeners - give product it's creamy consistency**\n\ncetyl alcohol, stearic acid and carnauba wax are the big ones- aren't bad, rarely cause things like breakouts for most people. These are also good at protecting the moisture barrier from water loss by forming a 'seal' \n\n**Moisturizers : Natural thickeners - come from nature, usually work as humectants (think hyaluronic acid)**\n\nhydroxyethyl cellulose, guar gum, xanthan gum and gelatin are the most popular\n\n**Moisturizers: Mineral thickeners - also natural, absorb both oils and retain water**\n\nmagnesium aluminium silicate, silica and bentonite are the big ones here. A lot of clay masks and some silicone based (neutrogena) sunscreens are apart of this category. Silicone based sunscreens are great for those who's skin can handle them since they keep oils/shine in check while also preventing your skin from overdrying\n\n**Moisturizers: synthetic thickeners - used in a lot of gel type products and some of the rich/smooth white creams**\n\ncarbomer, cetyl palmitate, and ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate are common ones\n\n**Emollients - soften the skin by preventing water loss, work as humectants,  definetly want these in your routine**\n\nbeeswax, olive oil, coconut oil and lanolin, petroleum jelly, mineral oil, glycerin, zinc oxide, butyl stearate and diglycol laurate , urea, glycerol, propylene glycol or lactic acid are big ones here.\n\nSome of these are termed 'comedogenic' like coconut oil but many many people don't break out from them so that's a pretty arbitrary rating imo\n\n**Edit- here’s a couple more I forgot to add that are sunscreen relevant**\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate-** protects against UVB and not UVA rays. It is not very stable either, when exposed to sunlight, it kind of breaks down and loses its effectiveness (not instantly, but over time - it loses 10% of its SPF protection ability within 35 mins)\n\n**Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane-**  famous Avobenzone. It is the only globally available chemical sunscreen agent that protects against UVA. It is the global gold standard of UVA protection and is the most used UVA sunscreen in the world. Suprisingly it’s in moisturizers too.The problem with it, though, is that it is not photostable and degrades in the sunlight. Wikipedia says that avobenzone loses 36% of its UV-absorption capacity after just one hour of sunlight",

Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

Second, I think that the phenoxyethanol lowers the surface tension of water as it dissolves (don't know for sure). And finally an area of saturated water forms very quickly once the phenoxyethanol has form the rafts, limiting the area where it can dissolve to just the edges,\n\n\nSo, as the phenoxyethanol dissolves at the edge of the rafts it is pulled away by the surface tension gradient next to the raft, this draws unsaturated water upward from below the raft. The supply of unsaturated water from below greatly exceeds the phenoxyethanol available to dissolve at the edge of the raft so it begins to form those fractal/dendritic curves maximizing the interface between the unsaturated water and the edge of the raft.\n\n\nNot a scientist, this is all speculation.",

    "body": "Why YSK: \nThere is a condition called Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) that leads to chronic dry eye disease. Eye doctors don’t usually do preventative eye exams for MGD as it used to be an “old person’s disease”. Doctors are now finding that even children are developing this condition. For everyone else: it is on the rise.\n\nMGD effects the production/quality of the oil that is supposed to be found on the ocular surface. If you don’t have enough quality oil, you *will* develop evaporative dry eye. This means that your tear film won’t be stable and without this protection you will have constant eye dryness and will also be at high risk for recurrent styes/chalazions.  \n\nThere are treatments for MGD, but since it’s a complex condition, they won’t work for everyone. The most common treatment is a hot rag or mask over the eyelids for atleast 15 minutes every morning and night. Eyelid scrubs are also recommended to prevent styes and infections.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this condition is *degenerative* and if left untreated will cause the oil glands to die off permanently. There is no way to regenerate them once they’re gone.\n\n*What causes MGD?*\n\nWe still don’t know every cause, but studies have found these possible links:\n\nMedications such as *antidepressants, beta blockers, acne medications, ADHD medications, allergy medications, birth control, etc.*\n\nSkincare and makeup ingredients such as: \nRetinol, phenoxyethanol, preservatives, wax, fragrance, parabens, alcohols, etc.\n\nFalse eyelashes and eyelash glues. \n\nDemodex mites (everyone has them, but they can cause an infestation).\n\nScreen time (you must blink 20 times per minute, most people only blink 7 times).\n\n*This is not intended to scare you or be an exhaustive list. Science changes all of the time and perhaps some of these causes or explanations can change tomorrow. Please be aware that it’s important to discuss this with your doctor. Please see an ophthalmologist once a year if possible and always research everything you use. Some of these products are lifesavers, so I don’t discourage their use completely. All I can suggest is looking into possible alternatives or starting preventative treatments.*\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5685175/\n\nhttps://eyewiki.org/Meibomian_Gland_Dysfunction_(MGD)\n\nhttps://aapos.org/glossary/meibomian-gland-dysfunction-and-treatment\n\nhttps://womeninoptometry.com/beauty/article/practicing-safe-makeup-tips-before-during-and-after-makeup-to-prevent-damage-on-ocular-surface-and-dry-eye-disease/",

Not contact lens safe.\n\nThose above will run you about $30 AUD.\n\nSystane Ultra is contact lens safe but I have to instil drops 2x as often for less relief. It’s $12 a bottle though so worth keeping on hand imo\n\nContacts can be a problem with those for dry eye. The best contacts for this are Daily Total 1s which are quite expensive. Acuvue Oasys is also quite wet. \n\nA hack is putting an eye drop in the cup of your contact lens when it’s on your finger, before you put it in your eye - keeps a layer of moisture in your eye for longer!",

It's like getting soap in your eye.  Every time you close you eye it stings but with dry eye it doesn't go away after 5 minutes like soap does.\n\nAt my worst I got an appointment with a chief surgeon at one of america's most prestigious teaching hospitals.  The pain was so bad I hallucinated in his waiting room, thinking someone called my name and following her around.\n\nHis treatment did nothing and I finally got help when another doctor stared into my eyes for 45 minutes and figured out one of my eyes did not blink 100% closed because of prior nerve damage from a car accident.

I thought I had pinkeye in the days after that.  Essentially my eyes were dry and the eyelid opening impacted the cornea.\n\nThe first doctor I went to had me wear a bandage contact lens for a few days and it seemed to get better.  But it didn't and I had issues for a while.  About a year ago I went to a doctor that specializes in dry eye issues.   There's a chance that I'm going to need to have my cornea scraped to clear away the damaged tissue (it grows back).  So far though, I've had pretty good results with Cequa prescription drops (crazy expensive, not covered by my insurance, but works better than Restasis), warm compresses in the morning and before bed (I bought a mask from Amazon), washing my eyes daily in the shower with baby shampoo, and Muro gel in the bad eye right before I go to sleep (non-prescription, I recently found that the gel works a lot better than the drops).\n\nI still have slightly blurry vision in that eye and I may end up doing the cornea scrape thing later this year.",

    "body": "Timeout muna sa review ng mga serum lotions dahil isang panibagong sunscreen na naman ang irereview ko ngayong araw. Ito ang Kagayaku Premium Tinted Sunscreen SPF 70 PA++++. Ang tagal kong hinintay nitong sunscreen na ito bago mai-deliver: inorder ko ng week ng April 21, dumating ng May 3. Uuriratin ko itong sunscreen na ito at titingnan kung worth it bang bilhin o waste of money lang. \n\nTLDR:\n\nHindi dapat tawaging premium ang sunscreen na ito. Tadtad ng errors ang ingredient list. Halatang di dumaan sa review bago i-mass print ang box at tube. Aside sa errors, magkaiba ang IL na nasa tube at nung nasa box. Plus, sobrang sakit sa mata basahin nung text na nasa back panel ng box, dahil sa white font na ginamit. And walang SPF test report. Sayang lang pera nyo sa product na ito. \n\nNabili ko itong sunscreen na ito sa halagang 295 pesos sa Tiktok. Out of the box, ang itsura ng tube nito ay reminiscent sa tube packaging ng SKIN1004 na sunscreen. From the tube, pump, pati na din sa cap nung pump. Pero walang silbi yung pump nito, hindi nadidispense yung laman kahit na makailang ulit na akong nagpump. So, no choice na ako kundi alisin ang pump cap at i-squeeze yung tube para lumabas yung laman. Apparently, masyadong viscous yung laman para lumabas sa pump. Halatang may mis-match sa characteristics nung content sa packaging na pinili. \n\nThe bulk product itself, sabi ko nga e viscous, pero nagbebreak ang emulsion upon skin contact. Yung binili ko e kulay brown, and ang appearance ng product is parang chocolate mousse. Yung amoy nito ay may chocolate gourmand notes, as well as konting floral notes. Lightweight ang product, madaling mag-spread sa balat, may light to medium coverage, walang whitecast, at kapag nag set na sa balat e wala akong nafi-feel. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list ng product na ito. Pinasakit ng IL ng product na ito ang mga mata ko. First, dahil ang hirap basahin ng text sa likod ng box dahil sa white font on top ng light beige background. Kinailangan ko pang i-edit yung contract settings nung pic para lang mabasa yung IL ng box. Second, dahil magkaiba ang IL na nasa box at nung nasa tube.\n\nIngredient list ng nasa tube:\n\nWater, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate (and) C20-22 Alcohols, PEG-100 Stearate (and) Glyceryl Stearate, Polysorbate 60, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diisopropyl Adipate (and) Diisopropyl Sebacate (and) Propylene, C15-19 Alkane, Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide (and) Alumina (and) Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate, CI 77491, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance\n\nEto naman ang IL na nasa box:\n\nWater, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, C20-2 Alkyl Phosphate (and) C20-22 Alcohols, PEG-100 Stearate (and) Glyceryl Stearate, Polusorbate 60, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diisopropyl Adipate (and) Diisopropyl Sebacate (and) Propylene, C15-19 Alkane, Dimethicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate (and) Zinc Oxide (and) Polyhydroxystearic Acid (and) Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Titanium Dioxide (and) Alumina (and) Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate, Copolymer (and) Isohexadecane (and) Polysorbate 60 Iron Oxides (C.I. 77491) (and) Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate (and) Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone (and) Hexyl Laurate (and) Perfluorohexylethyl Triethoxysilane, Titanium Dioxide (and) Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate (and) Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone (and) Hexyl Laurate (and) Perfluorohexylethyl Triethoxysilane, Phenoxyethanol (and) Chlorphenesin (and) Aqua (and) Glycerin, Water, Gosypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed Extract (and) Punica Granatum Seed Extract (and) Glycerin (and) Trehalose (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Fructoligosaccharides (and) Water (Aqua) (and) Phytic Acid, Parfum (Fragrance) \n\nWhoo! Inang yan, ang sakit basahin at ilista nung IL. Sa dami ng mali sa IL nito, hindi ko alam kung ano uunahin ko. Pero dahil nasimulan ko na, sasagarin ko na:\n\n1. Dahil karamihan ng mga ingredients na ginamit dito ay complex mixtures (mapapansin nyo yung mga ingredient na tadtad ng (and) sa pagitan), either tinamad yung gumawa ng IL or just plain incompetent. Ang siste kasi kapag gumamit ng mixtures as ingredients sa isang formulation, kailangang alamin ang % composition nung mixture, then imutiply yung % ng every component ng mixture sa % nung ingredient mixture na ginamit sa formulation. Either tinamad na alamin at i-compute yung exact % nung mga components nung ingredient mixtures or hindi ito alam kung pano gawin nung gumawa ng IL. \n\n2. Hindi ko din alam kung anong trip nung gumawa ng IL at bakit inilagay as 2nd ingredient ang Disodium EDTA (chelating agent) at 3rd ingredient ang Triethanolamine (pH adjuster / neutralizing agent). Ang typical usage rate ng Disodium EDTA is usually below 1% (0.05% - 0.1%), samantalang ang Triethanolamine ay may maximum allowed use na 2.5% according sa Annex III ng ASEAN Cosmetic Directive. \n\n3. Sa tube IL, walang Zinc Oxide. Pero pagdating sa box IL, meron na. So, ano ba talaga, meron o walang Zinc Oxide sa sunscreen na ito? \n\n4. Since tinted sunscreen ito, expected ang presence ng Titanium dioxide, Iron Oxide Red (C.I. 77491), Iron Oxide Yellow (C.I. 77492), at Iron Oxide Black (C.I. 77499). Pero bakit sa IL ng tube at box, wala ang Iron Oxide Yellow at Iron Oxide Black? Yung totoo? \n\n5. Sa IL ng tube, Phenoxyethanol lang ang preservative. Pero pagdating sa IL ng box, may Chlorphenesin na.\n\n6. Sa IL ng box: Polusorbate 60. Polysorbate 60 dapat yan. Pero weirdly, tama naman nung naulit sa Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate, Copolymer (and) Isohexadecane (and) Polysorbate 60 (pero wala dapat comma after Taurate:   Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer ang tama) \n\n7. Sa IL ng box: entry should be Fructooligosaccharides, hindi Fructoligosaccharides. \n\n8. Sa IL ng box: Diisopropyl Adipate (and) Diisopropyl Sebacate (and) Propylene.  Propylene ano? Wala kaming time hulaan kung ano yan. \n\nIto na ata ang pinakamaraming mali na nakita ko sa IL ng isang product na na-launch sa Market. Sa dami ng pera (daw) ng brand owner nito, di man lang naisip mag-hire ng regulatory consultant man lang para ma-check yung IL ng product nya. \n\nNgayon, punta naman tayo sa product claims. \n\n* SPF 70 PA++++ UVA/UVB Protection\n\n* Tone Adapt Technology\n\n* Lightweight\n\n* Anti Aging\n\n* Whitening\n\nSa SPF claims, wala pa akong makita na SPF test result nito from the brand owner, kaya di ko muna paniniwalaan itong claim nila na ito. \n\nSa claim na Tone Adapt Technology, kalokohan yan. Marketing term lang yang tone adapt technology na yan. \n\nIn terms of being lightweight, yes lightweight naman ito nung sinubukan ko. For anti aging, pwede naman, since sunscreens helps with aging, specifically sa photoaging. But since wala pa akong makita na SPF test report ng product na ito, di muna ako agree sa claim na ito. In terms naman ng whitening, wala akong makita sa IL na skin whitening actives sa product na ito. \n\nFinal words:\n\nDi ko alam kung saan kumuha ng tigas ng mukha yung brand owner na tawaging \"Premium\" itong sunscreen na ito. Ni hindi nga nagawa ang bare minimum na i-check ang mga nakasulat na text sa packaging bago magproceed sa mass printing. Sa dami ng pera (daw) ng brand owner, mano man lang na nag-hire ng consultant para i-check yan. Tapos wala pang SPF test report. Sana nagpa-conduct sila ng 3rd party in-vivo SPF test, meron naman nag ooffer nyan dito sa Pilipinas. Afford naman nung brand owner, mayaman naman (daw) sya e. E di sana solid yung claim nyang SPF 70 PA ++++.\n\nHindi ko alam kung seryoso ba talaga yung brand sa paglaunch nitong product na ito o nagpapapansin lang, kasi sa buong pagwowork ko sa cosmetics industry, ngayon lang ako naka-encounter ng ganitong klase ng product na hindi ko mawari kung pinag isipan ba o napagtripan lang. \n\nSorry, pero first time ko sasabihin to sa pagrereview ko: Wag kayo magpabudol sa product na to. Masasayang lang pera nyo, marami pang ibang sunscreen jan na mas maganda. \n\nAyun lang. Maraming salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products.

Sunscreen reviews on SCA have been incredibly helpful during this process, so I'd like to give back to the community by providing some content myself.\n\nThis is a comparison review of two American sunscreen options:\n\n* cult favorite [**Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++**](https://supergoop.com/products/unseen-sunscreen) | $34.00 for 1.7 oz | $20 per oz\n* budget-friendly potential dupe [**Kroger Sunscreen Invisible Gel SPF 40**](https://www.kroger.com/p/kroger-sunscreen-invisible-gel-spf40/0004126000791) | $10.99 for 3.0 oz | $3.66 per oz\n\nI'm also dipping my toe into European and Asian sunscreens right now to find my go-to's with better UVA protection, but I couldn't resist trying Supergoop to see what the hype is all about. I picked up the Kroger dupe as well to compare for \"fun\". I originally caught wind of it via [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/fapfh5/sun_care_kroger_sunscreen_invisible_gel_spf_40/).\n\n[**Supergoop vs. Kroger photo album.**](https://imgur.com/a/JuBFacB)\n\n1.

Glow Oil SPF 50](https://supergoop.com/products/sun-defying-sunscreen-oil-with-meadowfoam) (5.0 oz for $38.00 / $7.60 per oz). I am not planning on trying either of these myself, so if you have tried these, please share your thoughts for us!\n\n# 🌞 Review\n\n**PROCESS**\n\nI have been using both of these intermittently for the past couple of weeks. I also did a direct comparison one day where I applied Supergoop on one half of my face and Kroger on the other.\n\nI did not purchase a full size of the Supergoop, so feel free to take this as my \"initial impressions\", as the Supergoop sample size only provides about 8 applications using the 1/4 tsp rule. (If they're available, I prefer to try sample sizes of the products I'm considering before committing the counter space and the ca$h to full-size versions.)\n\n**Relevant about me and my skin:** Female, late 20s. Relatively pale. My skin is oily but loves hydration. No known ingredient sensitivities, skin is relatively clear except for occasional hormone-induced breakouts. Other skin concerns: mild redness, managing pore appearance and sebaceous filaments, fading hyperpigmentation and previous sun damage.\n\n**Since this is a sunscreen review, my current morning routine may be helpful, too:** Rinse face with water, pat dry. Timeless Vit C 20% + E + Ferulic. The Ordinary Caffeine 5% + EGCG under eyes. Hydrating serum if the mood strikes. Sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**APPLICATION**\n\n* **See photos:** [Packaging](https://i.imgur.com/mo8jhT5.jpg) | [Dispensed onto my arm](https://i.imgur.com/8clDq0R.jpg)\n* The Kroger formula does appear darker when coming out of the tube, but it is not actually tinted. Both sunscreens do not have any noticeable tint upon application for me.\n* They both have a similar gel texture, similar to...buttery Neosporin, in a non-gross way? The gel is not runny or goopy, but quite easy to spread as it glides easily over the skin. No issues with pilling, even upon reapplication. Easy to apply the recommended 2mg/cm^(2) \"dosage\" (\\~1/4 tsp).\n* Both make my hands feel weirdly greasy after applying for a bit, even after washing.\n* Neither have a distinct scent to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LOOK & FEEL**\n\n* **See photos:** [Immediately after application](https://i.imgur.com/safMkZr.jpg) | [10 minutes after application](https://i.imgur.com/ydlue5M.jpg)\n* Once applied, both the Supergoop and Kroger look essentially identical on my face. No whitecast whatsoever. Both have the signature \"velvety finish\" that Supergoop is known for, which is neither dewy/shiny nor mattifying.\n* Thanks to the silicones in these formulas, both provide a very slight smoothing effect. The Unseen has been described as [similar to the Smashbox Photo Finish Primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sephora/comments/ghcihy/supergoop_unseen_sunscreen_spf_40_reviews_and_the/). I rarely wear a full face, so I did not test how these wear under makeup.\n* They both feel very soft and almost weightless on the skin. Both are quite moisturizing, which I appreciate since I prefer to have sunscreen double as my AM moisturizer.\n* Despite feeling quite light on my face, I find that both sunscreens take an annoyingly long time to \"set\" after application. The Kroger sunscreen dries more slowly than the Supergoop and feels a bit heavier to the touch, which to me is the only notable difference between the two. (Weirdly, this isn't noticeable in terms of how the sunscreen feels on my face – I'm only aware of it when I happen to touch my face with my hands, if that makes sense.) The Supergoop seems to finally mostly set after about two hours; the Kroger takes about three. In the meantime, it seems like there is still some malleability to the sunscreen finish. I wonder how susceptible the coverage is to getting disrupted up if I happen to touch my face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PROTECTION & PERFORMANCE**\n\nPlease take the following with a grain of salt, as these are just my personal musings. I'm not a dermatologist or cosmetic chemist, I'm just a random person on the internet with skin.\n\n**UVA**\n\n* Since these are both American sunscreens, we already know that UVA protection is relatively lacking due to the abysmal selection of FDA-approved sunscreen filters. (For those not familiar with UVA protection ins-and-outs, [I enjoy this breakdown from LabMuffin](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-feature-why-you-should-protect-yourself-from-uva/).)\n* I emailed Supergoop and Kroger last week requesting current PPD ratings and both said they couldn't provide this info. Here's [Supergoop's response](https://i.imgur.com/KsL1tIA.png) and [Kroger's response](https://i.imgur.com/C33WWG4.png). \n* Supergoop [lists the Unseen as PA+++](https://thebrightside.supergoop.com/pa-sunscreen-rating-system/), so we can assume the PPD is somewhere [between 8-16](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-feature-why-you-should-protect-yourself-from-uva/#:~:text=PA%20is%20a%20similar%20concept,2number%20of%20plus%20signs.). They did actually provide PPD ratings at one point – [per this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/brih2q/i_emailed_supergoop_about_ppd_ratings_sun_care/) from May 2019 that lists Supergoop! Unseen as PPD 9.9 – but this was pre-formulation (that removed octinoxate at the end of 2019).\n* Without confirmation from Kroger, I am assuming the PA rating for the Invisible Gel is similar to the Unseen Sunscreen. Both contain [avobenzone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane), the only FDA-approved chemical filter that provides proper protection across the entire UVA range, but it is not photostable (degrades quickly with exposure to sunlight). The Kroger Invisible Gel does have a higher concentration of [octocrylene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/octocrylene), which is supposed to help stabilize avobenzone, but I am absolutely *not* qualified whatsoever to say if this actually results in improved UVA protection.\n* For some peeps, PA+++ is far too low of a level for UV protection. I feel like I'm personally in this category at this point in my Great Summer of Sunscreen Experimentation – especially on days that I'm going to be outside for long periods, I want a sunscreen that gives me better overall protection. \n\n**UVB**\n\n* Both sunscreens are SPF 40.\n* I did not notice any visible burning while wearing either sunscreen, but I also didn't use them on days when I was outside during peak sun exposure times.\n\n**Ingredient sensitivities**\n\n* Neither of these sunscreens caused breakouts or irritation, but my skin is not very sensitive in general. For those sensitive to chemical filters or silicones, these may not be ideal picks for you. Both are fragrance-free, however the Kroger does contain [citrus peel oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citrus-aurantium-dulcis-peel-oil), which could also be problematic for some.\n* Those with sensitive eyes may want to exercise caution when applying the Kroger Invisible Gel, as I did experience some minor irritation one day when I had liberally applied close to my eyes and got a bit sweaty. I haven't noticed this much with the Supergoop, but I'm not sure why – it could be because of the formulation differences, because I happened to not apply it as close to my eyes, or because I just simply didn't apply sweat as much on the days I wore the Supergoop.\n\n# 🌞 Conclusion\n\n**I'd recommend the Kroger Invisible Gel as a budget-friendly pick for Americans who currently love or want to try Supergoop! Unseen, but don't want to pay Supergoop prices.**\n\nIf you are willing to compromise just slightly on texture to pay literally *one fifth of the price per ounce*, give the Kroger a try so you can slather yourself in velvety sunscreen without emptying your wallet. For those with sensitivities to chemical filters or silicones, or who don't like the primer-esque texture, this is probably one to skip.\n\nYou're kind of prioritizing cosmetic elegance over higher UVA protection with both options, but this may be somewhat unavoidable for those who don't want to deal with sourcing foreign sunscreens or a [Zuckerberg-esque whitecast](https://www.reddit.com/r/awfuleverything/comments/hu8m7g/mark_zuckerberg_surfboards_in_hawaii_with_way_too/).\n\nIf you're in the US and willing to regularly spend $20 per ounce for a cosmetically elegant sunscreen like Supergoop, it may be worth your time to explore La Roche Posay or EltaMD sunscreens that offer equal elegance and better sun protection for your buck. Or even better, source Asian or European sunscreens to get better broad-spectrum protection.\n\nIf you don't live in the US, I would not recommend either of these sunscreens, as you probably have more easily accessible options at home that fit your criteria for UVA/UVB protection, cosmetic elegance, and/or budget.\n\n**Would I personally repurchase?**\n\nNot planning on it at the moment, given my focus on sunscreens that provide better UVA protection. If I were on a trip and forgot sunscreen or something, I would pick up the Kroger Invisible Gel again, since I know it is excellently priced, easy to apply, and has zero whitecast. Personally, the gel vehicle isn't my fave. I found it annoying that it takes basically eons to set on my face, and the slightly lighter consistency of the Supergoop does not justify the huge price jump for me.",

        "body": "I know this post is a little old, but I thought I'd add in my own experience with buying the Kroger Supergoop! dupes... a couple of weeks ago I went into a store and bought both the gel and the body oil. \n\nThe Kroger gel feels the same as the Supergoop! gel I've tried, although I would recommend shaking them both before dispensing them. The oil generally feels nice, like a moisturizing body oil does. I haven't tried the Supergoop! one, so I can't compare them. I'd also add that the oil does have a pretty strong smell. It's not a bad smell-- I actually liked it, but if you're sensitive to fragrance on the body, maybe skip that one. I also don't feel like I would use it on a sunny day while I'm outside. As an everyday sunscreen, I'm happy to use it. I also didn't notice any issues using it on my neck, which has a tendency to turn red if any sort of product touches it ever. \n\nAll fine and good so far, until I realized the next day that I made a rookie mistake and hadn't checked the expiration dates before buying. The oil expires 10/21, the gel 11/21. Took them back to the store just hoping to exchange them... all the bottles there were the same expiration dates. So I just got refunded.\n\n  \nToday I went to a different store and both the oil and gel were in stock. Unfortunately, all the oils still expire 10/21 and most of the gels expired 11/21. I managed to search through and found a gel with a date of 4/22, so I went with that one. I haven't repurchased the oil, but I would like to. \n\n  \nTL;DR: good sunscreens that feel great, but be sure to always check the expiration dates on the sunscreens!",

        "body": "Hello /r/chemistry, I have no idea what is going on here and a few days of searching hasn't turned up much. Quoted text below is from a post I made on chemistrygifs.\n\n> I suspect there are a few things going on here. First, the phenoxyethanol is not extremely soluble in water so it doesn't immediately dissolve into the water and forms thin rafts. Second, I think that the phenoxyethanol lowers the surface tension of water as it dissolves (don't know for sure). And finally an area of saturated water forms very quickly once the phenoxyethanol has form the rafts, limiting the area where it can dissolve to just the edges,\n\n> So, as the phenoxyethanol dissolves at the edge of the rafts it is pulled away by the surface tension gradient next to the raft, this draws unsaturated water upward from below the raft. The supply of unsaturated water from below greatly exceeds the phenoxyethanol available to dissolve at the edge of the raft so it begins to form those fractal/dendritic curves maximizing the interface between the unsaturated water and the edge of the raft.\n\n> Not a scientist, this is all speculation.\n\nSince then I have added mica powder to the water and observed that water below the droplets is drawn up quite quickly as they dissolve. Also the water/solution near the surface moves away from the droplet very quickly. I tried adding dye and mica powder to the phenoxyethanol but both of them interfered with the dissolving action.\n\nI read about measuring the thickness of droplets by using monochromatic light and observing Newton rings so I will attempt that next time I get set up. I will also try to measure if there is a temperature change with a thermal camera, I know some substances take energy to dissolve and others release it, I have no idea which is the case for phenoxyethanol.\n\nIf anyone has any insight as to what in the hell is going on here I would love to hear it. Thanks!\n\nYoutTube video here is higher resolution of a different run but is otherwise the same behavior: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npkv8gspVO0",

Has \"great skin moisturising properties\" according to [Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dipropylene-glycol). Safety rating of 1-2 (very safe) on [Cosdna](https://www.cosdna.com/eng/b05d771602.html). This is likely nothing to worry about unless you already know you have a sensitivity, as it is mostly there to keep the formula feeling elegant and seems to be mildly hydrating. \n\n//\n\nHYALURONIC ACID FERMENT FILTRATE \n\nNew kind of hyaluronic acid that Hada Labo claims will \"help fortify the skins moisture barrier to help skin looking plump and supple\". This is the most controversial addition as many people are sensitive to ferments and this product will unfortunately now be unsuitable for them, which is a real shame. However, if you are someone who enjoys ferments, this might sound rather exciting. I couldn't find much info when I searched \"fermented hyaluronic acid\", but Ratzilla's list seems to suggest that the HA has been fermented with Lactococcus bacteria, which is proposed to \"positively influence both the speed and quality of epidermal growth, resulting in better barrier function and overall skin quality\" ([Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactococcus-ferment-lysate)). I'm not convinced a difference in effect will be extremely noticeable alongside the 6 other kinds of HA but I expect it will work well for plumping and improving the health and appearance of the skin regardless. \n\n//\n\nHYDROLIZED SODIUM HYALURONATE \n\nThis is a super, super tiny (low molecular weight) version of hyaluronic acid, which is intended to penetrate even deeper into the skin and moisturise deeper than standard HA. If your skin wasn't bothered by the Hydrolized hyaluronic acid (another smaller molecule form) in the original formula (still in this one too!) then you might well not be bothered by this version too. Source: [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-sodium-hyaluronate)\n\n//\n\nPROPANEDIOL \n\nCommonly used solvent, humectant and emollient. In short, makes formulas more cosmetically elegant and also helps to pull moisture into the skin and keep it there. Considered very safe and a non-irritant. Further reading: [byrdie article](https://www.byrdie.com/propanediol-for-skin-4773491) [paula's choice ](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/uncategorized/propanediol.html)\n\n//\n\nCAPRYLHYDROXAMIC ACID \n\nAn anti-fungal amino acid derived from coconut oil that acts as a preservative. Limited data regarding safety, but Honest Beauty claims it is safer and less harsh than other commonly used preservatives (take this with a grain of salt as Honest Beauty has an agenda to push and so will be biased). Sources: [truth in ageing ](https://www.truthinaging.com/ingredients/caprylhydroxamic-acid)\n[honest beauty ](https://www.honest.com/blog/wellness/ingredients/what-is-caprylhydroxamic-acid/13775.html)\n\n//\n\nHYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE \n\nUsed as a thickener in cosmetics, gives a nice slippy, gel-like feeling. Water soluble, regarded as safe. \n\n//\n\nXANTHAN GUM \n\nExtremely commonly used thickener and stabiliser. Unlikely to be an issue unless you have a specific sensitivity to it. \n\n\n//\n\nAnd now, let's look at the changes in the top few ingredients: \n\n• The top ingredients, which I usually regard as the most important, have changed in that normal Glycerin has been removed and replaced with Diglycerin, and it's now the 7th ingredient as opposed to the 3rd. Diglycerin is not much different as both are powerful hydrators, but Diglycerin supposedly \"penetrates slower into the skin but gives longer lasting moisture and less sticky, better skin-feel.\" Source: [incidecoder ](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/diglycerin) This might be good for people who have tried the original Premium and found it to be too sticky on the skin! However, due to it being moved lower down, the impact might not be too obvious here. \n\n• Pentylene Glycol has been bumped way up the list from 16th to 4th! This is another thickening ingredient that is key to the sensory feeling of the product, and according to incidecoder its also a moisturiser and helps to hydrate and smooth the skin. However, [the derm review ](https://thedermreview.com/pentylene-glycol/) actually claims it doesn't have any specific skin benefits, but is at least safe and non-irritating. I personally would rather have kept a higher concentration of glycerin or diglycerin in the product as opposed to this as I think they're more intensely moisturising/hydrating to the skin. \n\n• On the other hand, urea has been moved from the 5th ingredient to the 3rd, where glycerin was previously. From [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea): \"A derivative of Urea, that works as a strong moisturizer and humectant meaning that it helps the skin to cling onto water and thus to make it hydrated and elastic.\n\nAccording to manufacturer's data,  Hydroxyethyl Urea has a similar moisturizing ability to glycerin (measured at 5%), but it feels nicer on the skin as it is non-sticky and non-tacky and gives a lubricous and moist feeling to the skin.\" \n\nSo, perhaps this formulation could actually remain equally as hydrating, if not more so, but less sticky due to the removal of glycerin? \n\n//\n\nTLDR: \n\nSo, apart from the ferment all the new additions are commonly used ingredients - nothing toxic, irritating or comodegenic! In theory (best case scenario) it should be even more hydrating due to the extra two forms of hyaluronic acid, and potentially less sticky due to the removal of glycerin and higher concentrations of urea and Diglycerin! Worst case scenario is that the concentrations of HA have been lowered and it won't have the same deeply plumping effect, only time will tell. \n\nThis is getting very long and my thumbs are tired so I'm going to end this post here even though I could potentially go on, hopefully this helps some people make an informed decision on whether they'd like to try the new formulation. I personally have already ordered a bottle as I'm not concerned by the addition of ferments and in general it doesn't look bad at all. Fingers crossed it's somehow even better than the original!!",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin’s outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin’s water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin’s barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates—aspirin’s technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics.

    "body": "Gusto ko lang i-share yung review ko tungkol sa product na ito dahil sobra ang hype nito sa Tiktok. Nakabili ako nito nung nag live selling nito yung dalawang sikat na content creators sa Tiktok: Skincarebyruzz at Wearsunscreen.\n\nTingnan muna natin ang ingredient list nitong sunscreen (pwede din tingnan sa pic na nasa itaas):\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Octyl, Methoxycinnamate, Dimethicone, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Polypodium Leucotomos Extract, Baicalin (Scutellaria Root  Extract), Vitamin E, Niacinamide, Phenoxyethanol,Titanium Dioxide, Carbomer 940 & Fragrance\n\nComment:\nUnang tingin pa lang, kita na agad na ang daming mali-mali sa ingredient list na inilagay sa box. Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate ang tamang entry dapat dun sa UV filter na ginamit, hindi Octyl, Methoxycinnamate (pati yung comma sablay ang pwesto). Making entry din ang Vitamin E sa ingredient list, either dapat Tocopherol o kaya Tocopheryl Acetate ang inilagay jan (kung alin man jan sa dalawa ang ginamit), dahil hindi considered na INCI name ang Vitamin E. Meron pang isa, yung Carbomer 940. Carbomer lang dapat ang nakalagay jan, dahil ang Carbomer 940 ay isang grade lamang ng Carbomer at hindi ito tamang INCI name. Isa pa, since tinted itong sunscreen na ito, bakit hindi nakalagay ang mga pigments na ginamit dito (Iron oxide Red / C.I. 77491; Iron oxide Yellow/C.I. 77492; Iron oxide Black/C.I. 77499)? Panghuli, hindi gumagamit ng \"&\" symbol sa ingredient list kapag nasa dulo. \n\nNgayon tingnan naman natin ang ilan sa mga product claims nito namedyom problematic (makikita sa Pic 1 at Pic 3):\n1. SPF 50 PA ++++ UVA/UVB Sun Protection (Pic 1) \n2. Broad spectrum (Pic 1) \n3. Fragrance Free (Pic 3) \n4. Provides broad spectrum SPF 50 coverage using zinc oxide... \n\nAnong mga problema sa mga claims na ito?\n\nUna sa lahat, paano papalo ng SPF 50 ang sunscreen na ito kung ang UV filters lang na ginamit ay Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate at Titanium Dioxide lang? Kahit pa sabihin nating nakasagad sa 10% ang Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate na ginamit, malabo pa din mangyari yan. \n\nIkalawa, papaano na-claim na broad spectrum ang sunscreen na ito at may UVA protection, kung malinaw naman sa ingredient list na walang nakalagay na UVA filter? Ni hindi nga ito naglagay ng Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone) para masabi man lang na may UVA filter ito.\n\nIkatlo, claim ng product na ito na may zinc oxide ito kaya naging broad spectrum. Paano mangyayari yan e wala naman sa ingredient list ang zinc oxide? \n\nIkaapat, nag-claim ang product na Fragrance free. E ang linaw-linaw sa ingredient list na may Fragrance. At nung ginamit ko yung product, meron ngang fragrance, pero hindi kalakasan, sakto lang para ma-mask yung amoy ng base. So basag na agad yung claim nito na Fragrance free. \n\nNgayon, tumungo naman tayo sa actual product use. Una kong napansin dito ay yung packaging. In fairness, cute naman ang bote, hugis araw. Ok sana tong bote kasi yung gitna nung bote e gawa sa squeezable material. Ang problema ko lang, nababakbak yung white na print, which is ok naman sana, kaso sumasama sya sa kamay kapag pinapahid na sa mukha yung sunscreen, kaya napagkamalan ko pang titanium dioxide na hindi na-disperse ng maayos. In fairness naman din sa product, hindi naman nag-pill sa balay ko nung ginamit ko na. \n\nFinal Verdict:\nKung hindi ko inurirat yung mga nakasulat sa box nitong product na ito, aakalain kong ok or matino ito. E ang kaso, ang daming mali at inconsistencies nitong product nito sa kanyang mga claim, kaya magdududa ka talaga kung maayos e. Di komo FDA notified ang isang product e maayos na. Kaya sa ating lahat na gumagamit ng skincare products, lagi tayong maging mapanuri sa mga binibili nating produkto. ",

        "body": "Based on my observation, the more a \"cheap\" product is shilled sa socmed and e-commerce platforms, the less I'm enticed bumili. Hindi naman sa pagiging matapobre no, pero looking sa price point ng products ni Hikari Skin Essentials (not just their sunscreen but their rejuv products too) you will really question yung quality ng binebenta nila. Sorry pero it's giving Rosmar and Viyline levels na ang target market is low-income people na naghahanap ng madaliang solution to skin problems at a low price point, regardless of the sussy quality.\n\nIf anyone needs affordable na locally-made beauty products, better stick na lang to mainstream brands na available sa Mercury and Watsons. Sure, malakas mambudol si Watsons as we all know pero surely every single brand they sell (including theirs) dumaan yan sa maayos na R&D at quality control.\n\nAnd if kelangan talaga ng  products na may pangmalakasang support like sunscreen, dun na mag-invest ng magandang brand if your budget can accommodate it.",

Una sa lahat, hindi ko alam ang kundisyon ng inyong balat, kung kayo ba ay dry, oily, combination, o sensitive skin. Di ko din alam kung ano ang skin tone nyo (kung fair, light, o morena/o). Hindi ko din alam kung may mga existing kayong condition sa balat (e.g. melasma, rosacea, atiouc dermatitis, atbp.). Pangalawa, hindi ko din alam kung anong preference nyo sa isang sunscreen. Kung ang gusto nyo ba e matte o dewy, or kung pang daily use lang ba o pang beach. Ikatlo, hindi ko din alam kung magkano ang budget nyo sa sunscreen. Dahil alam naman natin na mumurahin, mid-range, at premium na sunscreen. \n\nAng tanging masasabi ko lang is kung meron na kayong ginagamit na sunscreen ngayon na inyong na-research ng maigi at kumportable naman kayong gamitin araw-araw ng walang problema, at pasok sa budget nyo, e para sa akin, yan na yung akmang sunscreen para sa inyo.",

I was chatting over at the /r/beautyguruchatter Discord when NoSpelledWithAK said that she thought that the formula was changed and that no one said anything. This sounds rather surprising; after all, why would ABH change their formula for a brand new palette when everyone was likely to compare it to MR?\n\nWe wanted to go ahead and confirm that this was what happened... and, well, the news is not good.\n\nHere are the ingredients for the base formula of MR shadows, from [Sephora's

Probably the one everyone is going to latch onto is that Subculture shadows are based on talc, whereas MR shadows are based on mica, but it looks like the entire formula got changed between the two palettes. This likely explains why people are having problems with Subculture not blending in as well as MR, as well as some major kickback issues.\n\nInterestingly enough, the ingredients for MR aren't [listed on the ABH website](http://www.anastasiabeverlyhills.com/modern-renaissance-palette/ABH01-18170.html). I wonder why.",

So, from that standpoint, this switch is ethical. But, you know, the brand wasn't sitting there making this decision because of ethical mica concerns.  \n\nI guess what I'm saying is that ABH could have announced this and made it a good thing. If they partnered up with a children's rights org, and put out this palette as a first step toward using less mica. There was a way to have spun it.  \n\nBut even if they had spun it and we were sitting on this website gushing over how ABH supports human rights, the reality is that they did this to make their shadows cheaper. Lower quality. And that's a bummer. I definitely have been channeling my inner Kimberly Clark on this one. Don't need it, not gonna buy it.",

To me, it's not the talc that is the issue but the overall change in formulation (quite a few ingredients and their position on the list are different btwn subculture and modern renaissance)",

This has been sitting in my drafts for a couple of weeks because I feel insecure about publishing this when I’m sure many of you will understand all this much better than I can. I’m also not affiliated with Allie or Kanebo or Kao or even the beauty industry at large in any way. Any corrections will be very welcome and appreciated.\n\nMany of the links aren’t in English, so I’ll indicate the language unless I think it’s obvious: ^(J) = Japanese, ^(E) = English, ^(TC) = Traditional Chinese, ^(SC) = Simplified Chinese (I’m sorry if I get Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese mixed up).

Kanebo’s [brands](https://www.kanebo-cosmetics.co.jp/products/brand) include, well, Kanebo, as well as Allie, Kate, and Suisai.\n\nThe Allie brand also has a [Facial Gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-facial-gel-n-2020/)^(E) that’s specifically meant for the face, a [milk](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-perfect-n-2020/)^(E) that’s also for the face and body, and a few tone-up/color-correcting gels, all of which are rated SPF 50+ PA++++. (And a few water resistant makeup products that I admittedly tend to forget about.) They’re currently marketing their color-correcting sunscreens, [Allie Color Tuning UV](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-color-tuning-uv/),^(E) quite heavily as a foundation alternative that also provides UV protection. Aside from the Color Tuning line, which was released on February 16, 2021, all of the current sunscreens were released on February 16, 2020 (2020 formula). The previous version of the Allie gel, [Allie Extra UV Gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-spf50/)^(E) (without the “N”), was released on February 16, 2018 (2018 formula), and all the presently discontinued formulations released in 2018 and 2019 were also rated SPF 50+ PA++++.\n\nI’ve been using the Allie gel for nearly a decade now, starting with [the second formulation](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-mineral-moist-n/)^(E) released in 2012. [This 2013 article](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/japan-pa-system-for-uva-protection-revised/) from RatzillaCosme reminded me that I picked it up in the first place because it was one of the first sunscreens to be labelled PA++++. I do still try out other sunscreens from time to time, but I always have a tube of the Allie gel open concurrently with anything else I use. I’ve posted about the difference between the 2018 and 2020 formulas [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/gkgwm8/sunscreen_kanebo_allie_februaryapril_2020_new/), and reviews of each version [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/bz8r9t/japanese_sunscreens_allie_extra_uv_gel_highlight/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/jmkjlk/japanese_sunscreens_pt_2_allie_extra_uv_gel_n/), with an update to the 2020 review coming up.\n\n# On testing and reformulations\n\nAfter learning about the loophole in Korean law through [Odile Monod’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) (via u/bloominglace’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/)) and [Instagram Highlights](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTA0MjgzMTIwODUyNTQ4?story_media_id=2553999541407826596_1588058418) (via u/FrenchbunnyG’s [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/gvbbsmz) in the same post), I tried to find information about the laws surrounding SPF/PA testing for reformulated products in Japan (because I live in Japan and therefore use Japanese sunscreens) but kept getting a bunch of hits about testing methods in general, and gave up trying to sift through it all.\n\nThe only product I personally really care about is the Allie gel, so I wrote to Kanebo directly and asked whether they test their reformulated products individually, with the 2018 and 2020 formulas of the Allie gel as an example, or whether their test results are carried over across formulations. Their response as of April 26, 2021 is that they test each version separately (“SPF/PA値の測定に関しまして、それぞれ測定しております”).\n\nI don’t know whether the same goes for all companies in Japan or not, or even for all Kao/Kanebo brands, but that’s one less thing for Allie users to worry about.\n\n*—And after leaving this sitting in my drafts for a couple of weeks, I am adding that* u/ysy_heart *has posted* [*this*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) *about what the director of Japan Cosmetic Industry Association said about what their guidelines are on this subject.*\n\n# Hong Kong Consumer Council (October 2020)\n\nIn [the October 2020 report by the Hong Kong Consumer Council](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/jj0n81/sun_care_test_report_of_30_sunscreen_products/)^(E/TC) that everyone keeps referring to, the 2018 formula of the Allie gel (as seen in [the photo](https://imgur.com/seDmooL) published with the report) was rated SPF 61.7 PPD 9.8 (PA+++).\n\n*I’ll post a simplified version of [the results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(E/TC) in the comments, mostly for my own convenience.

However, the current standard for SPF testing in Japan is [ISO 24444:2019](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24444:ed-2:v1:en),^(E) effective as of February 21, 2020 according to [this notice](https://www.jcia.org/user/common/download/business/guideline/spf/SPF-jcia-r020221.pdf)^(J) (linked from [this page](https://www.jcia.org/user/business/guideline/spf)^(J)) issued by the [Japan Cosmetic Industry Association](https://www.jcia.org/en/)^(E) (JCIA)—or maybe it was also accepted before then? JCIA isn’t a government organization, by the way, so I don’t think they can actually enforce anything, but they seem to be in charge of setting industry-wide guidelines and work directly with the government in some capacity. Anyway, the same notice states that ISO 24444:2019 was issued in December 2019. The major changes between the 2010 and 2019 versions are listed in the Foreword of ISO 24444:2019:\n\n>— The definition of the minimal erythema response (MED) criteria has been revised.  \n>\n>— The choice of eligible test subjects is now based solely on individual typology angle (ITA°) with a requirement for the average ITA° for the test panel to be within the range 41° to 55°, with a minimum of three subjects within two of the three ITA° ranges.  \n>\n>— The ITA° is used to define the range of unprotected MED doses for the provisional or the test day unprotected MED determination (if no provisional MEDu determination is made).  \n>\n>— Three new reference standard sunscreens have been validated and added to the method to validate SPF test panels for products with SPF equal to 25 or higher (P5, P6 and P8).  \n>\n>— New test methods are provided to determine the uniformity of the beam of both large and small beam size solar simulators. A requirement for uniformity greater than or equal to 90 % has been added.  \n>\n>— Sunscreen application procedures have been described in greater detail.  \n>\n>— An informative Annex F has been added with photographic examples of erythema responses with guidelines for grading.  \n>\n>— The reporting tables in Annex G) and the requirements in Clause 11 have modified to provide more complete information on the results of the testing.  \n>\n>— The bibliography has been updated.\n\nThe notice from JCIA also lists most of these changes, with a few additional details. They point out for example that the Fitzpatrick skin type is being phased out as criteria for test subjects in favor of individual typology angle (ITA°), which will be relevant later in this post.\n\n*If you have no idea what an “individual typology angle” is (like me), it’s strictly based on skin color and seems much less open to interpretation than the Fitzpatrick skin type criteria. I found* [*this 2013 review article*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjd.12529)*^(PDF)* *in the* British Journal of Dermatology *really informative, though I admittedly have only skimmed through it very quickly.*\n\nIt’s possible that Eurofins just hasn’t updated their website, but I think this is what Michelle Ma Chan Mok-lan (Fancl) is talking about in the quote above about the HKCC report using testing methods from 2010. [Fancl Sunguard 50+ Protect UV](https://www.fancl-hk.com/product_details.asp?item_id=5685),^(TC) their product in the report (rated SPF 50+ PA++++ and tested at SPF 14.3 PPD 6.8 or PA++), was apparently released in [2018](https://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/10153767/top)^(J) in Japan, but according to the *South China Morning Post* article, “\\[Ma Chan\\] said that its product went through two rounds of testing by Cantor Research Laboratories in the United States in 2019 and the Chongqing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in China in 2017.” (Fancl also seems to point out that their product needs to be shaken before use in [this article](https://beauty.ulifestyle.com.hk/beauty/skincare/20099/fancl防曬-對消委會測試報告表示失望-強調產品完全符合標示-消委會就事件最新回應),^(TC) which could indeed potentially be something that affected the test results. I feel like it’s common knowledge among anyone that’s familiar with milk sunscreens at all, though, and I would hope that any lab conducting these tests would be aware of this. They also seem to say in the same article that any sunscreens that had extremely different test results should be re-tested in more than one lab, which is fair. But keep in mind that I’m reading a machine-translated version of the article for these observations.)\n\nI’m going to ignore the test run in China in 2017 because I believe it would have been following the so-called outdated testing methods, or ISO 24444:2010 (see the section titled “The Chinese version” below). [Cantor Research Laboratories](http://www.cantorlabs.com) basically just has their contact information on the website, so I can’t tell whether they would have conducted their test according to ISO 24444:2019, which would have been possible if the test took place in December. Cantor Research Laboratories was composed of 15 employees and specialized in anti-aging claims [as of 2016](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cen-09419-cover). *(They apparently do testing for Amway, a major MLM company, by the way; try googling* `\"Cantor Research Laboratories\" Amway study`*. —No, I don’t know whether that actally means anything, it’s just something I noticed.)* Eurofins Scientific on the other hand is composed of approximately 50,000 employees in 800 laboratories in 50 countries ([source](https://www.eurofins.com)), though I don’t have numbers for the Australian location specifically. I don’t know whether larger labs would necessarily produce more accurate results, but I would assume they generally wouldn’t be likely to be *less* accurate (or am I completely mistaken?). Interestingly, Dermatest, an Australian lab that was acquired by Eurofins ([source](https://dermatest.com.au)), lists Cantor Research Laboratories among their “Scientific Associates” on [their Links page](https://dermatest.com.au/information/links/). They also cite Cantor Research Laboratories’ Operating Procedure Manual on what appears to be another one of their factsheets, “No. 28 Antiperspirant Efficacy,” published on p. 12 of the February 2017 issue of *The Science of Beauty* (vol. 6 no. 7; [PDF](https://ascc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SOB-Feb2017.pdf)). On Eurofins’ Australian website, they instruct that samples should be sent to “Eurofins Dermatest,” located at the same address on the Dermatest website ([example](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/)), so I’m pretty sure we can think of them as the same entity. Clearly they know of Cantor Research Laboratories, and I wonder what they would say about the discrepancy.\n\nReturning to the *South China Morning Post* article, I assume that “the sampling of Australians for a product designed for Asians” is in reference to SPF testing, not PA testing, since the latter was *in vitro*. According to Eurofins’ [SPF Testing factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601368/spf-testing.pdf),^(PDF) their test subjects “consisted of fair skin individuals with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II or III” (p. 3). As mentioned above, ISO 24444:2019 no longer uses Fitzpatrick skin types as criteria for test subjects, so I think we can establish that the SPF results in the report cannot be compared directly with any SPF ratings based on ISO 24444:2019. There are however multiple sunscreens that were released before 2020 and would have been based on ISO 24444:2010.\n\nSo referring back to ISO 24444:2010, according to [this PDF from some time before 2013](https://www.tes-h.co.jp/documents/SPFPFA.pdf)^(J)—but I’m not sure whether it’s after 2010—Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III were part of the criteria for SPF test subjects (and types II, III, and IV for UVAPF). This would definitely be before 2010, but [this paper](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sccj1979/26/3/26_3_207/_article/-char/ja/)^(E/J) published by JCIA in 1992 also specifies Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III for SPF testing. As discussed below, the same goes for China as of 2015. So it seems like the Eurofins test subjects and test subjects in Japan and China (before ISO 24444:2019) would have the same Fitzpatrick Skin types, but Dr. Dray suggests in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGwjKOHq02w) (“Can we trust sunscreen? Korean SPF controversies,” April 30, 2021) that test subjects in different regions are likely to be skewed toward different skin tones. This is just speculation, but maybe it’s possible that more of the test subjects in Japan and China could have been types II and III, for instance, and more of the test subjects for the HKCC report could have been types I and II. (I’m guessing that this is what Professor Cheung means when he says that “the Eurofins report unfairly ran the tests on an Australian audience \\[…\\] given the products tested by the Consumer Council were formulated for Asian skin.”) In that case, while we absolutely couldn’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report, perhaps the report’s SPF ratings could possibly be pertinent if you have type I skin. But again, this is entirely speculative.\n\n**PA testing:** The Australian Eurofins website seems to confirm that their UVA tests are performed *in vitro*. I’m assuming they follow the [ISO 24443:2012](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24443:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vitro*), since they have [a factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601373/iso-24443-in-vitro-uvapf.pdf)^(PDF) for that too, linked from [this page](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/uva-tests/) on UVAPF testing. (ISO 24443:2012 is also mentioned at the bottom of [the report’s results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(TC) in footnotes 4 and 5, but I gave up on trying to figure out what it actually says.) In Japan, however, UVAPF testing is performed according to the [ISO 24442:2011](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24442:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vivo*). Eurofins themselves state in this factsheet that both the Japanese and Korean markets require *in vivo* testing, which they also point out is much more expensive than *in vitro* testing (p. 1). They also state that UVAPF ratings determined by these tests are considered **estimates** of Boots Star, FDA Broad Spectrum,\\* and JCIA UVAPF (= what most of us know as PA) ratings (p. 2).\n\n*\\* The FDA website says in vitro testing is accepted in accordance with* [*21 CFR 201.327(j)*](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b97fda59bb83d2742a276a215cdc115e&mc=true&node=se21.4.201_1327&rgn=div8)*, which I didn’t have the energy to actually read and am assuming is the same thing as Eurofins’ factsheet on* [*FDA Broad Spectrum Testing*](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601376/fda-broad-spectrum.pdf).*^(PDF)* *They say it’s based on ISO 24443:2012 but with “differing film thickness and pre-irradiation requirements” (p. 1).*\n\nIf the UVAPF testing for the HKCC report was indeed in accordance with ISO 24443:2012, I wouldn’t discredit the results entirely—but again, I’m not an expert. While we can’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report (same as the SPF ratings), it seems to me that the PPD ratings they give in the report could potentially be used to make comparisons with sunscreens from other countries where UVAPF ratings are also determined in accordance with the *in vitro* ISO 24443:2012 protocol, or at least with other results within the same report (though we would still have to keep in mind that “results reported from a single test should not be deemed conclusive”). Eurofins’ own factsheet suggests that ISO 24443:2012 is accepted in Australia, New Zealand, and the EU, but I haven’t done any research to back this up, and we have already seen that their factsheets might be outdated.\n\nThe next versions of [ISO 24442](https://www.iso.org/standard/75496.html)^(E) and [ISO 24443](https://www.iso.org/standard/75059.html)^(E) are about 40% through their respective development processes, by the way, so that’s something to keep an eye on if you’re looking into this stuff.\n\n**EDIT:** u/lovethewayyoulick has posted [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gycvnq4/) about the formulation of Allie sunscreens, specifically regarding Kao/Kanebo’s proprietary “[ADVAN Technology](https://www.kao.com/jp/skincare/surface/surface-02/),\" the name ADVAN coming from “Anti-Damaging uV-A Network.” In a nutshell, their sunscreens are designed to work with sebum to provide higher UVA protection, which would not be reproducible with standard *in vitro* testing. It also seems to explain why Allie sunscreens don't always do too well in casual experiments using light-sensitive materials (as I discuss in the section I had to delete for length posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyc9sqv/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). I’m now also thinking of other Japanese sunscreens that claim to work with different factors to increase their protection. Shiseido’s [Anessa](http://anessa.shiseido.co.jp/about/) sunscreens, for instance, advertise their “Thermo-Booster Technology” to work with heat and “Aqua-Booster Technology” to work with sweat and water. These product-specific factors may not necessarily be taken into account in third party testing.\n\n**Other possible issues:** Even after looking into all this (without actually reading all the publicly available details in each ISO… sorry, that’s beyond my mental capacity right now), I still don’t know whether the difference between the testing methods would really explain the larger disparities in the SPF results, like the Fancl sunscreen. I’ve seen some of you make a very good point that how old the bottle used for the test is (and I would assume things like storage conditions; last summer was a particularly hot one, and some supplements I ordered from the US arrived practically melted together in the bottle) or even the specific batch could potentially affect test results, too.\n\nFor more information about the actual testing methods, see [\\[Discussion\\]How SPF and PA are measured in Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mqysux/discussionhow_spf_and_pa_are_measured_in_japan/) by u/ysy_heart. (I want to note that the SPF testing methods described here are based on ISO 24444:2010 and have technically been phased out, but it seems general enough to be at least mostly applicable for ISO 24444:2019, too.)\n\n*—Phew, that was long! I keep seeing this report being mentioned, so I wanted to try my best to do my due diligence. I don’t have a background in science, though, and it’s my first time even actually looking at ISOs, so I’m sorry if I’m completely off.*\n\n# National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan (May 2020)\n\nIn another [report by the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/)^(E) published in May 2020, either the 2018 formula or the 2020 formula of the Allie gel (unclear) was confirmed to be SPF 50+ PA++++ in two out of two tests using a spectrophotometer, though I’m honestly skeptical of the general accuracy of these tests, seeing how four sunscreens claiming to be SPF 30–35 tested consistently at SPF 50+. I guess Japanese companies *could* plausibly be motivated to label their products with lower ratings than what they actually are, since many consumers here believe that high-SPF products are rough on your skin and can actively seek lower-SPF products for daily use, but as an amateur, it seems like it would be easier to actually make a low-SPF product if that’s what you want to sell.\n\nAgain, these tests were performed with an *entirely* different method, and I imagine their results can only be used to draw comparisons with other results in this same report, if anything at all. (For more information on the testing method, see u/ysy_heart’s research and thoughts in the link for the report.)  If there’s so much hubbub about the testing methods in the HKCC report, I’m sure testing with a spectrophotometer would be even further off. I want to give the NCACJ credit for at least running each test twice instead of just doing it once and being done with it, but I also don’t know whether running the spectrophotometer tests even a hundred times would necessarily be credible.\n\nAlso, although the HKCC report seems to have product name errors too (I’ll cut them some slack because they’re dealing with products from other countries, and the photo helps with product identification), I can definitively say that the report the NCACJ published has [some mistakes and ambiguities](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/gvsj5eh).^(E) This doesn’t necessarily mean that the tests themselves are equally faulty, but it does make me wary of any other potential mistakes in printing the test results.\n\n# The Chinese version\n\nThe Allie gel is also rated SPF 50+ PA++++ [in China](https://allie.cn)^(SC) (and SPF 45 PA++++ after being immersed in water according to [their official TMall page](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a212k0.12153887.0.0.1a67687dAgrr3k&id=596686898582),^(SC) if I’m interpreting “浴后防晒指数” correctly), where they require testing at National Medical Product Administration (NMPA) accredited labs in China, as well as additional *in vivo* testing ([source](https://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Article/2019/08/19/Sunscreen-regulations-in-the-world-from-European-Union-USA-Canada-to-China)^(E)). The NMPA-approved testing methods seem to be detailed in [this 11 MB PDF](https://www.nmpa.gov.cn/directory/web/nmpa/images/MjAxNcTqtdoyNji6xbmruOa4vbz+LnBkZg==.pdf)^(SC) of their Safety and Technical Standards for Cosmetics (2015), SPF testing from p. 546 and PA or PFA testing from p. 554. I’ve given up on trying to decipher everything, but it appears that their SPF testing either follows or is based on ISO 24444:2010 (so it might have been updated by now), using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III, and their PA testing either follows or is based on ISO 24442:2011, using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types III and IV.\n\nInitially I was satisfied in thinking of this as another separate test performed on the Allie gel, but then it occurred to me that I don’t know whether the Chinese version has the same formulation as the Japanese version or not, though I assume they would at least be very similar. [Based on the packaging](https://imgur.com/a/WbH2gAS),^(E) I’m guessing that the current version there is basically equivalent to Allie Extra UV Gel (the 2018 formula in Japan). [This page](https://www.jeebei.com/pingce/hufupin/ql1z6.html) lists the ingredients as follows:\n\n> 水，乙醇，氧化锌，三乙氧基辛基硅烷，甲氧基肉桂酸乙基己酯，丁羟甲苯，甘油三（乙基己酸）酯，异壬酸异壬酯，丙烯酸钠/丙烯酰二甲基牛磺酸钠共聚物，异十六烷，聚山梨醇酯-80，丁二醇，甘油，双-乙基己氧苯酚甲氧苯基三嗪，乙基己基三嗪酮，聚二甲基硅氧烷，黄原胶，EDTA 二钠，水解胶原，苯氧乙醇，透明质酸钠\n\nThis translates to:\n\n> Water, Ethanol, Zinc Oxide, Trimethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, BHT, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\nThis is the ingredient list for the Japanese 2018 formula, according to the packaging of a tube I bought in a major drugstore in Japan:\n\n> Water, Zinc Oxide, Ethanol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen\n\n*Both are my own translations and I don’t have a background in chemistry. Also, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate = Octinoxate, Ethylhexyl Triazone = Uvinul T 150, and Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine = Tinosorb S.*\n\nObviously, the order of the ingredients differ, but I don’t know whether China has the same rules about the order of the ingredients or not. One definitively different point, though, is that the Chinese version contains Phenoxyethanol and the Japanese version doesn’t. So while I can’t say how different or similar the two versions might be, it’s clear that they aren’t exactly the same.\n\nIt’s been pointed out that the [Bioré UV Athlizm essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-athlizm-skin-protect-essence/)^(E) and the [Bioré UV Aqua Rich gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-gel-2019/)^(E) and [essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-essence-2019/)^(E) are all rated SPF 50+ PA+++ [in China](https://www.kao.com/cn/products/biore/),^(SC) and not SPF 50+ PA++++ as they are rated in Japan, but since they are sold ~~(and possibly manufactured)~~ locally by Kao (China) Holding Co., Ltd. rather than as import products from Japan, you would have to consider the possibility that they may not necessarily have the same formulation as the Japanese equivalents.\n\n**EDIT:** I’ve just figured out that the Chinese versions of the Allie gel and Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence are made in Japan with different formulations specifically for the Chinese market. See links re: each product [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyhq3fu).\n\nSimilarly, RatzillaCosme says in a comment on [this page](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-gel-spf50-4-plus/) that “Rohto products that are marketed for outside of Japan have different ingredients/formulas than Japan’s and they’re not Japan-made (despite the Japanese printed). If the Japanese version is what you want, both the packaging and product name need to be exactly the same as what \\[is\\] shown in my site.” They also say in a comment [here](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-essence-2020/) in response to an inquiry about [Sunplay Skin Aqua](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/index.shtml) Watery Essence SPF 50+ PA++++ (I’m not sure but possibly [this](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-75.shtml)^(SC)), “That product isn’t Japanese — it’s made in China by a different company. It isn’t produced by Rohto Pharmaceutical in Japan.” (Credit goes to someone on this sub for mentioning that Ratzilla talks about this in their comments section. I’m sorry I can’t remember who it was.) Going back to the HKCC report, the results table says that [Sunplay Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-72.shtml)^(SC) is manufactured in China (in addition to the “Sunplay” in the product name already being a giveaway; in Japan, [Mentholatum Sunplay](https://jp.rohto.com/uv-sunplay/) is a separate Rohto brand alongside Skin Aqua, so “Sunplay Skin Aqua” doesn’t exist), so the results in the report would not necessarily be applicable for the Japanese product, not to mention the other concerns I discussed.\n\nSo the situation arises where there are products that aren’t “fake” but also aren’t exactly the same thing as what’s sold in Japan, kind of like how the American versions of LRP sunscreens wouldn't contain their more advanced filters (which is probably more drastic of a difference than what I’m discussing here). This might be especially important for anyone buying the product from non-Japanese vendors. Double check to make sure you’re getting the version you intended to buy—and if you specifically wanted the non-Japanese version, that’s great too. Like [the American and Japanese Curél Intensive Moisture Creams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/labr3m/difference_between_japanese_and_american_version/), it’s possible that the end result (the user experience) is pretty much the same anyway, but in the case of sunscreen, make sure you know what the SPF/PA rating is for the exact version you’re buying.\n\n# Using sunscreens from major corporations\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNsoPyo1PjA)^(J) posted on March 26, 2020, skinfluencer Arata Tomori says that SPF testing is usually outsourced to a third party lab, and that PA testing is often performed in-house (I haven’t looked into this). She says that different labs can come up with different results, and based on her own past experience with trying to make a sunscreen (I think she has her own skincare line), she has heard of labs that are actually known to give higher SPF ratings. She recommends that we stick with major corporations that are more likely to be working with labs that would provide accurate results.\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTS0Xd-T97s)^(J) posted on March 28, 2020, cosmetic chemist YouTuber Sumisho discusses issues with SPF ratings in general, with the AMA Laboratories case in the US as an example. He says we should be careful with smaller brands, and advises that it’s a good idea to pick products that are made by major corporations that put a lot into sunscreen R&D. He also advises that products sold in China go through additional testing and could be more reliable, and that you could check Tmall for listings, but I want to add again that you would need to make sure you’re looking at the version you want.\n\nOdile Monod also breaks down the difference between OBM, OEM, and ODM products in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) I mentioned earlier. Although she’s talking about the Korean beauty industry, I think this part probably applies for other countries, too, and she advises that it’s (not necessarily foolproof but) a good idea to pick OBM products that are formulated and manufactured in-house.\n\nAnd now [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) about the response u/ysy_heart got from the JCIA director can be interpreted to back up this approach as well. I’m generally in favor of indie brands in spirit, and usually I would think more about how these people might be benefiting from making these claims, but I do see how major corporations would have a lot more to lose from these sunscreen scandals. I also don’t think I’ve seen companies like Amorepacific (for instance) mentioned in connection with the recent scandal in Korea.\n\nI’m still looking up different sunscreens and who actually manufactures them, but the Kao Group (including Kanebo), the Kosé Group, the Pola Orbis Group, the Rohto Group, and the Shiseido Group are some major Japanese corporations that seem to generally have OBM products. I have a huge spreadsheet in progress that I plan on sharing whenever I think it’s ready, with specific products from these companies (and others) and some properties I wanted to compare.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nIf you’re *really* concerned about the accuracy of SPF/PA ratings, I guess the truly thorough approach would be to look at as many tests as possible. You could either stick with the sunscreens that consistently do well in third party testing (guilty until proven innocent) or avoid those that consistently do poorly (innocent until proven guilty).\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it just isn’t realistic, especially considering how frequently Japanese sunscreens are reformulated. A test result from last year might not be applicable for a product that was reformulated this year. You would have to make sure where the product tested was manufactured and what year it was released, and then there are the potential issues with storage conditions and different batches, etc. Also, “real” testing is expensive, and it’s not all that likely that there would be multiple credible third party tests following official protocols performed on the same formulation.\n\nAs Professor Tong says in the *South China Morning Post* article, we should probably accept that no single test is going to be an absolutely definitive one. Personally, with regard to what I’m already using, if it’s keeping my sun allergy symptoms from showing up, that’s good enough for me—but I guess you could say that I have the advantage (?) of my face being a hypersensitive UV meter of sorts. As for any products I might try in the future, I’m going to keep trusting the ratings as they are claimed unless there’s a scandal specifically involving that product. We *are* already taking a kind of leap of faith in trusting that the product is otherwise safe to use and that the ingredient list is correct and so on. And regardless of any tests results, even good ones, I would make sure to apply plenty, to reapply, and to avoid relying on sunscreen alone, especially if I’m going to be outside for an extended amount of time.",

I’ve been living in Japan for over 10 years, and am under the impression that the general consensus among Japanese consumers is that you use either Anessa or Allie if you don’t want to tan/burn, Anessa being top-level protection and Allie coming in second while also being easier on your skin. (This seems to specifically be based on Anessa’s [flagship milk](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/anessa-perfect-uv-sunscreen-skincare-milk-a-2020/)^(E) and Allie’s gel products, even though Anessa also has gels and Allie also has a milk.)\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean they’re absolutely the best sunscreens in the entire Japanese market, of course—the products discussed on this sub represent just a small fraction of all the sunscreens available in Japan—nor do I know how they would really compare with European sunscreens (which I’ve never used, aside from a couple of Asia/Australia-specific LRP products), but it does suggest that they must at least be among the best that are commonly available in drugstores nationwide.\n\nAllie sunscreens seem to do well in those completely unscientific experiment memes where people apply a ton of different sunscreens on their backs and lay out in the sun:\n\n|**Video/Article**|**Sunscreens and UV source**|**Conclusion**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sunameri for Kakaku.com, [人気の日焼け止め10種を徹底比較！ 日サロで肌を焼いて効果を確かめてみた](https://kakakumag.com/houseware/?id=11834), January 14, 2019|10 sunscreens including Allie Extra UV Gel (2018 formula);

Will be sold from 9th February 2019 in-store with limited availability on Japanese online stores at an earlier date priced at [1944 JPY RRP](https://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?__mk_ja_JP=カタカナ&url=search-alias%3Dbeauty&field-keywords=ビオレ+UV+アスリズム+スキンプロテクト). ~~internal cries and gasp~~ but to be fair it has more grammes. \n\n**Ingredients**:\n\n~~Again, hasn't been released but mentioned:~~\n\n* ~~Hyaluronic Acid, Royal Jelly extract, and Butelyne Glycol (moisturising ingredients).~~\n* ~~White floral scent (made from natural fragrances), Citrus, Musky Wood.~~\n\nEssence: \n\nWater, ethanol, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, ethylhexyl triazone, isopropyl palmitate, (lauryl methacrylate / sodium methacrylate) cross-polymer, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (Uvinul A Plus), hydrogenated polyisobutene, sodium acrylates copolymer, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), dextrin palmitate, BG, (acrylates / C10-30 alkyl acrylate) crosspolymer, alkyl benzoate (C12-15), glycerin, propanediol, potassium hydroxide, glyceryl behenate, hydroxyethylcellulose, (vinyl dimethicone / methicone silsesquioxane) crosspolymer,  pullulan,  cetyl alcohol , sorbitan distearate, stearoyl glutamic acid, arginine, EDTA-2Na,BHT, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronic acid, phenoxyethanol, fragrance.\n\nMilk: \n\nCyclopentasiloxane, zinc oxide, ethanol, water, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, (lauryl methacrylate / sodium methacrylate) cross-polymer, dimethicone, hydrogenated polyisobutene, isopropyl palmitate, talc, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (Uvinul A Plus), titanium oxide, alkyl (C30-45) dimethylsilyl polypropylsilsesquioxane, polymethylsilsesquioxane, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), Butelyne Glycol, PEG-12 dimethicone, triethoxycaprilsilane, PEG-3 dimethicone, Aluminium hydroxide, stearic acid, methicone, BHT, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronate, phenoxyethanol, fragrance.\n\n**So, what are their claims?**\n\n* **Unique durable \"Tough Boost\" technology:**\n   * Supposedly stays on skin even during hot and humid conditions of 40°C and 75% humidity even when skin perspires or sweats.\n   * Super waterproof which lasts 80 minutes through water resistance tests but easily cleansed.\n   * Usable as a makeup base (so...white cast? primer?)\n* **Two versions**:\n   * Water-based essence (70 g): fresh and moist feeling that leaves the skin with a smooth sensation.\n   * Oil-based milk (65 ml): silky touch that glides on the skin with a light-weight sensation, no stickiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ii2mnvhve8621.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3215d1e3ed7e8e9b5eabc5a3b78bcdbe9f3553f6\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that Biore UV SaraSara Line (so, Perfect Milk, Bright Milk, Face Milk and Spray) is repackaged but no reformulation. Only the cardboard packagings seem to change to my eyes.\n\n[Here if you want to see the complete list of Biore UV lines (in Japanese).](https://www.kao.co.jp/bioreuv/itemcheck/) On the table there are star ratings. The first one is its suitability for children and the second is how well it interacts with makeup (whether makeup slip or not).",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

Neither sunscreen has much flashback.](https://preview.redd.it/6qtwlqauu5k21.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=239868fe76c2e83dd6fd28fdf6a1d9a2b370341c)\n\nIn terms of protection: I've worn the new formulation for normal office days (no reapplications) and skiing in moderate snowfall (also no reapplications). In both cases I was sufficiently protected; no burns or tans, no deepening of PIH (and I tan/get PIH very easily -- most US and Asian formulations aren't protective enough for me). For me this works just as well as the old formulation, if not better.\n\n\\--\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised by this reformulation. Not only is it more cosmetically elegant in terms of both shine and white cast, but it has a slightly higher PPD and doesn't contain octocrylene, which was one of the ingredients I didn't quite like in the old formula. \n\nI will continue to purchase this sunscreen and look forward to seeing how it holds up in higher (summer) UV indices.",

I'm sure you can get the ultra light cheaper in other places, so this is just a general price comparison.",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), *Australian* websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it, but it can come out a bit forcefully sometimes.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** **Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\nI hope these reviews were useful :)",

A lot of skincare is based on “it *should * work” theoretically, but unless it’s tested with real outside factors (not done only in a lab) like does it penetrate the skin, does it work on skin pH, does it work with other products, and many other factors, I wouldn’t trust claims like increasing collagen production. I would only trust claims I can see after using a product. \n\n\nAs far as I know, topical creams cannot generate collagen production. Collagen is created from the foods you eat. I’m not even sure you can take collagen supplements to increase collagen production because everything in your body is broken down in the same way and your body will direct the amino acids to where the body needs it most and not where you might want it.",

    "body": "# Background\n\nSkinceuticals CE Ferulic is considered the best vitamin c serum that money can buy in the skincare market today. In fact, many people have sweared by the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, claiming that it makes a larger difference in their skin compared to other vitamin c alternatives. At $166 per oz, it's not as easily accessible by the average consumer. The reason why it's so expensive is because Skinceuticals currently holds the patent for the perfect ratio of vitamin c, vitamin e, and ferulic acid needed to optimize the effectiveness of vitamin c.\n\nThe \"golden ratio\" is **15% L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**, **1% Vitamin E (Tocopherol)**, and **0.5% Ferulic Aced** with a pH level between **2.5 - 3.0**. Skinceuticals CE Ferulic is also **fungal acne safe**.\n\nGiven the price, there have been a lot of posts and comments asking for dupes of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: This post is not sponsored. I used my own money to purchase Skinceuticals and Dr.Brenner for the advancement of skincare data.**\n\n## Why should I use Vitamin C?\n\nI'm not going to go into this too much since that's not really the focus of the post, but you can read more about the research behind Vitamin C here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin\\_c\\_recs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin_c_recs)\n\n## Popular Dupes\n\nThere are some well known popular dupes of Skinceuticals out in the skincare market today. Keep in mind, none of the dupes listed will have the exact same formulation as Skinceuticals due to the patent. Below are some popular dupes and the differences it has with Skinceuticals.\n\n**Paula's Choice C15 Booster**\n\n[Link](https://www.paulaschoice.com/c15-super-booster/777.html)\n\nPrice: \\~$65/oz\n\nDisclaimer: I have not tried this product.\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Paula's Choice C15 Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water (Aqua), Ascorbic Acid, Butylene|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Glycerin,|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Castor Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Tocopherol,|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Norleucine Acetate, Lecithin, Ferulic|\n||Acid, Panthenol, Bisabolol, Oryza Sativa|\n||(Rice) Bran Extract, Propyl Gallate,|\n||Sodium Gluconate, Sodium Hydroxide,|\n||Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.|\n\nPaulas's Choice claims that this a **15% Vitamin C formula, 1% Vitamin E,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid** at pH of **3.1**.

They also claim that it is at a pH of 2.5–3. NuFountain **is fungal acne safe**.\n\nMini Review: I did not see any difference using this vitamin c product for a few months, so I discontinued its use.\n\n# Skin(care) Background\n\nI have Asian, sensitive, combination hormonal/acne prone skin. I have lots of PIE due to old acne and lots of freckles and sun damage on my skin due to the fact that I've lived in Hawaii for most of my life.\n\n## Current Routine\n\nMorning:\n\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n* Shiseido SPF40 Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n* La Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash\n* Tretinoin 0.1% cream\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n\nTret has made my skin extra sensitive. For example, my skin is now unable to use the Cerave hydrating cleanser due to how sensitive it is. The La Roche Posay cleanser is the only non irritating cleaner I can use now that I am on Tret.\n\nI have tried multiple Vitamin C products on my skin over the years. Specifically, I've tried Melano CC, NuFountain C20, The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension, and Philosophy Vitamin C Powder.\n\nI have never been able to spot any visible improvement whenever I started using *any* brand of Vitamin C on my skin.\n\n# Review\n\nThere's quite a number of reviews between Skinceuticals CE Ferulic VS Timeless 20% Vitamin C and Paula's Choice C15 if you make a quick Google search. I didn't want to add to those stats as I think there's enough data there. This post is mainly going to review Skinceuticals CE Ferulic vs Dr.Brenner's 20% Vitamin C Serum. In my opinion, Dr.Brenner is the closest dupe, ingredients wise, to Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.\n\n## Packaging\n\n[Packaging](https://preview.redd.it/y21w3rkgcmi51.jpg?width=1433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=440c465d015a4ab5b9a285ece3ca393f24c7b33a)\n\nSkinceuticals came in a blue paper box, wrapped in plastic. The actual bottle is pretty opaque, but would definitely still allow light through given that it's glass and I was able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nDr.Brenner's came with the glass bottle wrapped in plastic. The bottle was just as opaque as Skinceuticals, and I was also able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nThe general guidance for both is to store in a cool, dry place. I've also read online that Vitamin C should be exposed to as little light as possible. Given that, I think Skinceutical's does a better job protecting the product until it gets to the consumer's home given the paper casing. For Dr.Brenner, it's possible for it to be exposed to light while waiting for it to be packaged and sent. However, they do claim on Amazon that they create their Vitamin C serum every 2 weeks to make sure it's fresh.\n\nI stored both of mine in a cupboard, so they're both only exposed to light when I take it out and use it. However, I kept my Skinceuticals in the paper casing while I stored it in the cupboard.\n\n## Product\n\n**Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-L-Ascorbic-Hyaluronic-Dr-Brenner/dp/B07ZG28M2S/)\n\nPrice: $24.99/oz\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water, Ethoxydiglycol,|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Propylene|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|Glycol, Glycerin, Laureth-23,|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Sodium|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Ferulic Acid, Panthenol,|\n||Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol|\n\nAs you can see, the ingredients used in Dr.Brenner is the same as Skinceuticals, although the ordering seems to be different. Dr.Brenner claims that the ratio is **20% Vitamin C, 1% Vitamin E, 1% Hyaluronic Acid,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid**. Unfortunately, I do not know the pH nor do I have anything to find out the pH of Dr.Brenner. Dr.Brenner **is fungal acne safe**.\n\n## Method\n\nI applied Skinceuticals to the left side of my face, and Dr.Brenner to the right side of my face every morning for 1 month, adjusting for irritation. I also applied the same sunscreen to my entire face after applying the vitamin c serums.\n\n## Thoughts\n\n**Skinceuticals CE Ferulic**\n\nThis has a really strong hot dog smell. The reviews are spot on about this. It really does smell like I'm rubbing hot dog water on my face. The serum is a pale yellow. The texture is slightly more viscous than Dr.Brenner's. The best way I can describe it is that it has the texture of thick water.\n\n**Dr.Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\nThis has a faint hot dog smell, not as strong as Skinceuticals. The texture is not as thick as Skinceuticals, it's more runny and has a closer texture to water, possibly due to the higher hyaluronic acid content. The coloring is a lighter yellow than Skinceuticals.\n\nMy before pictures are from when I applied the Vitamin C serums for the first time on each side. My after pictures are 1 month after daily morning application of the Vitamin C serums.\n\nI found that the Dr.Brenner serum is more irritating on my skin than Skinceuticals. I found that the side where I usually apply the Dr.Brenner serum usually gets more red and irritable compared to the Skinceuticals side. However, this only happens when my skin needs a break from Tret, and the irritation usually goes away if I take a break from Tret for a day.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\n[Before Front](https://preview.redd.it/pu2biihlcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fc6d699da9c03071fedefbf839616465bddf31b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/pbx6am5ncmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8781476d62dbbf083a306021e119563fd226742)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Dr. Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/yr2ofgzocmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be97af34e9328346fb0b41825bf547bce93c3c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Front](https://preview.redd.it/b6v0kgoqcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c50ddcdda52d39e8b434fe78d1e0147ff35c41b7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/wajzo5zrcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cee0f78bdf18dfe3bd284ed2406eb1b08e753b53)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Dr.Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/24ub6lbtcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a7c5406f55dd31b8823a9ff2a62cba875f2ce29)\n\nResults wise, both sides look pretty similar to me, with the Skinceuticals side looking a bit better. However, this could be due to the fact that I just had more acne scarring on the Dr.Brenner side than the Skinceuticals side. Given the fact that I don't think the difference between the two sides is all that large and my experience with them is mostly similar, I would go for the Dr.Brenner serum and probably apply it every other day. However, if you don't have sensitive skin like mine, I still would recommend Dr.Brenner's serum over Skinceuticals. The reason being that I just don't see *that* large of an improvement from Skinceuticals over Dr.Brenner to justify the 8x price tag. The ingredients are also *very* similar, with the only difference being that Dr.Brenner has more hyaluronic acid.",

    "body": "TL;DR: This is an update to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/e7f2lm/routine_help_fungal_acne_massive_breakouts_with/) where I thought I had fungal acne (I don't). I have allergies. \n\nBackground:  I've always had acne but in my twenties I developed rosacea, eczema, and increasingly sensitive skin. I'm also oily and my breakouts clear up most when I'm out of urban environments and in warm climates (but I live in NYC). I went to high end medical  spas who gave me expensive products/treatments, the results of which were inconsistent. When I found this sub I learned my products were full of irritants for my skin type/condition. I started making changes and saw results - but still had acne. It was itchy, on my back/chest, and all products made it worse. I started trying fungal acne safe products and at first they worked, till I had the [worst skin reaction since puberty](https://imgur.com/k715nBM) to basic, neutral products. After that I got tested for fungal acne with a dermatologist and saw an allergist.\n\n**I'm negative for fungal acne. But I am allergic to:**  \n\\-methyldibromo glutaronitrile/phenoxyethanol-(MDBGN-Euxyl K 400)  \n\\-METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE  \n\\-imidazolidinyl urea (germall®) 115)  \n\\-PHENYLMERCURIC ACETATE  \n\\-carmine  \n\\-thimerosal  \n\\-Sensitive to fragrance in general\n\nMy lovelies, phenoxyethanol is in EVERYTHING. My fucking LUBE had phenoxethynol (which explains some things). My doctors created a [SkinSafe](https://www.skinsafeproducts.com/) account for me, which lets me scan products to see if they are  safe. But it's not a one stop shop, many products are not listed, have out of date ingredients, or link to wrong items. \n\nAs of now I am using only the following that are confirmed free of my allergens:  \n[Aveeno Skin Relief Fragrance-Free Body Wash](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075X2KL5C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  \n[Free & Clear Hair Shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006FMK98/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  \n[Free & Clear Hair Conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033041GI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  \n[Hibiclens on my chest](https://www.amazon.com/Hibiclens-Antimicrobial-Antiseptic-Cleanser-Cleansing/dp/B00EV1D79A/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=hibiclens&qid=1580110327&s=beauty&sr=1-2)\n\nAnd nothing else. I'm washing my face with water, using a a humidifier, and drinking water. My detergent and other non-cosmetics are all safe. I'm adding a new product every 2 weeks and [**my skin currently looks like this**](https://imgur.com/3SzmZ7S)**.**   \n\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Once I start using a cleanser ([CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1LL62W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)) I think my skin is going to need a moisturizer right away but I want to take it slow. Should I wash my face with a little bit of my body wash and try a moisturizer first? Or do something else?\n2. Anyone else with these or similar allergies? What has your experience been like?\n3. I have $800 worth of products I can't use ($1450 if you count what I threw away because it expired while I figured this all out). Are there any product junkies in NYC who would like to take them off my hands? I'd love to just give someone the entire haul for any reasonable offer, or even an unreasonable one. My friends are willing to take them but I'd love to try and make some money back, I can't say I'm not a little bitter about being allergic to every single product I own 😞 \n\nThe names, retail prices, expiration dates, and other information are in the comments if anyone is interested. [Here's a photo of everything](https://imgur.com/9LpaH8c). And thanks to everyone for their help! I'm so grateful to this sub, I don't think I would have considered allergies a possibility had I not learned more about skincare and gone through so much trial and error. Addressing this might not rid me of my acne but I'm hoping it's a good starting point.",

Based off of your pictures, I can see you have already made some improvements as well (woooh!!)

It's often recommended for sensitive skin. I use it both as a a makeup remover and as my \"moisturizer\". It probably functions more as an occlusive to prevent against water loss but whatevs. I love it! \n\nHope this helps :) Good luck to you!

One of my allergens is in everything (Propylene Glycol), and another is a mix of a whole bunch of stuff (Compositae Mix II), so I think that Skinsafe tries to just eliminate everything that has any fragrance. \n\nOn another note- I still use some of my products that I'm allergic to since they weren't severe allergies, and I honestly am having a hell of a time trying to find some products that don't have allergens (Shampoo/Conditioner)  I also haven't gone through my whole stash yet, which is incredibly daunting.",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "Edit: title should be fatty alcohols not fatty acids but autocorrect thinks for me and sees me type acids a lot so naturally I must’ve meant acids. SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep. This stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide, Isopropyl Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Peg-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, ** Stearyl Alcohol**, Polyethylene, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, Fragrance, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Cetearyl Glucoside, **Cetearyl Alcohol,** C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, C12-13 Pareth-3, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica.\n\n*\"[Wait a fucking minute](https://media.giphy.com/media/iAYupOdWXQy5a4nVGk/giphy.gif),\"* she thought. \"That shit has cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and coconut derivatives all the shit I am avoiding. How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 🤔 causes flushing in my skin. And I'm not really interested in trying again.... \n\nBHA, again let me try again at some point. But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "Panibagong sunscreen naman ang irereview ko. Ito ay yung SunProfessional Sunscreen with Orgasol Caresse ng Brilliant Skin Essentials. Yung white ang binili ko, since hindi ako gumagamit ng tinted sunscreens for personal use. Na-curious ako sa sunscreen na ito kasi ito yung first time kong makakita ng product kung saan hindi active ingredient ang main focus. Perfect chance din ito para magkaroon ako ng idea sa performance ng Orgasol Caresse na raw material, na di ko na kinakailangang i-source out yung mismong material at ipadala sa lab. For context, ang Orgasol Caresse kasi ay isang spheroidal powder na may oil-absorption capacity at nakakapagbigay ng powdery finish, lalo na sa mga products kagaya ng sunscreen (more on this later sa ingredients portion). Naubos ko na itong nabili ko, kaya naisipan ko na ding gawan ito ng review. \n\nUnang kapansin-pansin sa product na ito ay yung primary packaging nitong bote na hugis itlog. Infairness sa brand, pina IPO pa nila ito, at nakita ko mismo sa IG nung brand owner yung specs at design ng boteng ito. Magandang to laban sa counterfeiting, since laganap to ngayon both sa local at international brands. Maganda din ang pagkakaprint ng text sa bote, hindi nag-i-smudge kahit basa ang kamay ng tubig, pawis, or nung mismong product. \n\nNgayon naman, sa actual use. Itong sunscreen na ito ay isang opaque white na gel cream, na hindi ganoon kadaling mag-break down when in contact sa daliri o kamay. For context, may mga nasubukan na akong sunscreen na upon contact sa skin e nag-be-break na agad yung emulsion. Ito kadalasan yung sinasabi nung mga users na nagiging matubig or runny yung sunscreen kapag ginagamit nila. Scented itong sunscreen ba ito, pero hindi ganoon kalakas (for me) na tipong nakakasura. Sakto lang para ma-mask yung odor ng base formula. \n\nMadaling i-blend itong sunscreen na ito sa balat, and sa ilang saglit lang e nagseset na ito kaagad. Wala akong white cast na na-observe dito nung ginagamit ko. Aside sa blendability at absence ng white cast, may na-appreciate ako dito sa product na ito. May cooling effect sa balat, sakto sa mainit na panahon natin. Yung cooling effect nito ay hindi ganun katindi to the point na may stinging, subtle cooling effect lang. Kapag natuyo at nagset na sa balat itong sunscreen, dun ko naramdaman yung effect ng Orgasol Caresse na powdery feel nung hinaplos ko yung face ko. Matte ang naging finish nito sa akin, so in my opinion, ok to sa mga oily to combination skin na users. Wala din akong na-observe na pilling sa duration ng paggamit ko nitong sunscreen. Wala din akong naramdaman na stinging o hapdi sa balat nung ginagamit ko ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredients. Ito ang ingredient list:\n\nWater, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, Butylene Glycol, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Nylon-6/12, Polyacrylamide, C13-15 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Green Tea (Camellia Sinensis) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus) Seed Oil, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Menthyl Lactate, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA\n\nMay apat na UV filters itong sunscreen na ito:\n\nEthylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB) \nButyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (UVA) \nOctocrylene (UVB) \nTitanium Dioxide (UVB) \n\nMay slight concern lang ako sa titanium dioxide na ginamit. Sunscreen-grade na titanium dioxide is usually coated with either aluminum hydroxide or silica. Mahalaga ang coating na yan for titanium dioxide dahil pinipigil ng mga coating na ito ang formation ng reactive oxygen species (ROS) kapag tinamaan ng UV ang Titanium Dioxide. Kahit coating yan, dapat isama pa din yan sa ingredient list. \nFor more information sa function ng aluminum hydroxide, pakitingnan na lang sa link below:\nhttps://incidecoder.com/ingredients/aluminum-hydroxide\nPara naman sa silica,  please see link below:\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925838810020128\n\nOk naman ang preservative system, since Phenoxyethanol at Ethylhexylglycerin ang ginamit, common preservative system na ginagamit ng mga brands na averse sa parabens. \n\nTingnan naman natin yung Nylon-6/12. Yan yung INCI name ng Orgasol Caresse. Yan ung nagbibigay nung mga skinfeel benefit at oil-control dito sa sunscreen na ito. Comparable itong ingredient na ito sa Silica at sa Polymethylsilsesquioxane (PMSQ), na kapareho nitong nagbibigay ng powdery after feel at oil-control benefit. \n\nAnother noteworthy na ingredient sa sunscreen na ito ay yung Menthyl Lactate. Ito yung nagbibigay sa sunscreen na ito ng subtle cooling effect sa skin during use. Related ito sa Menthol, ang kadalasang ginagamit na ingredient for cooling benefit. \n\nAng next comment ko sa ingredients nitong product na ito ay para sa mga cosmetic chemist at regulatory personnel na in-charge sa paggawa at pag-check ng IL. Sa product na ito, hindi na-take into consideration yung % composition nung mga raw materials na existing as blends or premixes. For example, sa UV filter, ang ginamit na raw material dito is SUNCAT MTA, isang raw material premix. Ang composition nitong raw material blend na ito ay yung first 6 ingredients na makikita nyo sa IL nitong product na ito. Kung ite-take into account yung % ng each component ng SUNCAT MTA, hindi dapat magkakatabi yung anim na yan, meron jan na dapat nasa ibabang part ng IL. This is the same din sa emulsifier system at preservative system na ginamit dito, hindi advisable na magkakatabi yan, since premix yung ginamit. Ngayon, bakit ko ito pinuna? Dahil pinapadali nito ang paggaya sa product nyo ng mga competitors nyo. So para dun sa brand, kung ayaw nyo magaya kaagad ng iba yung product nyo, please consider taking into account yung % composition nung mga mixture ingredients nyo para mapwesto ng maayos sa IL. \n\nPunta naman tayo sa product claims. Simple at straight forward ng claims nitong product na ito, base sa label. \n1. With Orgasol Caresse\n2. Broad Spectrum SPF 50 PA++++ UVA-UVB Protection\n\nClaim #1, napatunayan na natin yan sa ingredient list, Orgasol Caresse = Nylon-6/12.\n\nClaim #2, hindi ko alam kung nai-post na ba ng brand owner sa kanyang soc med yung SPF Test report. Yung brand owner na makakasagot nito. \n\nMay isang bagay lang akong napansin sa box nito. Hindi nakalagay yung mandatory warning statement, according sa ASEAN Sunscreen Labeling Guideline:\nDo not stay too long in the sun, even while using a sunscreen product. \nDapat lang talaga na ilagay ito sa label ng mga sunscreen product dahil madalas na nakakalimutan ng mga consumer na hindi advisable na magbabad sa ilalim ng sikat ng araw kahit pa na naka sunscreen. Once na mahulas yang sunscreen na gamit mo, masusunog at masusunog ang balat mo jan. \n\nFinal words regarding this sunscreen:\nAside dun sa mga comments ko regarding sa improvement ng ingredient list, absence ng mandatory warning statement, pati na sa non-inclusion ng ginamit na coating agents para sa titanium dioxide sa IL, ok naman itong sunscreen na ito overall. Good aesthetics, good formula, straight forward product claims na wala ng kuskos balungos. \n\nAyun lang, maraming salamat sa pagbabasa ng review na ito. \n",

    "body": "Part 2 based on u/winwinnwinnie’s comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/Hair/comments/t82slz/mending_split_ends_part_2_with_castor_oilsebacic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nYou can temporarily mend split ends together with the ingredients polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer. Most products that claim to mend split ends don’t have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here’s the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That’s fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there’s a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don’t let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don’t let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there’s some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can’t tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

    "body": "Edit: Wow, thank you everyone for the really nice awards and kind comments. I’m so glad I was able to help some of you! This took me a few days to start writing and ruminate on, so I’m really glad it seemed worth it for a lot of people. I’ll try to keep this going in for future major Ipsy skincare items! I’m about to get really busy in a month but I’ll do what I can! ❤️\n\nHey all,\n\nI've been seeing a lot of  posts about the Cryo ATP Sports Booster serum and how people don't know what it is exactly supposed to do... it doesn't help that the official 111Skin's description for it is just filled with nonsensical marketing bullsh\\*t. Considering the huge price tag, I think we're all feeling a lot more curious about it than most serums that wind up in our bags. As I'm reluctantly receiving this in my bag (Ipsy chose it for me), I'm putting in some time to figure it out.\n\n**Objective & Disclaimer:** Let's put aside the pseudoscience jargon used in 111Skin's description and try to figure out what the serum itself should do for your skin. I'm not an expert *in any way* but I'm a skincare enthusiast... I thought maybe it might be worth posting an interpretation of what this serum is formulated to do, since it appears the company itself fails to say anything useful at all on their website. At the very end of this, I'll explain how I think this product got its name. Again, I'm not an expert so if anyone knows better or has their own input feel free to chime in!\n\n**Product description per** [**official webpage**](https://111skin.com/products/cryo-atp-sports-booster): \"Mimicking the effect of extreme cold on the skin, this booster contains natural cellular energy, ATP, to encourage more oxygen for optimised cell function. Just a few drops of this highly-charged formula will reignite lacklustre skin, leaving it tightened, toned, and refined for a reinvigorated complexion. Perfect for use post-workout, this booster will prolong freshness for enlivened and refreshed skin.\"\n\n**Ingredients list**:  Aqua / Water / Eau, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Vp/Polycarbamyl Polyglycol Ester, Ribose, Acrylates Copolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Carbomer, Hydrolysed Sesame Protein Pg-Propyl Methylsilanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Tromethamine, Adenosine, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Adenosine Triphosphate, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Fragrance / Parfum.\n\nOK, now let's break it down \\[key ingredients in **bold**\\].\n\n* **#1 Water**\n* **#2 Glycerin--** this is a humectant, meaning it attracts water into the skin and helps with hydration. The fact that this is #2 tells you that this should be a moisturizing serum.\n* **#3 Niacinamide--** I'm pleased to see that this is #3 in the ingredients list-- and I believe this should make the biggest difference in the serum for most people that aren't already using niacinamide. It's essentially a niacinamide serum with a lot of other bells and whistles. Niacinamide  (aka vitamin B3) is a really common ingredient that is non-irritating to most people but can cause some stinging sensation for some. It evens out skintone, reduces appearance of pores, evens out skin texture (ie, reduces congestion), and boosts ability for moisturizers to work (and thus is wonderfully paired with glycerin).  Most people that aren't already using a serum or some kind of special moisturizer might not have niacinamide in their routine, which is why I think this'd be the most \"groundbreaking\" ingredient for those that aren't already using it. It's the key ingredient that is the reason people rave about the Peach and Lily's Glass Serum which is essentially a niacinamide and hyaluronic acid serum. But here's the catch-- all these benefits won't happen overnight. It needs to be used consistently over a period of at least a week, but likely much longer than that, to start showing effects. Here's a great [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qd7J1UNGUo&t=909s) by Dr. Dray, a real dermatologist, that explains benefits of niacinamide.\n* \\#4 Butylene glycol-- a solvent so ingredients that don't dissolve well in water can be more evenly spread out in the serum\n* \\#5 1,2-Hexanediol-- a preservative\n* \\#6 Betaine-- a humectant\n* \\#7 Polyglycerol-10 Laurate-- skin softener\n* \\#8 Phenoxyethanol-- a preservative\n* \\#9 Caprylyl Glycol-- a humectant\n* \\#10 Vp/Polycarbamyl Polyglycol Ester-- I actually don't know what this is and can't find an immediate Google answer\n* **#11 Ribose-**\\- a component of ATP, which helps explain the product's name. It apparently [might play a role](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047922/) in helping boost collagen production. \\[[Another source](https://www.oskiaskincare.com/skin-nutrition/patented-actives/ribose/#:~:text=Riboxyl%20or%20Ribose%20is%20a,naturally%20in%20all%20living%20cells.&text=It%20is%20the%20only%20known,new%20energy%20to%20tired%20skin) that explains the mechanism a little bit.\\]\n* \\#12 Acrylates Copolymer-- a microplastic for enhancing texture of product\n* \\#13 Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer-- thicken product, enhances texture of product\n* \\#14 Carbomer-- thicken product\n* \\#15 Hydrolysed Sesame Protein Pg-Propyl Methylsilanediol-- skin tightener\n* \\#16 Pentylene Glycol-- a humectant\n* \\#17 Tromethamine-- a pH adjuster\n* **#18 Adenosine**\\-- a component of ATP, which helps explain the product's name. It [might play a role](https://koreanskincaretips.com/adenosine-in-skincare/)in helping boost collagen production (and thus can may have anti-wrinkle properties).\n* **#19 Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil**\\-- offers a cooling sensation upon application, and I suspect is the reason 111Skin relates this product to cryotherapy... even though it has nothing to do with it. It might feel nice on the skin at first for people that aren't immediately irritated, but it can be an irritating ingredient to those with sensitive skin. This might be why some people are saying that they're seeing some redness after application. In the long term it's a sensitizing ingredient. Don't continue its use if you find your skin is irritated upon application. Edit: I should’ve researched this more, but it seems eucalyptus oil also has antiseptic, anti inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, which are all good things. However, it’s also not recommended by a lot of dermatologists due to how easily it can irritate skin for some people. (This is the case for many essential oils.)\n* \\#20 Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer\n* **#21 Adenosine triphosphate**\\-- ATP itself and gives the serum its name. This [L'oreal webpage](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/ingredient-library/atp.aspx) succinctly describes what its supposed to do in skincare.\n* \\#22 Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract-- skin soothing properties\n* \\#23 Xanthan gum-- for product texture\n* \\#24 Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil-- an emollient\n* \\#25 Fragrance/parfum-- the yummy smells and potential irritant\n\n**Interpretation**: There's a fair amount of humectants in this serum, with glycerin being #2 right after water. That can be promising for people with dry skin. Right after glycerin is niacinamide, which if you don't know is a holy grail ingredient for a lot of products. Anyone that doesn't already have this in their routine but has textured skin, irritation, uneven skintone, or enlarged pores, may benefit the most from this serum. Note that the positive effects of niacinamide will take weeks to show, so don't expect this to work overnight! Unfortunately niacinamide can cause some stinging sensation for some people which can be off putting. The \"*cryo*\" part in the product name is thanks to the eucalyptus oil, which gives a cooling effect on the skin upon application. Really, it doesn't serve any substantial service. Maybe some people will find it temporarily soothing but those with sensitive skin, it is a major irritant and a sensitizer. Lastly, the \"*ATP*\" portion of the name-- there's ribose, adenosine, and adenosine triphosphate in the serum. These ingredients are supposed to interact together to promote rejuventation, whatever the hell that means. From the webpages I've linked, it seems these three ingredients should promote collagen production within the skin, which should help battle wrinkling and dullness of the skin.  I haven't delved too deep into the studies that show its efficacy but if someone else wants to do that, please share with us what you find! As for why this product has \"*sports*\" in the name? ...Uh, because the eucalyptus oil might feel good on hot skin post-workout, and something about adding ATP onto one's skin will supposedly help restore ATP that is supposedly used up during the workout?\n\nAnyway, overall I'm optimistic about this serum for people with non-sensitive skin. The eucalyptus oil and fragrance/parfum added might be too much for some of us to handle, but for those that can handle it and that don't have a robust skincare routine yet, I'm optimistic that the niacinamide can make a difference for a lot of people. Do I think it's worth the price tag because of that though? Nope. There's a lot of affordable niacinamide serums out there-- off the top of my head, The Ordinary's niacinamide + zinc serum \\[<$10\\] and Peach and Lily's glass skin serum \\[<$40\\] are the holy grails for so many people. (The glass skin serum is my own HG for fixing my textured skin.) As for the ATP components of this serum... without looking more into efficacy studies I'm not sure if it'll do anything on that front. If anything, the niacinamide should visibly address the things that the ATP ingredients should supposedly  be taking care of. As long as it isn't harmful, then, ah well why not, I guess.\n\nThat said, I just wanted to remind anyone new to skincare that it takes weeks to show major results... but if you are having a bad reaction to it, stop using it! Irritation on the skin can spur so many issues, it isn't worth it.\n\ntl;dr-- I think this is just a fancy niacinamide serum and 111Skin tried to set themselves apart from other products by adding words like \"cryo\" and \"ATP\"... and tried to make it niche by adding \"sports\". Aside from marketing BS, it might not be a horrible serum and would be worth trying for anyone that doesn't have a niacinamide product yet (assuming niacinamide, eucalyptus oil, and/or  fragrance doesn't irritate their skin too much).",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!! Avoid these ingredients in hair care products: \n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrXz5xqoqRg8yKI2/tblol3s4T5YH103yY\n\nIt is hard to find a product with NONE of these ingredients, so make sure that these

And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

What I have found to work the most for me  has been a monthly Glycolic peel (20%) coupled with regular (2-3 times a week) exfoliating and of course niacinamide and Alpha arbutin and sunscreen that blocks against HEV and IR  to stop new pigmentation from forming. It's a nightmare to maintain  but it was the only thing that works. I did try tret, the 0.5 one but it was really really drying on my skin and darkened my pigmentation unless I exfoliated which made it more dry. Such a pita.",

I'm a massive science nerd and always approach things practically.\n\nSo, for example, to help with my inflammatory symptoms and conditions like MCAS, I have to avoid fragrances, things like SLS/SLES in cosmetics, and basically most personal care products. I agree that candles are an unecessary pollutant, and use glass/steel where practical because it's objectively less bad for you (and easier to wash! haha)\n\nI also try to aim for less wasteful living, so I already use cloth nappies for my kids and find reusable menstrual products (i.e. without plastic) less irritating, so certain things I am pretty \"scrunchy\" haha\n\nBut I also still use plastic containers because I already have them, use disposable items when I need to while out and about, and don't panic about these things. I don't use \"eco\" laundry and dish products as they have been shown to be ineffective (at least for now) and I understand most of the surfactants/enzymes etc in them and why they're there. Since using cloth nappies I realise that unclean laundry is actually far more dangerous and irritating to sensitive skin than products (provided no specific allergy) so it's definitely a balancing game for what works and your priorities. \n\nBasically, doing what you can afford and have access to is great, provided it doesn't create secondary issues, and don't let yourself get mentally dragged down by things you can't switch out right now. The amount of contamination I'm sure I get from living on a busy road and having grown up in a smoker's house with a wood fire, and all the products from the 90s/00s that we were exposed to (or earlier if you're older haha)... everyday life (things you can't change) is pretty toxic and if you can't change the 0.05% of one thing in your house, that's not going to affect you noticeably.

I know overuse of perfume can mess with hormones and your endocrine system apparently so I try to be conscious of that. \n\nMy boyfriend has sensitive skin, so we buy detergent from Rustic Strength.

I feel better making these changes for myself, but I have not forced my husband to make all of these changes with me with his personal care products and whatnot. \n\nI don't think I will switch to organic clothing. I haven't gone so far as to getting a full water purification system and air purifiers all throughout my house. I use a filter for water from my refrigerator and try to open the windows in my house as much as I can. I will use an air purifier at times when the windows have to stay closed because of hot summer temps or cold winter temps. I try to remain aware without going overboard. Change was gradual and not all at once. It can also be really expensive to do only organic things and whatnot, so I try to remain realistic about what is within budget and what may be the most important things for me to prioritize.",

I wrote this months ago; just have a courage to post it now lol.\n\nEverything I wrote is based from my experience, knowledge from fellow redditors on r/AsianBeauty, r/SkincareAddiction, and A LOT of research. Always remember - **YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)** - what worked for others might not work for you and vice-versa. There's no universal treatment in acne or other skin concerns. Skincare is a process of trial and error. Take this post with a grain of salt. \n\nAlso, this is a lengthy post so if you don't have any patience to read this wall of text, shoo! (Ay ang hard haha). Seriously, this post is mostly composed of studies, anecdotes, and other references to support my claims. AYAW NATIN NG FAKE NEWS 'DI BA? \n\nFor clarification, I'm far from that Korean, dewy skin. I have suffered from acne vulgaris for years, but I'm confident that my face improved a lot. But this post wouldn't focus with my acne journey. I want this to be a general skincare guide. There may be some personal thoughts here and there but that would be it. \n\nLastly, I apologize if along the way I may have bent the rules of grammar. I'm just accustomed to explaining things in English. I might repeatedly edit this post if I could bring myself to thoroughly proofread this.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile I know and appreciate that dermatologists know what products or practices are best for us especially our skin, I'm one of those enthusiasts who believe that it is much better if you know your OWN skin. For example, over my skincare journey I found out that my skin can't handle SLS but I can tolerate SLES, products with malunggay/ben oil break me out, etc. And these are findings a dermatologist can't just provide to me.\n\nYou'll probably get fed up with my skincare one liner - YMMV (Your Mileage May vary) - but this is crucial concept to be familiarized with. Everyone's skin is different. In a simple context - we have different sensitivity to cosmetic ingredients. YMMV but the components of our skin are all the same, just varies on how much you have vs how much they have.\n\nLet me provide you with some science. I'll try to explain this simply (as the saying goes, know and befriend your enemy), tho of course jargon can't be avoided. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A LITTLE SCIENCE ON HOW OUR SKIN WORKS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur skin is composed of three layers - dermis, hypodermis, and epidermis. The most important of the three is the **epidermis** - the outer layer of the skin. Epidermis consists of 15-20 layers of cells which is mostly 95% of **keratinocytes**. They create proteins, with *Keratin* being the most major protein. They are made in the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis - *Stratum basale/stratum germinativum*. Keratinoctyes present here undergo division and differentiation, half of it will remain in this basal layer, while the other half will further go upward into the upper layers until they reached the outermost layer of the epidermis - the **stratum corneum (SC)**. Keratinocytes in the SC are now keratinized or cornified, this is why they are also called Corneocytes. These keratinocytes in the SC or **corneocytes** are now dead skin cells, which regularly slough away (also called desquamation) and again replaced by Keratinocytes from the deeper layers. They are tightly bound together, forming the SC barrier (sometimes called epidermal barrier, moisture barrier), which plays an important role for a healthy skin.^[1,2]\n\nThis entire process of keratinization takes up to 4 weeks or approximately 28 days. \n\nOther cells present in the epidermis are:^[1,3]\n\n- Melanocytes - they protect our skin from harmful uv rays through their pigment called *melanin*. This pigment is black in nature, that's why when our skin is excessively exposed to sun, such cells produce more melanin. More melanin = darker spot. Heh! Don't blame melanocytes; blame yourself for not applying sunscreen. :P\n- Langerhans’ Cells - they uptake the antigens in our skin and carry them to the nearest lymph node. Specialized in fighting germs.\n- Merkel Cells - enables us to sense pressure because of their sensory function. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNotice how I focused with the Epidermis 'cause this is where skin diseases usually arise. I hope I haven't lost you yet. Skin actually involves complicated processes; the one I mentioned above is just a simplified version.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGoing back to stratum corneum (SC). SC is the most superficial layer of epidermis. It is also called 'horny layer' because *stratum corneum* is a latin term which literally translates to horny layer. \n\nAnd now the SC barrier. SC barrier is usually described through the *Bricks and Mortar* model. Construction of SC barrier resembles a wall in which layered *corneocytes* stand for *bricks*. Desmosomes keep them intact. Intercellular lipids are the cement which stand for *mortar*.^[2,4]\n\n[Visualization](http://www.ajicjournal.org/cms/attachment/2006299184/2028507809/gr3.jpg)\n \nThese bricks main job is the SC's hydration. This is because of the presence of **natural moisturizing factors** (NMFs). NMFs provide moisture retention because of its humectant property. Humectant bonds with water molecules to increase water content in the skin. Some \ncompounds also have the ability to attract moisture from the environment. NMFs are comprised of amino acids, carboxylic pyrrolidone acid, lactic acid, urea, glucose, and mineral ions.^[5-7]\n\nThe mortar, intercellular lipids, are mostly **ceramides** or sphingolipids (50%), remaining would be 25% of **cholesterol**, and 15% of **free fatty acids**. Together, they strengthen the permeability barrier, warding off external irritants; help in water retention and flux.^[8]\n\n\nAlso notice how important hydration (i.e. water content) in our epidermis, specifically in stratum corneum. \n\nHold on, I'm not trying to sound r/imverysmart here. I assure you such information are significant in skincare. As we delve in further, you'll understand why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo how do you measure skin barrier function? It is through **transepidermal water loss (TEWL)** and water content of the stratum corneum, and **skin surface pH**. TEWL and water content are evidently inversely proportional - increased TEWL lowers water content; decreased TEWL more water content. TEWL is the total amount of water vapor loss through skin when there is no sweat gland activity. TEWL is measured by ServoMed Evaporimeter (VERY EXPENSIVE!).^[9-12]\n\nImpaired barrier function has been known to lead in skin conditions and diseases such as xerosis (dryness), rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and acne vulgaris.^[10,13-15] It has been observed that patients with acne vulgaris have low amount of ceramides due to the diminished water barrier content, measured by TEWL. AV patients have higher sebum production and greater TEWL.^[16]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Oh, okay. Eh 'di ikaw na maraming alam, OP. Bakit hindi mo na lang kami diretsuhin sa acne treatments?!*\n\nAba aba, easyhan mo lang. This is one of my pet peeves. We want to have a healthy skin but we don't really educate ourselves with how our skin works, how  a specific product works - how it really impacts our skin. We just slather a random product on our skin and just hope for the best. Well, that 'best' doesn't come easily. We tend to follow unsolicited advice from people who are blessed with good genes and have a healthy skin to begin with. \n\nAnd if ever there's someone here, reading, who has a clear skin to die for, please stop giving UNSOLICITED advice. You're just bringing more attention to the person that they have problematic skin. Of course they know it, but rubbing it to them that they need to treat it isn't actually helpful at all.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n'Kay, going back. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me state my side why when someone asks advice from me, I don't advise them to see dermatologist ASAP. Emphasis on ASAP. I don't want to sound like I'm discouraging people to visit dermatologist. \n\n*Insert situation where a patient went to dermatologist because of acne vulgaris*\n\nA dermatologist would surely prescribe acne treatments. These can be topical or oral antibiotics;  oral Vitamin A derivative like Accutane; topical Vitamin A derivatives (also known as retinoids) like Tretinoin, Epiduo, Differin (Adapelene); benzoyl peroxide; salycilic acid; azelaic acid; and many more. ~~(YOU SEE, THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS AVAILABLE AND YET WE STILL SUFFER FROM AV)~~. They would also insist you to use their products or prescribe OTC products, having a basic routine to support a treatment they chose for you.\n\nBy then, the patient already have a simple routine of cleanser, (toner), moisturizer, (and sunscreen) + maybe a topical treatment like Epiduo. The dermatologist advised the patient to use all of these consistently. \n\nProblems? MANY. First, there's no guarantee that the basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, etc will work for your skin. Why? You can be sensitive to certain ingredient/s present on them, thus leading to *acne cosmetica* (breakouts from cosmetic products). Second, how the hell will you know if it's the cleanser, the toner, or the moisturizer that's causing the problem if you introduced them all at once? Third, treatments like Epiduo encourage faster skin cells turnover rate which can lead to *purging* (surfacing clogged pores A.K.A. it's gonna get worse before it gets better), how will you know if those added acne are due to purging and not acne cosmetica?\n\n\nFourth, these treatments can compromise our skin barrier. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) can cause irritant dermatitis and can result to TEWL.^[17] Topical retinoids can also cause dermatitis. In fact, there's a term called retinoid dermatitis - erythema (redness), scaling (dryness), and desquamation. ^[18] In short, no matter how powerful these treatments are, they can also worsen your skin concerns.\n\n\nQuoting:\n\n> In addition, certain medications used to treat AV can cause alterations in SC integrity and function, either via the active ingredient, the vehicle, or both, which can result in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation. . Providing specific skin care recommendations, including product selection and proper use, is an important part of the management of AV and may adjunctively augment the efficacy of topical medications in reducing acne lesions.^[19]\n\nYes, the patient's derma is right in providing a skin care products to help a treatment. But he's wrong for suggesting to use them all at once.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that a problematic skin has an impaired barrier function present to different conditions as what stated above.^[10,13-15] So damaging the skin barrier further would just worsen everything. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SO what do you need to do, then? BABY your skin! Moisturize it. Strengthen your SC barrier.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut how? By having a dedicated skincare routine! This is what I like with r/AsianBeauty. ABers focus on strengthening their skin barrier rather than treating any skin conditions right away. Try posting once on their daily help thread. \"Hi! I'm new to skincare and I need suggestions to treat my acne.\" They wouldn't say \"Hello! Acids like chemical exfoliants are effective on treating acne, try...\" Their answers would probably be, \"What's your current routine? I suggest having a basic routine first before proceeding with powerful treatments.\"\n\nBecause it makes sense! Having a dedicated skincare routine without treatment is as powerful as focusing on treatment itself.^[20,21]\n\nFun fact: Even a proper skincare routine has been known to be effective in aiding the skin barrier function of infants.^[22,23] ~~I can now foresee what would be the first product I would buy for my son/daughter - a moisturizer! Haha, kidding.~~ \n\nBelieve me, when I started having a routine of cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen every day, the number of my acne reduced significantly. But of course I reached the plateau where I needed to incorporate treatments on my routine, because having a solid routine + a powerful treatment would lead you far!^[24-26]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA simple skincare routine shall compose of a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, a broad-spectrum sunscreen.\n\nBefore we go further to skincare routine let me just provide additional notes to consider.\n\n**YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)**, duh. I know I mentioned this numerous times and will still do. It is important to instill this concept. You shouldn't be surprised that a certain, popular product didn't work for you. Or a product in which some told you to stay away from, worked for you. That's one of the mysteries of this world, Babe. ~~When they said we are created in God's image and likeness, they meant different gods~~. \n\nWe have different sensitivities to ingredients present in a specific product. \n\n>\"People can even be allergic to commonly used products. It’s not that ingredients in these are unsafe – it’s the way the body reacts to them can differ from person to person.\"\nDr Chris Flower, Director-General of CTPA and a Chartered Biologist & Toxicologist^[27]\n\nWhen a product says *hypoallergenic* doesn't guarantee one won't have reaction to it. After all, *hypo* means *less than* so just lesser chance of allergic reaction. \n\nSame goes with *non-comedogenic* (won't clog your pores). This is just one of those marketing strategies to make you buy that product. Okay, I might have gone overboard. That is still a useful guideline 'cause they could mean that the manufacturers tested their products and consider them good fit for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Don't get so worked up with this when you buy products tho. *\"Okay, this one doesn't say non-comedogenic so I might get acne here*\". No, not that mindset. Remember what I said? YMMV. You won't know until you test it out yourself.\n\n[FDA has a list of common claims and labels used in cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/default.htm). \n\nThese are:\n\n- \"Alcohol Free\"\n- “Cosmeceutical”\n- \"Cruelty Free\"/\"Not Tested on Animals\"\n- Hypoallergenic\n- Organic\n\nAs you can see, non-comedogenic is not recognized by FDA.\n\nOne reason is the comedogenicity of some ingredients were tested on rabbit ears. NOT ON HUMANS. \n\n[Related reading](https://www.prettycat.uk/single-post/2017/09/12/Comedogenicity-testing--The-Rabbit-Ear-Test)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom time to time, I'm gonna use cosdna.com as a reference to products' ingredients. It's a helpful site for identifying if a specific ingredient is highly comedogenic or an irritant. It does sound contradicting to my previous statement but even [CosDNA said that](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/help/ingredients_qna.php)\n\n> Our data source include[sic] international experts, institutions and publications. If any the three column is blank, this meas[sic] there is no data (not indicate[sic] [whether] the ingredient is safe or unsafe). We want to remind our user, the effect of cosmetics depends on concentration, quality, process and mutual influence of ingredients. The skin condition of each person are[sic] different (even constantly changing).\n\nNevertheless, it still a good site to track ingredients of a particular product. If for example two products broke you out or gave you adverse reactions, you can look and compare the ingredients present on these products, and pinpoint what could be the culprit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat being said, **Don't hesitate to stop using a product that is not working for you.** If it's making things worse, that just means it's not meant for you. \n\n*Ahh maybe this product is just drawing these pimples out.* No, that is *skin purging* and purging, only happens when you're using exfoliants (BHA, AHA,etc), acids, and/or vitamin A topical derivatives which increase skin's cells turnover rate like retinoids. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**SKINCARE IS GENDER-NEUTRAL**\n\nThis is intended specifically to men. Taking care of your skin doesn't make you less masculine. Using at least three facial products won't hurt your manliness. Please stop that ongoing machismo. \n\nThose products labeled *for men* are just marketing bullshits. \n\nI'm not saying that there's no skin difference between men and women. In fact, males have been reported to have larger pore size and higher sebum production.^[28] Even the skin's pH (which will be tackled later) of females are lower compared to males.^[29] Males also have greater skin thickness than females.^[30]. Males also experience more intense pigmentation after sun exposure and retain it for a longer time than females.^[31]. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's have an example.\n\n*Nivea for men deep cleansing face wash*\n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e1ce27538.html)\n\n> Aqua, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, **Sodium myreth sulfate**, **Decyl Glucoside**, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Alcohol Denat**, PEG-90 GLYCERYL ISOSTEARATE, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-2, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Parfum\n\nIngredients in bold are surfactants and an alcohol. What I have observed from cleansers that are marketed for men is its supposedly \"deep cleansing\" characteristic. This can be seen from these surfactants. I included alcohol because aside from these sulfates, this is also the culprit why it feel like such products *really cleanses* your face. When in reality, it just leaves your face squeaky clean and DRY. \n\nWhat I also observed is the presence of Benzophenone-4, why the hell would you put a sunscreen ingredient in a facial wash?? \n\nNow, knowing that men's skin has larger pores and tends to be more oily, do these ingredients really help with a male skin? Does science view surfactants as ingredients for men? \n\nDon't get me started with the other one - *Sikreto ng mga Gwapo*. ~~Sikreto pero binunyag, h'wag ako~~. Okay, I'm not saying avoid this product and the like. If it works for you, then okay. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother example:\n\n*Pond's Men Energy Charge All-in-One Moisturizer*\n\nWow what's with these \"men\" products that use \"Energy\" \"Fresh\" \"Sport\", \"Cool\"? To make them more *masculine*? lol\n\n[Ingredients](https://www.ponds.com/ph/men/products/collection/energy-charge/moisturizer.html)\n\n> Water, Dimethicone, Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capri Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Perfume, DMDM Hydantoin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, BHT, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Triethanolamine, Niacinamide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract\n\nAnother thing I observed is that these manufacturers of supposedly \"for men\" products might be inclined to the idea that men prefer putting products that absorb easily, almost feel like nothing has been applied to the skin, have a cooling effect. \n\nThese are evident with *Alcohol Denat* high up in the ingredients list. Alcohol, an astringent, makes the product absorb easily and can be irritating to some. The presence of Menthol, which is another astringent, is just for added fragrance and cooling sensation. And how can these be beneficial to male's skin? \n\nIt's not that this particular moisturizer is not beneficial. Key ingredients such as *Niacinamide* - for skin brightening and sebum regulation, *Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract* - for anti aging and photoaged skin, are also present. The thing is these ingredients are way below the list. Perfume even listed ahead of them, in which sensitive skin peeps should be wary of. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay let me stop criticizing these products. The takeaway is - skincare is not sexist! The *for men* label is just a marketing ploy, tricking you into thinking that their products are specially formulated for men. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### A skincare routine that doesn't compromise our SC barrier\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ON CLEANSERS / FACIAL WASHES**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're going to visit r/AsianBeauty you might stumbled with the pH level of the cleanser they are using. Apparently, pH level is significant in choosing a cleanser to have a healthy skin barrier. \n\n**The pH (Potential of Hydrogen / Power of Hydrogen)** is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.\n\n[For reference](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fChGF6M8a4/Vxcq2iOIf_I/AAAAAAAAEv8/tqT54xF5wMcwSVVaqHBe8YROCx7wP6EVgCLcB/s1600/640px-216_pH_Scale-01.jpg]). The pH scale ranges from 0-14. The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 is an acid and any solution with a pH above 7 is an alkali (or base).\n\nThe skin itself does not really have a pH. When they talk about the pH of the skin, they are referring to the pH of a very thin, naturally secreted, moist layer caused by normal secretions from sweat glands (sudoriferous glands), sebaceous glands (which secrete an oily substance called sebum), and the breakdown of fatty acids on the skin by good bacteria that live on our skin. Together these secretions create the **Acid Mantle**.\n\nYes, remember that I mentioned that skin's pH surface is one of the measures of skin barrier function?^[12] Well, it's gonna be relevant here!\n\nSkin's surface pH is said to be ranging from 4 to 6. Some papers say anywhere from 4 to 7 pH level. Having an average of 4.7, 5.5.^[32,33] The consensus is that our skin's pH is acidic to slightly/mildly acidic. This pH level helps maintain the strength and cohesiveness of the skin.^[34]\n\nWhy is it important to maintain this level of acidity tho? The formation of barrier lipids is observed to be delayed when the pH level is 7.4 or alkaline in nature.^[35] Hope you still remember the SC barrier's mortar.^[8] Lipid formation and metabolism require an acidic pH; alterations contribute to the SC barrier's integrity which may lead to different skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Eczema), irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris, and Candida albicans infection.^[36]\n\nAlso, maintaining the skin's acidity doesn't disrupt the bacterial flora's (good bacteria) colonization, present on our skin. Whereas, reaching an alkaline pH promotes the dispersal of these bacteria.^[37] One example is the growth of  Propionibacterium acnes (P Acnes), a commensal bacterium found naturally on our skin, which is also one of the causes of acne vulgaris. P Acnes grow much better in an acidic environment, reaching alkaline pH can increase the number of P Acnes.^[38] Aside from these, alkaline pH skin can show severe irritation to ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a harsh detergent that we will talk about later).^[39]\n\nIt has also been observed that patients with acne vulgaris tend to have a higher skin pH in comparison to those who a normal skin. Majority of acne occurences are related to high skin pH. Further increase of this pH mirrors a state of SC instability.^[40]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat increases our skin's pH? There are certain factors for that. Endogenous factors include: Skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition, race, age, atopic skin disease. Exogenous factors include: Soaps, detergents, cosmetic products, occlusive dressings, skin irritants, and topical antibiotics.^[41] We'll focus on the latter, with cleansers being the most significant. \n\nThe use of high pH cleansers can disrupt the acid mantle by increasing its acidic pH.^[37,40] A study showed that using an acidic cleanser reduced the number of acne and caused little irritation to acne-prone patients, as oppose to the group who used a soap bar (with a relatively high pH) - number of acne increased.^[42] \n\nIdeally, cleansers should have a pH of around 5.5.^[43] Avoid using soap bars, not only because almost all of them are alkaline (high pH)^[44] , they are also harsh and bring greatest changes to the barrier. Opt for liquid facial cleansers instead.^[45] \n\nEver wondered why some of feminine washes are formulated with acidic pH? (i.e. pH Care). ;)\n\nHow about the recently hyped Aztec Healing Clay Mask? Why is it combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)? Aztec's main ingredient is calcium bentonite clay which has a whooping pH level of 8 to 9.7! ACV has a pH level 3 to 5 - a perfect pH-neutralizer to bring down the bentonite clay's pH to an optimum skin pH level. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**You might want to avoid cleansers with SLS**\n\nProbably the most common surfuctant is *sodium lauryl sulfate* (SLS) also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It is one of the cheap foaming agents commonly found on soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc. It is responsible for the foam or the rich lather you notice when you use such products.^[46]\n\nSurfuctants can penetrate into skin and compromise SC barrier function.^[47] SLS, among other surfuctants, can increase the SC's TEWL and can cause inflammation.^[48,49] Ceramides, one of the skin's lipids^[8], has been observed to decrease when skin is in contact with SLS.^[50] \n\nIt is also listed by [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ebc959348.html), having a comedogenic rating of 5. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo TL;DR just choose a cleanser that is low pH and doesn't contain SLS then? NOT REALLY but IDEALLY yes. What I meant is there's a reason why some have nice skin despite using cleansers with high pH.  It's just that if you can avoid the drawbacks, then why not? But then again YMMV.\n\nBUT if semantics aside, what you really need to consider is to make sure you're using a **GENTLE** cleanser. Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing. Not drying. Not that \"squeaky clean\" feeling as what others coin.  Just because you're oily, you're gonna tolerate that. No. Remember that I mentioned that sebum is one of the components of acid mantle? That squeaky clean feeling is removing this fatty layer which is important part of skin's natural protection, and stripping natural oils instead of excess oils.\n\nAvoid overwashing, too. Cleanse for a maximum of two times only. Some even like to just splash plain water in the morning. I know it's tempting to wash your face, especially for oily skin, but that's just a temporary fix. After a few minutes, you'll notice that oils will start to build up again. You might even get *acne detergicans* from overwashing. If it bothers you that much, I recommend having an oil face blotter instead which only removes excess oils. [Like this one from Clean & Clear](https://www.cleanandclear.com/blotting-papers/clean-clear-oil-absorbing-sheets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm gonna list some IDEAL facial washes you can choose from. If I missed other ones, especially LOCAL cleansers or easily available, please do comment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Human Heart Nature] Facial Washes**\n\n[Months ago, I asked Human Heart Nature through their page the pH levels of their various cleansers](https://imgur.com/a/DPcKZ). They were pretty responsive. Listing them down.\n\n- [Nourishing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/nourishing-facial-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.50 to 5.2\n- [Hydrating Creamy Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/hydrating-creamy-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Balancing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/balancing-facial-wash.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Acne Defense Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/acne-defense-facial-wash-100ml.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 5.0\n\nPersonally,I prefer the Nourishing Facial Wash. It does what a cleanser should do - gentle cleansing. You might ask why not the Acne Defense Facial Wash since I have oily acne-prone skin type? My understanding is cleanser should only cleanse not treat your acne with acne-fighting ingredients. It's because cleanser is not meant to stay on our skin for a few minutes, thus such ingredients would not really contribute to acne. But if it works for some, go! If you want to try these facial washes, each of these has a small variant for a cheap price. Perfect for testing before committing to full sized bottles. \n\nKeep in mind that the surfuctants on these cleansers are not strong and little to no emulsifier present, thus you *might* not notice a rich foam or lather but that doesn't mean it's not doing it's job. Don't use a huge blob just to force a lather. These are also not fragrance-free. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Celeteque Dermoscience] Hydration Facial Wash](https://www.unilab.com.ph/products/celeteque-dermoscience-hydration-facial-wash/)**\n\nQuoting the product's description:\n> It has mild cleansing agents and a special combination of moisturizers that gently yet effectively clean without drying your skin.\n\nAnd according to one redditor who used digital pH meter to test the pH level of different cleansers, this one has a pH of 5.5! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/63jk7a/psa_ph_levels_of_various_cleansers/)\n\nHas SLES - a milder version of SLS. I do like this one tho even my mom and my lil sis. Fragrance-free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Sebamed] Facial Cleansers**\n\nHas two variants: \n\n- [for oily and combination skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=124&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=33d05c27ea2ee6871e84e36fdd0a39e4)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to remove excess sebum and aid the skin achieving lipid balance of oily and combination skin\n\n- [for normal to dry skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=125&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=62e9f9649f6166184bb8da0635908ac3)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to support and maintain the moisture and lipid balance of normal to dry skin\n\nThe cleansers look promising. I haven't tried them out tho.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Belo Essentials] Facial Washes](http://beloessentials.ph/product)**\n\n- *Pore Minimizing Facial Wash*\n\n> For smooth and radiant complexion, start with Belo Essentials Pore Minimizing Face Wash that tightens pores and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, gentle cleanser contains Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revitalizing your skin with a radiant glow. Expertly formulated for oily skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.3.\n\n- *Skin Hydrating Facial Wash*\n\n> Your first step to whiter skin, Belo Essentials Skin Hydrating Face Wash deeply cleanses without over-drying and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, nourishing cleanser is infused with Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revealing clearer and whiter skin. Expertly formulated for normal to dry skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.4.\n\nPersonal thoughts: The \"whitens your skin in just 7 days\" seems bogus. You can't just \"whiten\" your skin for that span. And expecting that from a cleanser? Nah. Anyway, if you're looking for a cleanser that's no-frills, these are not for you. They have tons of ingredients present.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**[[Safeguard] Derma Sense Facial Cleanser Sensitive Variant](http://www.sampleroom.ph/safeguard-derma-sense-gently-cleanses-facial-cleanser-acne-prone-skin)**\n\n> gently cleanses easily irritable skin with its mild, unscented formula. It removes dirt, impurities and excess oil, while maintaining your skin's natural layer. Dermatologically tested, DERMA SENSE brings professional care right to you\n\nAlso pH-balanced. I freaking want to try this one because it's well loved by fellow redditors here, but it's always out of stock! Yes, if a product is labeled for sensitive skin, I always prefer it because of their clean ingredients list (no fragrance, additives,etc), so less chance of breaking me out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Himalaya] Purifying Neem Face Wash](http://www.himalayaherbals.com/products/skincare/Purifying-Neem-Face-Wash.htm)**\n\n> Specially formulated to give you clear, problem free skin, a soap-free, daily use face wash gel that cleanses your skin by removing excess oil and impurities without over-drying. Neem, well-known for its purifying and antibacterial properties, kills problem-causing bacteria. Combined with Turmeric, it helps control acne and pimples leaving your skin soft, clear, refreshed and problem-free.\n\nAccording to some redditors it has a pH level of 5.5.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Cetaphil] Gentle Skin Cleanser](https://www.cetaphil.com/gentle-skin-cleanser)**\n\n> a mild, non-irritating formulation that soothes skin as it cleans. In fact, it's gentle enough for a baby's delicate skin. Designed specifically to work for all skin types, it is a simple, yet highly effective way to care for your skin.\n\nThis one has SLS. But my best friend uses this one and she really likes it! She said it's like putting a lotion on her face. Unfortunately, this broke me out. I can't handle SLS. It is also popular on r/AB and r/SCA. \n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7019242376.html)\n\nIf you can tolerate SLS, this is a perfect cleanser for you. Very short ingredients list. But I've read somewhere this has a pH of around 6.7. Not alkaline so it's kinda good nevertheless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**ON MOISTURIZERS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is probably the most vital part of skincare. Moisturizers can help with our SC barrier function if proper ingredients are used. From TEWL reduction, skin lipids' restoration, and other skin rejuvenation benefits.^[51]\n\nAll skin types need moisturizer. Yes, that is contrary to the popular belief that oily skin doesn't need moisturizer. You just need to find a moisturizer that will suit your needs. I presume you already know what your skin type is. If still not, I suggest reading this **[informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4kufkk/skin_basics_181_skin_types_setting_standards/)** \n\n**Skin types** vary in different measures but the most common would be: Normal (please step out, jk), Oily, Dry, Combination, and Sensitive. ([Paula's Choice recognizes that everyone has sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/what-is-my-skin-type.html)).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are different types/components/classes/properties of moisturizers. These are humectants, emolients, occlusives, and constituents of natural moisturizing factor/essential proteins.^[52,53] \n\n**Humectants**, as mentioned earlier,^[6] attract water from two sources - from the dermis into the epidermis and in humid conditions from the environment. In short, they are responsible for hydration! However, humectants are a double-edged sword. They increase TEWL too by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis where it is easily lost to the environment.^[53] In simplest words, because humectans increased the water content, the skin now have enough water so the rest just evaporates! For this reason, humectants are best combined with occlusives.\n\n**[Some ingredients that act as a humectant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/table/T3/)**:^[54,55]\n\n- *Glycerol/Glycerin*\n\nThis is the most common humectant. In fact, it is the second most frequently used cosmetic ingredient, next to water, documented through the FDA’s Voluntary Cosmetic Reporting Program.^[56] Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration.^[57] \n\n- *Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or hyaluronan/Sodium Hyaluronate*\n\nThey are not actually the same. Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from Hyaluronic Acid but they still function the same.^[58] It is also present on our body and most abundant in our skin, which accounts for 50% of our body’s total HA level.^[59,60] It can hold 1000 times its water weight!^[61] This makes it a superstar ingredient in skin's hydration and even in skin aging.^[62-64]\n\n- *Propylene Glycol(PG) and Butylene Glycol (BG)*\n\nI've been seeing these ingredients mostly from sheet masks, which is pretty logical. PG and BG, not only a humectant, but can also act as an enhancer. They help active ingredients penetrate the skin.^[65,66] So from a few minutes a sheet mask stayed from your face, the ingredients present penetrated better on your skin; thus faster result (i.e. brightening). There are also studies concerning that PG is skin-sentisizing (can cause adverse reactions from repeated exposure).^[67-69] But the consensus seemed to be PG is safe to use in cosmetics.^[65] If anything, PG should be used in low concentrations^[69] just like other humectants.^[55]\n\n- *Panthenol (Vitamin B5)*\n\nPanthenol, in long-term use, significantly improved the moisture level and decreased TEWL of the skin.^[70,71] It is incredibly useful in wound healing, too.^[72]\n\n- *Urea*\n\n*Insert biased praises in this ingredient.* I just recently discovered this ingredient and I'm already in love. Urea? EWW. Don't worry it's a different urea when used in cosmetics. We are talking about hydroxyethyl urea. As you've read earlier, Urea is one of the natural moisturizing factors present in our skin.^[7]\n\nApparently, Urea is a well-known ingredient in treating xerosis (dry skin).^[73-75] As it turns out, it can also be beneficial to other skin types! Who said only dry skin needs that hydration?\nUrea, like other humectants, can increase the hydration and water-binding capacity of the horny layer.^[76,77] It reduces TEWL and the irritant reactions when skin is exposed to SLS.^[78,79] \n\nThis sexy ingredient has also been observed to have a keratolytic property!^[80,81] **Keratolytic** means the agent that assists keratolysis - \"the softening and shedding of the horny outer layer of the skin\".^[82] In other words, it helps with the desquamation of keratinocytes in the SC or corneocytes; or in more simpler term: *exfoliation*. Fear not, it gently exfoliates compare to active chemical exfoliants. The fun doesn't stop as Urea can also enhance the penetration of other topical ingredients.^[81,83,84]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Occlusives** sit on the skin, creating a physical barrier, blocking the TEWL in the SC. This is the reason why humectants are paired with occlusives. The former draws water onto the skin, while the latter traps this water. The most popular occlusive ingredient is **petrolatum** or petroleum jelly. At a minimum concentration of 5%, it can reduce TEWL by more than 98%!^^[54] \n\nBut you all know how greasy a petroleum jelly is, right? Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline), was previously labeled as highly comedogenic after testing on rabbit's ear. But this has been busted by a study that tested it on acne-prone patients. They concluded that greasiness doesn't equate with comedogenicity! \"The admonition for acne patients to seek \"oil-free\" skin care products has no scientific merit with regard to comedogenicity.\"^^[85] If a product is making you oily because of its nature, doesn't make it highly comedogenic.  But of course -.  There was also an issue that occlusives futher impair barrier function but it has been proven that occlusives, like petrolatum, even accelerated barrier recovery.^[86] I can attest to that. Petroleum jelly really helped when I overexfoliated my skin.\n\nBecause of aesthetic reasons, lighter occlusives came into picture like **lanolin, mineral oil**, and **silicones** which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.^[54]\n\nJust look at how our fellow redditors are fond of occlusives A.K.A. **S L U G  L I F E**\n\n[I didn't choose the Slug life, the Slug life chose me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/73t814/humor_i_didnt_choose_the_slug_life_the_slug_life/.)\n\n[To all the slugs out there, you win](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7xe07s/personal_to_all_the_slugs_out_there_you_win/)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Emolients** fill the gap between the layered corneocytes, smoothing the skin. This is the sticky feeling you notice on your moisturizer. \n\n\n---\n\n**[References used:](https://docdro.id/0zJ9xzb.)**\n\nEdit: I have to divide this into parts cause of characters restriction.",

Minimalist had used same formulation and just changed active. Basically 3 formulas --> 10 products. I had shared this is my stories \\[@avaale\\_\\]. Purely because I found it interesting. [Reproducing those stories here](https://imgur.com/a/rBAGL2Q), if you'd like to take a look.\n\nToday I decided to take a deeper look at the products, since I was getting comments like 'are you trying to say these products are useless?'.  And I had too cursory an examination to be comfortable saying it's good or bad. The Minimalist had outdone themselves with transparency and even mentioned supplier details, for every main active. (Not being sarcastic, I'm genuinely in awe, that they did this, while have the Indian skincare world refuses to declare full list of ingredients).\n\nStarted with\n\n# Vitamin C 20% (SAP) + Ferulic Acid\n\nThey had sourced the SAP from [BASF.](https://www.basf.com/in/en.html) Searching for details on their SAP, I found [this.](http://www.dr-baumann-international.co.uk/science/BASF%20Vitamin%20C.pdf) The technical information sheet for SAP from BASF itself.\n\nA few things stand out.\n\n* The technical info sheet says SAP is **most stable at pH values above 6.5.** [Pubchem compound summary](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Sodium-ascorbate) agrees.  **However the Minimalist site claims that the product is at a pH of 3.5**\n* Now according to the same BASF technical sheet, at pH 3 (details on 3.5 was not provided) , stability falls from 100 to 10 in 60 days. Where as from PH 5 to 7 stability wavers at 90 to 100 till 120 days. Stability at various pHs were tested at 40C\n* Next the ferulic acid. LAA which is a highly unstable form of Vitamin C is usually formulated with ferulic acid to increase stability. All studies I found tested LAA & ferulic acid  [\\[1\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16185284/), [\\[2\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4536008/), [\\[3\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18603326/).  But Ferulic acid as an ingredient does have anti-oxidant properties and is a effective scavenger of free radicals, which could be a reason it was added. Just looking at ferulic acid, [this article](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/491755) states that it penetrates the stratum corneum in at both pH 3 as well 7.2. So it should still work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Salicylic Acid 2%\n\nFrom the site *\"Formulated with* [Curcylic 40](https://www.vantagegrp.com/en-US/Product/Page/ea60363a-7c2a-4907-b245-a763f0475c50/Curcylic-40) *(SA) based on advanced pre-solubilized technology from* [Vantage](https://www.vantagegrp.com/webforward/home)*, US, a global natural chemistry company\"*\n\nNow the INCI name for [Curcylic 40](https://www.cosmeticingredients.co.uk/ingredient/curcylic%C2%AE-40) is Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine & Salicylic acid. As u/Aayu07 pointed out in her Insta stories \"Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine\" part is not mentioned [in the Minimalist website](https://beminimalist.co/products/salicylic-acid-2) at all. I assume they're writing the whole thing SA.\n\nIf you check out [Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-dimethylamine) in Incidecoder.  It not only talks about [Curcylic 40](http://www.lipochemicals.com/products/curcylic-40), but also rather helpfully shows us other products with this ingredient, one of which happens to be [The Ordinary Salicylic 2%](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-salicylic-acid-2-solution) & [The Ordinary Aha 30% + Bha 2% Peeling Solution](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-aha-30-bha-2-peeling-solution-2).  The ordinary does mention [Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-dimethylamine) in [their ingredients list](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-salicylic-acid-2pct-solution-30ml?_ga=2.87650074.34031488.1600610763-39495863.1600610763) by the way. So for[2%, they basically have 5%](https://www.theformulary.co.uk/product/curcylic-40-water-soluble-salicylic-acid/) Curcylic 40 and pH is supposed to be between 3 and 8.  But pH of this product is not mentioned on the minimalist site.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Retinol 2%\n\nFrom the site *\"Contains top quality Granactive Retinoid sourced from* [Grant Industries](https://www.grantinc.com/)*, USA, A leading global supplier in skincare\"*\n\nThe granactive retinoid, they're sourcing from Grant has the [iNCI name Dimethyl Isosorbide (and) Hydroxyp­inacolone Retinoate](https://cdn.thomasnet.com/ccp/00654679/98240.pdf). Which they've split up, maybe due to percentages of concentration. The ordinary did this too.\n\nI found this [list of actives and briefs about them](https://cdn.thomasnet.com/ccp/00654679/98240.pdf) from Grant Industries. Where they mention [these results.](https://imgur.com/Pf6meSk.jpg)\n\n[INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxypinacolone-retinoate) also provides a summary of the ingredient itself and results from manufacturer's tests and results from Estee Lauder comparitive in-vitro study between Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, [tretinoin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tretinoin), good old [retinol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/retinol) and [retinyl palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/retinyl-palmitate) in collagen boosting effectiveness.\n\nTheir bottomline \"*We are really happy to see some innovation happening with retinoids, and we think* ***Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate is a super promising rising star, but it’s not fully proven yet.*** *If you are someone who likes to experiment and try out the newest things, grab your running shoes and try some HPR containing serum now (see product list below :)). If you like the tried and true, however, stick to* [*retinol*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/retinol) *and* [*tretinoin*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tretinoin) *for now and re-examine the question in a couple of years when (hopefully) more research will be available. \"*\n\nManufacturer recommends [upper limit use of 1%](https://imgur.com/Pf6meSk.jpg). This is where retinol comes in I'm guessing. For the other 1% or more. This is the same combination The ordinary uses in their [Granactive retinoid 2% emulsion](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-advanced-retinoid-2pct-30ml).\n\nAlso the other products using this ingredient in Incidecoder is a who's who of brands.\n\n* Sunday Riley A+ High Dose Retinoid Serum\n* Peter Thomas RothProfessional Strength 3% Retinoid Plus\n* Dr. Sam Bunting SkincareFlawless Nightly Serum\n* The Inkey List  Retinol Serum\n* And even surprisingly [Revolution Skincare](https://incidecoder.com/brands/revolution-skincare)Skin Tone Correcting Serum – Granactive Retinoid 2%\n* and much much more.\n\nThe [science behind this product](https://beminimalist.co/products/retinol-2) on the Minimalist website, speaks pretty much only about the granactive retinoid, even though the product is called Retinol 2%. Retinol and Retinoic acid esters are not the same and don't work exactly the same way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Niacinamide 10% + Zinc\n\nFrom the site *\"Formulated with Niacinamide USP Grade (US Pharmacopeia approved) by* [Lonza, Switzerland](https://www.lonza.com/)*, a leading global supplier of Vitamin B3 for over 40 years\"*\n\n[Lonza is definitely big into Niacinamide](https://www.efeedlink.com/search/?q=lonza&q=lonza), and a well known legit supplier.\n\nBut onto more relevant information, I did find this [data sheet from Lonza](https://dermagist.com/shop/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/niacinamide-sheet.pdf) with briefs on a few efficacy studies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Hyaluronic Acid 2% + Vitamin B5\n\nFrom the site *\"The key ingredient is sourced from* [Royal DSM, Netherlands](https://www.dsm.com/corporate/home.html)*; a global science-based company ranked in Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations 2020\"*\n\nBare bones [Data Sheet of Hyaluronic Acid](https://www.essence-plus.com/essence-plus689/program_download/good/201611081542182368.pdf) from manufacturer.\n\nBare bones [Data sheet of Panthenol,](http://technicaldocuments.dsm.com/product_finder/technical_documents/DNP/level10/DNP_DNPNA_000000000000413852_PDS_en.pdf?&&ACSew=ApplicationDataSheet) from Royal DSM. But I'm not sure if they're sourcing this from them too. One thing though, if they're sourcing ingredient from here pH of 5% solution in water is 9 to 10.5. Now the panthenol is probably lesser than 2% since hyaluronic acid is listed first (this is an assumption since Indian companies don't really care about listing in order of %).\n\nI'm not sure how relevant this is but pH of hyaluronic acid is 6 to 7 according to the data sheet. Panthenol is 9 to 10.5. This is a serum that I originally assumed for pH balanced. But the [incidecoder](https://imgur.com/VgOAZJ1.jpg) lists no [buffering](https://incidecoder.com/ingredient-functions/buffering) agent. [Skincarisma](http://www.skincarisma.com/products/analyze?utf8=%E2%9C%93&product%5Bingredient%5D=Aloe+Vera+Juice%2C+Dimethyl+Isosorbide%2C+Sodium+Hyaluronate%2C+Propanediol%2C+Ethoxydiglycol%2C+Panthenol%2C+Phenoxyethanol%2C+Pullulan%2C+Ethylhexylglycerin%2C+Hydroxyethylcellulose%2C+Xanthan+Gum%2C+Sclerotium+Gum%2C+Trisodium+Ethylenediamine+Disuccinate%2C+Lecithin) doesn't mention a pH adjuster either. So I'm very curious to see what the actual pH of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: I'm not a cosmetic formulator and while I roughly know ingredient purposes, I've no idea how all the ingredients would interact with each other and affect the pH. Which why I started this with 'I'm not sure, how relevant this is'.**\n\nI did ask a friend who purchased this product to check pH and if or when she gets back to me, I'll update this accordingly.\n\nAlso while the science behind the products had this to say *'Not all topical Hyaluronic acid serums are equally effective as the molecular size of HA determines the depth of its delivery in the skin. The smaller the molecule size, the deeper it penetrates the dermis. Larger-molecule size HA stays at the epidermis and provides surface hydration only.'*  The data sheet attached above mentions a molecular mass of 1.6 MDa. This is [middle molecular weight](https://www.nayaglow.com/2019/04/30/hyaluronic-acid-explained/).\n\nSo is this inherently bad? Not necessarily, as ecowell explains in detail in [this post.](https://www.theecowell.com/blog/hyaluronicacid) All sources are cited. Also [this](https://madridge.org/journal-of-chemistry-and-research/ijcr-1000103.pdf).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Lactic Acid 10% + Hyaluronic Acid 2%\n\nFrom the site \"*Formulated with natural and pure ingredients sourced from leading global suppliers such as* [Corbion](http://www.corbion.com/) *and Royal DSM, Netherlands\"*\n\nI think we can safely assume that HA in this product is sourced from Royal DSM. And I've already gone in-depth into it above. So directly onto, lactic acid. And we have the data sheet [here](https://www.corbion.com/static/downloads/datasheets/56pdf/pds-purac%20hs%2088%20(0406).pdf). Nothing that alarms me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kojic Acid 2% + Alpha Arbutin 1%\n\nFrom the site *\"Formulated with the most stable form of kojic acid, Kojic Dipalmitate, sourced from* [Alpha Environmental](https://www.alpha-environmental.com/)*, USA, a leading global supplier\"*\n\nI found nothing. Zilch. Not even a info page on their own site. Just a [listing](https://www.alpha-environmental.com/products.html) that shows they sell both Kojic Acid Dipalmitate as well as Alpha arbutin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# AHA 30% + BHA 2%\n\nFrom the site \" *All ingredients are sourced from leading global suppliers such as Fortune 500 Chemours Company, USA, and Vantage, US\"*\n\nSince we already BHA is [Curcylic 40](https://www.cosmeticingredients.co.uk/ingredient/curcylic%C2%AE-40) ie Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine & Salicylic acid, and it's been analysed above, I'm moving on the AHAs.\n\nChemours offers a variety of [Glycolic Acid products](https://www.chemours.com/en/brands-and-products/glycolic-acid) for different purposes. Their [Glypure TM](https://www.chemours.com/en/-/media/files/glycolic-acid/glypure-cosmetic-grade-glycolic-acid-brochure.pdf) range which comes in 3 variants are our best bet and Glypure GL which is glycolide, the cyclic diester of glycolic acid. I found a lot of information\n\n* [Technical Spec](https://www.chemours.com/en/-/media/files/glycolic-acid/glypure-70-spec-sheet.pdf) and [Material Safety Data Sheet](https://www.3eonline.com/ImageServer/ImageViewer.aspx?id=3Q%2FfAR8ne%2FvPh6syVnSymkS%2BBDo8OjmbVocxRCMEgeH9DOXp3rOno2bBstgZQVl6ddB5zxzJXIW7nbmF5mKrdg%3D%3D) for Glypure 70\n* [Technical Spec](https://cms.chempoint.com/ChemPoint/media/ChemPointSiteMedia/PDF%20Docs/C-10269_Glypure_99_specsheet_1.pdf) and a [2017 MSDS](https://cms.chempoint.com/ChemPoint/media/ChemPointSiteMedia/PDF%20Docs/Glypure-99-SDS-_1.pdf) for Glypure 99\n* [Product Information](https://www.in-cosmetics.com/__novadocuments/670288?v=637172315377900000) of Glypure GL\n* [Brochure](https://www.chemours.com/en/-/media/files/glycolic-acid/glypure-glycolic-acid-sell-sheet.pdf) with manufacturer studies and much more that I'm not adding here.\n\nHowever very little on Glypure™ Preneutralized which I feel is the actual product used. All we know about this is \"• Pre-neutralized Glypure™ is an aqueous solution neutralized with ammonium hydroxide. It is available in a variety of pH levels—2.25, 3.25, 3.8, 4.0, 4.4—as well as custom pH.\"\n\nIncase I'm mistaken I'm leaving other info attached above.\n\nLogically lactic is probably from [Corbion](http://www.corbion.com/) (which is not mentioned) and BHA from [Vantage](https://www.vantagegrp.com/webforward/home), which is mentioned.\n\nI found no mention of mandelic acid in both Chemours and Vantage's sites. I've no clue where it's sourced from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Apple Cider Vinegar 2% + Glycolic Acid 10%\n\nFrom the site \"*It is formulated with high-grade ingredients sourced from a Fortune 500 company, Chemours, USA\"*\n\nThis obviously refers to Glycolic Acid as discussed above. No idea about source of ACV.\n\nBut Neemli and Minimalist, 2 brands recently picked this combo to formulate products with. So I had a cursory glance at studies and found [this one study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31328306/) where \"*A total of 22 subjects (11 AD and 11 healthy controls) were enrolled. Subjects soaked both of their forearms for 14 days, with one arm in dilute ACV (0.5% acetic acid) and the other in water 10 minutes daily. Transepidermal water loss and pH were measured pre- and post-treatment*.\" Conclusion: Dilute ACV soaks have no significant effect on skin barrier integrity but caused skin irritation in a majority of subjects.\n\nNeemli's site did mention this *\"A natural astringent, Apple Cider Vinegar helps increase the blood flow to the skin, minimizing the appearance of pores. It also helps balance the skin’s pH to keep it functioning optimally and fighting acne-causing bacteria.\"* as the reason it was added.\n\nI'll have to look into this deeper later, but for now, this combination baffles me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Benzoyl Peroxide 2% + Glycolic Acid 5%\n\nFrom the site *\"Contains top quality ingredients sourced from Vantage Specialty, USA, ranked in the top 30% of the most sustainable companies in the world by EcoVadis\"*\n\nAnd we're back to Vantage. Glycolic Acid has to be from Chemours. so the BP is from Vantage.\n\nVantage markets BP as [Curoxyl 42](https://www.vantagegrp.com/en-US/Product/Page/65ea0c11-a095-463f-a102-a19ccd2ae9bb/Curoxyl-42). The INCI name is Aqua & Benzoyl peroxide. Found the [brochure](https://pdfhost.io/v/lWMc.doh5_PowerPoint_Presentation.pdf) and I find this product quite intriguing since they claim that it's a *\"aqueous based, micronized benzoyl peroxide dispersion (40%) in the form of a gel that can replace traditional BPO due to its low irritation profile\"* while normally I find BP quite irritating.\n\nNo mention of pH on the site, while Bp is supposedly 4.8 to 6.6. And glycolic acid traditionally potent at much a lower pH. This study on glycolic acid's  antibacterial activity against *C. acnes* found it [most potent at 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64545-9), while it did kill C.acnes upto 4.5. Less efficient killing was found at pH 5.\n\nSo I'm curious about the pH of this product too.\n\n# \n\n# My thoughts\n\n* I didn't find anything supporting or refuting Consumer testing results that's stated on the website.\n* I'm most excited for Retinol 2%, since The granactive retinoid emulsion was my love before I was prescribed Adapalene and Tret.\n* All in all, while the company has indulged in lesser than savoury practices regarding packaging and I'm not certain about the research they did into ingredients / formulation themselves or their passion for skincare, I do believe that they maybe better than a lot of indie brands out there.\n* A insta video by a popular beauty editor who was talking about the minimalist had been shared with me. They had said some sourcing seems legit and others shady. While sources for ACV and mandelic acid was not revealed, all others seem to be legit. I found no shadiness, let me know if you've found any.\n* Products that don't quite convince me / I still have doubts about are\n\n1. Vitamin C 20% (SAP) + Ferulic Acid  (pH reasons)\n2. Benzoyl Peroxide 2% + Glycolic Acid 5%  (pH reasons)\n3. Apple Cider Vinegar 2% + Glycolic Acid 10%  (combination)\n4. Hyaluronic Acid 2% + Vitamin B5  (pH reasons)\n5. Kojic Acid 2% + Alpha Arbutin 1% (no details, no idea what to think)\n\n* The actual results and efficacy is yet to be seen, and I'll personally primarily judge them on that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso speaking about popular bloggers / influencers, a lot of info about minimalist that's been going around in social media is clearly from this sub.\n\nAs you guys know this is a completely non-profit platform that we're using to educate ourselves and others, the other contributors and I gain nothing from doing all this research and sharing it, And while I have no problems with people sharing and using this information, I do wish credit is given where credit is due. And if you're asking \"how do we credit? you're anonmyous\", u/Aayu07 and I both started Instagram handles. Well she has had hers for years. I started it because she wanted to credit me for sharing some glycolic acid stuff. And I'd appreciate it if you credit me if you use this information anywhere. Just DM me or u/Aayu07 or any other user here to find out whether they wanted to be credited. Basic courtesy guys. For instance u/kparwal and u/e-lusion were also credited when u/Aayu07 used their findings.\n\nJust to be clear, ***\"I*** ***do not*** ***consent to this post or any part of it being reposted on any social media (including but not limited to YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat).

Because the Ordinary entered a market that was pretty saturated, and the Indian market is STARVED of basic formulations. \n\nI DO wish they'd use INCI names for their ingredients, because the Derma Essentia moisturizer used a proprietary name for their emulsifier, and I was so excited, I only found out later that Polysorbate 20 was in there... Not fungal safe 😐. But I'm glad these products ARE minimal! \n\n... That being said, chemist products are still cheaper, and Be Minimalist's products are too pricey for me 😂 Talk to me when I make my own money, maybe I'll have all their products, who knows! ...

    "body": "Anyone on any form of social media knows about Lume Deodorant; their advertising is on point! I loved the catchy commercials, positive reviews, and had been using natural deodorants for years so I thought why the heck not?!? I've been using for 2+ months and felt it was time to write about my experience. I'm a big believer in honesty and transparency and my biggest criticism of this product/company is the inability to leave an unbiased review, even/especially if it's negative; the company never posted my less than stellar review on their website so I'm taking it to this forum. Underarms are skin too!\n\nI purchased the 3oz Lume Unscented Deodorant in the tube for $19USD. I've used it approximately 60x, pea sized amount per pit and I still have some left. It's vegan, cruelty-free, aluminum-free, and baking-soda fee. It's a mandelic acid based product. In the past I've used Schmidt's Original and Sensitive, Native, and an independent Etsy brand. All but Native worked well for odor but eventually they all irritated my pits to different degrees\n\n**PRO** \n\n* The first positive I will say is that it never irritated my pits, even directly after shaving. It's safe to use anywhere the gets stinky but I only have used on my underarms.\n\n**CONS**\n\n* DISHONEST PRACTICES As I mentioned before, I think the company promotes skewed product reviews by omitting critical reviews. This is not cool by me.\n* INEFFECTIVE- Guys, nobody wanted this product to work more than me. I don't have a strong body odor but my underarms will get stinky if I don't use anything. I don't care about getting sweaty (this is not an antiperspirant) but this really didn't work well to control odor. The company is very upfront that to use the product effectively, your clothes need to be treated first to wash off residual bacteria and residue from former products. I bought their recommended detergent and treated all my clothing as directed; nope, still stinky. I repeated the clothing treatments multiples times without results hoping it would work. At that point, I was past the 30 day return window. I bought a few new (washed) shirts and still experienced odor so I think the washing is kind of BS. Some days it would work better than others but it def didn't live up to the 72 hour odor control the company claims. It'll work well for a few hours but after that...phew. My body actually has a different, worse scent when I use this product. \n* \"UNSCENTED\"  is more like...old bananas. It mostly fades but kind of off-putting.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nWater, Mandelic Acid, Arrowroot Powder, Tapioca Starch, Isoamyl Laurate, Sodium Acrylate/ Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ Dimethylacrylamide Crosspolymer, Caffeine, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Theobroama Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Isohexadecane, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Sodium Lactate, Panthenol, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Tocopherol, Polysorbate 60, Lecithin, Pullulan, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Ethylhexyglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Silica, Fragrance\\*",

That's one thing I didn't like about Lume - they utilize pseudoscientific concepts like 'other deoderants trap toxins' and 'aluminum causes cancer' - both of which are untrue fear mongering. If you can't sell your product without using pseudoscience, its probably not all it's cracked up to be. \n\nAlso most deoderants don't use aluminum, antiperspirants do. So their advertising is also doing that dishonest thing where they declare their product free of something...implying that's a selling point because other products have the thing ... when they don't.",

Eventually I succumbed and bought a trial size. \n\nMy history?

I even had a pharmacist friend whip up a super strong spray-on liquid for me to use. \n\nEver since I started using Lume, I am virtually odorless. One application lasts more than a day in this Florida heat and humidity. I still sweat, but it doesn't smell. (It's not just my nose- I ask my husband and my siblings to check out of paranoia.) \n\nFor reference, I use the peach scent. I've used a couple others but didn't enjoy the smells. Lavender was slightly tolerable to me. It must differ from person to person, but this has been incredible.\n\nI'm usually ashamed and embarrassed when ads catch me, but I'm glad that I tried this and it's still working for me.",

This product works so well for me personally and if they stop selling it I would truly freak out\n\nWhat works for me is putting it on as soon as I get out of the shower and reapplying halfway through the day",

Parabens actually are naturally occuring and are found in many fruits and vegetables like blueberries. I'm sure you've probably heard that parabens are linked to breast cancer. This simply isn't true. The study that most people referenced for this was very poorly designed and found no causal link or even a good correlation with parabens. You may have also heard that parabens mimic estrogen. There are naturally occurring chemicals found in fruits and vegetables that are 10,000x stronger mimics and the estrogen in your body is a 100,000x stronger. There is no measurable disrupting affect from parabens. They're a very effective preservative and were actually named the nonallergen of the year by the American Contact Dermatitis Society in 2018. Perservatives used in place of parabens like phenoxyethanol are actually much stronger allergens. It makes me sad to see marketers using these fear tactics to sell products and trick the public. Parabens are safe and the best cosmetic preservative we have! \n\nhttps://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/parabens/\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30649006/",

Swirl it around until it's homogeneous. Adding suran wrap with holes helps really get them.\nFlies all day!\n\nAs for your pattern, the soap is what is called an amphipathic molecule. It had polar and nonpolar regions with this long chain molecule. These long molecules in the acidic vinigar solution will want to arrange themselves in the most stable fashion. This would be by having all the polar carboxylic acid and amine groups facing one another or sitting close to one another. The nonpolar alkyl chains will fold or protrude from these \"headgroups\" in such a way as to have the most surface area as possible arranged closely with one anothers nonpolar chains. This is the microscopic effects occurring at the boundary layer with the soap and acid solution. The macroscopic pattern that you see is an emergent effect from as the boundary layers although \"random\" develop stable and unstable regions. This is an effect described in chaos theory as someone had previously stated. It's a REALLY cool thing to check out.\n\nAs for what the right ratio of soap and water do, a SMALL amount of soup. Will break the tight arrangement of all the polar water molecules. This lowers the surface tension because the water molecules can't hang out next to one another. And especially at the surface, those nonpolar regions will display their alkyl chains, making it easier for materials to slip into the water and not be held up by the tight water arrangement. That's why the fruit flies slip into the water so easily.",

    "body": "**Background**  \n\nIn August my favorite shampoo, Hask Argan Oil Repairing Shampoo, got reformulated with ingredients I'm allergic to, so I decided it was high time to try out some AB shampoos.  One of the things I really liked about the Hask shampoo was that it cleansed thoroughly but gently, so I knew I wanted a shampoo that shared some (if not all) of the same surfactants as they can make a huge difference in the harshness of the shampoo.  I also wanted a sulfate/silicone free shampoo that had a few oils like the Hask shampoo as well.  After many nights scouring cosdna for ingredients lists, I settled on Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo.  \n\n**Product Claims/Ingredients**  \n\nMoist Diane's [website](http://www.moist-diane.jp/en/products/extra-damage.html) claims the purpose of this line is to \"restore extremely damaged hair ends and roughness\", as well as repairing hair damage when heat is applied due to the line's unique \"nano repair matrix\".  I don't heat treat my hair, nor is it permed, bleached, etc so I wasn't really drawn in by these claims. \n\nMy main draw was the [ingredients list](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_63e4326873.html):\n\n>Water, **Olefin (C14-16) sodium sulphonate**, **Cocamidopropyl betaine**, **Cocamidomethyl MEA**, Cocoyl glutamic acid TEA, Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, Myristamine oxide, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Gamma-docosalactone, Quaternium-18, Quaternium-33, **Cholesterol**, **Ceramide EOP**, **Ceramide NG**, **Ceramide NP**, **Ceramide AG**, **Ceramide AP**, Propylene glycol, Hydrolyzed keratin, **Argania spinosa kernel oil**, Mango seed oil, Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter, Prune seed extract, Carapa guaianensis seed oil, Sclerocarya birrea seed oil, **Baobab seed oil**, Opuntia Ficus-Indica seed oil, Steardimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin, Pouteria sapota seed oil, Keratin, Isostearoyl hydrolyzed keratin, Alanine, Hydroxyproline, Sodium-PCA, Cetearamidoethyl diethonium hydrolyzed rice protein, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, Hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, **Hydrolyzed hyaluronate**, **Hydrolyzed honey protein**, Malus domestica fruit cell culture extract, Argania spinosa sprout cell extract, Rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract, **Collagen**, Hydrolyzed conchiolin, Bis-ethoxydiglycol cyclohexane 1,4-dicarboxylate, Propanediol, Dipropylene glycol, Butylene glycol, Isomalt, Polyquaternium-10, Isononyl isononanoate, Soybean sterols, Sodium chloride, Xanthan gum, Lecithin, Behentrimonium chloride, Glycerin, Citric acid, **Lactic acid**, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Aroma, Caramel \n\nBold indicates ingredients that my face likes or surfactants that are the same (or very similar) to the Hask shampoo.  Wow.  Five ceramides plus cholesterol, some nice oils (including baobab!!!), and some HA and collagen thrown in?  Yeah.  I like it.  \n\n**Performance**\n\nThis shampoo is a dream.  It lathers richly, which feels great, and it also has a mild fragrance (generic bubble bath scent) that is noticeable while using it but fades very quickly.  It comes in a large pump bottle, which is genius for shampoo and so much easier than fiddling with a squeeze tube.\n\nI have a naturally oily scalp that needs daily washing.  My scalp gets flaky if I use a shampoo that's too harsh, or if it gets super dry in the winter.  I've had no problems with flakiness since starting this shampoo and my scalp overall feels more hydrated and strong.  My hair also feels stronger and is glossier than it has been in a while.  I used to use Hask's argan oil hair mask 2-3x weekly, but I haven't felt the need to do so since starting this shampoo. \n\nI've also used this as a body wash since I ran out a month ago and thought why not share the goodness of this shampoo with all of my body skin. My skin is hydrated and appreciates the extra pampering.  \n\nFor curiosity's sake, I tested the pH with my aquarium drop test kit.  It's a narrow range test kit so it only shows 6.0 to 7.5, with anything below or above those values showing as a 6 or 7.5 respectively.  However, I'm not going to use anything above a 6.5 so it works for my purposes.  Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo comes in at a 6.0 or below, which is awesome so I'm considering testing it on my face because YOLO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI have been using this shampoo daily since September and I will continue using it for my hair and body until they reformulate it or discontinue it. **HG**\n\n**Where to find it**\n\nI bought mine off Amazon prime for $15, although it's no longer available on Prime.  You can also find it and the refill pouches for a similar price on Ebay or Amazon Japan. Edit: and Dokodemo",

If you happen to come across a Japanese product, it's in a pump container, some kind of pinkish liquid, it's all in Japanese, and just your luck - there's zero English on the package. *What could it be?*\n\nHowever, the daunting task of trying to figure out what your Japanese product isn't as daunting as you might think. There actually is *English*.  It's just in Japanese (*sorry, another derpy sounding comment orz*).  Specifically, it's in [Katakana](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Table_katakana.svg/2000px-Table_katakana.svg.png) and the characters look like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Table_katakana.svg/2000px-Table_katakana.svg.png).  For the purposes of this guide, let's just say Katakana is a form of transliteration.\n\nFor example, let's take your two bottles of hair product.  Which one is the conditioner and which one is the shampoo? Most Japanese hair products will either say シャンプー *or* コンディショナー. If you look on the [chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Table_katakana.svg/2000px-Table_katakana.svg.png), that's literally 'shanpū' and 'kondishonā'. Sounds a lot like shampoo and conditioner! The character \"ー\" means to hold the sound out slightly longer. Katakana is literally on every Japanese comsetic/skincare product.  Japanese cosmetic sites use Katakana for brand names, product type, colors, scents, just about everything.  For example, Dolly Wink is ドーリーウインク, pronounced dōrī uinku.\n\nThere are 46 basic Katakana characters. If you spend an afternoon mastering them, you'll make shopping for Japanese products much easier (although you can always use Google translator, who am I kidding, it's the golden technology age xD).  You can readily differentiate Katakana (カタカナ) from Hiragana (かたかな) and Kanji (片仮名) -- that's Katakana written in the 3 different written texts.  Katakana differs from Kanji in that it is simpler, and has less strokes than most Kanji.  Katakana is also more 'boxy' than hiragana.\n\nFor those of you familiar with the Japanese language, you're probably already familiar with Katakana.  Hopefully this will provide some insight to everyone else.  One way to learn the katakana is to dividend them into sets.  If \"a, ka, sa, ta, na\" does not work for you, try \"ka, ki, ku, ke, ko\" instead.  Good luck!\n\nLastly, most people are familiar with [Rakuten](http://global.rakuten.com/en), but if you want to see what's really trending in Japan, you might want to consider [Cosme](http://www.cosme.com), Japan's leading cosmetic retailer/website, with tons of user reviews (albeit it's all in Japanese). They also have their [own shop](https://www.cosme.com/en), but I've never purchased from them.\n\nRunning Cosme through Google Translator is sometimes a pain because half the links don't work.  So, to see selling rankings on Cosme, click on \"売れ筋ランキングへ\".  If you want to see new cosmetics, click on \"新着コスメへ\" (copy paste and then search the page).\n\nHope this was helpful!\n\n************\n\nSome common words:\n\n** all-in-one / オールインワン / ōru in wan\n\n** aloe vera / アロエベラ / aroe bera\n\n** amino collagen / アミノ コラーゲン / amino korāgen\n\n** aqua / アクア / akua\n\n** arbutin / アルブチン / arubuchin\n\n** base / ベース / bēsu\n\n** base makeup / ベースメイク / bēsu meiku\n\n** basic/simple / シンプル / shinpuru (such as basic skincare)\n\n** BB cream / ＢＢクリーム / BB kurīmu\n\n** beauty / ビューティ / byūti\n\n** body / ボディ / bodi\n\n** body scrub / ボディスクラブ / bodi sukurabu\n\n** brand / ブランド / burando\n\n** breast / バスト / basuto\n\n** brush / ブラシ / burashi\n\n** care / ケア / kea\n\n** cleansing cream / クレンジングクリーム / kurenjingu kurīmu\n\n** cleansing gel / クレンジングジェル / kurenjingu jeru\n\n** cleansing milk / クレンジングミルク / kurenjingu miruku\n\n** cleansing oil / クレンジングオイル / kurenjingu oiru\n\n** cream / クリーム / kurīmu\n\n** cream eyeshadow / クリームアイシャドウ / kurīmu ai shadō\n\n** coenzyme Q10 / コエンザイムQ10 / koenzaimu Q10\n\n** concealer / コンシーラー / konshīrā\n\n** conditioner / コンディショナー / kondishonā\n\n** cool / クール / kuuru\n\n** cotton / コットン / kotton\n\n** deoderant / デオドラント / deodoranto\n\n** dimethicone / ジメチコン / jimechikon\n\n** Dolly Wink / ドーリーウインク / dōrī uinku\n\n** drink / ドリンク / dorinku\n\n** essence / エッセンス / essensu\n\n** essence or serum / Kanji: 美容液 (びようえき) / biyōeki\n\n** eye care / アイケア / ai kea\n\n** eye cream / アイクリーム / ai kurīmu\n\n** eye liner / アイライナー / ai rainā\n\n** eyeshadow / アイシャドウ / ai shadō\n\n** film / フィルム / firumu\n\n** foam / フォーム / fōmu\n\n** food / フード / fūdo\n\n** foot / フット / futto\n\n** foot care / フットケア / futto kea\n\n** foundation / ファンデーション / fandēshon\n\n** fragrance / フレグランス / fureguransu\n\n** glycerin / グリセリン / guriserin\n\n** gold / ゴールド / gōrudo\n\n** gommage / ゴマージュ / gomāju\n\n** goods / グッズ / guzzu\n\n** Hada Labo / ハダラボ / hada rabo (Kanji: 肌研）\n\n** hair / ヘア / hea\n\n** hair mask / ヘアマスク / hea masuku\n\n** hair pack / ヘアパック / hea pakku\n\n** hair styling / ヘアスタイリング / hea sutairingu\n\n** hand / ハンド / hando\n\n** hand cream / ハンドクリーム / hando kurīmu\n\n** hyaluronic (acid) / ヒアルロン酸 / hiaruron酸\n\n** ice / アイス / aisu\n\n** item / アイテム / aitemu\n\n** jojoba (oil) / ホホバ油 / hohoba-yu\n\n** kit / キット / kitto\n\n** lemon / レモン / remon\n\n** lemon extract / レモンエキス / remon ekisu\n\n** leg / レッグ / leggu\n\n** liner / ライナー / rainā\n\n** liquid / リキッド / rikiddo\n\n** lip / リップ / rippu\n\n** lip balm / リップクリーム / rippu kurīmu\n\n** lip care / リップケア / rippu kea\n\n** loose powder / ルースパウダー / rūsu paudā\n\n** lotion or emulsion / Kanji: 乳液 (にゅうえき) / nyūeki\n\n** makeup / メイク / meiku\n\n** mascara / マスカラ / masukara\n\n** mask / マスク / masuku\n\n** massage / マッサージ / massāji\n\n** milk / ミルク / miruku\n\n** oil / オイル / oiru\n\n** olive (oil) / オリーブ油 / orību-yu\n\n** oral / オーラル / oraru\n\n** pack / パック / pakku\n\n** paraban / パラベン / paraben\n\n** peeling / ピーリング / pīringu\n\n** phenoxyethanol / フェノキシエタノール/ fenokishietanōru\n\n** point makeup / ポイントメイク / pointo meiku\n\n** powder / パウダー / paudā\n\n** pressed powder / プレストパウダー / puresuto paudā\n\n** puff / パフ / pafu\n\n** remover / リムーバー / rimūbā\n\n** rinse / リンス / rinsu\n\n** rose hip (oil) / ローズヒップ油 / rōzu hippu-yu\n\n** soap / ソープ / sōpu\n\n** serum / セラム / seramu\n\n** set / セット / setto\n\n** shadow / シャドウ / shadō\n\n** shampoo / シャンプー / shanpū\n\n** shape / シェイプ / sheipu\n\n** size / サイズ / saizu\n\n** skincare / スキンケア / sukin kea\n\n** smooth / スムーズ / sumūzu\n\n** sponge / スポンジ / suponji\n\n** stick / スティック / sutikku\n\n** super / スーパー / sūpā\n\n** supplement / サプリメント / sapurimento\n\n** toner (moisturizing or hydrating) / Kanji: 化粧水 (けしょうすい) / keshōsui\n\n** treatment / トリートメント / torītomento\n\n** trial / トライアル / toraiaru\n\n** two-step / ツーステップ / tsū suteppu\n\n** vitamin / ビタミン / bitamin\n\n** wear / ウェア / wea\n\n** white / ホワイト / howaito\n\n** whitening / ホワイトニング / howaitoningu\n\n***** \n\nContributors:\n\n/u/DarlaDimpleAMA, /u/organiccatmilk, /u/TheHeianPrincess, /u/frivolouscentipede",

Thanks for your time and effort!\n\nI just want to add that \"conditioner/コンディショナー\" is a relatively fancy word in Japan. \n\nConditioners are usually called \"rinse/リンス\". Newer shops now label conditioners as \"conditioners\", but many shops still refer to them as \"rinse\".\n\nAnother thing is that certain hair product companies will label their conditioners as \"treatment\". This is pretty common. If you see a lineup of hair products that doesn't have a conditioner, chances are the product labeled as \"treatment\" is actually the conditioner.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

    "body": "Hi, it’s been about 8 months off of accutane and it absolutely changed my life. \n\nI’ve struggled with acne since I turned 15. The stress of school led me to become depressed (causing a bad diet, lack of physical activity, etc) and develop cystic acne. I think it is almost entirely hormonal so I do worry I’ll have to do another round of accutane but for now I’m focusing on taking care of my skin in ways other than acne prevention.\n\nAccutane got rid of most, if not all, of my pustules and cysts. It left behind some scarring that I’m working on right now but it transformed my skin so I’m now able to work with it instead of breaking out. \n\nI wanted to give some encouragement and tips to anyone just starting out, considering accutane, or feeling upset about their acne.\n\nThe first thing, YOU ARE NOT GROSS. You are probably cleaner and more hygienic than the person with the clearest skin in the world. Don’t let your brain trick you, and if it does here is some reassurance.\n\nSecondly, acne is a condition. You are actively struggling with something that affects the body and mental health in ways beyond words. Give yourself some grace, your body needs it. The good news is, acne is able to be treated just as other sicknesses.\n\nThird, moisturizer. You can’t just use your basic everyday moisturizer when on this medication. You need a lot more external substances because your body is unable to produce its own moisture on accutane. Hylaronic acid in the morning and evening saved me. The La Roche posay triple repair cream worked the best for me too. I tried the high end brands and they just didn’t repair my skin. The triple repair cream has niacinimde too so it will gently work on the scars when you apply. I still use it, months later.\n\nFourth, cosmetics are probably doing you more harm than you realize. I assumed that expensive = no breakouts. As much as I despised my friends for using Yuka (I thought the health stuff was annoying), it is so helpful. I found out my skin wasn’t just breaking out because of my stupid hormonal issues, it was the ingredients in my makeup causing reactions and altering my hormones over time because of my sensitivity. Phenoxyethanol is something I am sensitive to as well as talc. Fragrances are not good either. Use things that have pure ingredients, no harmful additives that could break you out or cause an allergic reaction. I recently returned all of my makeup to purchase things that wouldn’t irritate and I noticed a difference almost immediately. During this time I also took Zyrtec. This antihistamine was recommended by my dermatologist for breakouts or daily use for skin irration. This helped so much and will clear up any bumps or blemishes caused by things other than your own body. (I also think it’s recommended to take an antihistamine during the purging stage of accutane, however I didn’t do this so I can’t speak on its effectiveness). \n\nLearn your skin type so you can research products to best help your skin. I found I have dry skin which weirdly leads to my pores being clogged because of abnormal sebum production. I now oil cleanse everyday and my skin has never been more even and hydrated.\n\nHere are my progress photos. The first one was about 3 months into accutane. It took me about 6 months to see results noticeably. The last photo is me today, there’s still work to be done but I’m much happier! \n\nI don’t have a lot of photos of my acne before the photo I pictured. I never left the house without makeup and would do my skincare in the dark so I did not want to photograph it 😭",

I didn't really have a lot of acne to begin with, I mostly had closed comedones, started at 20mg for 7 months, now I'm at 30mg since one month, and it's not gotten better at all. It's only gotten worse. The purge was horrible, I started getting so much acne in comparison to what I had when I started, and my closed comedones haven't budged. Not one has gone down. It feels like I'm doomed. I keep reading people saying hang in there, and it'll be worth it in the end. But it doesn't feel that way. I avoid going outside or meeting people, and my confidence has gone down. I'm at 8 months and I don't see an end in sight. I still have more acne then when I started. I also have a lot of scarring.

Nasaktuhan na nakita kong naka-live yung sa Dermorepubliq kaya napagpasyahan kong tingnan ang kanilang mga product. May isang product na nakatawag pansin sa akin: ang kanilang 1% Retinol Serum. \n\nNapukaw ng product na ito ang aking pansin dahil sa taas ng retinol na nilalaman nito. Mataas ang 1% retinol para sa isang leave-on product, ang rekomendasyon nga lang nito sa E.U. ay nasa 0.3% lang (https://health.ec.europa.eu/publications/revision-scientific-opinion-sccs157616-vitamin-retinol-retinyl-acetate-retinyl-palmitate_en). \n\nKaya sinilip o naman sa listing ng Dermorepubliq 1% Retinol Serum, una kong hinanap ang ingredient list nito. Pero laking gulat ko nung makita ko ang ingredient list nito:\n\nAqua, Isopropyl Myristate, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Niacinamide, Retinyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol, Allantoin\n\nWalang Retinol, imbes, Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalagay. Malinaw na mislabeled ang produktong ito. Hindi ko tuloy maintindihan kung papaano nakalusot sa FDA ito noong nag-apply ito ng cosmetic product notification. 🤦‍♂️\n\nKaya para sa lahat: laging maging mapanuri sa inyong binibiling produkto.

Since I am acne prone, I try to avoid perfume/fragrance, alcohol and essential oils in my products. \n\n*Processing img thx4k3izjnf61...*\n\nI have tried a bunch of sunscreens and these are the **best ones** I have settled on after a long 2 years of trial and error and time/money/effort invested. I have tried to include the swatches of all the four sunscreens and the white cast whereever it was possible (suncros) for the camera to capture. Lets begin.\n\nProduct Name: **Suncros Soft Matte Finish Gel, SPF 50, PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave\n\nAvailability in India: Easily Available in India, offline and online.\n\nIngredient list: Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nSunscreen type: Physical / Mineral \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zgtf9w6knf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0796b78286edcc7126df7421f34ae34c3ae1c7c8\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using this sunscreen since almost one year. I used to use UV Doux before this for as long as I can remember, but had to stop using it as my skin got really sensitive and I had damaged my skin barrier. \n\nYou definitely cannot use the recommended two fingers of sunscreen with this one as it gets really heavy and suffocating. I tried layering it in small amounts (maybe just one fingertip at a time), let that settle and then apply another fingertip. I could only do two fingertips with this one. It did work for my extremely sensitive skin at that time and miraculously it was even calming and healing for my active acne and the PIH post acne was really minimal. The texture is in between a cream and a gel as can be seen in the picture. I totally understand why people detest it so much, the heavy suffocating feeling is a put off. I am not going to lie, it is heavy, feels like a suffocating layer on your face and is uncomfortable but you get used to the feeling once you see that its actually working for your extremely sensitive skin when nothing else does. You have to properly blend it in, take a minute or two to actually spread it on the skin. I have tried to photograph the white cast this one gives immediately post application. but once it settles in 30 minutes or so, the white cast is almost negligible and gives a primer finish (I am NC 43-45 for reference). I don't use makeup so I don't know how it would perform under makeup. The reapplication is difficult. I blot my face a lil before I apply this and again it takes a while to settle which is irritating if you are out and about. I could never reapply this more than once. It is sweat proof, tested it in peak of summer. This is the only zinc oxide based sunscreen that did not dry out my cheeks. \n\nAll said and done, I can't seem to make it work as my stand alone sunscreen as two fingertip amount is just not going to cut it when you are on all sorts of actives. Hence, since I have healed my skin barrier now and can use chemical sunscreens again, I use it over my cheeks (an area where my PIH is the worst) layered over my chemical sunscreen, after it completely dries. It's the perfect sweet spot for me and helps with PIH.\n\nRepurchase Status: Holy Grail (HG). Already repurchased twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Bello Photostable Emugel Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Easily available offline and online.\n\nIngredient list:\n\nKey Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, Ethylhexyltriazone Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyltriazine, Diethyl amino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate.\n\nOther ingredients: Purified water, Dimethicone and Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl phosphate, Ceteth-10 phosphate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Myristyl Myristate, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic Triglyceride, Pentaerythirtyl distearate, Phenyl trimethicone, Vitamin E acetate, Carbomer copolymer, Disodium Edetate, Trolamine, Sodium polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Methyparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr24pvoaknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f726d323339bee404855990ab043e2a3b051acc2\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using it everyday since approximately 4 months. The texture is creamy and you have to work it in for like 2 minutes into the skin. Immediately post-application, the sunscreen feels greasy to touch and looks oily but it gets absorbed into the skin in about 10 minutes and leaves a dewy finish which never goes away. I really like the dewy healthy glow it gives me. I can actually use 2 finger amount of sunscreen and it doesn't leave a white cast on my dark skin tone. If it gets into your eyes, it does sting. I can assume that dry skinned people would loooooove this in the winters. If you are combination or oily, I feel you can completely skip the moisturiser step when using this in summers. Would be perfect for inclusion in a minimal routine in the AM. On reapplication, it does leave a little bit of white cast on the sides of the face where we tend to have the peach-fuzz which will go away with a little bit of rubbing. Overall, this is the best budget sunscreen easily available in India which doesn't make us look like we have dressed up for a meme.\n\nRepurchase Status: HG, WRP. Already repurchased thrice. I will be trying out Photostable Gold SPF 55 in the summer, maybe it will replace this one. If not, I will always come back to this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Biore UV Smooth Kids Milk Spf 50 PA++++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Availability is a serious issue. Used to get it from Dokodemo pre-pandemic.

Where I live is not very humid and that's why I think this one works so well for me. The texture is very aptly described as milk since it feels like a thick emulsion and spreads into nothingness into the skin. I can use the recommended amount of sunscreen with this one and it doesn't leave a white cast at all. It gets absorbed into the skin within 2 minutes and leaves behind a comfortable breathable layer of moisture on your skin. It does not dry down matte. It doesn't irritate my eyes. Its just so perfect for my combination skin even on my oily T-zone in peak summer days.  Reapplication is such a breeze. I have reapplied it in a taxi, in my office, before a meeting without any downtime. I just absolutely love everything about this sunscreen except that I think it has been discontinued and I am crying over the loss of my only true HG sunscreen. If anyone from Biore is reading this, please accept my plea and bring this back into production!!!!!\n\nRepurchase Status: HG forever.

But I never had the courage to put it on my face due to the infamous \"perfume\" in the inci list as I had a compromised barrier and could tolerate only physical sunscreens. All said and done, this has served well as an excellent body sunscreen which doesn't break the bank and provides me excellent protection. It is non-greasy unlike the other body sunscreens on the market. The white cast disappears within 5-10 minutes and you are good to get dressed and head out of the house. I apply it on all the exposed areas of my body - neck, upper shoulders, arms, hands (I don't feel guilty reapplying it even with the frequent hand washing as its relatively affordable + acts as a moisturiser for me) and feet. \n\nHowever for the sake of this review, I mustered all the courage I had to try it on the face but alas it did not suit me and caused me CC's by evening. It spreads well, leaves a white cast on skin which disappears in about 5-10 minutes, although the white residue along the hairline just doesn't disappear. I had to rub it excessively, almost rubbed it out to get it out of my peach fuzz! The finish on this sunscreen is not ultra matte and nor is it dewy to touch, its almost in between which is comfortable for combination and oily skin types. I was worried that this might get drying on my cheeks as the day progressed due to the zinc oxide content but it did not get dried at all. While I was typing the inci list, I realised it has Niacinamide in it!!! Yet another amazing ingredient to be present in this sunscreen. All in all, I would say if you don't have sensitive/sensitized skin and are okay with the \"O\" sunscreen filters, this is an excellent sunscreen.  \n\nRepurchase Status: Might repurchase for body. Not suitable for my face.\n\nThis review took me almost a month to write and photograph, but I am ultimately happy with the final write-up. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this! I have tried to include everything based on the rules of this sub, but still if you have any questions, do hit me up.\n\nI will make another post of the sunscreens which didn't work for me and would include the likes of Cipla Rivela tint sunscreen, Hada Labo UV Perfect Gel, Skin Aqua UV Moisture Gel, Photostable Insta,  Aroma Magic Mineral Sunscreen and The Mom's Co. Mineral Based Sunscreen.",

It didn't even have an official sign on it, just the name and price handwritten in sharpie, so it must be super new. \n\n[Ultra Hydrating Gel Moisturizer with aloe and green tea extract](http://imgur.com/a/q6TViPm) 75ml - $8.99\n\nIt's definitely one of their more expensive cosmetics but based on the ingredients it looks pretty good for the price. Luckily TJs has a great return policy so if I don't like it I can get my money back.\n\n\nFull ingredients list:\n\nWater (aqua), glycerin, saccharide isomerate, propanediol, ammonium acryloxyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, phenoxyethanol, polyamide-5, dimethicone, hydroxyacetophenone, polysilicone-11, squalane, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, laureth-12, ceteryl olivate, glyceryl stearate, ethylhexylglycerin, sorbitan olivate, sunflower seed oil, cetearyl alcohol, lactobacillus ferment, tocopherol, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sodium hyaluronate, milk thistle extract, birch leaf extract, beta-sitosterol, panthenol, squalene, coconut fruit extract, citric acid, green tea leaf extract, sodium citrate.\n\n\nIt doesn't have a fancy smell, in fact it kind of smells like a medicinal cream like tret or hydrocortisone, but the smell dissipates on application. It's a very light gel cream and it sinks in fast. It comes in a frosted plastic jar.\n\nI am patch testing it tonight so I will update when I get to know it a little better. I'm not great at analyzing the more chemically-sounding ingredients, but I can tell that it does silicones and does not have alcohol denat, which is good for me. I was drawn to the buzzword ingredients like squalane, aloe, lactobacillus ferment, hyaluronic acid, green tea, and other extracts. If anyone has any more knowledgeable insight based on the ingredients, I would love to hear it. \n",

Been using these for a couple years). Now I’ve been using the Prequel on my face and body since January and plan on sticking with it. My skin looks and feels incredible. More hydrating than the DDG pads but still leaves that beautiful glow, pores are looking good, and my skin just looks nice and bouncy. AND it hasn’t irritated my rosacea (I also use Tret every other night). And for my body- no reappearance of KP on my legs or backs of arms, no booty acne, no ingrown hairs on my bikini line or underarms, knees and elbows are super soft, all of my skin texture in general is smooth af. And as long as it’s not crazy hot out, I can skip deodorant as long as I pat a bit of it under my arms. It’s light years better than the Ordinary acid\n\nAnd I was thinking about picking up these other two products.

I'm probably not the only one who has a dog that likes to lick lotion off of me.  \nXylitol is extremely toxic to dogs and also NOT usually found in lotion.   \nThe alternative to the lotion is a set of essential oils, which includes an orange oil. My vet advised me that some citrus oils weren't great for dogs, either (and citrus oils are really bad for cats, too). I emailed FFF because both choices suck if you have four legged friends. \nEdit: I will post their reply here if/when they respond.\n\n-----\n\nFrom [Anthropologie's page](https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/mer-sea-co-body-cream):  \n\n> Water, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Sea Whip Extract, Tocopherol, Sea Salt, Maris Limus (Sea Silt), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Dicapryl Succinate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Parfum (Fragrance), Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Phytate, **Xylitol**, Glyceryl Stearate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic Acid, Alcohol (Denatured), Sorbic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzoic Acid, Dehydoacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n-----\nFrom /u/stereofailureohno, on why Xylitol is added: \n\n> Never in a million years would I have expected to see Xylitol in a body lotion!\nOut of curiosity I looked a little more into it, different sites list it as everything from a moisturizer, humectant, thickeners/emulsifiers, to slip agent. Apparently it does have some merit as a skin care ingredient after all?\nAs a dog and cat owner I am very disappointed that I have no 'good' choice out of these items.\n\n\n",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?  You are probably more geared up than most to recommend?  Thanks again.  Bev",

Even when i was  in the flight my skin did not dry out at all ! \n\n\n     ▫️The days i used hydrating serums my skin looked so plump and glowy the next morning,  I couldn't stop admiring it XD \n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔹ARE THERE ANY ALTERNATIVES ?\n\n\n       ▫️ Rosehip oil , followed by any moisturiser and slugging . This provides overnight results.\n\n \n\n      ▫️Rosehip oil pretty much provides the same effect and a small bottle of 30 ml runs a really long way. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔹  COMPARISON BETWEEN MARULA OIL AND ROSE HIP OIL\n\n \n\n\n\n___ |Rosehip oil|Morula oil\n|:-|:-|:-|\nfatty acids*****|more Linoleic acid and less Oleic Acid|more Oleic acid and less Linoleic acid\nantixodiants| |higher in antioxidants\ntexture|lighter / sinks into the skin|thicker / feels heavier\ncomedogenic rating|low|high\nbrightening properties ( scars )|yes|no\nantibacterial properties|yes|no\n\n\n\n 🔸*****\n\n\n\n\n *🔸you have oily or acne-prone skin, you likely have low levels of linoleic acid in your skin and therefore can benefit from a facial oil that’s high in linoleic acid*\n\n\n*🔸As a general rule, if you’re acne-prone or oily, you want an oil that’s high in linoleic acid. Whereas if you have dry skin, an oil that’s high in Oleic acid will help you more*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔹 REPURCHASE STATUS \n\n\n        ▫️ WNRP\n\n\n        ▫️ Its a great moisturiser but rosehip oil provides the same effect , doesnt leave a heavy feeling post application. \n\n\n       ▫️for dry scaly patches i swear by the slugging method",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco.

I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price .

I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

    "body": "To me, price tag doesnt matter. Its whats INSIDE that matters. and i feel like i see a lot of people ignore the ingredients of their skincare and are getting scammed. on both the low dollar tree end and and the high end.\n\nNow i am not one to be scared of anything with a scientific name like Hydrogen oxide or call everything 'Chemicals'. But if a product claims to have a certain ingredient and its the LAST thing on the list under even fragrance and preservatives, i have questions. Or for what ingredients they claim to have they then package improperly like Vitamin C and Retinal in clear bottles.\n\nSome brands at the DT have proven time and time again to just not use enough of an active they claim they have in a product and its just a waste of my $1.25 (im looking at you BOLERO) while others have shockingly good ingredients like skin nutrition botanicals.\n\nAs a long time DT lover, this newer brand BPure is giving me Bolero vibes with some of their products, and thats an insult.... For example the new glow up serums. I took a look at the ingredients and they just dont line up with the claims on the package.\n\nHere are the ingredients for the strawberry one:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PEG/PPG-17/6 COPOLYMER, POLYSORBATE 80, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, CARBOMER, SODIUM ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ISOHEXADEC- ANE, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLHY-DROXAMIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, DISODIUM EDTA. FRAGRANCE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SODIUM HYALURONATE. SALICYLIC ACID, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM. LINALOOL, FRAGARIA ANANASSA (STRAWBERRY) FRUIT EXTRACT, CITRIC ACID, CARMINE (CI 75470)\n\nThis claims to have AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) and just just does not. it has citric acid which is technically an AHA, but its at the end of the list and in that amount is not doing anything. and the strawberry extract can be considered a 'natural aha' but again, thats not the claims and its so low it wont work like an AHA.\n\nHaving most the actives listed under fragrance means its likely under 1%. The Salicylic acid has to be like 1-2% to work. At MOST this serum is hydrating. but a very basic hydration at that. Which isnt bad, but not what it claims at ALL.\n\nBut then there are brands like skin nutrition and their claims on their products and the ingredients are actually shocking. The actives they claim are there in their true form (not like the AHA lie in the last one). They have correct percentages (and often TELL YOU the % for a lot of things). While they might not be the most life changing product, based on formula alone, they weirdly outclass a lot of brands and their claims for $1.25\n\nWhile i enjoy trying all the new products that come out, when i see items like the BPure strawberry smoothing serum, i get frustrated. They clearly can make and sell quality products like skin nutrition. It feels like they have started to pump out poor performing products that probably have a better profit margin since they dont contain very much of the more expensive ingredients and its \"just a $1.25\" so people scoop them all up since its viral.\n\nIs anyone else seeing this with recent launches? And BPure has put out some great products too, but they are so hit or miss with their claims and how they line up with whats in them. Just because i shop at DT doesnt mean i want to over consume. and i know its easy to just try everything, but it adds up. \n\nwhat viral DT beauty products have you noticed like this? what are your thought on this? Do you just trust what the product is claiming? What are your thoughts?\n\n",

        "body": "Buying DT beauty/skincare is  an option for those who enjoy frequently trying new products, love to experiment, and prefer an inexpensive/budget shopping experience. Over the years I have tried some DT products but have left behind most I had initially considered.  Because after checking the ingredient list, I have concluded that many  products simply won’t meet my needs. Fragrance, niacinamide, floral/fruit extracts are a no. Instead I stick to the OG skincare/haircare/cosmetic products that have never disappointed and I know work for my skin.  I just buy these on sale, stack my coupons, use store promotions and CVS ExtraBucks to restock the products I have already learned work best. For example, a bar of Vanicream soap might be as low as $4 after coupons and promotions. A Maybelline mascara might cost $5. That’s the same cost as four DT products at the current 1.25 price point.  Sure, I could buy 4 DT mascaras for that same $5, but they likely won’t be as effective or as consistent as a Maybelline product. However, if I saw my favorite Maybelline mascara at DT I would certainly buy at least two!\n\nWe can choose how to consume and we can all become smarter consumers. If an active ingredient is dead last or very far down the list, there’s a good chance that ingredient has such a low percentage that it will not produce appreciable results.\n\nAn educated DT consumer is a happier consumer. ❤️",

        "body": "I agree with a lot of what you have said. I think that those specific watermelon, strawberry, Avocado, etc. bpure serums are sort of useless and definitely unnecessary. Not Worth even your $1.25. And so I totally agree with that. \n\nI also agree that there are definitely products that don't have amounts of ingredients that are even going to be effective just like you said. That being said, I think a lot of people hear \"Dollar Tree\" and think, there's no way there's anything good in there or anything in an amount that's effective, which just isn't necessarily true at all. And so I'm glad that you also mentioned a couple brands that are doing good things cause I actually think there are several brands that have extremely effective combinations additionally. \n\nOne thing I thought would be important to point out for those who aren't as adept at ingredient list reading, It isn't always just about how high up in the ingredient list the ingredient is. Some things just have to come in very small percentages for the best situation for your skin. People think they want retinol to be the second ingredient, but we don't usually want like a huge percentage of retinol or something else. AND sometimes a large amount of retinol isn't even helpful if it's not actually being delivered into the skin with proper mechanisms. So an amount of retinol or Vitamin C or whatever underneath 1% could still be effective depending on the situation. \n\nThe whole vitamin C thing is super complicated as well because there's different types of vitamin C that require different percentages to be effective. And also it's just a not a very stable ingredient and so there's a lot of confusion there. \n\nHowever, that being said, I don't think we should write off all clear bottles that have what we consider sun sensitive ingredients like retinol. Studies have shown that while some ingredients prone to deteriorating in sunlight, that is specific to sunlight and not just like the light within the store or within the warehouse. And so in actuality, most of the product is not going to be exposed to very much sunlight at all because it would be made in a factory, stored in boxes, transported in boxes. And then stored in the store until you take it home. And then you have to decide where you're going to put it. It probably experiences minimal deterioration in such circumstances. So saying oh the retinol etcetera in this product is completely ineffective because it's in a clear bottle is over-simplistic and negating a lot of the good. \n\nOverall I agree with you but I just wanted to add some of my thoughts.",

I’m currently using the glow recipe watermelon moisturizer dupe which has niacinamide.

I prefer moisturizers with niacinamide when I can find them at DT. To me this moisturizer is meh - the packaging is nice since it’s a glass jar and it’s 2 oz. But it’s a very “wet” texture which I don’t like because then I can’t apply while my face is still damp which is customary for me. It takes a while to dry too. \n\nAs a side note - does anyone know if you can or need to exfoliate while using Adapalene?

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "**Personal info:** 28F. Skin type: dry, sensitive, acne-prone, rosacea. Sensitive to niacinamide. Skin tone: pale af. Climate: hot and humid (SC, USA).\n\n**Product info:** Japanese, SPF 50+ PA+++, free of alcohol, fragrance, essential oils, and niacinamide. Truly a milky texture. Combination sunscreen (meaning both mineral and chemical filters).\n\n**Ingredient list:** Cyclopentasiloxane, Water, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, BG, Diethylhexyl Succinate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Hydrated Silica, Lauryl PEG-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Lauroyl Lysine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Triethoxysilylethyl Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Hexyl Dimethicone, Methylparaben, EDTA-2Na, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Arginine, Bis-Ethylhexyl Hydroxydimethoxy Benzylmalonate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Acrylates Copolymer, CI 73360, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Talc, Ethanol, Iron Oxides, Tin Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Tocopherol, Mica \n\n**My experience with it:** This is the best SPF I've ever tried! I've tried quite a few in my search of the perfect SPF, and nothing has been able to beat this. No white cast on me. I've never experienced pilling or any sort of irritation from it. It wears beautifully under makeup. Easy to blend as it is a truly milky texture. This is truly fragrance free - smells like nothing to me. Natural finish on me but I've read some people have a matte finish with it. I have used this since January of this year (2023). \n\n**Potential con:** I've read some people anecdotally notice getting sun with this product. I haven't noticed this, but I honestly avoid the sun as much as possible. I'd love to hear from those who experience this!\n\n**A true con:** the wimpy size of the bottle. 40 mL is so small! Alas, I'll continue to repurchase. The price is affordable for me (\\~$11 a bottle).\n\n**Another SPF I also love:** Canmake Mermaid Skin UV Gel SPF 50+ PA++++.",

I do suspect the spf isn’t great and that it would take 3-4 hefty layers to actually achieve SPF50.

There are a few serious YouTuber’s (one who is a derm in Houston) who breaks the ingredients down during her vids and is sensitive to those with sensitivities (ex- niacinmide). Her name is Dr.Dray. I recommend giving a listen. She also covers many Asian products both chemical, mineral & hybrid. She also puts links( to sites and stores and is not compensated).

Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

I hope that this honest review of the product will help you to decide whether or not you think this product will work well for yourself.\n\n# Product Itself (Before Trying)\n\n**At a Glance (before opening)**:\n\n* Product size is 11.5 oz. / 326 g.\n* Product states that it is formulated with no parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, or petrolatum.\n* Product states that it is not tested on animals, is cruelty free, is ethically traded/sustainably sourced, comes from a certified corporation, is family founded, and is created with fair trade shea butter.\n   * [What does \"fair trade\" mean?](https://www.greenerchoices.org/fair-trade-certified/)\n* Product states that it is manufactured in the USA using globally-sourced ingredients.\n* Product jar itself is made from 35% recycled plastic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Description on Container**: \"Our Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Whipped Curl Cream provides definition with a soft, flexible hold.  Formulated with Manuka Honey, Yogurt, and Fair Trade Shea Butter, this lightweight curl cream also hydrates and helps strengthen hair to reduce breakage while styling.  Experience significantly less breakage when used as the fifth and last step in the Hydrate + Repair regimen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Directions For Use on Container**: \"After generously spraying hair with the MANUKA HONEY & YOGURT HYDRATE + REPAIR MULTI-ACTION LEAVE-IN, apply to clean, damp hair and work through.  Style as desired and air dry or diffuse to finish your look.  This is the ultimate finish to the Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair regimen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients as Listed on Container**: \"Water (Eau), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin (Vegetable), VP/VA Copolymer, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Carbomer, Honey (Miel), Yogurt Extract, Yogurt Powder, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, Trichilia Emetica (Mafura) Seed Butter, Inulin (Chicory Root), Sorbitan Olivate, Sodium Hydroxide, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Sodium Phylate, Triethyl Citrate, Caprylyl Glycol, Benzoic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance (Parfum)\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredient Breakdown (with the help of the \"Is it CG?\" Engine):**\n\n1. Product contains two humectants: Glycerin (Vegetable) and Honey (Miel).\n   1. *Humectants absorb moisture and help balance dry and damaged hair, but humectants also pull moisture from the environment too.  It is advised to use humectants with caution if you live in environments are hot and dry.*\n2. Product contains two oils:  Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil and  Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter.\n   1. *Oils are good at coating hair strands in order to seal moisture, but should be used with caution as they may build up over time (especially if you cowash).  It is advised to use a clarifying shampoo occasionally (about ever 2 weeks) to remove buildup that oils may cause.*\n3. Product contains a conditioning agent: Caprylyl Glycol.\n   1. *In this case, this conditioning agent is working as a film-forming ingredient over the hair.  Conditioning agents are water soluble but have potential to build up over time (can clean with clarifying shampoo, see note in oils for more info).*\n4. Product contains a moisturizing alcohol: Cetearyl Alcohol.\n   1. *Alcohols are generally added to hair products to improve their ability to penetrate hair.  This alcohol is considered a moisturizing alcohol, so it will not dry hair.*\n5. Product contains three botanical ingredients: Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, and Trichilia Emetica (Mafura) Seed Butter.\n   1. *Botanical ingredients are ingredients that are derived from plants.  Botanical ingredients generally help with cleansing, stimulating, nourishing, refreshing, soothing, moisturizing, normalizing, and deodorizing.*\n6. Product contains two preservatives: Benzoic Acid and Phenoxyethanol.\n   1. *Preservatives prevent growth of bacteria and micro-organisms in your product.*\n7. Product has fragrance.\n   1. *Fragrance is generally okay to use on hair.  People with scalp sensitivities or allergies to fragrance should avoid fragrance in products.*\n8. Product *may* contain a protein, but this would be a light protein if so: Yogurt Extract and Yogurt Powder.\n   1. *I am honestly not sure if this is a protein, but when looking up online, some sources do say that yogurt contains protein.  If this is a protein, it is likely a very weak form of protein that would not impact your hair too much (honestly, it would still probably be less protein than the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie, which contains silk protein).*\n\nHere is the full breakdown using the [\"is it CG?\"](http://www.isitcg.com/view/TZFBb9swDIX_CuHDYGMOeu8t8dJ1hyBGUqQY0AttszFRWTRoaYs27L-PyrKiN9N6j_z4-LvwxX1xHAlhJ7yEqAQ79PEN4VE8JfgE3-UcNcBL8ZgGxUDwGQ40Iys8jzzPNEAT1UGjhNNLUdQFW8dnEyqUW4xVDQ0FQk0O1q6XUVwNX13qSdlDeaIzBewcme7U3p3W0MgsLk2kNeydcW2jyoz2Ue4d_6AKHjRygD1bnwP37ONinmmKnhcoG1yCaAVHMrCr5n16thtWDZsYksoyk05xghb1jRnKHEKV34zcmFE7uUL8y6HcMTljvKWxvQTFPrzXrfwcsm09oF_EM8IXPnPAYNgblA67j0hPyv3IzlTbiQL3Jtrha1Sbf-X-D_HNR5dDakbuRRMcRIIxHEU76-0tn9tGRxnYVskXkgsPtmNLPiBpCqNysOifyIBXA6_CqrP13U2bxmyxED1O12xundoxuWttqBSsgIatQU6vwdluaX_yEfMxN-R_Cfew7nmwwSN5uSQzoc-vD4pnRd8TlJb0a5yq4s9f) engine.  I recommend using this engine even if you do not use the CG method because it lets you see what ingredients do what to your hair.  \n\n**Overall Impression Based on These Factors:**\n\nThis is my impression BEFORE trying the product.  Overall, this product sounds like a great replacement for those who are looking for a lightweight, protein-free (at least, from my analysis) curl cream.  I think this product would be a great alternative for those who liked the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie but didn’t like the protein and weight that the Curl Smoothie had.  This product does have glycerin in it, which I know some hair types are sensitive to, so that could be a turn off for some people.  This product has a lot of moisturizing ingredients in it, so it will probably benefit those seeking moisture for their hair the most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Information About the Hair this Product is Tested on (My Hair)\n\n**Curl type**: 3A \n\n**Porosity**: Medium-High \n\n**Width**: Fine \n\n**Length**: Somewhere between 12-24 inches \n\n**Density**: lower-normal \n\n**Damage**: I may have a little protein damage on my hair (may have overdid it with a rice wash), but other than that it is mostly healthy.  Last cut was a little over 3 weeks ago.  Last clarify wash was a week ago.  I generally have halo frizz around my scalp area which I am currently combatting with the upside-down shower method.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Other Products Used with this Product and Application Methods Used\n\n**Note**: All products are CG approved.  These are all the products I used on the day I tried this product.  I wash my hair every other day.\n\n**Pre-Treatment**: dampen hair, detangle with a little bit of the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt conditioner, scrunch out some wetness, apply overnight oil (sweet almond oil, olive oil, rosemary oil, tea tree oil mixture) and sleep with a processing cap on.\n\n**Shampoo**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Shampoo\n\n**Conditioner**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Conditioner\n\n**Deep Conditioner**: Raw Sugar Healing Power Hair Masque with Avocado Oil + Banana + Coconut Milk + Agave\n\n**Leave-in**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Multi-Action Leave-in\n\n**Curl Cream**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Whipped Curl Cream (this product)\n\n**Gel**: Kinky Curly Original Curling Custard\n\n**Cast-breaker**: Shea Moisture 100% Argan Oil\n\n**Tools**: WetBrush Wet Brush, Microfiber head wraps (I use them as towels to scrunch), Xtava Black Orchid Diffuser, InfinityPro by Con Air Drier, my hands (for scrunching)\n\n**Method**: Wet hair while leaning forward (back of head facing ceiling and hair pointing down).  Shampoo roots while leaving forward and use praying hands to run shampoo over the rest of the hair.  Rinse leaning forward.  Apply conditioner leaning forward and use a wet brush to distribute in product, squish to condish while leaning forward.  Let sit for 2-4 minutes.  Rinse while leaning forward.  Apply deep conditioner while leaning forward and use a wet brush to distribute product.  Let sit for 8-15 minutes.  Squish to condish and leave a little in hair when finishing.  While leaning forward, apply leave-in and curl cream by using praying hands and then scrunching upwards.  Scrunch some of the moisture out of hair with a microfiber cloth, then praying hands + scrunch in gel.  Diffuse with Xtava’s Black Orchid diffuser on low heat low (\"cool\") speed, let hair sit for a couple minutes and scrunch out the cast with Shea Moisture’s 100% Pure Argan Oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# First Impressions After Opening Product\n\nThe smell of the product is quite nice and very low-key.  It smells like the rest of this line if you have ever tried it.  The consistency is almost like lotion (if you have ever used Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion, think of that texture/look/consistency).  On a side note, the safety seal was INSANE to take off, so you’ll *definitely* know if someone tampered with your product.  When compared to the curl smoothie, the curl smoothie is a lot more “coagulated” (idk how else really to describe it) versus this product, so this whipped curl cream definitely gives the appearance of being lighter than the curl smoothie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Thoughts During Application\n\nI applied this product while upside down (leaning forward so that the back of my head faced the ceiling and my hair pointed downward) and with near soaking wet hair by running a small amount on my hands down the top of my head first (not raking in).  After that, I applied a little more to my hands and used prayer hands to apply it down the length of my hair.  Something interesting I noticed while doing this was that the cream seemed to soak in immediately, like, in literal seconds.  At first I thought I wasn't using enough product, but as I continued using prayer hands around my hair I noticed that the product melted in all around my head.  When I scrunched after using praying hands, I noticed that the curls seemed quite defined (I had a little wet frizz, but this is nothing out of the ordinary for me).  The smell was very pleasant and didn't bother me at all during the application.  Something else I noticed was that this product didn't provide the same \"slip,\" or slippery feeling, that the curl smoothie did.  This may be because it wasn't as heavy as the curl smoothie, but it did leave my hair with its normal, slightly rougher texture that I normally feel (it felt like how wet hair feels without any product added).  I kind of actually liked this, since to me that was proof that it wasn't going to weigh my hair down and didn't create a film over the hair that brought it down, but I could still tell it was working because of how well my hair was holding a curl while wet.  Overall, I probably used a little over a quarter's worth (maybe a half-dollar coin's worth) of product, which for me is more than I'd use for the curl smoothie but less than I thought I'd have to use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Results\n\n**Before Scrunching:** As I am sitting here letting my hair settle after diffusing, I am looking at my hair and noticing the amount of volume it has now before breaking the cast that I do not normally get.\n\n**After Scrunching:** Holy volume Batman!  So after scrunching, I noticed that my curls definitely look softer than they normally do with the curl smoothie.  I'm not sure if that is a good thing or bad thing at the moment, so I'll have to see how my hair holds up for the rest of the day.  The cast I had wasn't entirely crunchy, so I may not have diffused for long enough which could also be the culprit, but unknown.  My hair smells sooooo good but is not overwhelming, which is nice.  My hair also feels a lot softer after having scrunched, so it looks like the cream doesn't turn your hair super rough.  [Here is what my hair looked like after I scrunched it (not my closet, sorry for the clutter in the background).](https://imgur.com/a/T08BGx3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Final Verdict\n\n**Disclaimer**: I am only one person, and this is only one product review.  As such, this review is based on my experience with the product and may differ (for better or worse) with other experiences or your own experience.  I hope that this honest review of the product will help you to decide whether or not you think this product will work well for yourself.\n\nMaybe it is still too soon to tell, but I really, *really* like this cream after this first wash.  It didn't make my finer hair feel weighed down after a shower, and I didn't have to be super careful to not overdo it during application like I normally have to do for the curl smoothie.  My hair feels softer and less \"wet\" than it normally does after I scrunch the crunch, which may be due to my gel or this curl cream, but either way I'm liking it.  Now that my hair is crunched, it feels extremely bouncy (like, I'm bouncing in the mirror just to see how it bounces) and lightweight.  I don't know how it will hold up in the elements, since I haven't gone outside, but for now it looks great.\n\nConsidering the price for the amount of product, it seems like a pretty good deal.  The Whipped Curl Cream's container is 11.5 oz (interestingly enough, the curl smoothie is 12 oz, so it looks like someone at Shea Moisture wanted to be funny).  I bought the tub for $12, so it looks like that is nearly a dollar per ounce, which I consider to be good for the price.  I didn't have to use a ton of product to get the result I did, so I anticipate this tub lasting me at least 6 months if not longer.  \n\nThe smell and consistency were great in my opinion.  The product didn't feel \"goopy\" like the curl smoothie and essentially melted into my hair, which I was totally not expecting.  This is probably due to the \"whipped\" nature of the product, as products marketed as \"whipped\" tend to be lighter and absorbed easily.  The smell was not overpowering, and I actually kind of preferred it over the curl smoothie to be honest (after a while, the curl smoothie begins to smell like over scented baby-powder/diapers to me).\n\nOverall, I think this product is *definitely* worth checking out if you are looking for a lightweight curl cream, have used the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie but feel weighed down by it, or are looking for a curl cream for finer hair.  The price is good, the product looks good, and I am very happy with the results.  \n\nI hope this review may have helped some of you curlies out there!  Good luck on your curl journey :)\n\n# After a Week Update\n\nGood morning y’all!  So it’s been a week since I bought this product and I’ve had some time to see how it performs with my hair.  I’ll start by saying I think that it’s done well for my hair in that it is so lightweight, but sometimes I still find it hard to style my hair without that “coating” the curl smoothie gave me.  I have noticed that I’ve had a bit more wet frizz than normal, which I had a really bad buildup episode so it could be that or this cream, but I’m really not sure.  I’ve still also noticed that my hair seems to become a bit more frizzy when I scrunch the crunch, but I have a funny feeling that that’s due to the new gel I tried and not this cream, but it could be.  Here is a pros and cons list of what I’ve noticed over the past couple days:\n\n**Pros:**\n1. Product is very light weight and clearly does not weigh down my hair.\n2. Product forms wet curls well when scrunched in (but may need a strong-hold gel after to keep them).\n3. Product smells great (I prefer it way more than the curl smoothie).\n4. Price point for product is very affordable.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. Product may not be able to support certain curl types without more hold (I have 3a hair, may work better for wavier hair but this could also be a gel problem).\n2. You will need to use more product than expected to get results.\n3. Product may contribute to wet frizz (my hair had a ton of buildup so this may have contributed too)\n4. This is not a curl cream that you can probably add in and then walk out for the day, it will most likely require a gel to help the hold.\n\nOverall, I’d rate it 7.5/10.  It’s worked really well for my hair, and this rating could go up when I try swapping my strong-hold gel back into my routine and see if it was the cream or the gel that isn’t holding my hair.  The product makes my hair so soft once my routine is done and doesn’t weigh my finer width hair down, but I do have to use more product than I normally did with the SM CS.  I’m definitely going to use up the rest of this jar, and I still highly recommend this to people who are looking for a lightweight curl cream to try.  Unfortunately, there is no sample size containers out there and I did email Shea Moisture asking about samples, but they essentially told me to take a hike so that was a no.  Regardless, if you are able to get your hands on this product, I think it is definitely worth a try!",

        "body": "Thank you so much for your extremely thorough original post, and for the update. Your hair looks great!\n\nI have somewhat similar hair, have been experimenting with products for a while, and have yet to find any holy grail products. Reviews like this help a lot!\n\nI used to have such a simple hair routine, several years ago. I’d occasionally shampoo with T-Gel for scalp issues, but would normally cowash with a conditioner (not CG) and use a little of the same stuff as a leave in, then scrunch with a T-shirt and air dry. Depending on how badly I needed a haircut, I wouldn’t need any styling product until refreshing, and my hair would have good clumpy ringlets up front and a good wave in the back on my short-ish style. But then my perfect conditioner was discontinued. My hair has never looked as good with so little effort since. \n\nIt’s improved a lot since this round with CG, mostly due to this sub. My curls can get curlier and the waves in the back are sometimes curls, but my hair seems really sensitive to both protein and humidity. I’m in the Pacific Northwest, so we can get a lot of humidity! I’m also sensitive or allergic to a ton of scents used in hair products, so that limits what I can try. \n\nSorry to rant all over your wonderful product review. You’ve actually helped with some of my curly hair frustrations because I think I’m going to try this curl cream.",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( .

I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise!

I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation.

I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

    "body": "So I always thought that ferments were a \"Asian skin care\" thing. But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit? What do they do for YOUR skin? Your fav AB fermented products or ones you are wanting to try?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are some of the leave-on skin care from [Sephora's \"Best Selling\" skin

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

I have been wanting to do this comparison since the minimalist released its peel, and I finally got the chance to that. I have uploaded a video and images for the comparison but I'll first start with the review.\n\nReview\n\n* *Your skin type-* Sahara desert dry skin\n* *Your current climatic conditions-* Hot af\n* *Your current AM/PM routine-*  \n**AM**\\- Nothing, I only apply sunscreen if have to go out  \n**PM**\\- Ponds cold cream (for my double cleanse), cleanser (Neutrogena hydro boost cleanser), tret (twice a week), ordinary peeling solution (once a month), innisfree jeju volcanic mask (once a month), moisturizer (I have like 4-5 moisturizers that I use)\n* *Your age- 22*\n\n**The Ordinary AHA BHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* More than a year\n* *Ingredient List-* Glycolic Acid, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Daucus Carota Sativa Extract, Propanediol, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Salicylic Acid, Potassium Citrate, Lactic Acid, Tartaric Acid, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Xanthan gum, Polysorbate 20, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n* *Holy Grail but Will Not Repurchase-* I fucking love it, it made my skin so smooth and my complexion brighter. I never had any skin problems before as such, but it just made everything better. I never experienced any sort of purging or irritation with this peel. Although, I will not be repurchasing it because I paid ₹1200 for this even though it lasted more than a year. The availability is an issue too.\n\n**Minimalist AHA BHA PHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* 2 times\n* *Ingredient List-* Aloe Vera Juice, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Gluconolactone, Mandelic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lecithin\n* *Holy Grail but Will Repurchase-* I loved it in the very first go, I saw immediate results much like the ordinary. I did not experience any sort of irritation or purging with this either. I honestly don't have much to say because the results are pretty much identical for both.\n\nComparison\n\n**Texture**\n\nAs you can see in the video below, apart from the colour difference the minimalist one a bit flowier than the ordinary. Also, I like the shape of the dropper of the minimalist one, it's pointy rather than the round tip and it looks classier ( at least to my eyes). That is really it when it comes to the texture and the feel of the products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/mobbuo/video/dxwg1bxpdes61/player\n\n**Application**\n\n*note- i forgot to take my before pics, pls forgive a newbie 😔😔😔*\n\nI did a half-n-half application of the peels. The immediate thing I noticed was the way they applied, ordinary being thicker is slightly easier to spread because it doesn't drip as much as the minimalist.\n\nAlso, idk what it is about minimalist peel but I had to apply it a tad bit more than its counterpart.\n\nThird, minimalist did not burn AT ALL while the ordinary always burns a little, even after a year of consistent use.\n\nIn the images below you can see my skin right after the application of the peels, the results are very much the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2kdr544sdes61.jpg?width=3464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8425c82498afb958897ee5482979129fdc1c07d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In Conclusion-** I like both, I don't have a preference for one over the other when it comes to the results. The only thing is that minimalist is cheaper and easily available, so I will go for that one instead of the ordinary.",

Easy to spread texture for a natural, hydrated, shine-free finish leaving no white cast.\n\n*Fragrance free • Non-comedogenic • 50ml*  \nPrice- $499  \n \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n**Uvinul A Plus**\n\nThis Modern filter excels in protecting your skin from free radical and skin damage. Its Photostable nature provides continuous defence against the sun, while its excellent safety profile makes it perfect for all skin types, including the most sensitive. In the formula it not only promises potent UVA protection but also enhances the formula for broad-spectrum protection.\n\n**Tinosorb M**\n\nTinosorb M is an UV filter that revolutionises sun protection with its broad-spectrum coverage against both UVA and UVB rays, also provides even protection into visible (blue) light, Its dual-action mechanism not only absorbs but also scatters sunlight, offering unparalleled defence against the sun's harmful effects. Renowned for its photostability, it ensures long-lasting protection, maintaining its efficacy even under direct sunlight.\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate**\n\nIt stands out as a UVB filter that effectively shields your skin from the sun rays. It's popular for its ability to prevent sunburn and protect against UV-induced damage. This UV filter is prized for its lightweight feel making daily application enjoyable without the greasiness.\n\nWater/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Ethoxydiglycol, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Diisopropyl Adipate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Isododecane, Pentylene Glycol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Acrylates/Polytrimethylsiloxymethacrylate Copolymer, Decyl Glucoside, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propylene Glycol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Xanthan Gum  \n\n\n**Review**  \nSkin Type: Combination (Oily in T-zone), acne-prone, currently a bit dry due to acne medication  \nWeather: Pleasant, not hot enough to test sweat resistance  \nAge 25-30  \nTexture: Super watery in texture, close to the new Neutrogena Dry-Touch sunscreen.  \nApplication: for my skin, it blended easily, like a dream.  \nWhite Cast: My face is slightly darker than NC42 and most sunscreens leave a white cast including Minimalist SPF50. This left no white cast at all, I was pleasantly surprised.  \nWent out in the sun for an hour, no stinging/burning/tanning observed but that is too soon to judge.\n\nOverall: After application, it forms a slightly tight film which gives a glow to the face. I had slight barrier damage on my chin, it did not sting when I applied the sunscreen there but pilled after a while only in that area. I usually get sweaty on my nose post sunscreen application but that did not happen, it might be due to the pleasant weather. My skin feels slightly stretchy right now and lightly oily on my forehead  \nAM Routine today: Simple Moisturizing face wash-->.Cosrx propolis synergy toner-->Cosrx Vitamin C 23%-->Simple hydrating light moisturizer-->wait 5 minutes then sunscreen\n\n  \n**TL;DR**: I think I will repurchase this, it has great lab and human testing results, the texture and application seems great for summers for my skin and this is the first sunscreen which truly has no white cast for me. The last sunscreen to do this was Aqualogica which tanned me. (I don't mind tanning but it proved that it did not protect my skin). \n\nObviously YMMV but I hope this works for you. Feel free to ask any questions.",

    "body": "\nHey all! 👋🏻I want to review hair growth serum from minimalist-\n\nSo i have straight fine hair(little below shoulder length)(30s/F), oily scalp. \n\nI have been suffering from hair loss for past two years. I haven't checked with my derm. I have lost some hair (in patches) because of my tight hairstyle. Then came humidity season and my hair were everywhere. Before taking an appointment I decided to try hair serum. I started on 29th june. \n\n\n29/6: Started with serum. First application was hassle free. No burning or warming of the scalp. I used 4 drops front of scalp(problem area) and 4 drops back of my head, everyday, in the AM(as i take shower in the PM). Rubbed into my fingers and then Massaged only on my scalp and not on length. It was non greasy.\n\n\n01/07: In just two days I started to feel my hair fall is less, like 3-4 strands in my comb. I thought its a placebo effect.\n\n\nI continued it for two weeks straight, every day and my hair fall reduced by 20%. I stopped the application on 14/7 for two weeks as i was traveling and wanted to see if hairfall return and to my luck it Did. But it wasn't alot. I think some people miss understand that after stopping hairfall doubles but it's just the same amount you used to get(at least for me)\nI restarted again and still using it and now i can say I definitely see hair looks bit thicker, have seen baby hair growth especially at the hairline and hair fall has reduced to 80%. \n\nI will keep using it as it dint have any side effects except one stubborn cc which always occurs on my forehead if apply regularly. Thus i now use it 4-5 times a week(depends on which day i ll shampoo and workout)\n\nIts non greasy if applied less but if you directly use the dropper on scalp you might end up using alot and it will give oily look. My scalp normally gets oily on 3rd day but with everyday application of serum hair looks oily on 2nd day. \n\n\nPROS: 1. It works.\n2. New hair growth. \n3. Hair seem thicker.\n4. Less hairfall.\n\n\nCONS: 1.Everyday application is a task for long hair and oily scalp as you need to shampoo.\n2. Give cc on forehead with regular use.\n3. Don't think its a permanent cure.\n4. Expensive.\n\nInci:\nButylene Glycol, Aqua, Dextran, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Trifolium Pratense (Clover) Flower Extract, Propanediol, Arginine, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Gluconolactone, Calcium Gluconate, Glycerin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Apigenin, Oleanolic Acid, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Sprout Extract, Isomalt, Sodium Metabisulfite, Larix Europaea Wood Extract, Glycine, Zinc Chloride, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sanguisorba Officinalis Root Extract, Serenoa Serrulata (Saw Palmetto) Fruit Extract, Capryloyl Glycine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Lactic Acid\n\n\nTL:DR- True to its claims, will repurchase it!\n------------------------------",

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.** \\[**BEPLAIN\\] Cicaful Ampoule - 4.34/5 (3,174 Reviews)**\n\n30ml/29,000 KRW\n\nCentella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyalutonate, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacilius/Rice Ferment, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Xantham Gum, 1,2 Hexanediol, Ethyhexylglycerin.\n\n*The few reviews I have read for this say that it absorbs fast, is pretty soothing, and some people state that it really helped their acne. The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing. A little bit on the heavier side so oily skin may not like it, but all the dry skinned people seemed to really, really love this. It's cheap, very hydrating, absorbs well. However, a few oily people said it takes a little bit to sink in for them.*\n\n[BIG](https://preview.redd.it/d2pcet1rc8731.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4fac533d2f3f52e206e338e85a10c33fc69df5)\n\nB I G\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. \\[Manyo Factory (Witch Factory)\\] Bifida Complex Ampoule - 4.21/5 (5,368 Reviews)**\n\n50ml/35,000 KRW\n\nBifida Ferment Lysate, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Fruit Ferment Filtrate, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Glycerin, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Caffeine, Hydrolyzed Algin, Red Ginseng Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Methyl Gluceth-20, Epigallocatechin Gallate.\n\n*This is a very popular product. This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things. Director Pi says ferments provide very, very gentle form of exfoliation.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chi00fdvc8731.png?width=470&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a191ba338f59eaa0c66ece19e1e3b5311c87dfa\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. \\[SCINIC\\] First Treatment Essence - 4.16/5 (5,282 Reviews)**\n\n150ml/19,800 KRW\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Adenosine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Water, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rubus Coreanus Fruit Extract, Sea Water, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b08iueb0d8731.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=163f45d2760c17dfc195db29d3e667246a7c272c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. \\[TORRIDEN\\] Dive-in Serum - 4.42/5 (1,127 Reviews)**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Betaine, Propanediol, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Beta-Glucan, Malachite Extract, Cholesterol, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Xantham Gum, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract.\n\n*This looks like Hada Labo lotions tbh. :o Except with more skin soothing things like panthenol, witch hazel, madecassoside, allantoin and such.

    "body": "Cleansing balms\n\nUPDATE 8/20/20: I’m adding a new balm I’ve recently tried (at the bottom of the list). If anyone has tried balms that you’d like to review in the format used, please post them below!!!\n\nOk, I’ve been (still am) on a mission to try and review all of the best/most popular cleansing balms in an effort to find the very very best one. I’ve tried nearly all of the most popular ones now. I searched everywhere for a comprehensive review of all of these and couldn’t find much so I’m hoping this will be a helpful resource to others who might be looking too. I welcome any input!!\n\nBackstory:\nI had been using The Body Shop’s Camomile balm since way before cleansing balms went mainstream, for probably a decade at least. I never knew there were other options until I was given a sample of Farmacy Green Clean and that’s what started me down this path - I wanted to see what the best option truly is! I liked my Camomile but could there be a better balm out there waiting for me??!\n\nAs always, YMMV but below are my results! All prices are in Canadian dollars and I have not researched pricing or availability in other countries.\n\nAs for what I actually use it for - I don’t wear a full face of makeup every single day but I do always wear a tinted sunscreen and mascara at a minimum, usually with a light powder foundation, blush and brow gel as well. I’ve tried every balm below on little to no makeup up to a full face of special occasion makeup.\n\nA note about ingredients - I’ve copied ingredient lists below from the brands websites. It was important to me to evaluate which ones have polyethylene (plastic) as well as essential oils.\n\nI would LOVE to hear your thoughts on those below or any other options I haven’t tried yet!\n\n**TL;DR FINAL VERDICT**: for a really good clean and soft face, Drunk Elephant’s Slaii is probably the best value in terms of value, packaging, ingredients, etc. I think this will continue to be my go to in the super dry winter months (especially since I tend to wear a bit thicker makeup in the winter), but to be honest, I think I will probably continue use my trusty Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Butter in the summers.\n\n**The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter**\n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $17 CAD @ The Body Shop reg price (but it’s often on sale).   \nPrice per oz: $5.67/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a wide and flat metal tin that is perfect for storing bobby pins or things in after (no plastic packaging, yay!). I have had a few times over the years where the threads get misaligned and stuck if it was tightened wrong and have needed to use a knife or screwdriver to pry it open again.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it stays a little solid as you rub it into your skin. I wouldn’t say it emulsifies 100% to an oil but it feels great on the face and it’s super spreadable once warmed up. Doesn’t feel greasy/oily, more creamy.    \nScent: Very neutral scent, I don’t believe there are any added scents, essential oils or fragrances.    \nOn the Eyes: It doesn’t sting the eyes at all, but sometimes there’s a light film, if so I just blink a few times and it goes away.    \nAmount Required: A very small amount is required for my whole face (probably about 1/2 tsp max) and one tin easily lasts me a few months.    \nIngredients: No plastic to be found here! I also love that the ingredient list is short and sweet.    \nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Citric Acid.    \n\nVERDICT: I’ve loved this forever and to be honest, now that I’ve tried some others I’m not totally sure if the grass is actually greener on the other side. Still a top contender for me and the price is amazing! I do wonder though if my skin feels a just a tiny bit less moisturized after using this (compared to some of the others below)...\n\n**Farmacy Green Clean** \n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $45 CAD @ Sephora Canada.   \nPrice per oz: $15/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes, but the plastic tray it is stored in is very flimsy (sits in top of the tub).    \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it melts easily and emulsifies quickly to rub around your face. Not greasy/oily.    \nScent: Light citrusy scent (almost like a lime sherbert or something) that smells so good I just want it all over my face all the time.    \nOn the Eyes: I do find it causes quite a bit of a film if I use it on the eyes (something I’d never really experienced before with the Camomile balm), no stinging unless it gets directly in the eyes. Makeup dissolves easily with minimal rubbing or tugging.    \nAmount Required: A small amount is required.    \nIngredients: While they say it’s not “microbeads” and that it melts in water, this product does contain polyethylene aka plastic. Take that for what you will. This product does have quite a bit of essential oils and extracts.    \n\nCetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid.   \n\n\nVERDICT: I like it, I love it, I want some more of it. It smells amazing and feels luxurious on the face. Even though a little goes a long way, I do have a hard time justifying spending that much money on a first cleanser (and I don’t love that it contains polyethylene and a lot of essential oils).\n\n**Physicians Formula The Perfect Matcha 3-in-1 Melting Cleansing Balm**\n\nSize: 41mL (1.4oz).  \nPrice: $15 CAD @ Shoppers Drug Mart (also find at Walmart, Superstore etc).   \nPrice per oz: $10.71/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top and an internal insert underneath. The insert holds the very tiny spatula.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes but it’s tiny, about the size of a safety pin.   \nTexture & Emulsion: It melts but it’s not overly emollient and isn’t as spreadable as others I’ve tried.    \nScent: Sort of a light essential oily/green tea/citrus scent. Some say it smells like Green Clean but I completely disagree and it’s nowhere near as nice of a smell.    \nOn the Eyes: A bit of eye stinging and a definite film was to be had.    \nAmount Required: Larger amount required to effectively remove makeup/sunscreen of any I’ve tried to date.    \nIngredients: Looks like we have that ever present plastic again (polyethylene) as well as fragrance, food colouring and citrus essential oils. Sad face.    \nCETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SORBETH-30 TETRAOLEATE, PEG-5 GLYCERYL TRIISOSTEARATE, PEG-10 ISOSTEARATE, POLYETHYLENE, FRAGRANCE/PARFUM, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF POWDER*, PHYLLOSTACHYS EDULIS SHOOT WATER**, NELUMBO NUCIFERA FLOWER EXTRACT***, CITRUS NOBILIS (MANDARIN ORANGE) PEEL OIL, WATER/EAU, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBITAN SESQUIOLEATE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 OLEATE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, LACTIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, MALTODEXTRIN, YELLOW 5 (CI 19140), BLUE 1 (CI 42090). *MATCHA, **BAMBOO, ***LOTUS\n\nVERDICT: It’s a no from me, dawg. I couldn’t wait to finish this (relatively small) tub so I could try the next product. Having heard so many claims that it’s a perfect dupe for Green Clean, I was VERY disappointed. IMO they are nothing alike other than the colour (both balms are a light green colour). Smell, texture, effectiveness, price, ingredients - nothing wowed me.\n\n**Heimish All Clean Balm**\n\nSize: 120mL (4oz).   \nPrice: $23.95 CAD @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $5.99/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a flip top. Under the lid is a second lid which holds the included spatula. I like that the spatula is separated from the product but the extra lid makes it extra bulky in my cabinet.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.   \nTexture & Emulsion: This balm I’d say emulsified almost immediately to a complete oil. It has a light oil feel (similar to say a sunflower oil, not as thick as an olive oil for example). It melts right away once it touches your face and feels like an oil face massage as you rub it in. It feels quite luxurious!    \nScent: Light floral scent (smells like essential oils). I like it and it’s not too overpowering IMO but I have heard some people find it too strong of a scent.    \nOn the Eyes: No stinging and the eye film is minimal.    \nAmount Required: I’d say a medium amount. Definitely more than the Camomile and Green Clean but it doesn’t seem excessive.    \nIngredients: There is polyethylene (plastic) in this as well as a number of essential oils which those with sensitive skin may wish to avoid.    \nEthylhexyl palmitate, cetyl ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, polyethylene, PEG-8 isostearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, citrus aurantifolia (lime) fruit extract, freesia refracta extract, iris versicolor extract, jasminum officinale (jasmine) extract, lilium tigrinum extract, leontopodium alpinum extract, nelumbium speciosum flower extract, narcissus pseudo-narcissus (daffodil) flower extract, rose extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, amyris balsamifera bark oil, citrus paradisi (grapefruit) peel oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil, juniperus mexicana oil, boswellia carterii oil, citrus aurantium bergamia (bergamot) fruit oil, tocopheryl acetate, 1,2-hexanediol.\n\nVERDICT: There’s a lot to love about this - the scent and the texture are awesome, the price is definitely right, and I enjoy using it. My skin does always feel great after and it doesn’t dry me out. Cons for me are the bulky packaging, the amount of essential oils and the microbeads. I do like it but I’m not ready to stop my search quite yet.\n\n**Drunk Elephant Slaai**\n\nSize: 115mL (3.83oz).   \nPrice: $45 @ Sephora Canada.   \n(Note that this price includes a small vial of Bamboo Booster (physical exfoliating grains) as well).   \nPrice per oz: $11.75/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top. The spatula is magnetic and sits on top of the tub via a magnet (super handy for the makeup cupboard but also exposed/can pop off in a makeup bag while travelling).    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Feels like softened butter and emulsifies to a thick oil feeling (similar to olive oil).     \nScent: Neutral, but a light olive oil type scent. I wish it had a nicer smell but it’s not offensive.     \nOn the Eyes: No stinging, easily removed eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: just a little, I’d say the smallest amount of any I’ve tried which is great news for it lasting a good while.\n\nIngredients: There don’t appear to be any polyethylene in this product and it’s lighter on the essential oils as well (good news if you have sensitive skin).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Lauryl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-3 Laurate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Oil, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Seed Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Schinziophyton Rautanenii Kernel Oil, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Ximenia Americana Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Glycerin\n\nVERDICT: Love love love! Definitely don’t use too much but when using a small amount the oiliness isn’t too much and it makes my face feel soft and clean. However, a second cleanse is a must.\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Balm**\n\nSize: 125mL (4.17oz).    \nPrice: $40 @ Sephora Canada.    \nPrice per oz: $9.59/oz.    \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Texture is comparable to a solid form coconut oil (similar to the Heimish balm in texture and colour also). Emulsified quickly to a soft oil.    \nScent: Unscented.    \nOn the Eyes: A light film, but no stinging. Takes extra rubbing to loosen stubborn eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: Medium amount (not as much as Heimish but not as little as Drunk Elephant).    \n\nIngredients: Very short ingredients list but unfortunately, those classic plastics are in this balm as well (polyethylene).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate , Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil , Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride , Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate , Polyethylene , Peg-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate , Water\\Aqua\\Eau , Tocopherol , Phenoxyethanol\n\nVERDICT: Honestly, I have no real bad things to say. It’s utilitarian. It doesn’t feel luxurious but it works.\n\n\n**Acure Seriously Soothing 3 in 1 Serum**\n\nSize: 50mL (1.7 oz).   \nPrice: $23.49 @ well.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $13.82/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a glass jar with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: A very soft solid serum that gets a little melty when room temperature is quite warm. It melts immediately in your hand/on your face and becomes a liquidy oil. It feels luxurious but does leave an oily film so a second cleanse is definitely required.\nScent: Strong scent due to the blue tansy oil (some might not like it but I do!)\nOn the Eyes: It’s very gentle and doesn’t sting or leave a film.\nAmount Required: Very little required. I’d say about half a teaspoon for my whole face including eye makeup.\nIngredients: No plastic here! Just very basic natural ingredients.\n\nCaprylic/capric Triglyceride, Euphorbia Cerifera(Candelilla) Wax, Copernicia Cerifera(Carnauba) Wax, Butyrospermum Parkii(Shea) Butter, Rosa Canina(Rosehip) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa(Argan) Oil, Tocopherol(Vitamin E), Tanacetum Annum (Blue Tansy)flower Oil, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant)seed Oil.\n\nVERDICT: I didn’t originally buy this for a cleanser, (just as a balm) but used it in a pinch as my first cleanse when I accidentally lost my jar of Slaai on a camping trip. I love how my skin feels soft and soothed after using it as a cleanser and it feels so silky on my skin. It is a little on the expensive side but I think it’s a keeper for sure seeing as it’s so versatile!!\n\n**Banila Co. Clean It Zero Original Balm Cleanser**\n\nSize: 100mL (3.3 oz).   \nPrice: $27.96 @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $8.40/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: TBD.   \nTexture &amp;amp; Emulsion: TBD.   \nScent: TBD.   \nOn the Eyes: TBD.    \nAmount Required: TBD.   \nIngredients: Doesn’t look like there’s any microbeads in this bad boy, thankfully!\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, PEG-10 Isostearate, Synthetic Wax, Onsen-Sui, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Lithospermum Erythrorhizon Root Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Ethylhexylglycerin, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Angelica Archangelica Root Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Polydiethyleneglycol Adipate/IPDI Copolymer, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Acrylates/Methoxy PEG-15 Methacrylate Copolymer\n\nVERDICT: TBD - haven’t tried it yet but I plan to so I’ve included the info I was able to find so far.\n\n\nYour turn!

    "body": "#Rant#\n\nUntil recently, i only used sulphate free shampoos thinking it would be much better for my wavy/curly hair but i always used so much of product (even after dissolving it in water and emulsifying in my hands), they never removed the oil one go either leading me to go for a second rinse which inturn wastes water and it took me so much of time to just shampoo my hair. \n\nI was fear-mongered HARD. I have tried so many sulphate free shampoos and never stuck to one, i was never impressed with any. So many of them i just ended up using on my body because i got bored of them and didn't like them. At first, i believed the \"sUlpHatEs aRe bAd fOR YoU' movie trop and then, when i got to know about the CGM, i got even more afraid of them (double homicide, if i may). But over the past year ive tried some shampoos with sls in them and i always noticed less hairfall.\n\nI have been concerned about my hairfall for years, ive lost the volume i used to have back in school and mom's comments on my hair is just the cherry on cake i need. I am trying my best to feel confident in the hair I have and not letting insecurities affect me yet trying to take care of them and reduce as much of hairfall as possible. \n\nI am, i think, loosing the normal amount of hair its just my brain telling me that I need to immediately rush to the doctor. Lowkey a triggering topic, tbvh. \n\nI am just thankful i started using sulphates again and i dont have any plans to stop. Plus sulphates are better for my oily scalp.\n\n#Review#\n\nPrice- Rs. 149 for 192.5 ml.\n\nINGREDIENTS: WATER SUM LAURETH SULFATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, DIMETHICONE, FRAGRANCE, C177891/TITANIUM DIOXIDE, GUAR HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CASTOR SEED OIL, MICA, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUMBENZOATE, SODIUMHYDROXIDE, HYDROXYCITRONELLAL, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARETH-6, ACETIC ACID, PEG-100 STEARATE, TRIDECETH-10, TRIDECETH-S SALICYLICACID, LIMONENE, FUMARICACIO PANTHENOL BENZYL SALICYLATE, LINALOOL BENZYLALCOHOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL AMODIMETHICONE, ALPHA-ISOMETHYL JONONE, CARSONER, GERANIOL, CITRIC ACID CITRONELLOL, COUMARIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL HEXYL CINNAMAL, GLYCERIN, GLYCOL DISTEARATE (FLL CE552/).\n\nHairtype- wavy/curly, oily scalp, dry ends.\n\nHair care Products- khadi protein mask (once a week), aloe gel (whenever i feel like), livon (trying to finish it up).\nI have stopped oiling completely\n\nI recently shifted L'oreal Dream Lengths Shampoo (because of the rave reviews here) and i think I have finally found the shampoo for me (don't want to jinx). I get less hairfall, it emulsifies easily, i dont need to spend a ton of time rubbing it in to remove any sort of build up and I haven't noticed any dryness of my hair as such. I haven't seen any difference in curls either (NOTE: I dont follow CGM rigorously, i have just picked up a couple of steps that suit me).\n\nI shampoo twice a week, once a week i either do aloeing or apply the khadi mask (an HG btw). Then i wrap my hair in a t-shirt and also wear a satin hair bonnet while sleeping. I have almost stopped using hair ties and only stick to those huge-ass clutchers (clips). I dont use any products after shampooing because i hate the feeling. I'll just sometimes use livon to finish that up but i don't think I'll be able to before it expires.\n\nMy shampoo method- I take a little bit of a shampoo in a mug, add water onto it and pour it on my scalp ONLY. I dont wash my ends everytime i shampoo, like once a week is enough. \n\nStatus- WRP",

Mukti gold herbal hairwash - this shampoo is used by my whole family and my dad especially have seen a drastic change in his hairfall  and we used to have tresseme shampoo before this, bcuz of which we switched onto this herbal hairwash shampoo\n2. A homemade serum after wash (aloevera gel, rose essential oil, glycerine, rose water), this makes my hair smell heavenly nice. Only I use it \n3. Cold pressed coconut oil before hair wash - for 1-2 hr , only me and my mom do the oiling part.\n4. Washing my hair more often - 3 times a week\n\nNow I would like the share the mistakes I used to make which when corrected helped me in hairfall.\n\n+ oiling for long hours -  I used to oil my hair a night before hairwash day. But one of my friend told me that oiling for long hours is one of the major reason of hairfall. So now I make sure that I don't keep oil in my hair for more than 2 hrs.\n\n+ Oiling with the right oil - I used to oil my hair with dabur amla hair oil  after which I switched to pure coconut oil.\n\n+ Diet - I eat 2 soaked walnuts, 10 soaked almonds, 2 soaked anjeer, 2 cashews. I drink anjeer water with anjeer. I have been following this religiously for a very long time. And I believe this has helped immensely in improving my hair texture. \n\n+ Washing my hair after every 2nd day - I have noticed that after every 2nd my hair gets oily and itchy and if I don't wash it the same day. My hair starts to fall out. I sort of wash my hair at every alternate day.\n\nLet me know if you guys have any questions related to this. \n\nHAPPY TO HELP 😊",

Tried all of them out there, from cheapest to most expensive, but none worked for my hair. Cut to Biotique, and my hair got so smooth and shiny. Hairfall reduced tremendously. Hair growth got better, less split ends. Then I recently switched to other sulphate free shampoos, and no matter how less or more I apply, my hair looks so dead and dull. So, I don't care if Biotique is sulphate or sulphate free. I just know its gentle, and even if I use more, it never harms me. It always repairs my hair beyond my expectation (I suffer from depression so I can go for long periods without taking care of my hair) and makes them silky smooth and in no need of any extra treatment. Its magic for me.",

It's impossible to last without sulphates. Most CG shampoos also have milder sulphates because they're cleansing agents. Shampoos also tend to have polyquaternium which is a conditioning agent that builds up (certain kinds of Polyquaternium build up more than others). Without sulphates you won't get rid of the buildup and it will lead to poor scalp health. \n\nI use Pantene Lively Clean every once in a while (maybe once a month, twice in the humid summers). It's got \"harsh\" sulphates which strip my hair and scalp clean of all buildup. Unfortunately with really short hair you can't avoid getting shampoo all up in your hair. \n\nAs to whether sulphates cause less hairfall, I won't comment because everyone shair and scalp are different. I found a method that works for me and In glad you could introduce it to your routine too without much issue :) \n\nSulphates and silicones aren't necessarily bad. It's also important to remember that you lose more hair during high humidity conditions. That's normal.",

The texture is slightly thick and gooey(but not gross)\n\nApplication: I use 3-4 pumps for my whole face. I apply it on wet dripping face right after cleanser in the evening. On some days I layer it twice. My skin drinks it up as soon as I apply it. It spreads easily on wet skin. On dry skin it doesn't fully absorb and sits on the skin.\n\nI love it. I bought 9 bottles so far. And gifted three to my friends. You can see 4 in the photo. I gave away the old ones for recycling. I use it every day in my PM routine during winters. It helps keep my skin hydrated in dry weather. If i go a week without using it, I can feel the difference. Skin feels tight and not as glowy when i wake up. I always take it for travelling. It's helpful during flights and while staying in hotel rooms where my skin feels most dehydrated.\n\n***10/10 Will repurchase , Holy Grail!***\n\nSorry for any mistakes. This is my first review. English is hard. Please be nice.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the product, do ask.\n\nIngredient list:  Snail Secretion Filtrate, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Carbomer, Panthenol, Arginine\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kji0qunq126c1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ce0d4f723574305d1432788265475e90018dca3",

I bought a bottle of this cleanser a couple months ago and noticed that it was irritating my skin. Looked at the ingredients to see if this was a fake, or otherwise if there was a formula change. Saw that they took out parabens and replaced it with phenoxyethanol.\n\nParabens at the concentrations they are approved for use in cosmetics have shown 0 issues with endocrine (or other health related) issues, alongside 0 issues with skin irritation. They have been considered a safe and gold-standard cosmetic preservative for this reason. I have yet to find a single well-performed study that confirms that people have ended up with skin issues (let alone overall health and wellness issues) by using skincare products with parabens. Not a single one.\n\nI just wish more companies would flatly confirm this, rather than ruin their products by using alternative preservatives that are more likely to cause skin irritation/contact allergies. And I wish the consumer base of skincare would stop fearing these ingredients.\n\n<end rant>  \n\n\nEdit: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19101832/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19101832/)\n\n\\^ Some of the vast amount of available literature on parabens",

    "body": "Take a second to look through these photos. Can you tell a difference between the two sides? Which is which? The answer will be in the comments.  \n\nHopefully I got enough pictures with different lighting. These are all different stages of my routine in the morning.\n\n\nSCENT:\n\nIt has been mentioned in this sub that the DT serum smells like pee. For me it has a clean, neutral scent. I would assume those were bad batches. \n\nIf I were to compare the two, I think Kérastase smells better. It also has a pleasant scent that lingers on my hair for a couple hours. DT does not linger, probably because it’s so neutral.\n\nSecond opinion: \nI asked my boyfriend to smell it too without context, he has a more sensitive nose than me. He stated that it doesn’t smell bad, I asked him if it reminded him of anything and he said it doesn’t. I told him that it smells like a clean scent to me and he agreed. \n\nThen I explained the rumor about it on Reddit and he said:\n“No, it doesn’t smell like urine. I am well acquainted” (referencing my dogs lol)\n\nSo do with that information what you will, maybe he’s just being agreeable 😂 but rest assured, you now have two more opinions on the scent. I would say to smell yours before applying to the hair just in case. I’ll update this post if there are any changes as I use it.\n\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nDollar Tree (from the bottle):\nWATER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, GLYCERIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYQUATERNIUM-37,\nPROPYLENE GLYCOL, CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, DIMETHICONE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, PEG-20 STEARATE, STEARTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, FRAGRANCE, C13-16 ISOPARAFFIN, TRIDECETH-6 ACOHOL, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, DIMETHYL STEARANINE, HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, PANTHENOL\n\nKérastase (from their website):\nAqua / Water / Eau ● Dimethicone ● C13-16 Isoalkane ● Niacinamide ● Glycerin ● Polyacrylamide ● Phenoxyethanol ● C13-14 Isoalkane ● Laureth-7 ● Panthenol ● Ascorbyl Glucoside ● Butylene Glycol ● Linalool ● Hydroxycitronellal ● Benzyl Salicylate ● Benzyl Alcohol ● Hexyl Cinnamal ● Citronellol ● Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein ● Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone ● Coumarin ● Hydrolyzed Corn Protein ● Hydrolyzed Soy Protein ● Limonene ● Iris Florentina Root Extract ● Citric Acid ● Ci 19140 / Yellow 5 ● Ci 14700 / Red 4 ● Parfum / Fragrance\n\nOne notable difference in the ingredients is the addition of niacinamide in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is supposed to promote hair growth when used on the scalp. But if you are anything like me, I don’t apply serums all the way to the scalp, I start them from about the middle of my hair through the ends. \n\nBased on this, I do not believe niacinamide is especially helpful in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is probably more helpful in shampoos and scalp products (And now I’m tempted to use a certain DT niacinamide/squalane serum in my hair instead of on my face 🤣)\n\n\nPRICE:\n\nKérastase: $60/3.04 fluid oz, or $19/oz\n\nDollar Tree: $1.25/4 fluid oz, or 31¢/oz\n\n\nTEXTURE:\n\nI put these next to each other on the back of my hand. Kérastase has more of a serum feel, it’s clear/yellow upon application, and it has a little more of an oily texture. DT starts out a little thicker and looks white/creamy at first, then it blends out to be sheer. With both products, I rub them between my hands before applying to hair. \n\n\nMETHOD:\n\nLast night I did my normal shower routine, including a clarifying shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner. I’ve been using this particular duo of products for about 6 months. \n\nI let my hair dry for a couple of hours and applied one serum on each side, washing my hands between applications. Then I put my hair in braids for the night. I didn’t use any other leave-in products before taking pictures.\n\nIn the morning I took out the braids, hand-combed them, brushed through them, and then did some touch-ups to the ends with my curling iron, taking pictures throughout every step. \n\nSo let me know what you think and I’ll put my final thoughts in the comments!

Both sides of my hair look shiny and hydrated. The ends feel great. They are equally manageable. The dollar tree side MIGHT have a little more shine to it, or it could be the angle of my camera.\n\nI seriously can’t tell a difference besides the fragrance (I had to keep smelling each side to make sure I had them right) and the fragrance is not worth $58.25 to me. So you know where I’ll be spending my money.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "Hi! I tried these three online prescription services over the past two years and thought a comparison review might be helpful. \n\nMy skin: dry, extra sensitive, eczema prone \n\nConcerns I wanted to address: redness, slight texture\n\n[Packaging of all three (pumps) ](https://imgur.com/a/tZZx3vP)\n\n**Rory**\n\nCost: $5 trial, then $75 per quarter (for my specific formula) \n\nPrescriptions: first 10% azelaic acid, 2% tranexamic acid, 1% magnesium ascorbyl phosphate. Second 0.015% tretinoin, niacinamide 2.5% \n\nFormulation: this formulation also includes ceramides, which I really liked for my dry skin. It was the creamiest and thickest out of all three brands. However, it also had gritty bits in it that made it less enjoyable and more irritating to apply. \n\nResults: Slight redness reduction after 4 months of using every other night \n\nPersonal Opinion: I felt the entire experience was very generic and that my provider was not personalizing my formulas. After experiencing irritation with azaleic acid, they switched me to tretinoin, which did not make sense to me. I did not purchase or try my second formula with the tretinoin.  \n\n**Curology** \n\nCost: $5 trial, then $19 + shipping every month or $40 with free shipping every two months \n\nPrescription: 4% azelaic acid, 4% niacinamide, 0.25% zinc pyrithione \n\nFormulation: this formulation was the smoothest and felt most like a normal moisturizer to apply. Mine had no scent and layered well with the products I used underneath it. It caused no irritation. \n\nResults: Significant redness and texture improvement after 3 months of nightly use \n\nPersonal Opinion: My Curology provider was the most responsive and informative of the three. Curology is known for their low-strength formulas, so I wasn’t surprised that this was the mildest of my prescriptions. My provider has been clear that I can increase strength when I feel ready, though. For now, I appreciate that this causes no sensitivity, and I don’t feel like my skin concerns need anything stronger. Also, the zinc pyrithione in this one really helped flakiness around my eyes and mouth. I usually use a zinc pyrithione cleanser, so it was nice to be able to skip that step with this. \n\n**Apostrophe**\n\nCost: $90 without auto refill, $75 with auto refill every three months \n\nPrescription: 15% azelaic acid, 4% niacinamide \n\nFormulation: This was the thinnest of the creams. It disappeared almost immediately after spreading it on my face. It also had gritty pieces similar to Rory, but these ones were much finer. \n\nResults: Unable to tell because it was too irritating to use more than twice a week \n\nPersonal Opinion: The 15% azelaic was too strong for me to start out with. When I asked my provider if I could have something milder or a different ingredient, they replied that I should just use an over the counter azelaic acid. I did not appreciate this, because I have tried the over the counter products and do not like the consistency or the other ingredients they contain. Apostrophe was by far the least helpful and least informative of the three. \n\n**Overall favorite: Curology** \n\nCurious to hear others’ experiences!\n\nEdit: i also forgot to mention these all use the same base formula containing: \n\naloe barbadensis leaf juice, C13-14 isoparaffin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, water, laureth-7, maltodextrin, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, tocopheryl acetate, triethylene glycol",

The Curology provider was way more informative and each response seemed more personal than Apostrophe. However, the Curology provider only prescribed me 0.035% to start off and using it every night made me peel like crazy when fall/winter hit. It might have been a combination of the formulation and weather change, but my skin didn’t peel this badly at all with Apostrophe. Curology just bumped me up to 0.05% this month. I’ll most likely stick to Curology unless peeling becomes a constant issue, which then I’ll try out Agency or go back to Apostrophe.",

Ferments have been all the rage recently, with *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (living yeast) extract and *Saccharomyces ferment* being the two I see the most. While I could not find any clinical dermatology studies done on sake as a ferment in skin, we may be able to glean some understanding into the benefits of sake by examining both ferments and koji (kojic acid) itself.\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of yeast used for brewing beer. In one study, saccharomyces cerevisiae extract (SCE) was studied in several formulations. One contained SCE, and/or vitamins A, C, and E, and was patch-tested on the back of volunteers. The subjects were then tested for transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin moisture (SM), skin microrelief (SMR), and free radical protection in 3 hour, 15 days, and 30 day intervals.\n\n>*\"Our results suggest that vitamins and SCE showed effects in \\[skin moisture\\] SM and \\[skin microrelief\\] SMR. Only formulations containing SC had long term effects in the improvement of SMR. Thus, these kinds of evaluations are very important in cosmetics development to evaluate the best risk and benefit correlation.\"¹*\n\nAnother fungi ferment, saccharomyces ferment, has similar benefits. It is obtained through the fermentation of saccharomyces - a genus of fungi that is known as the baker's yeast - in the presence of metal ions. The yeast is credited with promoting good skin condition and is frequently found in products that reduce redness.\n\nThe other half of sake worth discussing, koji (kojic acid) is a skin-lightening agent and antioxidant. It is a tyrosinase (an enzyme that controls the production of melanin) inhibitor, but not as effective as other tyrosinase inhibitors like licorice extract. \"In combination with allantoin and other proper ingredients in sunscreen preparations, the mixture can inhibit UV-caused erythema and accelerate wound healing.\"² Unfortunately, it can also be sensitizing to some skin and create irritation.\n\nFrom this break down, we can assume that sake contains some sort of very mild exfoliating, humectant, and whitening properties, though it is important to keep in mind that there are no studies that I could find into the benefits of sake when applied topically, so this is all assumptions based on the chemical makeup.\n\nThe next ingredients on the list are ceramides 3 and 6. If you've been following my writings, you already know that ceramides are naturally found in the skin and help maintain the skin barrier. In fact, our skin's natural lipids are 35-40&#37; ceramides.\n\nSlightly more exciting is placental protein. Derived from animal placenta ([in this case, horse](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5fgonk/psa_kikumasamune_does_not_use_ingredient_derived/)), it is considered to be a safe ingredient that does not deliver any metabolic or endocrine activity. Again though, there was not much precedent that I could find on the benefits of including this ingredient specifically, however egg whites have been used for centuries on skin to make skin temporarily feel tighter and appear smoother.\n\n*Fun fact: Umbilical extract has precedent for unrestricted use in Japan, except for certain products.³*\n\nFinally, we arrive at the stars of this product: arbutin and licorice root extract. Arbutin, an ingredient primarily used for it's antioxidant properties as well as skin bleaching. It is a natural hydroquinone, derived synthetically or from bearberry plants. Once on the skin, it converts into hydroquinone and acts as a tyrosinase inhibitor. While not as effective as hydroquinone, it lacks the concerns of hydroquinone thus has become more popular in recent years.\n\nLicorice root extract is similarly a tyrosinase inhibitor as well as an anti-irritant - with some studies signalling that it may be able to absorb UVA and UVB rays. It is more effective than kojic acid and some studies put it at 75x more effective than ascorbic acid ([though Dr Dray raises some interesting points regarding the efficacy of L-AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JxO6sVMJzM)). \"The chief constituent of licorice root is glycyrrhizin, present in concentrations that range from 5 to 24 percent depending on the variety of licorice used.\"²\n\n# My Experience\n\n**My skin type:** Rosacean, acne-prone and extremely irritation-prone\n\nFirstly, the pump on my bottle broke off rather spectacularly when my bottle took a tumble from my tiny bathroom counter top. I'm not sure why this product comes with a pump applicator in the first place, as it frequently would dispense more product than I needed, which I suppose is fine as I was able to spread it down my neck and chest, but it was still was a bit of a shock to get a whole handful of it on the first pump. This experience doesn't seem limited to me, so I really recommend decanting this product into a better dispenser if you can, like a spritz top bottle.\n\nPackaging aside, the first time I used the High Moist lotion, I was pretty nervous. It's a very runny product, sharing a consistency with water, and if you've read my blog at all you know that I am a fairly dry-skinned lady. To my surprise and delight though, it was *uber* moisturizing. I applied it fresh out of the shower, in place of my HadaLabo Premium, and instantly my skin just felt soft and supple. I imagine much of this is due to the placenta protein filling in the gaps of the skin cells and creating a \"smooth\" texture as well as the ceramides, which tend to plump up my skin and make it feel softer.\n\nThe fragrance was also so mild that frankly, the smell of sake overpowered it. Thankfully this smell seemed to dissipate after a few minutes of application, and my rosacea did not flare up from the inclusion of fragrance. Over the next few days, I used the High Moist in place of my HadaLabo, and then began to combine it at night with the HadaLabo Premium on top. It worked well with oils and other moisturizing products on top - no pilling or strange film to report.\n\nIn two weeks, my skin looked brighter and felt smoother, though none of my dark spots had faded. Unfortunately, like most products with ferments, it began to break me out after this time. The good news though is that it doesn't appear to break me out immediately, unlike every other ferment, and the smoothness lasted for a few days after I discontinued use, which means I may try to use it sparingly once my skin heals.\n\n# Sources\n\n1.

    "body": "**I hate buying sunscreen.** Outside of a few gel-like sunscreens which I can never find for a reasonable cost, most just disappoint me. I feel like I often have to choose between having the complexion of a sad day, or looking **so** greasy.\n\nMy skin ranges from light-medium to medium-dark. To visualize: I'm Doja Cat when it's cold out and Kerry Washington once I can get some sun - strong golden tones. I tan fast, with or without SPF (though I am very pro-SPF), and have burned exactly once in my entire lifetime. I'm still not interested in putting myself at risk for skin cancer.\n\nI'm not going to claim that this sunscreen will not leave a white cast on people with deeper and darker skin-tones than my own, though I truly hope it works for you. So... here's my review!\n\n**Banana Boat: Light as Air, 50+ SPF UVA/UVB Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Lotion**\n\n* **Price**: $5.99 on sale at Kroger, regularly $10.99 here.\n* **Size**: 6 oz. ($0.99/oz. on sale, regularly $1.83/oz.)\n* **Scented**? Yes, it's pretty noticeable at first but fades (not completely). I'm VERY sensitive to scents (I can't wear perfumes, they trigger migraines), but it's not the usual *Eau de Banana Boat* I expected.\n* **White cast?** None on my skin tone. Absolutely none. It's decently liquid-y for the SPF, and if you apply it more liberally, it can be rubbed in and absorbs fairly quickly.\n* **Greasy**? NOPE. It's not one of those slick sunscreens. Alcohol is the fifth sunscreen, and I'm no scientist, but I suspect this may contribute to it.\n* **Pilling**? None. I tried applying more and more to dare it to pill, it didn't! Usually, sunscreen will build up and 'highlight' my hair follicles/stubble (I have hairy arms and can't be bothered to shave regularly) - didn't happen!\n* **Ingredients**: Water, Diisopropyl Adipate, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Tapioca Starch, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Coco-Glucoside, Chlorphenesin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice.\n\nI read a lot of reviews on here and think \"Yeah, can't relate!\" since a lot of sunscreens with 50+ SPF have white casts, and many AB sunscreens are either intentionally white cast-y or, worse, pink-tinted, which are both a no for me. \n\nI hope this block of text helps another medium-skinned beaut who has been walking around intermittently looking like a tombstone and/or bacon grease. Feel free to ask any questions, I haven't seen much about this sunscreen before, and I've been trying it out for a while now :).",

I myself am white but obviously not enough because the white cast looks horrible, especially if I haven't shaved. And the tinted sunscreens are great, but then their too dark and it can make for some uncomfortable looks out in public. Plus, they cost more per ounce and require more care in application. But then most chemical sunscreens aren't as safe for sensitive, acne prone skin like myself. Several of the supposedly sensitive ones I saw today at Target still had oxybenzone and other irritating ingredients. But this one didn't. So yeah-thanks for the heads up. I'm hopeful about it now!",

I never looked much into the lawsuit, and just warned people about the potential danger while moving on. \n\nHowever, I recently saw a post about DevaCurl products that spawned some.. conversation, and I ended up running into this comment, which piqued my interest. \n\n> “According to the lawsuit, propylene glycol and cocamidopropyl betaine are just two of the harmful ingredients included in DevaCurl products. The case claims the defendant’s products also include phenoxyethanol, Laureth-4, VP/VA copolymer, and Ceteareth-20, as well as a generalized “fragrance” that the suit says can typically be found in products that include artificial or harmful chemicals for such.”\n\n> Weird. I thought propylene glycol was found in many hygienic and cosmetic products…even Minoxidil (Rogaine). Wouldn’t that be counterintuitive?\n\nBetween this, and a [recent video from Manes by Mell](https://youtu.be/0-YXQMKH724) that I ran across while looking for information about the new Shark HyperAir, my curiosity was piqued, and I decided to [find some more information about the ingredients listed in the lawsuit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/wdm31g/look_what_i_found_at_tj_maxx/iilbaff/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)\n\nI was disappointed to find that all of these ingredients are, in a handful of words, mostly harmless. Propylene glycol is basically used everywhere, and every other ingredient listed seems to just be commonly used in the cosmetics industry. The only specific ingredient that stood out (after **admittedly quick** skimming) was the phenoxyethyl. \n\nI’m not really here to defend or critique Deva Curl. Whoever wants to stop, or continue, using them for whatever reason can continue to do so. I, personally, never really used their products, and I only miss their Wash Day Wonder detangler, which basically is a detangling miracle for me.\n\nAll I’m here to do is share information that I hope people find useful. There are a lot of anecdotes going around, and I think it’s important to understand both why people are frustrated with Deva Curl products, as well as the facts about the lawsuit and ingredients. \n\nAs a counter anecdote, I listened to people here about the wonders of coconut oil, and used some for a period of time. It worked, but made my hair feel both slick, and dry. Turns out that a lot of Curly Girl/Guy suggestions don’t have the same effect on thick, fine, low porosity, hair like mine. If I hadn’t run into Mell’s video on coconut I could have ended up damaging my hair by listening the praise of an otherwise excellent hair fair ingredient that simply didn’t work with my hair type. \n\nIt is important that we listen to our hair, and research what we use, so that we can be informed about how we can care for ourselves.",

It’s okay if you’ve decided not to use DevaCurl products for whatever reason, and I’m not here to tell anybody otherwise. \n\nMy only reason for making this post is to remind people to be careful what they hear online. **Even a product that has a 0.01% failure rate would still around 33,000 subpar units in the US**.\n\nWhile it’s important to listen to people who have had bad experiences, it isn’t enough to simply go on someone else’s word for *our personal* care routines and health choices. Some people may have been put off of DevaCurl products that would have otherwise found good success with them. Other people may have stopped using DevaCurl products when the only thing they needed to do was adjust their routine. Still others may never be able to use DevaCurl products because the change in formula is simply too much for their body to handle.\n\nI may chime in here and there with a few personal hair care experiences, but the main point I want people to take away from this post is that anecdotal experiences are not evidence. **Respect those who have had bad experiences with a product, but always do your own research into the things you buy so that you are not unwittingly spreading misinformation, or preventing yourself from using a product that may actually work well for you.**",

I began to get an incredibly itchy scalp (the person in the comments talking about ph seems onto something to me). I had tons of bleeding, scabs, dandruff, etc and it was pretty painful. After reading the horror stories I realized that deva had changed its whole product line and packaging to new stuff (the new green bottles) So I decided to experiment. I stopped using my old product (I used to buy in bulk so had a cabinet of product I was working through over the years) and bought all the comparable products from the new line and within a week all my itchy scalp issues went away. I suspect it had something to do with the no/low poo line ultimately. But I am happy with the new product line and have continued to use it for about 6 months now with no issues. \n\nI don’t know about the whole hair loss thing, but the scalp issues seemed to be true for me for the products made in that one window of time. I don’t know that ultimately it deserved all the panic and craziness online that it got, and deva likely should have been more transparent if they found issues with the product to explain what happened…. But regardless it seems the issue I saw was resolved in the new formulas. I saw some speculation that the clear bottles may also have had something to do with it. UV effecting the product, that seems possible I guess. Anyways, I’ve been happy with the new product line so for now I’m continuing to use it.",

If you just use a co-wash and the rest of the Deva line without clarifying for a long period (say, 2+ years) the buildup is going to cause scalp issues such as inflammation leading to hair loss, brittleness and dryness due to products no longer soaking in, etc.\n\nI had problems after using DevaCurl for years, but found that clarifying my hair once a month with a Sulfate shampoo (followed by a deep conditioner) helped a ton.\n\nAdditionally, symptoms like hair loss, itchy scalp, hair texture change, and dry scalp/hair are very vague symptoms that can be caused by a number of things. I'd have to see really concrete research and testing, with a control group and everything, to be convinced, personally, that it was Deva causing everything. Not to discount those who have had bad experiences - my heart goes out to you - but, I think nailing down a specific cause of such general symptoms is a more involved process than just reading a product label.\n\n So maybe it isn't the product themselves so much as the usage.",

I also just want to touch on the whole protein stigmatization: back in the day, animal protein was used as the only protein in products which produced a lot of over-proteinization.

    "body": "Review Day 1/7\nI recently purchased most of the new acne line by Pyunkang yul and I'm pleasantly surprised.\nUnlike the minimal ingredients the other lines have has these products contain a whole list of beneficial ingredients such as Centella Asiatica, Licorice Root extract, Niacinamide, a peptide complex as well as many more. The star ingredients for this line is white willow Extract and Forsythia fruit extract. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Toner:\nIt's very watery so great for those with oily skin. It absorbs pretty quickly and has a sweet scent despite it not having any essential oils. After two weeks of using it I prefer the essence toner to it but it did help with the breakout I had and helped with clearing out my pores but it's not hydrating enough for me to see using in the long term. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Facial Cleanser:\nMade with almost the exact same stuff but includes Citric acid and other agents for cleansing the skin. I'm not going to lie I love the cleanser it's so gentle and uses micro bubble technology. You might be disappointed that it doesn't lather well but I don't really care abut that aspect. It's a thicker consistency than their ato cleanser and 500ml cleanser but thinner than the foaming cleanser and has a pH of 5.5-6. My friend tested the pH on her one and she got a pH of almost 5.8. It also doesn't strip me of any moisture i feel more hydrated after cleansing. I'll definitely repurchase when I run out i prefer it over the Cosrx salicylic acid cleanser or my cereve hydrating cleanser. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Spot Cream:\nI got this for my sister but tried some myself I didn't really notice any difference on my skin but my sister who has sensitive acne prone skin saw improvements on her acne. I prefer to my a'pieu pimple patches over it. \n\nThis line is perfect for acne prone sensitive skin while people like me that has combo- dry skin might not like it as much it. \n\nEdit (I think their listed on cosdna if you want to check what is what) : Ingredients for the cleanser\nWater Cocamidopropyl Betaine Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate PEG-75 Acrylates Copolymer Glycerin Disodium cocoamphodipropionate PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate Dimethyl Sulfone Pyridoxine HCl Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Butylene Glycol Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Sodium Chloride Copper Tripeptide-1 Allantoin Citric acid Potassium Hydroxide Sodium Benzoate Phenoxyethanol Disodium EDTA\n\nIngredients for the toner:\nWater Butylene Glycol Dimethyl Sulfone Pyridoxine HCl Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Niacinamide Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Copper Tripeptide-1 Glycerin Hydroxyacetophenone Myrtus Communis Extract Tropaeolum majus Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Disodium EDTA\n\nSpot cream ingredients \n\nWater Pentylene Glycol Glycerin Behenyl Alcohol Cetearyl Alcohol Niacinamide Glyceryl Stearate Dimethyl Sulfone Silica Polyacrylate-13 Polyisobutene Polysorbate 20 Allantoin Madecassoside Asiaticoside Panthenol Pyridoxine HCl Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Xanthan Gum Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Butylene Glycol Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Copper Tripeptide-1 Hydroxyacetophenone Myrtus Communis Extract Tropaeolum majus Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Disodium EDTA\n\n*For the cleanser and toner everything has an EWG rating lower than 3 these are all available in sale on style korean for $10 USD and under (shipping was dreadful to Canada its probably good if you live in the US) \n\nEdit x2? I just saw it on yesstyle too and they are doing a sale on the products as well . To clarify i broke out by using the moisture cream from this brand I added those products plus olivarrier products to sooth my skin. I'm planning on reviewing that brand later this week \n",

    "body": "As the title suggests, this is my current sunscreen collection, and I'll be reviewing the products and mentioning the ones I love and the ones I don't ! (This post might be half cooked, not very organised and all over the place, but it's my first time, so bear with me :P) \n\nSo as I mentioned, this is my first post here (eeep! :D) and initially I thought of sharing my entire shelfie, but I realised that being the junkie/hoarder I am, it'd end up being a terribly long post , hence after much deliberation I decided to post different categories of products separately  (sunscreens, moisturisers, serums etc) and after I'm done with that, I shall be making a post with only the products I use in my  current skincare routine!\n\nWithout further adieu let's get started! Please do like, share,  subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell icon!... lmao jk\n\n**Skin Type** : Oily - Combination, Comedonal Acne Prone, Rosacea Prone,\n\n**Major skin concerns** : Hypersensitivity, Non inflammatory acne, Sebum Production. \n\n**Age** : Early - Mid 20s, F\n\n**Current Climatic Conditions** : Semi- Arid, Dry winter \n\nSpecie : Homo Sapien\n\nHeight : wait.. I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

    "body": "First of all, these are a list of products available in Boots that I've found, so they're non-exhaustive. Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point.

    "body": "NOTE: Sorry for the WEIRD MARKDOWN. The new Reddit's editor is a damn mess and I am constantly cleaning its crummy markdown.\n\nHi, SCA.\n\nSomeone requested more reviews and breakdowns, so I figured I would post this here. I originally posted it in r/AsianBeauty where I got some excellent feedback and thoughts.\n\nThis is a bit of a review slash ingredient breakdown, so I hope you enjoy!\n\n\\---\n\n>*Full Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol ,* ***Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake)****, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Leucine,* ***Ceramide 3***, ***Ceramide 6***, ***Placental Protein***, ***Arbutin***,***Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (Licorice Root Extract)****, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein, Maltitol, Methyl Gluceth-10, Peg-6 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Fragrance.*\n\nI've highlighted the ingredients that are worth discussing a bit in detail.\n\n# Ingredient Breakdown\n\nSake is a fermented product made from [rice](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/01/sake-rice-how-sake-is-made-rice-varieties-brewing-sake.html), [water](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-school-the-importance-of-water-in-sake-making-where-does-sake-come-from.html), [koji](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/koji-the-miracle-mold-how-sake-is-made.html), and [yeast](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-yeast-temperature-yeast-strains.html). Ferments have been all the rage recently, with *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (living yeast) extract and *Saccharomyces ferment* being the two I see the most.\n\nA couple of studies on sake (specifically rice wine and sake extract) showed multiple benefits. One in vitro (meaning in a dish or tube) study showed that rice wine increased  \"the expression of procollagen and laminin-5,\"⁴ which is one of the key components in the intercellular makeup of the layer that holds the epidermis to the dermis. Additionally, \"laminin 5 also accelerates the assembly of basement membranes and may enhance the recovery of damaged skin.\"⁵In the same study, experiments were done on hairless mice (in vivo) and showed that topical application protected the mouse from photo-aging.\n\nAnother study showed \\*that sake extract inhibited tyrosinase, both in vivo (in a living organism) and in vitro, though it is unclear how many subjects were involved based on the abstract alone.⁶\n\nIt's important to note that the first study I mentioned comes from Doosan Group R&D, which seems primarily interested in vehicles, construction, electrical, etc., while the second study was paid for by AMOREPACIFIC R&D - a popular skincare company.\n\nWhile these studies are minimal, we may be able to glean some deeper understanding into the benefits of sake by examining two of the most popular (and more studied) ferments as well as koji (kojic acid) itself.\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of yeast used for brewing beer. In one study, saccharomyces cerevisiae extract (SCE) was studied in several formulations. One contained SCE, and/or vitamins A, C, and E, and was patch-tested on the back of volunteers. The subjects were then tested for transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin moisture (SM), skin microrelief (SMR), and free radical protection in 3 hour, 15 days, and 30 day intervals.\n\n>*\"Our results suggest that vitamins and SCE showed effects in \\[skin moisture\\] SM and \\[skin microrelief\\] SMR. Only formulations containing SC had long term effects in the improvement of SMR. Thus, these kinds of evaluations are very important in cosmetics development to evaluate the best risk and benefit correlation.\"¹*\n\nAnother fungi ferment, saccharomyces ferment, has similar benefits. It is obtained through the fermentation of saccharomyces - a genus of fungi that is known as the baker's yeast - in the presence of metal ions. The yeast is credited with promoting good skin condition and is frequently found in products that reduce redness.\n\nThe other half of sake worth discussing, koji (kojic acid) is a skin-lightening agent and antioxidant. It is a tyrosinase (an enzyme that controls the production of melanin) inhibitor, but not as effective as other tyrosinase inhibitors like licorice extract. \"In combination with allantoin and other proper ingredients in sunscreen preparations, the mixture can inhibit UV-caused erythema and accelerate wound healing.\"² Unfortunately, it can also be sensitizing to some skin and create irritation.\n\nFrom all of this, we can assume that sake contains some sort of very mild exfoliating, humectant, anti-aging, and whitening properties, but the studies are fairly minimal thus far. To add, it is important to remember that not all skin ingredients penetrate deeper than the first few layers of the stratum corneum (the upper-most layer of the epidermis, what we see with our eyes), so long-term studies in vivo over many years tend to be the most reliable (hence why your doctor may be more apt to prescribe you tretinoin \\[Retin-A\\] than a newer drug).\n\nThe next ingredients on the list are ceramides 3 and 6. If you've been following my writings, you already know that ceramides are naturally found in the skin and help maintain the skin barrier. In fact, our skin's natural lipids are 35-40&#37; ceramides.\n\nSlightly more exciting is placental protein. Derived from animal placenta ([in this case, horse](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5fgonk/psa_kikumasamune_does_not_use_ingredient_derived/)), it is considered to be a safe ingredient that does not deliver any metabolic or endocrine activity. Again though, there was not much precedent that I could find on the benefits of including this ingredient specifically, however egg whites have been used for centuries on skin to make skin temporarily feel tighter and appear smoother.\n\n*Fun fact: Umbilical extract has precedent for unrestricted use in Japan, except for certain products.³*\n\nFinally, we arrive at the stars of this product: arbutin and licorice root extract. Arbutin, an ingredient primarily used for it's antioxidant properties as well as skin bleaching. It is a natural hydroquinone, derived synthetically or from bearberry plants. Once on the skin, it converts into hydroquinone and acts as a tyrosinase inhibitor. While not as effective as hydroquinone, it lacks the concerns of hydroquinone thus has become more popular in recent years.\n\nLicorice root extract is similarly a tyrosinase inhibitor as well as an anti-irritant - with some studies signalling that it may be able to absorb UVA and UVB rays. It is more effective than kojic acid and some studies put it at 75x more effective than ascorbic acid ([though Dr Dray raises some interesting points regarding the efficacy of L-AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JxO6sVMJzM)). \"The chief constituent of licorice root is glycyrrhizin, present in concentrations that range from 5 to 24 percent depending on the variety of licorice used.\"²\n\n# My Experience\n\n**My skin type:** Rosacean, acne-prone and extremely irritation-prone\n\nFirstly, the pump on my bottle broke off rather spectacularly when my bottle took a tumble from my tiny bathroom counter top. I'm not sure why this product comes with a pump applicator in the first place, as it frequently would dispense more product than I needed, which I suppose is fine as I was able to spread it down my neck and chest, but it was still was a bit of a shock to get a whole handful of it on the first pump. This experience doesn't seem limited to me, so I really recommend decanting this product into a better dispenser if you can, like a spritz top bottle.\n\nPackaging aside, the first time I used the High Moist lotion, I was pretty nervous. It's a very runny product, sharing a consistency with water, and if you've read my blog at all you know that I am a fairly dry-skinned lady. To my surprise and delight though, it was *uber* moisturizing. I applied it fresh out of the shower, in place of my HadaLabo Premium, and instantly my skin just felt soft and supple. I imagine much of this is due to the placenta protein filling in the gaps of the skin cells and creating a \"smooth\" texture as well as the ceramides, which tend to plump up my skin and make it feel softer.\n\nThe fragrance was also so mild that frankly, the smell of sake overpowered it. Thankfully this smell seemed to dissipate after a few minutes of application, and my rosacea did not flare up from the inclusion of fragrance. Over the next few days, I used the High Moist in place of my HadaLabo, and then began to combine it at night with the HadaLabo Premium on top. It worked well with oils and other moisturizing products on top - no pilling or strange film to report.\n\nIn two weeks, my skin looked brighter and felt smoother, though none of my dark spots had faded. Unfortunately, like most products with ferments, it began to break me out after this time. The good news though is that it doesn't appear to break me out immediately, unlike every other ferment, and the smoothness lasted for a few days after I discontinued use, which means I may try to use it sparingly once my skin heals.\n\n# Sources\n\n1.

Normally I’ve always used it to get rid of the gunk and then use dawn dish soap to fully clean my brushes. However I recently looked into all of the ingredients and I come to find out there are NONE that can sanitize a brush. The last two ingredients Phenoxyethanol and Caprylyl Glycol have antimicrobial properties but their main function in cosmetics is to PRESERVE the product itself for a longer shelf life, and should not be used to properly sanitize your brushes. I’ve seen far too many artists saying they “prefer this over dawn dish soap” THIS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO REPLACE YOUR SANITIZER. If you’re really in a pinch inbetween clients you need to get rid of the majority of product with the cinema secrets AND after that use 70% alcohol to sanitize with a quick dry.",

When I worked a counter, we’d have to wash our brushes after every shift which meant leaving the counter. But leaving the counter also meant that the two sharks on the floor would swipe your sales (instead of the courteous ringing up under your employee number) and a loss of sales can get someone fired. \n\nSo I thought that if I stayed at the counter and cleaned brushes with cinema secrets, I’d be good bc Cinema Secrets is a brush cleaner that we were told also sanitizes. \n\nI am SO glad I was taught better by a friend, who then understood why I did what I did and we were able to alert management to the happenings on the floor. \n\n20ish years later, when I’m training new artists I drill WASHING, soap and water washing, of the brushes and their handles. But also using Beauty so Clean sanitizer OR 70% alcohol once the brushes and tools are dry.",

As promised, here's my review/first impression on the new Cancer Council Vitamin C Fluid Sunscreen and will be comparing it to the Cancer Council Face Day Wear Fluid.\n\nIngredients:\nCancer Council Vitamin C Fluid:\nActive ingredients: Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane 5.00% w/w, Bemotrizinol 1.00% w/w, Octocrylene 8.00% w/w, Octyl Salicylate 5.00% w/w, Ethylhexyl Triazone 4.00% w/w, Methylene Bis-benzotriazolyl\nPreservatives: Phenoxyethanol, 1,2-hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\nCancer Council Face Day Wear Fluid\nActive Ingredients: Homosalate 8% w/w, Octocrylene 6% w/w, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane 5% w/w, Ethylhexyl Triazone 4% w/w, Methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol 2% w/w, Bemotrizinol 1% w/w\nPreservatives: Phenoxyethanol, 1,2-hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n(Source: Cancer Council webpage)\n\nVitamin C Fluid has 8% octocrylene (UVA and UVB) where as Face Day Wear has 6%. No Homosalate (UVB) in the Vitamin C Fluid but has the addition of Octyl Salicylate (UVB).\n\nTexture:\nVitamin C Fluid seems a tad runnier and absorbs/dries down faster than the Face Day Wear Fluid.\n\nFirst impression:\nNote that I have oily combo skin.\nTried wearing them on my face with 2 pumps of each sunscreen on each side of my face. The side with the Vitamin C seems to spread  and absorbs nicely onto the skin and has a nice velvet finish to it (similar to the Hamilton everyday wear.) \n\nFace Day Wear Fluid also spreads nicely  but takes a little longer to absorb onto the skin. Has a slightly heavier feel on the face compared to the Vitamin C Fluid.\nBOTH sunscreens made my eyes teary in a mild way but I am already used to it😛.\n\nIn conclusion, I prefer the texture and wear of the Vitamin C Fluid for my oily combo skin over the Face Day Wear Fluid. Both are great sunscreens not gonna lie. The Face Day Wear Fluid has always been my go to sunscreen but will be replacing it with the Vitamin C since I already have it.\nFor the price of $24.95 for 50ml, I could get the Hamilton Everyday wear for $9 for a similar finish🤔🤔🤔. \n\nNo mention on the type of Vitamin C derivatives used on their packaging or website. If anyone knows please do let us know!\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "**TL;DR: Don't fuck up like me. Make sure your moisturizer, primer, and foundation all have the same base or you will regret it.** \n\nOk, I know that this topic has come up a lot recently, but I feel like a lot of discussions leave out a key part of the problem. By now, I think most people know that you have to make sure your primer and foundation have the same base i.e. are they water based or silicone based. It makes sense since those two are layered one on top of the other and if they're immiscible then the foundation will just settle on top and come off on everything, defeating the purpose of a primer. Now, what I haven't seen discussed is how your moisturizer may be interacting with your primer and foundation. I've discovered some interesting things through trial and error recently and wanted to share it with the MUA community.\n\nFirst, I recently switched moisturizers. My skin has been a disaster this winter and I needed a major skincare overhaul. I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has always had my back with great products that don't irritate my skin. One of the new things I got was a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, the [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/hydro+boost+water+gel.do?sortby=ourPicks). I love this product because it absorbs quickly, eliminated my dry spots, and hasn't caused any irritation. What I didn't take into account when I bought this product was the ingredients list; I was just happy to find a non-irritating hyaluronic acid delivery system. \n\nwater, **dimethicone**, glycerin, **dimeticone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer**, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, dimethiconol, C13-14 isoparaffin, **dimethicone crosspolymer**, chlorphenesin, carbomer, laureth-7, sodium hyaluronate, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance, C12-14 pareth-12, sodium hydroxide, blue 1 \n\nThe bolded ingredients indicate it's a silicone-based primer. Yes, the first ingredient is water, but the silicone is present in large amounts, and it interacts differently with water-based products.\n\nMistake 1: I was going for a low-effort look one day and decided to used some of my face powder and call it good. With face powder I usually wear my [NYX HD Primer](http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/high-definition-primer/NYX_180.html) because it's lighter but still holds the powder in place. That day my makeup was slipping and sliding everywhere and I looked like a cakey hot mess when I got home. I checked the ingredients on my moisturizer, found all the silicone, then looked at the primer ingredients. \n\n**Water/Aqua/Eau,** Propylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Diethylhexyl Maleate, Glycerin, Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, PEG-15 Glyceryl Isostearate, Trihydroxystearin, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Tocopheryl Acetate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Cera Carnauba/Cire de Carnauba, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Silica, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin,  Propylene Glycol Stearate, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Laurate, Propylene Glycol Laurate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Salicornia Herbacea Extract, Copper Tripeptide-1,  Chlorphenesin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, C12-14 Pareth-7, Amodimethicone,  Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance/Parfum, Citronellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. MAY CONTAIN / PEUT CONTENIR (+/-): Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Chromium Hydroxide Green (CI 77289), Ultramarines (CI 77007).\n\nThe water-based primer just sat on top of my moisturizer, making my makeup come off all over everything.\n\nMistake 2: I somehow spaced and forgot all about my moisturizer issues and yesterday I was rushing to leave and decided to just throw on some Sonia Kashuk Radiant Tinted Moisturizer and go. Wrong move. I had already washed my face and moisturized previously, so the Neutrogena moisturizers was under the tinted moisturizer. As I was rubbing the tinted moisturizer on my face, it started to ball up and look disgusting. I quickly wiped it off and left bare faced, but later I looked at the ingredients in the Sonia Kashuk Tinted Moisturizer. \n\nFluorphlogopite, Sorbitan Is Os Tearate,\nTris Iloxane, D Is Teardimonium Hectorite,\nCetyl Peg/Ppg‐10/1 D Imethicone,\nD Imethicone Cros S Polymer, Butylene Glycol,\nSilica D Imethyl Silylate, Synthetic Bees Wax,\nTetras Odium Ed Ta, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium\nChloride, Alcohol, Talc, Peg‐30\nD Ipolyhydroxys Tearate, Aluminum\nHydroxide, Potas S Ium Sorbate, Stearic Acid,\nCaprylyl Methicone, As Corbyl Palmitate,\nTocopherol, Pentaerythrityl Tetra‐Di‐T‐Butyl\nHydroxyhydrocinnamate.\nMay Contain: Mica, Titanium D Ioxide, Iron\nOxides , Zinc Oxide.\n\nThis one is a little more tricky, as it does have some dimethicone ingredients, but my best guess is that the other ingredients react negatively with the ingredients in the Neutrogena moisturizer.\n \nNow, I know this sounds like using the Neutrogena moisturizer is too much of a pain, but it's really not that big of a deal. My favorite primer, the [ELF Poreless Face Primer](http://www.elfcosmetics.com/p/poreless-face-primer?dept=face-faceprimer), works perfectly with this moisturizer and my HG foundation, [Revlon Colorstay Whipped](http://www.revlon.com/products/face/foundation-makeup/revlon-colorstay-whipped-creme-makeup#309971347054||0), goes on better than ever. I just wanted to make this post to inform people that mismatched moisturizer can cause just as many issues as mismatched primer and foundation!",

Reviewing FormulaRX Barrier Relief Moisturiser\n \n* Texture and consistency:  It sinks right in the skin and has a gel like texture. It doesn’t feel heavy nor makes me sweat on application unlike other moisturisers make me do. I loved the fact it’s so lightweight and has the gel consistency.\n\n* Effect/ Result: to be very honest, when I first started using this moisturiser, I felt like it was breaking me out, at one point I even stopped using the moisturiser for a while because I was just upset. I loved the texture so much but had been doubting if it’s breaking me out. But later I realised it wasn’t the moisturiser, it was just my usual hormonal acne. I’ve been using it for 2 months and lately it has been working just fine. \n\n• It has 4% niacinamide, confirmed with brand. I had thought of using it as an alternative to a niacinamide serum, but didn’t show any added visible effects.\n\n* Would not repurchase because: \n1. The price, 699 for a 50 g basic moisturiser?!?!\n2. It does it’s job, moisturises my face. Nothing exceptional about it and honestly the Minimalist moisturiser does the same thing for a lesser price.\n3. It makes my face extremely oily and greasy in an hour. My face looks extremely dull. I wouldn’t use it in day time.\n\n•PROS.\nThe thing I love the most about this moisturiser is its consistency and lightweight feature but then the fact it makes my face oily AF is a bummer :(\n\nCute packaging: I’m a sucker for pastel colours and aesthetics and gohd I love the tube in my skincare cabinet, looks so pretty ✨\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS \nLike I’ve been mentioning again and again, I really wanted to love this moisturiser but the price point and lack of any exceptional feature wouldn’t make me purchase it again. \n\nMinimalist Sepicalm 3% + Oat Moisturizer\n\nReview Type: RAVE\n\nPrice: Rs. 345-349 for 50 g\n\nUsage Time: 4 Months, every night and sometimes day too\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Squalane, Glycerine, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Cocoyl Aminoacids, Sarcosine, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Avena Sativa (Oat Kernel) Flour, Sodium Polyglutamate, Undecane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopherol Acetate, Arginine, Glycine, Alanine, Histidine, Sodium Lactate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tridecane, Aluminium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Trehalose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n* It has a creamy texture and is quite a thick moisturiser for an extremely oily skin person like me.\n\n* It does not have any actives and I can layer it on top on any active I use, is the fact I love this moisturiser.\n\n* It is decently priced, would definitely repurchase it. \n\n* I’ve used it under makeup and it has worked wonders since the makeup didn’t cause any breakout or any dryness or flakiness.\n\n* I’ve been using it since July, taking a pea sized amount every-night and still have almost 3/5 left, a little goes a long way for me which makes it super affordable. \n\n* I think it’s safe for me to call it my HG moisturiser. It has never broken me out or caused any CCs or any another issue.\n* Literally soothed me, I had been using pulp vit C earlier which was quite strong and potent, Sepicalm moisturiser came handy every time\n\nCONS\n* it’s thick and greasy\n\n* Does not sink in skin immediately unlike the FormulaRX one. It sits on skin for a while\n\n* Makes me sweat after application \n\n* Cannot use it in day (except under makeup)\n\nWhy do I still use it\n- No matter what texture it has, it has soothed my acne, vit C burn, and improved overall skin texture.\n\n- I love the price point \n\n- I use it at night so I don’t worry about how I look, all I care is how well it works. And it does work for me!\n\nI know we’ve missed detailed reviews on this sub here so here’s one from me, more coming in!\nHope y’all find it helpful :)",

It’s an apples to oranges comparison. One is a ceramide moisturiser which has 3 ceramides + phytosphingosine + niacinamide. This usually comes in very expensive creams.\n\nMinimalist on the other hand is the basic moisturiser\n\nIt’s a difference in needs and wants regarding which one would be preferred by a user.",

The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

I compared the two products' ingredient lists, and noticed some big differences.\n\n> **Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm**: Water, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tapioca Starch, Triceteareth-4 Phosphate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol , Piroctone Olamine, Fragrance.\n\n> **Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating+**: Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 MA Crosspolymer, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, DMDM Hydantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Stearic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Panthenol, Sodium Lactate, Triethanolamine, Sodium PCA, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 1\n\nThe first thing that jumped out at me was the inclusion of silicone compounds in the Dove shave balm.  It contains cyclopentasiloxane and dimethicone.  Silicones are absent from the Nivea balm.  This is a pro or a con, depending on your skin type and the base of your foundation.  \n\nThe second thing I noticed that I liked was the inclusion of ceramides in the Dove balm.  However, they're mostly on the tail end of the list, so it's hard to say how much is actually in the products, and if it is present enough to do any good.  Certainly can't hurt.\n\nThe Nivea balm has the benefit of having tapioca starch in it's formulation, which can be good for oil, and it has Witch Hazel extract.  Both balms have pretty good ingredients.  Neither contains drying alcohol.\n\nSo I purchased it.  When I got home, I washed my face, moisturized as normal, then put the Dove balm on the left side of my face and the Nivea balm on the right side.  I eschewed all other primers.  I dabbed a little Maybelline FitMe concealer under my eyes, and used a RT sponge to apply some L'Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte.  The foundation went on very smoothly and did not cake up or pill.  I set it with NYC loose powder.  I added some blush and bronzer for some depth, then I went about my day.\n\nSix hours later, I surveyed the first round of results.  Aside from my foundation being rubbed off of the tip and bottom of my nose (got the flu), both sides looked okay.  I did noticed, however, that the foundation on the right side of my face was more textured.  I could see my pores way clearer than the other side of my face.  Both sides were moderately oily.  The left side of my face was holding up somewhat better than the right side.  I noticed fewer flakes around the dry spots of my face on the left side.  At eight hours, all of these observations were more pronounced.  I noticed more oil on the right side, enough that my pores were \"shining\" with oil.  It was odd.  Neither side looked bad, however.  But for me, the left side (Dove) was winning out in the overall appearance category.  \n\nSo, for my initial testing, Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating did better than Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm, as a foundation primer.  Both have pretty good ingredients, both are alcohol free, and each can serve certain skin types better than the other.  Cheers! ",

    "body": "Nitong nakaraang mga araw may isang Tiktok content creator ang inulan ng comments sa kanyang Tiktok page dahil diumano sa hindi magandang paraan o istilo ng pagrereview ng sunscreen na ito. Dahil dito , naisipan kong bilhin at subukan itong sunscreen na ito. \n\nUna sa lahat, binili ko itong sunscreen na ito sa tingin kong official store nitong Worada sunscreen na ito. Ito yung store na may Worada din sa pangalan. Dito din sa store na ito binili nung content creator na binanggit ko kanina. Yung B1T1 na yung binili ko, yung isa sa usage test, yung isa naman e sa gagawin kong test sa lab. May kasama din pala itong freebie na Whitening Antiperspirant and Deodorant Cream (isusunod ko itong i-review). \n\nSimulan ko muna sa packaging. Yung packaging nito ay 50 g Cosmetic Pouch with spout. Ito ay gawa sa BOPP/VMPET/LLDPE/Aluminum Foil na sinadya para maprotektahan ng husto ang laman na sunscreen. Ito yung isa sa mga usual na material na ginagamit sa paggawa ng mga cosmetic pouch. Makikita din sa packaging na gawa pala ang Worada Sunscreen sa China. \n\nHindi ko nakita sa packaging ng sunscreen na ito yung mandatory warning para sa mga sunscreen na dapat present sa mga sunscreen products na binebenta sa ASEAN: Do not stay too long under the sun, even when using a cosmetic product. \n\nSa paggamit naman. Pagkabukas ko pa lang ng sachet nitong Worada sunscreen, naamoy ko na agad yung fragrance nito. Amoy milky floral ang fragrance na ginamit dito. Ang laman na sunscreen ay isang cream na off-white na may hint ng dilaw ang kulay (mas maputi ng kaunti sa evap na gatas). Kapag inilagay na sa daliri, nagbe-break na agad ang emulsion at nagiging matubig o runny, kagaya nung sa video review. Noong ipinahid ko ang 2-finger lengths nitong sunscreen, una kong napansin e masyadong maputi yung sunscreen para sa skin tone ko. Tinagalan ko na ang pagbe-blend nito sa buong mukha at leeg ko, pero sa huli halata pa din ang whitecast. Nasabihan pa nga ako ng kasama ko sa lab na nagsusumigaw yung sunscreen ko sa mukha. \n\nNgayon sa ingredients naman. Ito ang ingredients nitong Worada sunscreen:\n\nMilk, Aqua, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Titanium Dioxide, Glycereth-26, Potassium Laurel Phosphate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Isohexadecane, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polysorbate-80, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Niacinamide, Trehalose, Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Parfum\n\nUnahin na natin ang UV-Filters. May tatlo na UV-Filters ang Worada Sunscreen:\n\n* Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB) \n\n* Ethylhexyl Salicylate (UVB) \n\n* Titanium Dioxide (UVB) \n\nBabalikan ko ito mamaya para mai-relate sa product claim nitong sunscreen. \n\nAng pinakaunang ingredient sa IL nito ay Milk. Maling entry na naman. Lac (Milk) ang tamang INCI name kung naglagay ng gatas as ingredient. \n\nRelated naman ang gatas sa susunod kong punto. Gumamit ng Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, at Propylparaben itong sunscreen na ito bilang preservative system. Angkop itong preservative system na ito, dahil ang taas ng ginamit na Milk sa formulation na ito. Nararapat lang na broad spectrum preservative system ang gamitin. \n\nPreservative Efficacy:\n\nParabens: Yeast and molds; Gram(+) bacteria\n\nPhenoxyethanol: Yeast and molds; Gram(-) bacteria\n\nRegarding sa safety ng parabens (methyl, propyl), approved for use pa yan ng regulatory bodies ng ASEAN at EU, basta masunod lang ang maximum allowed concentration. Pakitingnan na lang sa pic yung statement ng SCCS, ang committee na inaatasan ng EU na magsagawa ng safety assessments ng mga ingredients kagaya ng parabens. Pero kung isa ka sa mga nakakaranas ng contact dermatitis dahil sa pagiging sensitive ng iyong balat sa parabens, mabuting iwasan na lang ang mga produktong gumagamit nitong mga preservatives na ito. \n\nSunod, may laman naman itong mga ingredients na moisturizing sa balat: \n\n* Glycerin (humectant) \n\n* Trehalose (humectant) \n\nPara naman sa whitening:\n* Milk\n\n* Niacinamide\n\nMay antioxidant din: Tocopheryl Acetate\n\nSunod nating tingnan ang product claims ng Worada sunscreen:\n\n* SPF 60 PA+++ UVA-UVB Protection\n\n* Invisible\n\n* Waterproof\n\n* Sweat Resistant\n\n* Lsolate Skin (nasa harap, di ko naintindihan kung anuman ito) \n\n* Whitening\n\n* Moisturizing\n\nSa SPF claim, hindi ko mawari kung papaano nasabi ng brand na ito na may UVA protection ito, samantalang yung tatlong UV-filter nito e puro UVB protection ang kayang ibigay. Dagdag pa, wala pa akong nakikitang SPF test report para sa Worada sunscreen na ipinakita ng brand owner sa kanilang soc med accounts. Kung meron man, makikicomment na lang sa baba. \n\nSa claim na invisible, hindi naman invisible e. Kitang kitanang white cast e. \n\nSa water proof claim, hindi pwede ang water proof claim. Water resistance ang tamang ilagay jan. At kailangang may patunay na tinest ito, kesyo ito ay 40 min or 80 min water resistance. Ganoon din sa sweat resistance. May test din para jan, either 40 min o 80 min, kagaya ng water resistance. \n\nYung Lsolate Skin na claim na nasa harapan, malay ko jan. Kailangang i-clarify ng brand owner yan. \n\nSa claim na moisturizing at whitening, meron namang ingredients na laman ang sunscreen para masabi kahit papano na pasok ang claim nila. Ang concern ko lang e yung paggamit ng Milk. Matumal ang mga studies kung sa nakakapagpaputi ang gatas. Tapos, takaw-mikrobyo pa yan. Mabuti na nga lang, ginamitan ng broad spectrum preservative system. Pero kung mahina ang preservative system nito, madaling masisira ang product na ito. \n\nFinal words:\n\nMarami akong concerns na nakita sa product na ito. Una na jan yung kung SPF-tested ba talaga ito. Pangalawa yung claim na may UVA protection, pero malabo base sa mga UV filters na ginamit. Ikatlo, yung mga unallowed (water proof) at unsupported (water resistant at sweat resistant) claims. Yang tatlo na yan, major red flags na agad dahil hindi tama na magki-claim para sa product na hindi pa naman nagtetest. Palaging tandaan, sa mga product claims, laging dapat may kaakibat yan na substantiation. Kasi napakadali gumawa ng product claims, ang mahirap e patunayan kung tunay ba talaga yan. Performance-wise, hindi para sa akin itong sunscreen na ito, dahil ayoko ng whitecast. \n\nAbangan ang Part 2 para sa mga isasagawa kong mga test sa lab. \n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbasa. \n",

Kaya ang saya na may mga katulad niyo na nagpo-pop up lately! \n\nThanks for the detailed info—honestly, nakakainis yung mga locals online na nagkakalat ng misinformation or kulang sa research, so seeing someone credible like you is really refreshing. I hope you consider uploading videos on TikTok or any video platform, too! Would love to see your reviews, tests, and opinions reach a larger audience. That’s all.

Previously reviewed in a prior post about trying Muji travel size skincare. Milky texture. Its drying and smells like citrus due to the essential oil. WNR. Feels drying on my skin. Maybe someone with oily skin would like it more.\n\nIngredients: Water, 1, 3-propanediol, fine titanium oxide, talc, dimethicone, concentrated glycerin, sugar squalane, 2-pentanediol, lipophilic glyceryl stearate, behenyl alcohol, PEG stearate, POE (20) sorbitan oleate, PEG (80), lavender extract-1, chamomilla extract-1, calendula officinalis extract, tangerine peel extract, kiwi extract, oleoyl phytosphingosine, alanine, Arginine, sodium L-glutamate, serine, proline, sodium hyaluronate-2, dipentaerythrityl hexaoxystearate, POP methyl glucoside, BG, ethylhexyl glycerin, beeswax, polyhydroxystearic acid, isostearic acid, aluminum hydroxide, hydrated silicic acid, potassium hydroxide, xanthan gum, starch-sodium acrylate graft polymer, sodium alginate, citric acid, sodium citrate, natural vitamin E, fragrance\n\n**2. Rohto Mentholatum - Hada Labo Koi-Gokujyun Perfect Gel.** Travel size that I got at a random convenience store while in Japan. Soft gel-like texture. Good in humid weather. Not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. Its a decent moisturizer for me in the daytime in the summer. WNR. Again, maybe someone with oily skin may benefit more from this gel.\n\nIngreditents: Water, BG, glycerin, hydroxyethyl urea, pentylene glycol, PPG-10 methyl glucose, triethyl hexanoin, squalane, (acryloyl dimethyl taurine ammonium / VP) copolymer, behenyl alcohol, acetyl hyaluronic acid Na (super hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid Na, hydrolysed hyaluronic acid (nano-ized hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid hydroxypropyl trimonium (skin-adsorbed hyaluronic acid), hydrolyzed collagen, glucosylceramide (ceramide), suizenzino-polysaccharide (Sakuran), dimethicone, PPG-17 butes -17, triethyl citrate, cyclopentasiloxane, phenoxyethanol, succinic acid 2Na, dimethicone crosspolymer, agarten, EDTA-2Na, succinic acid, α-glucan, acrylate copolymer ammonium , Methyl paraben\n\n**3. Kansosan Medical Highly Moisturizing Cream.** A buttery and moisturizing cream. While shopping at Donki, I googled what is the best Japanese cream for dry and sensitive skin and Kansosan was suggested so I bought it to try. \n\nIts fantastic on my dry skin. It sinks in upon application but also coats my skin with a layer of moisturizing protection. Ive been using it for 2 days now and all I can think about is how amazing this would be for winters. Im gonna stock up when I go back to Japan. I think I found my holy grail moisturizer. I need to try other products from this brand. \n\nThis cream is like the better formulated version of the Kikumasamune sake cream and the Purito Dermide sleeping pack. Plus Kansosan doesnt smell bad. People who enjoy thick moisturizers like the Illiyoon and Aestura would like this cream.\n\nIngredients: Heparin-like substance\\*, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate\\*, Purified Water, Glycerin, Methylphenyl Polysiloxane, Cross-linked Methyl Polysiloxane, Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, 1,3-Butanediol, Methyl Polysiloxane, Polyethylene Glycol-Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, 2-Ethylhexyl Dodecanol, 1,2-Pentanediol, Poly(Oxyethylene-Oxypropylene) Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, Isostearic Acid Hardened Oil, Anhydrous Magnesium Sulfate, α-Olefin Oligomer, Sodium Citrate, Glycerol Mono-2-Ethylhexyl Ether, Sodium Metabisulfite, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Citric Acid, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Sodium Phosphate, Vaseline, Glycosyl Squalane, L-Arginine, Hydrogenated Soybean Phospholipid, Plant Sterols, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Water Soluble Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Polyethylene Glycol Octyl Dodecyl Ether, Plant Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate (2), \n\n\\*denotes \"Active Ingredient\", no symbol denotes \"Other Ingredients\"  \n",

    "body": "Hey y’all. I was reading this 2020 article called “[Are Beauty Brands Intentionally Hiding Their Ingredients?](https://jessicadefino.substack.com/p/are-beauty-brands-intentionally-hiding-their-ingredients-694b38f0f11d?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true)” by Jessica Defino, and she lists some examples of beauty brands who have hidden their ingredients online in the past or still today.\n\nI have also noticed this happen in the “Clean Beauty” space. I find this to be very sketchy and will not support brands who engage in these practices personally. Here are some examples from the article\n\n* **La Prarie:** *“In my opinion, brands who do not display their ingredients are most definitely doing this intentionally”… Sometimes, it’s to protect profits. “If you’re going to spend $300 on a single product, you are more likely to read all the information provided because it’s not an impulse buy,” Parr explains. If said product includes, say, possibly-carcinogenic butylated hydroxytoluene and potentially-hormone-disrupting parabens (as is the case with* [*La Prairie Skin Caviar*](https://www.laprairie.com/default/gift-guide-2019/luxe-cream/95790-01251-94.html?ncr=true&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6Lm-ue_t5QIVA6SzCh11QAO1EAQYASABEgIoNfD_BwE)*, $510, the ingredients of which are not available on La Prairie’s site), consumers may be quicker to ask questions and slower to spend money.*\n* **Beauty Blender:** *“The brand has chosen not to disclose the contents of its* [*Bounce Foundation*](https://beautyblender.com/collections/foundation/products/bounce-1-40-n) *on its site, save to say they’re made with “all of the good” and “none of the bad.” This gives the impression that the products are very nice and safe. In reality, Beautyblender formulates with talc (*[*asbestos*](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/talc) *contamination is a concern, leading many cosmetics corporations to “*[*quietly move away from*](https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/beauty-brands-moving-talc-cancer-lawsuits-mount-200609194041998.html)*” formulating with the ingredient), PEGs (created through ethoxylation, a method that uses ethylene oxide, a known carcinogen, and can result in contamination from 1,4 dioxane, another known carcinogen), and fragrance”* (update: BB appears to now be listing the ingredients for this foundation!) \n\nI also noticed that this sub’s [recent villain](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/1f6whjk/comment/ll3bor8/), **Sahi Cosmetics**, touts a “[Clean Beauty Promise](https://sahicosmetics.com/pages/clean-beauty-promise)” with ingredients that will “NEVER” be in their products. A redditor commented a couple weeks ago that  lots of the products on the Sahi Cosmetics site don’t have ingredients listed, so I used the wayback machine and found that the ingredients *used* to be listed. Many contain ingredients that they say they \"NEVER\" use, which makes me suspect that the ingredients might have been hidden for this reason? Some examples:\n\n* **Carbon Black** appears present in the 'Snatched and Glowing' Eye & Face Kit -- the Precise FeltTip Liner specifically \n* **Aluminum Salts** appear to be present in the Under Eye Creamy Concealer (Aluminum Hydroxide  is an emulsifier and pH adjuster, and can fall into the aluminum salts category. Additionally, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate falls under aluminum salts)\n* **Aluminum Salts** also appear to be present in some of the baked blushes ( Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, and Calcium Sodium Borosilicate all contain aluminum compounds)\n* **SLES** (Sodium Laureth Sulfate) and **Mineral Oil** are present in the Waterproof Mascara (Paraffin is a type of mineral oil; plus Microcrystalline Wax (Cera Microcristallina)).\n* Many of these products contain **Phenoxyethanol** (okay if it’s less than 1%, but the concentration is not listed) and **Titanium Dioxide**, which if in neoparticle form would also be a violation of the clean beauty initiative (but it’s unclear what form it is in). \n* **Talc:** it’s also worth noting that the Baked Blushes, which do not have ingredients currently listed on the website, also contain Talc. I think most of us are aware of the risk of Talc contamination (even if small) when it comes to private labeled goods, and this is an ingredient that many consumers will want to know is in the products or not. \n\nDoes anyone have other examples to share that I can add to my list of brands who appear to have hidden their full ingredients from consumers, or brands claiming to be “Clean” but still using ingredients that are no-nos? Please share if so",

    "body": "I'm someone who is deeply interested in the ingredients used in personal care products (especially baby products). I recently took a list of 40+ (I lost track at some point) of the most popular baby wipes and looked at every single one of the ingredients. I cross-referenced medical journals, studies, and databases from the EU and US to analyze the ingredients.\n\n﻿If you're interested, you can find the [full list of 40+ baby wipes and their ingredients](https://glowingnest.com/baby-wipes/) analyzed here and ranked from best to worst. \n\n﻿Here's what I found:\n\n**There's no such thing as \"biodegradable\" baby wipes:** This one bummed me out. While a lot of wipes say they're biodegradable, because of the way landfills are designed (a lack of oxygen, light and moisture﻿﻿﻿—crucial components of decomposition) they won't break down in any reasonable amount of time. And they won't break down in the sewer, either.\n\n﻿**Never flush baby wipes**: Even if the wipes say they're flushable, don't flush them.﻿﻿ Ever heard of a fatberg? They're a huge mass of grease, hair, dental floss wipes, etc. that combine into a huge mass in the sewer system. They recently pulled a [40 ton fatberg out of the London sewer system](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/29/bus-sized-fatberg-cleared-from-london-sewer). Please don't flush wipes.\n\n﻿**Materials used:** Most brands disclose the material used in the wipes, but many do not.\n\nThe four main materials wipes are made of are:\n\n* **Polypropylene** is essentially plastic—the same plastic used in most disposable diapers.\n* **Polyester** is also plastic.\n* **Viscose** is made from wood pulp. This wood pulp is highly processed and often bleached, but is better than polypropylene and polyester.\n* **Cotton** has started to find its way into the baby wipes market with newer brands. Some brands even use organic cotton.\n\n﻿**Ingredients to avoid in baby wipes:**\n\nThe following list of ingredients should be avoided when shopping for baby wipes. Our listings make sure that none of these ingredients exist in the product. If they do, they will receive a bad rating.\n\n* **Polysorbate 20** – Treated with ethelyne oxide, which can be contaminated with 1,4 dioxane, a highly toxic chemical that is linked to organ toxicity and cancer.\n* **Parabens** – Toxic preservatives that have been linked to breast cancer, hormonal disruption and skin irritation. Anything ending in “-paraben” such as *methylparaben*, *ethylparaben* and *butylparaben* is included.\n* **Phenoxyethanol** – Considered to be a less toxic preservative, but still linked to skin irritation and eczema.\n* **Sodium Benzoate** – A chemical preservative that’s inconclusively safe. Studies have linked the chemical to ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) but that likely only applies to sodium benzoate when used as a food preservative. It’s also controversial due to its ability to turn into toxic benzene when mixed with ascorbic acid (a derivative of vitamin C).\n* **Fragrance** – Seeing *fragrance* on a label is never a good thing. This is used as an umbrella term used for hundreds of chemicals that don’t need to be disclosed. It’s also often mixed with phthalates—linked with endocrine disruption, lowered sperm counts in males, and thyroid disorders in females.\n* **Propylene glycol** – A petroleum-based chemical typically linked with skin irritation and kidney issues when used internally. While this compound is broken down in the body, infants’ ability to do this is much lower than an adult. Because of this, we believe avoiding this chemical is better.\n* **Polyethylene glycol (PEG)** – Petroleum-based penetration enhancer that can be contaminated with  1,4-dioxane, a possible human carcinogen and ethylene oxide, a known carcinogen. Anything that starts with “PEG-” is included.\n* **Triclosan** – Another preservative linked to endocrine disruption, eye and skin irritation, and is very toxic to aquatic organisms.\n* **Tocopheryl acetate** – This is a synthetic version of vitamin E, used as a preservative in skincare. The issue is that it’s sometimes contaminated with  hydroquinone, a skin-lightening agent that’s banned in the UK, EU, Japan and Australia. This chemical is a skin irritant and possible carcinogen.\n\n**Note on preservatives:** While it's easy to hate on preservatives, in some products—like baby wipes—they're crucial. I found one brand that uses no preservatives at all (Dyper) and I could never recommend them for that reason. Baby wipes are essentially water and paper, which is a breeding ground for bacteria and mold when no preservatives are used. If a brand doesn't list any preservative, it either means they aren't using any, or they're not disclosing the ones they *are* using, which is a bad sign.\n\n﻿**Beware of WaterWipes:** WaterWipes are a popular brand amongst health-conscious mamas because they advertise themselves as being just \"*water and grapefruit seed extract*\". However, in 2020 they changed the ingredient listing to include \"﻿*trace of benzalkonium chloride*\" as a preservative. This is a well-recognized irritant and contact allergen, and therefore I'd recommend other brands over WaterWipes.\n\n﻿Let me know if you want me to do any other guides.",

Parabens have been proven to be safe when used in the correct concentrations and are the best preservatives for water-based products. \n\nPhenoxyethanol, when used as a preservative in certain concentrations is no longer linked to irritation (skin and eye products). \n\nAnecdotally, water wipes were recommended to us both at the hospital and by the lactation consultant and are the only wipes that don’t cause diaper rash in my baby. \n\nBenzalkonium chloride is used extensively as a disinfectant in many products, especially right now as it is effective at fighting the virus that causes COVID-19.

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm thinking doing creams or gels next. =) Thank you everybody for the comments, glad to see the time I spent making these posts is helping some of you!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Oils & Gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6dqq7/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing_oils_gels/)\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams & Foams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6fso3/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing/)",

    "body": "This isn't a new product (to me or the sub) but I rarely see it talked about, so I figured I would give it a review. I've been using this cleansing oil on and off for about 18 months.\n\n**Skin type:** I'm in my 30s, and my skin is generally oily (formerly dehydrated/oily), but has recently become a lot more dry due to the dry winter weather and prescription tretinoin use. My primary skin concerns run a wide gamut - I'm focused on anti-aging because of my age, but I also have acne, clogged pores, PIH, and melasma. My skin is very, very clog prone. Basically, my skin is a \"special snowflake\" that thinks the world should tremble in fear.\n\n**Location/weather:** I live in the Mid-Atlantic area of the US, so the weather is hot and humid in the summer, and cold and dry in the winter.\n\n**Other first cleansers I have tried:**\n\n* Heimish All Clean Balm\n* LJH Dr's Care Cleansing Oil\n* Whamisa Organic Flowers Cleansing Oil\n\nI have also, in the past, tried traditional OCM with mineral oil. It did not go well (lots of clogs), and in general, I now try to avoid cleansing oils with mineral oil in them, hence why I haven't tried some of the more popular cleansing oils on this sub. The LJH Dr's Care also contains mineral oil, and also didn't go over well with my skin.\n\nAnyway, onto the actual review.\n\n**Ingredients (copied from Ulta.com):** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Bis-Ethoxydiglycol Cyclohexane 1,4-Dicarboxylate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Water, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Black Sugar Extract, Sodium Pca, Betaine, Threonine, Sorbitol, Proline, Lysine, Lepidium Meyenii Root Extract, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Alanine, Butylene Glycol, Cholesterol, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Serine, Glycine, Alcohol Denat., Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Ceramide Np, Sarcodon Aspratus Extract, Sucrose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium Edta.\n\n**Price:** This oil cleanser is easily found on tons of websites. I most often buy from Amazon, and pay about $14-15 USD for a 200mL bottle.\n\n**Smell:** This oil smells *strongly* of lemon, with the faint hint of sugar. The smell is very noticeable on application, but once the cleanser is rinsed off, it dissipates completely. I happen to like the smell, but others may find it a little too reminiscent of Lemon Pledge.\n\n**Texture:** This cleansing oil seems rather thin - it seems to be slightly thinner and less viscous than vegetable oil. Sometimes this is annoying, as I have to use a little more oil than I'd like to really massage my face well without pulling my skin (3 pumps or so).\n\n**Cleansing Power:** In my opinion, this oil cleanser does a fantastic job with face makeup and sunscreen. It does not excel with waterproof eyeliner and mascara - it will remove some but not all waterproof eye makeup. I, however, do not like to use this on my eyes. I wear contact lenses and it always causes them to get milky, making it difficult to see. The cloudy residue lasts several hours. I do not know if this would impact someone who doesn't wear contacts. However, with face makeup and sunscreen, as well as with some superficial clogs, this oil cleanser does a great job. I sometimes, but not routinely, feel grits coming out of my skin. It does not help break up deeper clogs or closed-head blemishes.\n\n**Emulsification:** This stuff turns pretty darned white when mixed with water. I make sure to rinse all traces of it off my face so I don't see any of the cleanser, especially near my hairline. It emulsifies and rinses off easily, and doesn't leave any feeling of residue on my face. I always follow with a second cleanser, but I do not feel a film or greasiness with this cleanser. It also doesn't make my skin feel tight or dry - just clean.\n\n**Overall:** I really like this cleanser and have repurchased it many times. At the price point, it does what I need it to do. It breaks down the face makeup (Mac Studio Fix Fluid or Estee Lauder Double wear, topped with Innisfree powder) and my sunscreen (La Roche Posay Ultra Fluid). It rinses cleanly, and it is inexpensive and easy to find. I don't expect **any** cleanser to address aging concerns, or to meaningfully use acids. Any claims of brightening from a cleanser are probably worthless, since the product isn't on your face long enough to do any meaningful chemical exfoliation. This cleanser is best at what it does not do: it doesn't create new acne for me and it doesn't irritate my skin.\n\nIt is probably not my favorite of all oil cleansers. Right now that would be Whamisa, which is great, but expensive, and which also doesn't seem to penetrate pores as deeply as the Skinfood cleanser. Skinfood Black Sugar Perfect Cleansing Oil is a great choice that I will probably continue to buy it, especially since it's easy to get in the United States. I think it's an excellent pick for a first cleanser that isn't based on mineral oil, but only if you are not sensitive to fragrances.",

    "body": "I am a hairdresser and have been doing Brazilian hair blow-drying in a salon for years. Evaporation of the product during blow-drying burns my eyes, my throat burns, sometimes I feel a burning sensation in my chest, I get headaches and sometimes migraines (I have had migraines for many years, but I noticed that I get them more often when I do more Brazilian treatments) , even some customers shed tears and have to keep their eyes closed while blow-drying. \n\n   \nI’ve never thought too much about the toxicity of the product, so I googled a bit and found a few articles that write about the dangers of the contents of Brazilian treatment products, so I decided to share with you some of the substances found in CHOCOCOCO  and their side effects: \n\n* **Stearic Acid** \\- Inhalation may cause chemical pneumonitis  \n* **Behentrimonium chloride**  is considered toxic in concentrations of 0.1% and above and is suspected to cause skin and eye irritation. \n* **Phenoxyethanol** is actually very harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin, especially for breastfeeding or infants, It can also have an effect on the brain and central nervous system. If you are exposed to the product several times a day, every day, it can accumulate and probably have a bad effect on you. The American Cancer Society warns that formaldehyde is a known carcinogen. This means it can cause cancer or help cancer grow. Formaldehyde can also trigger other side effects. May be toxic in concentrations of 1% or less. Tests show that keratin treatments contain unsafe levels of formaldehyde and other chemicals. The FDA has received dozens of product complaints. One hairdresser, for example, said her treatments caused her migraines, blurred vision, sore throat, nausea and loss of smell. \n* **Glycolic acid**  shows some inhalation toxicity and can cause damage to the respiratory system, thymus and liver if they are present at very high levels over a long period of time. \n* **Coumarin**  is moderately toxic to the liver and kidneys. \n* **Benzyl benzoate** side effects: irritations of the skin, eyes, nose and throat that can cause severe symptoms such as burning, nausea, vomiting and damage to the liver and kidneys. \n\n Some manufacturers claim that their keratin treatment does not contain **formaldehyde**, although there are studies that state the opposite. \n\nI would just like to briefly explain the process of Brazilian blow-drying for those who do not know: \n\n1. Hair is washed with a special shampoo (from the manufacturer, of course) \n2. The product is applied to dry hair, after 20 min it is blow-dried  \n3. Blow-drying causes a strong and visible evaporation of the product, the steam of which goes straight into my face (after blow-drying, the whole salon stinks of it, and is in the fog)  \n4. Hair is ironed at 220'C (which causes evaporation, but not in such quantities)  \n5. After the treatment, the hair is washed with special shampoos (Again, from the manufacturer, of course) \n\nI just want to state that I am not a chemist nor am I knowledgeable in chemistry in any way so I hope if someone is educated in this field I would be grateful if you would leave an opinion, also I do not know the percentage of these substances because their website does not state it.  \n\nHere is a list of all the ingredients in their product: \n\n Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Keratin / Hydrolysed Keratin, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Beta Vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark / Leaf / Twig Extract, Calendula Officinalis (Marigold) Flower Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Behentrimonium Chloride, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii, Shea Butothera Evening Primrose) Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract, Maris Sal (Dead Sea Salt), Dehydroacetic Acid, Aloe (Vera) Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Squalane, Ascorbic Acid Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Fragrance, Retinyl Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Glycolic Acid, Coumarin, Linalool, Limonene, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate  \n\nThanks for reading and I will be grateful for any information and opinions <3",

Looking at Kerastase and Redken ingredients lists are generally way more frightening. I can’t see any really nasty things in the list- the nastiest ones are Coumarin, Linalool, Limonene, Alpha- isomethyl ionone and benzoyl salicylate. These are fragrances that are more allergenic than when the list just says fragrance or perfume ( the manufacturer has to write the most allergenic fragrances separately in the list). But again- all of these will be found in almost any salon hair products with fragrance- and in a lot of “ natural” products as well. Phenoxyethanol is in basically every product you buy for hair, body or face. It acts as a stabilizer or as a preservative in products and became highly popular when parabens got unpopular. It is generally considered safe in small concentrations ( under 1%) for adults. It’s not considered safe for children under age 3 and should not be used if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. It has nothing to do with Formaldehyde as far as I know. Again- phenoxyethanol is in almost any product, even in the most sensitive no perfume no color brands. If you have to avoid it I think you would be limited to raw oils and the baby products.\nOverall I think that the list looks very descent. With some quite good stuff in it as well.\nAlso FYI I’m not educated in this, so I’m by no means an expert- it’s just a weird hobby😅\n\nEdit: I would also recommend wearing a mask and glasses when using. It looks safe when applying normally to hair but it’s not meant to be inhaled/ go in the eyes of course.",

        "body": "While you’re not wrong that the traditional Brazilian blowout is very toxic and releases formaldehyde when heat is applied to the hair the initial time at the salon, I am not reading anything specifically in those ingredients you listed that would cause this process. Glycolic acid would be suspected if it were high on the list, because glyxolic acid and ingredients with similar names may consist of one of the first ingredients in a “new and improved” Brazilian blowout (which still releases formaldehyde, they tend to just be sneakier about their product claims). The ingredient list you posted doesn’t have those ingredients, from what I can tell (but hey, I’m not a chemist, so if anyone is an expert in that field, please chime in). \n\nBehentrimonium chloride is an extremely popular ingredient in many hair conditioners, both drugstore branded and professional. I haven’t heard any recent research regarding controversy with the ingredient, but it very well could only be toxic under certain circumstances of which I can’t attest to (such as applying heat and keratin with it). \n\nThe first ingredient is water, the next is a harmless emulsifier (which allows the cream to keep it from separating), the third ingredient is an animal protein that comes from animal hair/hooves/horns. It’s not a scary ingredient, it’s just a cheap protein compared to keratin. Then keratin, followed by a lot of essential oils (which I wouldn’t be surprised if they were the culprit here). Fragrances, especially ones as volatile as essential oils, *especially* when you mix a buttload of them, generally do not play well with being heated against the hair at 450F. The rest of the ingredients are comprised of ingredients that make up less than ~1%, like tiny fragrance ingredients (linalool, limonine), and preservatives to keep it from spoilage (benzyl salicylate). \n\nI would definitely discontinue that brand, especially because unless there are extra ingredients/steps in the treatment aside from that ingredient list, I’m not sure I understand how they are meant to last for 3-6 months on anyone. None of the ingredients to form any sort of lasting keratin bond to the hair appear to be in that ingredient list, and the ones that could potentially play any role are in such minutes qualities to almost be meaningless. The glycolic acid being near the end of the ingredient list suggests it’s much more likely that it was a minor pH adjustment to the formula, not any life-changing chemical reaction. It seems as if your salon is getting ripped off by whoever is promoting their line of keratin treatments to you. The Cezanne line is one of the better ingredient lists out there, but I’ve only been doing a deep dive (as a current stylist) on this treatment since right before I did one on myself. I did the long lasting Cezanne treatment and there is absolutely no smell at any point in the process. You just have to make sure when you rinse the product, you don’t rinse too much of it out before you pat-dry and blow dry or there won’t be enough keratin still on the hair to bond correctly.",

        "body": "i'd bet MONEY that the glycerin is the biggest factor, followed by the fact that there are so many more \"sealing\" type ingredients in the second one - the first one is probably doing a lot to reduce combing/brushing friction and static, using silicones to add in some shine, and adding a small amount of hold to help with manageability and frizz, while the second seems like it's more trying to hold onto actual water than create the properties that we as consumers think of as \"moisturized\" (softness, smoothness, manageability, etc). the glycerin is a humectant, meaning it attracts water and holds onto it, and all those oils could initially form a thin barrier to keep that water inside the hairs. that being said, the actual water stuff seems to be genuinely important for some types of hair, particularly very curly natural hair, even if it has little to do with how we imagine \"moisturized\" hair feeling. use whichever product gives you hair that feels and looks the way you like it; neither one is objectively better or worse. i much prefer creams closer to the first one, because my hair dries super slowly already and i'm sort of instinctively resistant to any marketing that pushes \"natural ingredients\" as a selling point, but whatever you prefer is what's best for you!",

Would love to hear yours too!!\n\n1. **THE PRICE!** It’s **$30 for 1 oz**, and I get that this has rainbow algae and sustainable packaging & ingredients, but it’s still pretty high compared to other retinol serums in the market (e.g. The Inkey List’s $9.99 retinol serum for the same volume). Nothing wrong with a higher price point, BUT THIS IS HYRAM WE’RE TALKING ABOUT!! He alwayysss talks about the importance of having access to affordable skincare but releases a $30 retinol serum? Pretty off brand for me, especially since he talked about offering fair prices in his initial brand launch video.\n2. **Low rainbow algae concentration?** Rainbow algae is a highlighted ingredient for this product, but it’s 3RD TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST! It’s also after phenoxyethanol, which is a preservative with usually less than 1% concentration. This shows that there’s actually not much rainbow algae in there! Again, this is not something I expected from Hyram, being that he’s super ingredients-focused. He’s also had several videos where he has educated his viewers on how to read an ingredients list, so dang. Did not expect this from him.\n3. **Sustainable packaging and ingredients!** Gonna give credit where credit is due, and I gotta say, Hyram went above and beyond for sustainability! Even if I don’t like a couple of things about this new product, I appreciate the sustainable efforts on both sourcing and production. Yay for protecting our home!\n\n\nOverall, this definitely isn’t what I expected from Hyram, but hey, I think the product itself will perform okay, as long as you're willing to pay $30 for 1 oz I guess. What are your thoughts?",

But there are other things you should notice.\n\nSustainable packaging? Best thing he could have done is *not make more bottles*. \n\nYou haven't seen the other posts about him here recently have you? He's very much been getting scathing reviews of his roll out. The White savior complex post may have been on r/beautyguruchatter but it's **gross** of him to use images of BIPOC as the poor 3rd world people he's going to help with his overpriced face creams. There are problems with water here in the US he could have focused on. Using black people in need employing empathy marketing ...wtf? Also reminds me of church missionary bs. Can read more about that on this well thought out IG caption:  https://www.instagram.com/p/CPoW8XsnYMt/?utm_medium=copy_link\n\nAnd I just wanted to say that rollout video was horribly cringe for me. Poor black people pouring water into a can between clips of him giggling and hopping around in a lab coat? Just... what?\n\nIt's bad that he's made this overpriced, but *especially* given who his target audience is, teens. That rainbow algae is just a kind of brown algae and that's just a money grab ingredient. It won't do anything. The retinol is what will work. And there are much better affordable options with real established results. This is likely a product that won't do anything but be praised for being so gentle by a huge group of teenagers that have the lowest need for retinol. \n\nNext, the Inkey list has been rapid firing products onto shelves as a clear money grab. Quality has gone down. Their comparables? Everything is about 1oz, so the Inkey list is actually more expensive than a lot of other nicer brands per oz. But now Hyram and them have teamed up to charge 3X the price of a typical TIL product as another blatant money grab.\n\nThey should be doing better.

That's in the bracket above tried and loved EU pharmaceutical brands, like LRP and Eucerin... brands that actually pump millions into testing their individual products, rather than apparently just flicking through a wholesale ingredients catalogue for things that sound new and sexy.",

It doesn’t seem particularly innovative, considering there are so many retinol products out there. \n\nWhy I do applaud him for wanting to make a change, I feel that the best thing he could have done is not add to the already overwhelming skincare industry surely?

Relative to the Inkey List’s normal prices, maybe, but there are a lot of other serums out there that are way more expensive. I think the price itself doesn’t stand out to me as blasphemous, though personally I wouldn’t buy it.\n\nFor the algae, maybe I just haven’t read up on it and feel free to correct/educate me, but idk what the ideal concentration is so I hesitate to make a comment about where it should be in the ingredient list. Also I think in the US, when you go below 1%, you can place the ingredients in any order. So theoretically, there could actually be more algae than 0.2% retinol but they just chose to order the ingredients list in this way. Regardless, idrc about the algae in general no matter what the concentration. I was surprised to see them advertise algae as one of their key ingredients since I don’t think of algae as an “active” or even a trendy ingredient.",

Not everything is The Ordinary (and TO's retinol is crap, and only lasts 3 months and only that long if you keep it in the fridge) - $30 is not expensive for a retinol serum. I would say it's pretty cheap (especially if the product is a good product). Go to Sephora's website, search retinol and sort by price - there are literally only two brands below the $30 mark (excluding minis) - Inkey and TO. Why would Inkey support a line of skincare that directly competes with themselves - it makes total sense that the brand would be more - and most brands are. Did you seriously expect a $10 retinol serum that was also sustainably produced?",

    "body": "About a month ago, I picked up the Trader Joe's Nourish Oil-Free Antioxidant Moisturizer.  Note that TJ's also sells an intensive moisturizer, which contains oil.\n\nIt's a watery lotion that is light yet moisturizing.  If I apply too much, it feels annoyingly wet on my skin for about a minute until it dries.  After that, it is perfectly comfortable.  Since it's summer here, I don't need a heavy moisturizer.  I really like this and would definitely buy it again.\n\n[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/6AvUUKs)\n\nPros:\n\n* Inexpensive at 6 oz for $6\n* Contains a bunch of different antioxidants\n* Lightweight\n* Fragrance-free\n\nCons:\n\n* Antioxidant concentration might be low.  Many are listed after the preservatives.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just unknown.\n* Clear container might let light in, which might make the antioxidants less effective\n* Pump might not be super sturdy?  I knocked mine off my counter and the pump came off.   I was not able to get it back on, so I had to transfer the lotion to another container.\n\n\nIngredients:  Water, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Ethylhexyl (Octyl) Palmitate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Polysorbate-60, Cetearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Cetearyl Glucoside, Sodium PCA, Ethylhexyglycerin (Preservative), Shea Butter Fruit, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Xanthan Gum (Thickener), Tocopherol (Antioxidant), Sorbic Acid (preservative), Soluble Collagen, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C Palmitate), Pomegranate Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Extract, Coffea Arobica (Coffee) Seed, Chamomile Flower/Leaf Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Stearate, Phytonadione (Vitamin K1), Menadione (Vitamin K3), Hydrolyzed Silk, DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol), Copper PCA, Retinol (Vitamin A), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A Palmitate), Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10),Thioctic Acid (Alpha-lipoic acid), Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3), Polysorbate-20, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Phospholipids\n\nPossible dupe?  [Skin Resource MD Oil Free Antioxidant Facial Moisturizer](https://skinresourcemd.com/collections/face-moisturizers/products/oil-free-facial-antioxidant-moisturizer#goto).  The packaging and ingredients look similar enough.  The ingredients are not listed 100% the same, but it seems that it would at least be very similar.\n\nI hadn't seen a review on this moisturizer here before, so I thought I'd write one.  Let me know if you also enjoy this product!",

I finish with the Oil-Free Antioxidant Serum. \n\nA few side notes:  I keep a bottle of the All-In-One Cleanser in the shower and use it in place of soap.

And the oils are different. Rare Beauty uses jojoba and Sunflower oils. ETUDE uses Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Apricot Oil, Evening Primrose Oil and Sweet Almond Oil. Rare Beauty also uses Florida Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, and Nymphaea Odorata Root Extract. While Etude just uses Mango Fruit Extract.\n\nHave you seen this before, where a company dupes another company's formula and then charges more for it?",

I'd rather have an inclusive shade range that's easier for me to purchase, even at a higher price. \n\nAlso I don't see how this etude house tint is any different to romand's juicy lasting tint, or glasting tint, or any tint that has a glassy finish. Yeah, rare beauty does have a lot of aesthetics taken from k-beauty but like everyone else is saying, it's probably not exactly the same.

Parachute discontinued this product soon after and I was heart broken, so were my friends who became equally obsessed. BUT, they brought it back, my boyfriend discovered it for me and I immediately asked a friend of mine to get it from India (I am currently residing in UK). I was very excited to try it, the texture is same as the previous product but they have definitely changed the formulation. The scent is also very different from the discontinued product.\n\nThe new formulation is amazing and this has become my holy grail again. I would repurchase it in a heartbeat, ive struggled with fungal acne and this product is the only thing that helps me. i love it SO MUCH. it really is the best fucking product and i am so happy it is back. I will be loyal to this till the end of my life. Although, i feel the new formulation is inferior to the old one but only marginally.\n\nThis product is very cheap too, always on sale on myntra and is available everywhere, last time people struggled to find it.

They help boost your ceramide production and NAG is skin-identical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**PHYSICIANS FORMULA SKIN BOOSTER - BRIGHTENING**](https://www.target.com/p/physicians-formula-skin-booster-vitamin-shot-brightening-1-fl-oz/-/A-75569193)  **$7.99/1 oz or 30ml**\n\n*Water, Butylene Glycol,* ***Niacinamide***\\*, Glycerin,\\* ***Acetyl Glucosamine***\\*, Pentylene Glycol, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Disodium Edta, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Phenylethyl Resorcinol, Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate,\\* ***3-0-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid***\\*, Iron Oxides (Ci 77492), Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Vegetable Collagen, Agar, Calcium Alginate, Xanthan Gum, Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tropolone, Gluconolactone, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Red 30 (Ci 73360), Sodium Benzoate.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like it's an \"inspired\" product of [**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-niacinamide-booster/798.html)**:**\n\n*Water (Aqua),* ***Niacinamide*** *(vitamin B3, skin-restoring ),* ***Acetyl Glucosamine*** *(skin replenishing/antioxidant),* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside*** *(vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative).*\n\nThe Paula's Choice obviously has more beneficial ingredients and higher % but still, it's **$44 for 0.67oz/20ml**. But if you have the money for it, go for it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The OLAY Luminous Miracle Boost Concentrate  $33.49/1 oz or 30ml on** [**olay.com**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/olay-luminous-miracle-boost-concentrate-face-booster)**, and  $15.59** [**@ Target.**](https://www.target.com/p/olay-luminous-miracle-boost-concentrate-1-0-oz/-/A-51169830)\n\n*Water, Cyclopentasiloxane,* ***Niacinamide***\\*, Hexyldecanol, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Xylitol, Nylon-12, Panthenol,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*,\\* *Tocopheryl Acetate,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Zinc Gluconate, Magnesium Aspartate, Inositol, Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Polysorbate 20, Boron Nitride, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethanol, Peg-11 Methyl Ether Dimethicone, Polyacrylamide, Benzyl Alcohol, Aminomethyl Propanol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Benzoate, Laureth-7, Fragrance, Copper Gluconate, Mica, Red 40.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Niacinamide works great together with undecylenoyl phenylalanine, or sepiwhite MSH (developer brand name) to be very brightening together.](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/sepiwhite-msh) Sepiwhite is not well-known and very rare to find in commercial products (besides Olay I mean). Probably because Olay developed it. But it works great on its own as a brightener, and even better combined with vitamin c (which is why you see ascorbyl glucoside here, a stable derivative of ascorbic acid). The miracle boost USED to contain n-acetyl glucosamine (which is the one I used) as well the other ones listed here. But I guess it got too expensive or whatever.\n\nThis also has some other great ingredients, like xylitol, gylcerin, panthenol, zinc and copper gluconate for soothing and healing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used this booster in conjunction with the Luminous cream, which has niacinamide and NAG. My skin looked so much brighter and prettier. The texture was really smoothed out and my skin started getting a more like.. translucent ?? quality? You DO need to give brightening ingredients *at least 3 months* to work their magic though, especially for things like arbutin/hydroquinone. (Arbutin breaks down into hydroquinone.) But for niacinamide, I saw results for skin texture/overall brightening before that.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe the price Target was selling it for, because I got it for a much higher price elsewhere before. I couldn't keep affording it so I let it go, sadly. :'(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [**Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment ($24.99)**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/regenerist-luminous-tone-perfecting-treatment) is a simpler formula, but still has the same active ingredients.\n\n*Water,* ***Niacinamide\\*****, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dimethicone,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Silica, Boron Nitride,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Dimethiconol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, \\*Vitamin B3\\*\n\nBut ironically, it costs more than the more complex booster if you purchase at Target online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIY:**\n\nI have made DIY niacinamide NAG serums before. But because I'm too lazy to make it properly, they really lack penetration power. I'm really into cosmetic science and have read from professional cosmetic chemists that a simple DIY isn't effective if you don't do it right. You gotta keep the powders dissolved right and STAY dissolved instead of them recrystallizing on your skin and not penetrating your skin/being useless. I experimented for months with the DIY but I DEFINITELY noticed a difference as soon as I started using well-formulated, commercially available niacinamide serums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience with certain products:\n\n\\- [**Eva Naturals 5% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Niacinamide-Serum-Eva-Naturals/dp/B0147PDMYY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eva+naturals+niacinamide&amp;qid=1561763684&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3)**:** Pretty awesome, works well, you get 2 oz. But it has avocado oil and such, and may break some people out. (This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %. Very good moisturizer for the body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther commercial products you can find SEPIWHITE in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Black Opal skin care products**](https://blackopalbeauty.com/collections/skincare): They have multiple.

It's got a silky smooth texture that spreads easily. You don't need a lot which is good but I'm definitely using it up more quickly than I was expecting.\n\nI'll probably stick with it for 3 months to see if there's any improvement but at the moment I'm seeing a small improvement in overall skin tone but not much improvement on sun spots that I wanted this product to fade.

Sorry the image isn't super aesthetic but I wanted to write the post asap!\n\n**About me:** 24F\n\n**Climate:** Between 35-39 degrees this summer, slightly humid but really dry most times.\n\n**Skin type:** My body's skin is dehydrated and always needs to be moisturised; however, even slightly heavy lotions make me sweat.\n\n**Texture of this lotion:** Looks like any regular lotion, bFraut when rubbed in it literally disappears into my skin in a good way. It spreads like a serum/water lotion.\n\n**Fragrance:** Light but pleasant scent, very similar to other Vaseline lotions. \n\n**Cost:** MRP 300\n\n**WRP/WNRP:** WRP\n\nIngredients list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Glutathione, Sodium Hyaluronate, Retinyl Palmitate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycine, Cystine, Sodium PCA, Petrolatum, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Perfume, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Styrene/​Acrylates Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Coco-Glucoside, BHT, Benzoic Acid, Citric Acid, Potassium Hydroxide\n\n*Moisturisers I've already tried and mini reviews (note:* ***reviews are only for summers, otherwise I love all of these lotions and they work perfectly during winter***\\*):\\*\n\n* *Vaseline Aloe lotion* \\- Too light and not moisturising enough.\n* *Vaseline Restoring variant in the yellow bottle* \\- Makes me sweat in summer.\n* *Parachute Blue Bottle* \\- heavy and makes me sweat in summer.\n* *Vaseline Aloe Gel tube* \\- I really like this one for summer, gets absorbed super fast and gives a cooling feeling. However, I don't know if it helped with my dehydrated skin.\n* *Vaseline Daily Bright & Calming Body Serum -* I love this one. Though it's slightly less moisturising it's actually good for really hot and humid days.\n* I've also used the *Neutrogena hydro-boost gel* and *Cosrx All-in-one cream*s on my body because my face skin reacted badly to them - I honestly loved these for my body during summers because of how light but hydrating they are but obviously they're too expensive to be purchased to use on the body.\n* Lastly, I've tried to dilute every regular lotion with some water; *Minimalist 5% Niacinamide Lotion*, *Vaseline advanced repair* and one of the *Nivea dark blue bottle*s (all my HGs for winter). All of them still made me sweat after the water dried down.\n\nI have tried the *Vaseline Gluta-hya Serum-in-lotion* for about 1 week now and love it already!\n\nThis one looked like any other lotion but when applied, it literally turns into a watery serum consistency and gets absorbed by my skin within minutes. It doesn't feel heavy at all but moisturises very well for quite a few hours.\n\nI had to reapply on some really dry parts of my body within 4 hours but I'd take that any day over the sweaty feeling I get from using regular lotions in summer.\n\nIts scent is very similar to the Yellow Vaseline lotion however, it's slightly different and it's quite pleasant.\n\nIf anyone of you had used the Vaseline spray-on lotion/serum thing, this Gluta-hya thing is a more moisturising version of that product which is great because I also like the spray lotion despite it being slightly less moisturising.\n\nI don't know if it's really new in the market or if I've just found it but it's a good find!\n\nAlso, at the back of the tube, it says that this specific variant has *'Dual UV Filters'* i.e. UVA and UVB filters but obviously, I doubt if it's good enough protection, so I won't stop using my body sunscreen yet.\n\nThey also have another variant called [Dewy Radiance Serum-in-Lotion](https://www.myntra.com/body-lotion/vaseline/vaseline-non-sticky-gluta-hya-dewy-radiance-serum-in-lotion---200-ml/22580648/buy?gclid=Cj0KCQjwi46iBhDyARIsAE3nVrZg5uLe88lcJQxcHA5kivV2zWTXKHmiQ3ZT1v1Twhhmqj53tFr9twIaAu3lEALw_wcB) if anyone's interested!\n\nApologies if my format/writing isn't that great!",

Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

    "body": "Hi, guys!\n\nI started my skincare journey almost a year ago, and this thread has been of great help! However, and regardless of how much I seem to learn and understand about skincare - I use skincarisma and cosdna to check all ingredients -, my skin doesn't look good. I have small bumps all over my cheeks and forehead (it's not acne, looks more like a rash) and a rough texture all over my face. I recently moved to a humid climate after having lived in a dry climate for 3 years, and also have recently quit my job, so stress may be playing a part too. \n\nI had good skin growing up (was one of those lucky teens with very little to no acne), but now I'm 27 and my skin seems to be coming back at me with a vengeance!\n\nI have sensitive yet normal skin that becomes angry with everything - I reckon it's hypersensitive and dehydrated at the moment. It can't take any fatty alcohols, tocopherol, fragrance (including phenoxyethanol) nor any aggressive acids such as AHA or BHA. I think even butylene glycol and silicones, which are often branded as safe and well tolerated by sensitive skin, have upset my skin...\n\nHere's my daily skincare routine:\n\n**AM**\n\n* Spray [Avene Thermal Water](https://www.aveneusa.com/thermal-spring-water), followed by [rose water](https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B004J0FNZO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) applied on a cotton round to tone.\n* Hydrate with [pomegranate oil](https://www.ecco-verde.es/biopark-cosmetics/aceite-de-granada) or [Avene Tolerance Extreme Cream](https://www.eau-thermale-avene.es/rostro/cuidados-cotidianos/tolerance-extreme-pieles-sensibles-a-hipersensibles/tolerance-extreme-0).\n* I am not using SPF at the moment since I had to quit using [Avene Lait Mineral SPF 50+](https://www.eau-thermale-avene.es/solares/solar-pieles-intolerantes/leche-50-pantallas-fisicas) because the talc was making my skin appear dull. I recently ordered [Cyberderm Ava Isa Aurora Rose Tinted SPF 45](https://www.thesunscreencompany.com/product/ava-isa-aurora-rose-tinted-ultra-matte-spf-45/), which I hope will be a life savior.\n* Follow with makeup ([MAC Studio Fix Perfecting Stick Concealer](https://www.lookfantastic.com/mac-studio-fix-perfecting-stick-various-shades/11470563.html), [BareMinerals Mineral Veil](https://www.bareminerals.co.uk/face-makeup/finishing-powders-and-mineral-veil/mineral-veil/UKmastermineralveil.html?dwvar_UKmastermineralveil_SkinShade=Tinted), [BareMinerals Invisible Bronze Power](https://www.lookfantastic.es/bareminerals-invisible-bronze-7g-various-shades/11408868.html?variation=11408869), [100% Pure Luminating Créme](https://www.100percentpure.com/collections/natural-bronzer-highlighters/products/luminating-creme-northern-light?variant=36540649358))  \n\n**PM**\n\n* Remove makeup with [Silk Naturals Apricot Cleansing Oil](https://www.silknaturals.com/store/index.php/skin-care/cleansers/apricot-cleansing-oil-843.html).\n* Cleanse with [SVR Sensifine dermo-nettoyant](https://www.labo-svr.com/en/sensifine-dermonettoyant), with the help of [Foreo LUNA Go](https://www.foreo.com/luna-go) for sensitive skin (I only use the anti-aging side of the device, as the brittle side causes bumps to appear all over my face).\n* Spray [Avene Thermal Water](https://www.aveneusa.com/thermal-spring-water), followed by [rose water](https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B004J0FNZO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) applied on a cotton round to tone.\n* Use [Silk Naturals Mama's Helper Serum](https://www.silknaturals.com/store/index.php/skin-care/serums/mama-39-s-helper-serum-1292.html).\n* Hydrate with [Avene Tolerance Extreme Cream](https://www.eau-thermale-avene.es/rostro/cuidados-cotidianos/tolerance-extreme-pieles-sensibles-a-hipersensibles/tolerance-extreme-0).\n* Lock moisture with [pomegranate oil](https://www.ecco-verde.es/biopark-cosmetics/aceite-de-granada) or [hemp seed oil](https://www.ecco-verde.es/biopark-cosmetics/aceite-de-semilla-de-canamo-bio). \n\nI have also ordered [Silk Naturals Vitamin C Peptide Serum](https://www.silknaturals.com/store/index.php/skin-care/serums/vitamin-c-peptide-serum-603.html) (to help dilute my PM serum, which has a weird texture), [Garden of Wisdom 100% pure squalane oil](https://www.victoriahealth.com/product/100-Pure-Squalane-Oil/12851) (to use in the AM or PM), [Garden of Wisdom Anti-Aging MultiPeptide Serum](https://www.victoriahealth.com/product/Anti-Aging-MultiPeptide-Serum/12859) and [Garden of Wisdom Daily Hydrator](https://www.victoriahealth.com/product/Daily-Hydrator/12907) (both to use in the AM in replacement of the oil).\n\nI have carefully selected each of these products after many hours spent browsing and comparing, and I'm very disheartened right now. I've become desperate because no matter how much I research or spend trying to get the best skincare possible, it doesn't seem to be doing the trick...  \n\nI want to get to a tried and true routine so I can start enjoying skincare instead of seeing it as a chore. Any ideas? Any input is much appreciated!\n\nThank you :))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***UPDATE Dec. 2022:***\n\nMy skin has been nearly perfect for over 2 years now (picture [HERE](https://imgur.com/CvtD5W0), no filters) and I'm super happy about it!\n\nSince I last updated this post, I changed quite a lot in my routine by reading up even more about skincare and pH levels. Turns out my former holy grail cleanser, the SVR Nettoyant, had a pH of over 9, making it too alkaline for the skin. Other products were axed from my routine because their pH was inadequate or because the ingredients weren't doing much for my skin. I found that bakuchiol/retinol doesn't work well on my skin, and I need to use two serums in the AM and the PM, let them dry thoroughly, and then use an occlusive oil or cream for best results. Also any kind of electric face cleanser (such as the Foreo) is too harsh on the skin. I'm better off with just using a cotton round to remove excess.\n\n[INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/) was key to setting up a balanced, antioxidant and cellular communicator ingredients-heavy routine. Here's what I use on my face at the moment:\n\n**AM**\n\n* MARY & MAY 6 Peptide Complex Serum\n* COSRX Pure Fit Cica Serum or Purito Galacto Niacin 97 Power Essence (I tend to alternate every other day)\n* Purito Plainet Squalane Oil 100\n* Barr Centella Soothing Sun Essence SPF50+ PA++++\n\n**PM**\n\n* Cleanse with Silk Naturals Apricot Cleansing Oil (sometimes I double cleanse with Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water if needed)\n* Beauty of Joseon Repair Serum\n* Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Water Essence\n* Purito Centella Unscented Eye Cream (for the undereye)\n* Unifarco Ceramol Crema 311\n\n**Once a week or as needed:** exfoliate with COSRX Poreless Pad (discontinued) or the COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid.  \n\n\nIf I'm not feeling lazy, I'll use the Nuface Mini Facial Toner. If I go to an event or want my skin to feel extra lush, I'll use one of these face masks: Benton Aloe Soothing Mask Pack (hydrating) / HYGGEE Active Red Flower Mask (brightening) / Yadah Daily Vegi Mask Wine (antioxidant).\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any questions, feel free to DM me :))",

        "body": "I have some routine recs for your dehydrated skin. First put together a base routine of **cleanser/ moisturizer with ceramides/ sunscreen**, then you can add other stuff if you aren't satisfied with your results after 2 weeks. (Most people don't need to use every step, only people with the most severe cases of dehydrated skin need to use every step.)\n\n**Gentle Cleanser**: Use a non-foaming cleanser from [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/cleanser_recs). Other popular non-foaming cleansers not listed on that page are: Garnier Skinactive The Gentle Sulfate Free Cleanser, Eucerin Advanced Cleansing Body & Face Cleanser, Aveeno Baby Soothing Relief Creamy Wash, Hada Labo Tokyo Hydrating Facial Cleanser.\n\n**Hydrating Toner**: If you live in a normal/humid climate, use a hyaluronic acid toner like Hada Labo Gokujyun Hyaluronic Acid Lotion (apply on damp face after cleansing; toners are called \"lotions\" in Japan). Other popular hyaluronic acid toners are Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion (thicker than the regular version), Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner (there's also an unscented  version if you're sensitive to fragrance/essential oils), Sukoyaka Suhada Urea Moisturizing Lotion, Cezanne Skin Conditioner.\n\nNaruko Taiwan Magnolia Brightening and Firming Toner EX (easy to find on ebay, not amazon) contains 5% [Niacinamide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/niacinamide), tranexamic acid, licorice root, arbutin, and two types of Vitamin C (ascorbyl glucoside and ethyl ascorbic acid), which all help with fading hyperpigmentation.\n\nIf you live in a dry climate, use a hydrating toner *without* hyaluronic acid like Kikumasamune High Moisture (pink bottle), Etude House SoonJung pH 5.5 Relief Toner, Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner, Mebika Hydrating Moist (easy to find on ebay, not amazon), Naturie Hatomugi Skin Conditioner.\n\nIf you live in a dry climate and want to use a hyaluronic acid toner, read [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/584pl0/hyaluronic_acid_and_dry_climates/).\n\n**Essence**: Popular options: Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence, Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence, Mizon Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule, Farm Stay All-In-One Honey Ampoule (dupe for the discontinued Scinic AIO Honey Ampoule).\n\nLess popular, but still effective products: Tosowoong Green Tea Essence, Tosowoong Propolis Sparkle Ampoule, Skin 1004 Madagascar Centella Asiatica Ampoule, Purito Centella Green Level Buffet Serum (there's also an unscented  version if you're sensitive to fragrance/essential oils), Reddy Cerassol Cica Ampoule, Zymogen Houttuynia Cordata Ferment Serum.\n\n**5% Urea Cream**: I recommend reading [this post](https://thenakedchemist.com/what-is-urea-and-its-benefits-in-skincare/) to learn about the benefits of urea.\n\nEucerin makes several different 5% urea creams; I previously used [this one](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Eucerin-Dry-Skin-Replenishing-Face-Cream-50ml/184120821339) from the UK, but then I discovered that Eucerin Advanced Repair Cream (which is easy to find in the US) also contains 5% urea, and it's cheaper and comes in a larger container than the UK version. Make sure to get the Cream, because the Lotion is greasier than the Cream.\n\nOther 5% urea creams: [Medisei](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Medisei-Panthenol-Extra-Cream-For-Irritated-Senstive-Skin-With-Panthenol-Urea/282812470867), [Sebamed](https://www.amazon.com/Sebamed-Extreme-Relief-Cream-Urea/dp/B01IZ6Q180/ref=sr_1_3_a_it), [Balea](https://www.amazon.com/Balea-Care-Urea-Face-Cream/dp/B073V3PR8S/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_7), [Numis Med](https://www.amazon.com/Hyaluronic-Dermatologist-Moisturizes-Numis-Med/dp/B076L3NCC8/ref=sr_1_3_a_it), and [Cien](https://www.amazon.com/Cien-Soothing-Day-Cream-Urea/dp/B00XA5PXW2/ref=sr_1_16).\n\nYou can read [my comments in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/9kswpu/skin_concern_i_cant_seem_to_fix_my_dehydrated/e71u9mf/) for more detail.\n\nNOTE: Hada Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream is often recommended as a 5% urea cream, however that product uses [Hydroxyethyl Urea](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/hydration/hydroxyethyl-urea.html) which is different from normal [Urea](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/exfoliant/urea.html). You can read [my comments in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/b0s3yw/your_favourite_urea_or_ceramides_product/eigt4hl/) for more detail.\n\n**Moisturizer with Ceramides**: Popular AND cost-effective options are Cerave PM (contains 4% [Niacinamide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/niacinamide)), Cerave Moisturizing Cream, Eucerin Eczema Relief Cream, and Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream. Mix in a couple drops of **squalane oil** if you feel like your skin needs a little extra moisture. Read [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/84orw0/discussion_whats_your_absolute_hg_ceramide_cream/) for other ceramide cream recommendations.\n\nUPDATE: Although [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/) pointed out that Cerave products don't use the golden ratio for ceramides, I (and many, many other people) personally think that they're good products for healing dehydrated skin.\n\n**(PM ONLY) Occlusive**: Apply a thin layer of Vaseline to \"seal\" everything in. Other popular occlusives are Aquaphor and Cerave Healing Ointment.\n\n**(AM ONLY) Sunscreen**: Aim for SPF 30-50. Popular recs for dry/dehydrated skin are [Endurance Shield High Performance Sunblock](https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Sunscreen-SPF-Ounce/dp/B00B2SJL9K/ref=sr_1_cc_1_a_it) and [No-Ad Sunscreen](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_9?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=no+ad+sunscreen&sprefix=no+ad+sun%2Caps%2C234&crid=2HRCJ5PRRHUXF). [Asian sunscreens](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=asian+sunscreen&ref=nb_sb_noss_1) are also very popular. Read the [Holy Grail threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sunscreen#wiki_product_recommendations) for more sunscreen recs.\n\nAlso, are you drinking enough water? I try to drink 3 to 4 liters of water everyday. I also take one flax seed oil supplement (Trader Joe's brand) everyday. If you don't want to take a supplement, you could incorporate a tablespoon of flax seeds into your breakfast every morning by putting it into your yogurt or oatmeal.\n\n(edited to add more product recs)",

So my confidence levels are zero! I previously had cystic acne, my doctor prescribed me doxycycline a year and a half ago which has helped! Although my skin is severely dehydrated now probably due to my heavy use of acne face washes etc previously, and I have rough texture/open pores. My skin cannot tolerate being washed a lot so I have to keep washing to an absolute minimum. \n\nMy current routine is...\n\n(AM)\n Don’t wash\n\n(PM) \n1. Wash with Dermol 500 (a simple creamy lotion prescribed by my doctor) - Here are the ingredients Benzalkonium Chloride 0.1%, Chlorhexidine Hydrochloride 0.1%, Liquid Paraffin 2.5%, Isopropyl Myristate 2.5%. Also contains:Cetostearyl Alcohol, Cetomacrogol 1000, Phenoxyethanol, Purified water.\n\n2. Hada Labo Premium \n\n3. Squalane Oil mixed in with Zerobase Cream (an emollient cream prescribed by my doctor) - here are the ingredients Liquid Paraffin, White Soft Paraffin, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Macrogol Cetostearyl Ether, Sodium Dihydrogen Phosphate, Chlorocresol, Phosphoric Acid And Purified Water.\n\n4. Seal with aquaphor \n\nI have listed the ingredients as these are products that I don’t think are available in the US and you may not be familiar with. \n\nI sometimes skip washing completely some days if my skin seems compromised. \n\nI would like advise as to whether this routine is beneficial for me or not? \n\nThanks!!",

    "body": "My foray into skincare began around July last year when I decided I wasn't happy with my skin and wanted to do something about it. Initially I researched foundations, but none of the products I tried evened my skin to my satisfaction, which is when I found /r/SkincareAddiction. Here, I learned that my skin was dehydrated, more than likely due to using Dove bar soap and BP on my face and zero moisturizer every day. :) My skin has changed so much since I started and I am finally ready to review some products I have been using and maybe help others find their way.  \n**Disclaimer** This is my first Reddit text post, I'm really hoping the formatting turns out the way I anticipated.  \n\n**Where we started:**  \n* 25/F/FL; combo/oily dehydrated skin with mild acne, some PIE, sporadic CCs and occasionally painful nodules usually on my forehead, chin, or temples. Noteworthy: I have been on oral contraceptives since I was a teenager and switched to Skyla in 2015. I don't believe my acne is hormonal, but since I've always had some sort of hormonal birth control it's hard to tell how much it has affected my skin.  \n\n\n* No real routine, just washing my face with bar soap in the (scalding hot) shower, using a Neutrogena BP mask to annihilate acne. I was under the (false) impression that since my face was oily I certainly wouldn't want to add moisturizer!  \n\n\n* Mostly concerned with the nodules I was getting because they were big and painful and took forever to heal. Admittedly, I am a skin picker and just recently I realized this is probably the cause of the nodules because the two that I have dealt with recently developed in spots that I had messed with just a few days before.  \n\n\n**Level one: Build a routine.**  \n* At this point, I read everything. EVERYTHING. I spent a couple of months just researching products, learning about skin types, and poring through threads on SCA. I put down the BP mask and bought Neutrogena foaming face wash and CeraVe PM. This was around September when Irma hit and I was without power for a few days, but still managed to keep my fledgling routine. \\o/\n\n* Unfortunately, I felt that CeraVe PM was contributing to a new outbreak of whiteheads around my mouth, where I don't normally get whiteheads. I wound up replacing it with Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow which I LOVE. More on that later.\n\n* I also incorporated Neutrogena Sheer Touch sunscreen around this time, but that gave me small breakouts as well and I just didn't like the way that it sat on my skin so I decided to put sunscreen on hold while I did more research.\n\n* While incorporating these products into my routine I tried my best to follow SCA's advice and start slow, one product at a time, and patch test first. I don't really feel that patch testing helped me determine if a product would break me out, as I wouldn't notice any difference in the area I patch tested but then within a few days of trying a new product on my whole face I would see an increase in whiteheads in strange areas. It sucked, but it's alright since the breakouts were mild and didn't take long to appear so I knew fairly quickly that a product wasn't working for me. I still recommend patch testing for sensitivity purposes.\n\n**Level 2: Sunscreen and acids.**  \n* Finally, after months of reading, I felt ready to take on an acid. I settled on CosRX BHA Blackhead Power liquid because it was purportedly more mild (and less expensive!) than other options and I felt that I should start gentle. I picked this up from Ulta in early December and used it every three days for 4 weeks. During that period I don't feel like I had a purge; I kind of expected my acne to go into overdrive but it didn't really get any worse. After the 4 weeks I started using it MWF. \n\n* I also bought Skinfood's Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel from Amazon, but shipping took about a month so I was able to incorporate it well after the BHA.\n\n**Level 3: Skincare God.**  \n* *Just kidding.* So here we are in mid April and I have repurchased the Neutrogena cleanser once (although I switched to hydrating instead of foaming), Peach Slices moisturizer three (!!!) times, Skinfood sunscreen once, and am 1/3 of the way through the CosRX BHA. Let me tell you, I am SO much happier with my skin. \n\n* My skin is more bright and even and I have had much fewer blemishes than I used to, which I would attribute equally to a marked decrease in picking. Taking better care of my skin and working towards a goal makes it easier to keep myself from messing up my progress, although I still have setbacks during times when I am very stressed out, but I try not to let that discourage me.\n\n* Oil production WAS down, but a couple of weeks ago I tried to incorporate Cosrx Ultimate Moisturizing Honey Overnight Mask at night for added hydration, but it wound up drying me out? Additionally, I am running dangerously low on Peach Slices Moisturizer and could not find it at any of my local CVS locations so I have been rationing it while I wait for more to come in the mail. :'( \n\n* From here, I want to try to find a more hydrating cream for nighttime and an easily accessible drugstore sunscreen because currently it takes the Skinfood 2-4 weeks to come in so I have to make sure I order it in advance. I also REALLY want to try Krave Beauty Kale-lalu-yAHA, but I am waiting until I get back from vacation next month before I incorporate a new exfoliant. Finally, someone talk me out of buying something from the Dr Jart Cicapair line because I'm not quite sure what it's for but I really want it.\n\nI hope this will be helpful for those still figuring out what works for their skin, as I know I felt completely overwhelmed when I first started. I am still interested in experimenting with new products but I feel that I have a really solid routine as it is so I am content to wait until I am in a better situation financially to mix things up.\n\n**Current routine**  \nAM: splash with water  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSkinfood sunscreen  \n\nPM: cleanse with Neutrogena  \nCosRX BHA MWF  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSometimes a sheet mask when I'm feeling fancy (I really like Ariul Seven Days masks)  \nVaseline (not so much lately after I read a thread here about Vaseline potentially trapping bacteria if your face isn't cleansed properly)\n\n**Reviews**  \n* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser: Not much to say here, but from what I have read that is good to say about a cleanser. It took a little time to get used to not having that tight, \"squeaky clean\" feeling that I got using the foaming cleanser, but ultimately I think this has been better for my skin. I have had my eye on Glossier's Milky Jelly cleanser for MONTHS but I can't bring myself to buy it when I am pretty satisfied with how this has been for my skin.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n* Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow: Light gel formula, sinks into my skin really well. I am still a bit oily toward the end of the day, but I have kind of resigned myself to the fact that that may not fully go away. Maybe when I start incorporating a more hydrating night cream it will help. Either way the slight oil doesn't bother me much and I really like this moisturizer.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide NP, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol*\n\n* Skinfood Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel 50+ PA+++: Very happy with this sunscreen, although the oil control is hit or miss. Some days when I apply it after moisturizer it has a nice, almost powdery finish and I forget it's even there. Some days I'm more oily but I'm still figuring out what the cause of that might be. I don't wear foundation so I can't speak to how this sits under makeup but I do wear a little blush and I can still see it at the end of the day. When I apply it I pat it around my face and then rub it in, there is a slight white cast at first but for me it disappears very quickly, however, I am fair skinned.\n\n*Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Octyl Salicylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Lauryl Peg-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Titanium Dioxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Propylene Carbonate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Fragrance, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Tocopherol*\n\n* CosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid: I use three pumps MWF and occasionally a tiny amount to spot treat nodules. Overall I feel like it helps existing acne heal more quickly and keeps it from getting to that huge, inflammatory state. It applies and dries down very nicely and I typically wait 15-20 minutes after application to apply moisturizer. I didn't realize until recently that it has niacinamide, which I had thought didn't agree with my skin because it was also in CeraVe PM, but I think it has really helped lighten my PIE, particularly a spot on my forehead that I really went to town on last year and it was a pain in the ass to heal.\n\n*Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Betaine Salicylate, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arginine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol*\n\n**Links that I found helpful along the way**  \n[Try a gentle hydrating cleanser -- even if you have oily skin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7j6juf/psa_try_a_gentle_hydrating_cleanser_even_if_you/)\n\n[Routines which involve inadequate cleansing, high moisture, and heavy occlusion are risky...](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/86twai/psa_routines_which_involve_inadequate_cleansing/)",

    "body": "PART I OF THE POST:\n\nSo, I've seen a lot of people doubting this product's efficacy because it has salicylic acid and niacinamide together and that these two need different ph levels to operate, so let's clear that up first!\n\n[Here's](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/) a post from lab muffin explaining how the ph level doesn't matter for salicylic acid, because it is *special*  !\n\nAnd I've asked around the skincareaddiction sub a while ago about niacinamide and one of the users replied that that in short niacinamide is a tough cookie and is highly stable! (their version was very detailed) And I didn't wanted to make this post without very reliable source and today dr dray made an Instagram post busting some niacinamide myths, how niacinamide is highly stable and works very well with other ingredients!\n\nPART II:\n\nThis brings me to my next point and this isn't just pertaining to sebogel it's more like a generalised observation, I think that a lot of people have this \"I can judge a book by it's cover\" attitude in a way, just because we learned how to read ingredients lists 😅\n\nIngredients list are primarily there to make consumers aware of well... Ingredients! they might be allergic to, we can make overgeneralised guesses on how a product would work based on the list but even then there are nuances because skin care is very subjective and yes there are times ingredients lists help us see through a brand's bs, for example a hyaluronic acid serum having hyaluronic acid at the bottom of the list or after phenoxyethanol which is used in less than 1%.\n\nBut for the most part, we really aren't qualified nor can we judge a product based on its ingredients list since it all comes down to the formulation.\n\nE.g Dr dray when she reviewed purito sunscreen, only commented about the lack of filters and in the comments she explained that even knowing the concentration of an ingredient doesn't tell you much it all comes down to formulation, so my point is this feels like another form of \"parabens are bad!!!\" Which if you think about it's actually \"I know better than cosmetic formulators and scientific studies!\" Which is not far off from the situation right now... \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, there's a fine line between  questioning and drawing conclusions based on the first article we read after a quick Google search.\n\nI'm not saying even if a product didn't work for you, continue using it or checking the ingredients list is a waste, if a product didn't work for you it didn't work for you! Period! Your experience is valid !! And you have every right to call out a product that caused you harm!!!! And learning to read ingredients lists is a must in the skincare game but it's just when we make judgements at face value, we repeat history, again e.g set parabens on fire!!!\n\nP.S I hope I didn't offend anyone 😅",

We see some posts on this sub (and other skincare subs for that matter) where they post a picture of a random skincare product and it’s INCI list asking for “thoughts? Ingredient list looks good”.  I kinda get tired seeing the pseudo-scientificness and ingredient-wokeness of some of these posts. (No offence to anyone who may have done this lol)\n\nNone of us are qualified to look at an ingredient list and tell whether a product is good or not. I doubt if even qualified product formulators are able to do that. The obsession with ingredient lists is seriously frightening and a form of fear-mongering like you said. INCI lists for the same product can be different in different countries based on local regulations. As a general rule, use the INCI list only to check if the product actually has what it claims to be and/or if it contains ingredients that you may be allergic or sensitive too. Anything beyond that is pointless over-thinking.",

You can tell when someone is talking because they have knowledge vs someone talking right outta their butt. \"I have done my research!\" is *in no way* the same as having actual hands-on experience in the field, and to believe so reeks of ignorance, no matter how many articles you have read. And to discredit entire products because \"It has silicone!\" \"It has coconut oil!\" \"This one ingredient is comedogenic, so don't use this product!\" just blows my mind. Like, bruv the formulators aren't retarded fyi, neither are the associations that approve the products. With the recent DMDM hydantoin controversy, I feel like this is going to open up another avenue for people to just say, well this sucks balls and i know because i read three research papers on it. Despite the fact that dermatologists have come out and said that there isn't a lot backing up the lawsuit, and the people probably had an allergic reaction. The same shit poor old silicones had to go through. But you know, *we did our research so we know.* It's one thing to discuss a theory, another to state them like they are facts.

I'm definitely not going through an entire bottle of newly opened sunscreen in a week. Was relieved that 3 out of 4 above had preservatives but the sad thing is this isn't 100% across the board. We're not even at the stage where we can evaluate if the preservative system is sufficient, I'm having to go with \"well, at least there's one.\"\n\nCan anyone chime in one whether one preservative like ethylhexylglycerin or phenoxyethanol is as sufficient as we can compromise on for commonly used products? I can't tell an entire industry to bring back parabens (which sadly accompany formulas with other irritating/comedogenic ingredients for me like niacinamide, alcohol/alcohol denat., shea butter, etc. and I don't think my skin likes the high ratio of propanediol in many products) so this is me on copium.  \n\nI still use skinsort even with all its problems, but too bad they only have \"paraben-free\" as a filter option and not \"with parabens or preservatives\" as one.\n\nUpdate: To clarify, I'm personally expressing my own concern based on the resources I've access to as a public consumer. I appreciate people giving me balanced pushback (and thank you to those sharing resources for me to look into further), and still, given that we're all forced to navigate these cloudy waters on our own if we don't have a background in this field already means these questions come up for me.

For example, I am an engineer, and while I took chemistry and did clinical lab there's absolutely no way that I am qualified or knowledgeable enough to understand and judge every single ingredient in a formula or what each one of them do when put together. It would be completely foolish of me to do so without any solid, evidence based, backing behind it; every single opinion that I give on this sub or any other has anywhere between many years of experience or solid hours of googling behind it, and I expect others to do the same. \n\nTaking the word of someone, anyone, regardless of their qualifications or credentials without doing research on their claims and finding how it lines up with the general consensus it's also very foolish. LabMuffin is not infallible, she's one woman who can make mistakes and will make them in the future, and relying on her word alone is not enough when it comes to complex topics and discussions. \nThe Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, the branch of government that oversees and imposes The Comestic Act, is where you have to go if you want to further understand any ingredient of any product made and sold in Korea. There are plenty of [documents](https://www.mfds.go.kr/eng/wpge/m_24/de011014l001.do) and webpages made available in English for you to look through, and many other [websites](https://cosmetic.chemlinked.com/cosmepedia/regulatory-requirements-for-cosmetic-ingredients-in-south-korea) who dive deeper into the topic by reviewing and translating documents. \n\nIn short, to try and raise alarm on a topic based with very little backing and even less proper research is definitely not helpful in the current anti-science climate we're living in.",

They either justify their short-life products as ~it’s meant to be that way because it’s au naturel~. Or they still use preservatives, just not the largely demonized and widely recognized ones like paraben, then they market it as paraben-free, which is technically true and they don’t explicitly state preservative-free, **but you can’t pretend that the fear of paraben isn’t read as the fear of preservatives as a whole to the public**.\n\nAnd Lab Muffin isn’t just some random influencer who doesn’t know what she talks about. Yes, she is flawed and fallible. But she is very passionate about consumers’ science literacy. Now is it possible for her viewers to watch her videos and not perfectly grasp her message? Of course! Each of us is deeply imperfect as a communicator and an audience. \n\nBut it’s still incorrect to conflate someone like Michelle as the typical influencer who loves to talk out of their a** and someone like OP as the anti-science crunchy type. After all, the examples OP listed are all Korean sunscreens, which btw I literally just received my stock-up haul of Skin1004 sun serum, but you can’t ignore the fact the K-beauty brands literally had a scandal not too long ago regarding their sunscreen regulation. And guess who was the big influencer that originally went bat for K-beauty brands when the allegations started to bubble up? It was Lab Muffin beauty.",

I am quite new to making reviews with pictures so please let me know if there is any error in the review and if I need to change anything and how to change it. Now, on to my review.\n\nReview: I bought this sunscreen as the ingredients list really fascinated me and given how their facewashes did great on my skin and the sunscreen seemed so affordable I thought I would give it a try and see if it works in this humid climate for my oily skin. \n\nUnfortunately today it's very cloudy so my camera could not pick up the colour of the sunscreen. I had applied it along side the Re'equil on my hand to show the difference between both as both claim to be matte and sweat proof and very light on the skin. The Deconstruct one is a very light flesh pink/light peach colour while the Re'equil one looks like white with a touch of very light green. \n\nThe texture of Deconstruct seemed to resemble butter cream frosting on cake that was left in the fridge overnight. It was a bit stiff and sort of grainy. When I began to apply it on my face, it was horribly waxy.. like rubbing a candle on your hands or face and having that waxy residue stick behind which does not go away while the Re'equil one was very light and powdery and dry and had a very smooth, fine finish.  The Re'equil one had a pleasant baby powder scent like the one the Pink Johnson's baby powder does while Deconstruct did noy have any scent. \n\nTrying to spread and apply this sunscreen on my face and neck was a nightmare. I tried everything from gently applying it over in swiping motions to tapping it. Nothing worked. I even tried applying a moisturiser first in the hope that it helps spread the sunscreen better but that made no difference. The only plus point was how soothing it was on my skin which no sunscreen has done so far for me and it did not sting under my eyes. But sadly because it feels like applying candle wax and it feels coarse, it discouraged me from applying it and even when I applied super tiny amounts it was hard. Soon after I ended up getting breakouts and even worse skin texture from it.  It did make me slightly sweat above my upper lip and below my lower lip area and a bit under my eyes but not as much as the Minimalist SPF 50 sunscreen did. That one made me sweat buckets in seconds! I resolved the sweating due to the Deconstruct sunscreen issue by dabbing a bit of baby powder ( its my cheap dupe for setting powder or compact powder)  all over and that gave a nice matte and dry powdery look. \n\nAdditionally similar to Re'equil, cleansing it off is a pain in the butt! 😵‍💫😵‍💫🤧🤧I used so much cleansing balm ( Earth Rhthm Propolis cleansing balm) and the Bioderma Micellar water AND a foaming cleanser TWICE or THRICE  and it still remained on my face without going away. I had to spend 30 mins and tons of cleansing products,( and get drenched all over like I stood under the shower)  just to remove even half of it all and in frustration I ended up going to bed with some of it still on my face and neck.  I was severely disappointed in it but I guess for this price point I am not surprised since Indian brands rarely give you a bang for your buck when it comes to affordable sunscreens. 🥲🥲 Also, from the looks of it, it seemed they were trying to make a silicone free, cheaper dupe of the Re'equil ultra matte dry touch sunscreen ( blue one) but gosh.... I would take my risks with Re'equil far more than this one  😓 and for all its affordability, I ended up wasting precious expensive cleansing products in desperately trying to take it off of my skin. \n\n\nI will say that it did give  decent protection from the UV rays and I did not tan as much as I usually do. Since this sunscreen is sweat and water proof but terrible for my face, I decided to use it on my hands and feet since the sunscreen in these areas also wipes off quickly and this will give me perfect protection there. \n\nAll in all, I will give this sunscreen 2/5 and will not recommend it for indoor use either except for your hands and feet. Definitely WNRP.",

    "body": "I’ve been putting this post off for too long, but it’s 4am and I can’t sleep, so I may as well get ‘er done.\n\n**Background:** I’ve used two full sized bottles of SK-II’s FTE, and I’m about 1/4 of the way through Missha’s! I feel both have been given a fair chance to show their results. I have oily skin with rosacea, and have been using prescription retinoids for a couple months now.\n\n**SK-II Ingredients:** Galactomyces ferment filtrate, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, water, sodium benzoate, methylparaben, sorbic acid.\n\n**SK-II Review:** It’s no surprise that I loved this stuff, seeing as I used up two bottles of it. The texture is lighter than water, and it sinks in in a matter of seconds. My skin legitimately felt healthier, bouncier, and more resilient after continued use. It doesn’t feel hydrating by itself, but after a while I felt as though I didn’t need as much additional hydration as I normally do. I would say my skin looked brighter, but only marginally. There are downsides though—because of the mild exfoliation, I experienced a slight purge the first week of use. I also don’t think it’s compatible with strong retinoids because of its exfoliative properties. After being on adapalene for weeks, I noticed a stinging sensation when I would apply it. Luckily I was towards the very end of the bottle and was able to use it up.\n\n**Missha Ingredients:** Bifida ferment lysate, diethoxyethyl succinate, niacinamide, 1,2 hexanediol, adenosine, water, lecithin, saccharomyces ferment filtrate, potassium sorbate, glycerin, hydrogenated lecithin, acetic acid, water, polyquaternium-51, ceramide NP, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, yeast ferment extract, lactic acid, hordeum vulgare extract, cassia alata leaf extract, ethylhexylglycerin, sodium PCA, butylene glycol, dipropylene glycol.\n\n**Missha Review:** I switched to Missha because I couldn’t justify dropping another $200 on a FTE without at least trying a dupe, and I’m glad I did. If SK-II is lighter than water, Missha is about the same as water. It’s by no means thick or heavy, just not quite as light, and doesn’t sink in as immediately. Besides the texture, the first thing I noticed is that it felt very hydrating. I’m assuming there has to be some degree of exfoliation going on because of the small amount of lactic acid, but it didn’t sting my retinoid treated skin in the least. In fact, it felt very soothing. Even when I ramped up adapalene to tretinoin, there were no bad reactions. My skin doesn’t feel quite as healthy/resilient as it did with SK-II, but despite that it *looks* better. It’s smoother, my redness is noticeably reduced, and overall looks brighter.\n\n**Final comparison/wrap up:** If I’m considering price, Missha is the winner. It accomplishes some pretty impressive things for being less than a 1/4 of the price of SK-II. If price isn’t a consideration, I think it’s less clear cut. SK-II feels higher end on the skin, and I’ll forever miss that healthy skin feeling and subtle luminosity—but again, I don’t think it’s suitable to use with super strength actives like tretinoin, unless you’ve been on it for a long time and are 100% adjusted to it. IMO Missha is better if you’re after immediate hydration, want more soothing action, and prefer to use harsh actives.\n\nI tried to be as thorough as possible, but I did start this at 4am after not sleeping well… so if I need to clarify anything please let me know! As always I love questions, and hope I helped :)",

I’m out of the loop, but I really thought - wow, when did missha sponsor some esports team??!\n\nsecond, I can actually add something on topic. I used to really like the missha one and used it for a good while (easily 4 bottles). but a couple years back they changed the formula again and that made me breakout pretty fast (normal/dry skin). not sure if it was that yeast ferment, but it didn’t really agree with me. I’m still using the night ampoule from the same line. it has been changed twice aswell, but without negative effects for me. \n\nI feel like this duo of fte and ampoule is one of their staples, but by the time (which is a really long time usually) you need to repurchase, there might be a new edition. not sure if that is the case for skII aswell.",

I had initially planned to write this review 2 weeks after using the latter, but I’ve had a below average experience in one week itself so I’d like to share my review in hopes of being of help to those who want to purchase it.\n\n*I have dry skin not prone to acne, have very little to no pigmentation and use Vitamin C as a preventive measure against ageing, sun damage and dullness. I live in an area with high UV levels and a very humid climate.*\n\n*My routine: Episoft Cleansing Lotion, Laneige Cream Skin Refiner: Toner & Moisturiser, Minimalist's Vitamin C Serum, Bello Photostable Emulgel SPF 40 (day) and Moskina Cream (night).*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Texture Shot](https://preview.redd.it/35qouoy87q871.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9053ecf1c188f97b487b54a5a2b714b59a0a04cd)\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\nChemist At Play:\n\n>Water, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic acid, Propan-di-ol, Sodium Isomerate, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Ferulic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Oryza Sativa (Rice Phytoceramide), Amorphophallus (Konjac Phytoceramide), Hamamelis Virginiana, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 80.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMinimalist:\n\n>Centella Asiatica Leaf Water, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Ethoxydiglycol, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Glycerin, Sodium Gluconate, Acetyl Glucosamine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pullulan, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lecithin, Lactic Acid\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/q0l52oub7q871.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=452589ce63e896b49a2bb5a08fbc6956ad6b9cf5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChemist At Play has Witch Hazel and Citric Acid; this may not be problematic for all, but if they are for you then keep this serum away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, Minimalist gave me the actual results a Vitamin C serum is supposed to give but Chemist At Play did the reverse. I'm just glad that it didn't give me any CC's or acne. I'm going to go ahead and reverse the dullness through Minimalist's serum. I'm better off using a ceramide infused moisturiser after my serum than have it in my serum in this case, which is a pity because if this serum had worked for me, it would've been an all-rounder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, everyone's skin is different and this is just one, hopefully helpful review.",

We’re so excited in this growth and the thought provoking and interesting discussions that have sprouted in such a short time.\n\nDo you like the new CSS? /u/smallrobots is a beautiful wizard and put this together while I was sleeping. If you see any issues or areas of improvement, please let us know!\n\n---\n#Asian Beauty Network\n \nAs the Reddit Asian Beauty community grows, it has become increasingly obvious that a single catch all subreddit no longer fits the needs of the community. \n \nr/abdiscussion was created to be a thoughtful discussion oriented space, and was always intended to be a companion subreddit. That's why we’re really happy to work together with a group of dedicated moderators to be part a network of subreddits that allows you to create the perfect AB Reddit experience for you.\n \n* /r/AsianBeautyRehab\n* r/asianbeautyexchange \n* r/ABCJ \n* r/ABCJDiscussion and  \n* r/AsianBeautyAdvice. \n \nEach space caters to a different need, you can find them all [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeautyNetwork) with an explanation of what each subreddit focuses on. \n \nThere’s also a multireddit feed which can be found [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/user/stufstuf/m/asianbeautynetwork/) that you can copy, save  and edit!\n \nWith that in mind, this post will outline how we intend to manage Reviews, Help Threads and The Wiki on ABDiscussion.\n\n\n--- \n#Reviews\nReviews are back, with a format and a dedicated weekly thread! Thank you to /u/rumazazil for the initial template.\n \nAlongside Asian Beauty Reader’s Digest Monday, Monday will also feature a Review Thread! Each month, we will have a Monthly Review thread based on a central theme based on an interesting discussion topic raised by the community.\n \nReviews using the review structure are encouraged in the ‘Ingredients and Studies Tuesday’, ‘Makeup Discussion Wednesday’ and ‘Miscellaneous AB Thursday’ Weekly threads. \n  \n##Format\n \n* **Full Product Name**:\n* **Skin Type/Skin Tone/Current Climate**:\n* **Reason for Use**:\n* **Product Size & Price**:  \n* **Packaging**: \n* **Ingredients**: \n* **Product smell, texture & finish**:\n* **Product effects compared to claims**: \n* **Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products**:\n* **How long it has been used for**:\n* **Has it been/will it be repurchased**:\n* **Concluding remarks**:\n\n*example*:\n\n* **Full Product Name**:  Neogen Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Lemon\n* **Skin Type/Skin Tone/Current Climate**: Oily, acne prone, humid and cold.\n* **Reason for Use**: For gentle exfoliation\n* **Product Size & Price**: Box of 8 pads, price unknown as it was a sponsor gift. \n* **Packaging**: Individually wrapped pads in a foil pouch. I really like this set because it makes it easy to carry around for overnight stays or on the plane.\n* **Ingredients**: Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol Denat., PEG/PPG017/6 Copolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract , Cymbopogon Citratus Extract, Citrus Unshiu Peel Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Tricholoma Matsutake Extract, Cordyceps Sinensis Extract , Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Saururus Chinensis Leaf/Root Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Broussonetia Kazinoki Bark Extract, Coptis Chinensis Root Extract , PEG-60 Hydrogenated Cator Oil, Carbomer, Tartaric Acid , Glycolic Acid , Lactic Acid , Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA, Benzophenone-5, CI 19140, CI 17200, Fragrance\n* **Product smell, texture & finish**: It smells like lemon, which is really off putting as I've had lemon = bad drilled into my head. It leaves a sticky finish but you have to wash it off. \n* **Product effects compared to claims**: Claims - \"this product provides gentle yet effective exfoliation of dead skin cells and impurities, leaving skin smoother and clear.\" Sure, I guess? It's gentle, but I didn't think it left it particularly smoother than any of my regular acid products.\n* **Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products**: I use it as my acid step after cleansing, but it's a wash off acid, so you have to bear that in mind.\n* **How long it has been used for**: I've used two pads so far.\n* **Has it been/will it be repurchased**: Has not been repurchased, and will not be repurchased.\n* **Concluding remarks**: I like them well enough and I'm glad I got to try it because those tubs have been super inviting, and I've been lemming HARD. But honestly it just hasn't wowed me to make me want to use it often. Especially as I have to wash it off, which is like, WHY. This is effort, I don't see a huge change and compared to the Innisfree Green Barley Peeling Pad, it's pretty meh. What I will say is that you can use it as a body pad just before a shower which is actually not bad because it is mega mega soaked in product.\n \n\nIf there are other points you think should be included in the template or removed, please let us know. \n\n--- \n#Help Threads, Asking for Advice & The Wiki \nFor the foreseeable future we will not have help threads. The daily threads are discussion threads, not help threads, so while advice has been freely given we want to make it very clear that **no member of the community is obligated to give advice or help anyone**. Every discussion topic should feel like a slumber party where you're talking stuff out with your friends. Advice should be part of an organic discussion. \n \nInstead of, “I'm NW15, should I buy The Face Shop Super Ultra Cool to the MAX in 13?”\n \nTry, “It's summer and I've seen a lot of cooling cushions around that make me really curious. Do they work? I have no idea! I read this review that said they do and this one that says they don't. My NW15 skin thinks they're a gimmick, but I'm tempted to get this The Face Shop Super Ultra Cool to the MAX in 13 I found on Peony Peony Store. Anyone tried any cooling products from this line?”\n\nPlease remember, if you can easily do an internet search for the answer, you should do so, not expect anyone else to do it for you.\n\nAs r/AsianBeautyAdvice have awesome plans for a wiki, we will not be curating one in the traditional sense.  \n \n--- \n#Other Points:\n\n**Flairs**\n\nThere is also no need for post flairs as everything should be a discussion! \n\nOther than no self promotion (ie no link to your blog/external platform) we have no restrictions on personal flairs. Skin type, location and skin tone are common flair content, but you can also have fun with it as long as it isn’t offensive.\n \nAn example of suitable flairs would be:\n \n* Snail enthusiast\n* Dry/Sensitive Skin | Australia\n* NW20 | Passionate about AB makeup!\n* Tony Moly Banana Pack needs more love\n \n\n**Blogger, Businesses & External Content Creators:**\n\nNo shameless self promotion and no stand alone threads centered around your content. All content creators must follow a 10:1 rule, where for every post of self promotion (ie, relevant link to external content in a discussion post) there must be 10 posts that have nothing to do with themselves or their brand.\n \nIf you are a blogger or external content creator you are expected to participate as any other member of the community, there will be no special flair given.\n \n**Business Rules:** \n\nBusiness representatives who are hoping to post on behalf of their business (ie, clarify ingredient list, or use of product) must first identify themselves to the moderators and they will be given a special flair. Failure to do so will result in all unverified ‘official’ posts being removed.\n \nBasically, you have to prove you’re posting on behalf of Jolse before we let you post on behalf of Jolse.\n \n \n \n#Next Steps:\n\nWe are looking for new mods! Horray!\n \nUS Timezone preferably as I am in the EU and /u/smallrobots is in AUS.\n \nWe are looking for 3 mods:\n\n* 1 CSS Dedicated mod, has no other responsibilities. \n* 3 to help with the day to day moderation. \n\nThis involves clearing out the spam queue, moderating to the rules and responding to modmail.\n \nIf you are interested please send us a modmail with the title, “ABD Mod Application” with a little bit of information about yourself and why you think you would be a great mod!\n\n---\n\n#Thank you!\n\nThat's it for now, thank you guys for all your feedback, we are always listening and we are always working to make ABD the best space we possibly can. New rules take effect immediately, and the sidebar will be updated to reflect that from tomorrow.\n\nAs always, the comments are open for your comments!

Some of these are repeats and some were first time bought. Let me start with the repeats:\n\n**1) Minimalist Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid 16%**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 599/- for 20 ml. I got Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen SPF 40 free with it.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Butylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Gluconate, Ferulic Acid, Coceth-7, Phenoxyethanol, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Fullerenes, Tocopherol Acetate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PVP, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Dropper black bottle, comes with an extra carton\n\n**Fragrance:** None \n\nIf there's one product I've always raved about, it's this Vitamin C Serum. This has become my HG that I've purchased Multiple times now, and will probably repurchase in future. \n\nI love how it lasts longer and doesn't oxidise quickly compared to other Vitamin C Serums, and there's a no difference in my skin on its usage. It does a good job at lightening and fading acne spots and marks. The only other Vitamin C Serum I like is Cosrx 23%, but it's quite heavy on the pockets. \n\nI'm quite tempted to try out the Klairs and the Numbuzin one. Would appreciate the reviews if anyone has used them.\n\n**2) Formularx Hydrashied Vitamin C + Peptide Watery Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 699/- for 50 ml. It's frequently available on BOGO offers on their website.\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Vitamin C, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Octocrylene, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate/VP Copolymer, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Gold, Disodium EDTA, Pentapeptide-4, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glutathione, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is my second tube, and I love the texture. It's very lightweight, absorbs easily, no greasiness on the skin and yes, No whitecast. It also doesn't burn my eyes, like the Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen. I doubt it's waterproof, as the tube does state to reapply after exposure to water. Using this post snail mucin essence or a hyaluronic moisturizer gives a dewy look. \n\nAs far as protecting against sun exposure goes, I do cover my face with a dupatta when I leave home. I'd say there's a light tan on my face coz the summer heat is at its peak. Though labmuffin says that good sunscreen don't always prevent tan so I don't know what to say about that. \n\nAs far as the texture goes, it's Amazing, just don't expect miracles when it comes to sun protection.\n\n**3) Pyungkal Yul Calming Moisture  Barrier Cream**\n\n**💸 PRICE:** Rs. 1250/- for 50 ml. Frequently available on discounts at Maccaron\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Centella Asiatica, Ceramides\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isohexadecane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Ceramide NP, Arachidic Acid, Glucose, Palmitic Acid, Oleic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Squalane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Packaging:** Tub\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is a BOMB moisturizer. Having a combination skin with oily Tzone always meant trouble finding a good barrier repair cream. Most barrier repair moisturizer having ceramides have thicker textures that feel either too heavy or too greasy, or both, on the skin.\n\nNow I had just started Olay Retinol Serum, and was in need to a ceramide moisturizer to protect my skin barrier. I just randomly bought this on Maccaron when it was available on a great discount.\n\nAnd I've found my HG. It's so good, so lightweight, not at all heavy and soothing. I always end up with a pimple while trying ceramide cream but this one was so light it didn't feel greasy at all. \n\nI'm in love and this has definitely entered my list of future repurchase. \n\n**4) Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water**\n\n**💸Price:**  Rs. 1500/- for 150ml Available on discounts at multiple websites\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Ginseng, Niacinamide, Adenosine\n\n**Ingredients:** Panax Ginseng Root Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Glucoside, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Disodium Edta, Glucose, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lactobacillus/Panax Ginseng Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n**Claims:** Cruelty free, no artificial fragrance, colorants, mineral oil, parabens, sulfates.\n\nA cult favourite toner, how could I skip this? And here's my judgement, it's good to damp your skin and give a nice plump. Not ideal if you're looking for the glass skin effect. I think this is one of those products that don't give an immediate result, but when you use it consistently, you do feel your skin looks better. \n\nHaving said that, I don't think this would be a repurchase. It's good, but nothing that stood out. I'd rather experiment with multiple other toners available in the market. ",

I guess because it’s pure ascorbic acid it really does a good job on giving a subtle brightening glow and lightening some spots.\n\nAlso it is not very mild so when i started using it alone it gave me dry flaky skin. So I started mixing it with my moisturiser and things were good !\n\nBefore this I have only used Sugandha vit C which I also liked and Minimalist 10% vit C which did nothing for my skin.",

    "body": "You want to know if it worked...I'm burying the lede here. Stay with me though.\n\nI have not had a chance to read the papers K18's team wrote in the last 10 years, so I decided to do this \"part 1\" with current results, then a part 2 with paper/patent comments plus how my hair fared in an upcoming bleaching service.\n\nK18 is a post-wash leave-in treatment applied on towel-dried hair. The claim is \"...molecular breakthrough clinically proven to reverse hair damage in 4 minutes\" from bleach, dyeing, heat, other chemical services like perms.\n\nAnd\n\n>Traveling into the inner-most layers of hair to reach the core polypeptide chains (keratin chains), our revolutionary K18Peptide™ is just the right size and makeup to fit in and reconnect broken chains.\n\nIngredients as of this writing:\n\nWater, Alcohol Denat., Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Cetyl Esters, Behentrimonium Chloride, Polysorbate 20, sh-Oligopeptide-78 (K18Peptide™), Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Starch, Isopropyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance, Geraniol, Linalool, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Alcohol.\n\nIt is sold in 5 ml sample sizes or 50 ml full size. The pump pushes out about 1ml of product and anywhere from 1 to 4+ pumps is needed for the treatment depending on hair length, volume, & strand thickness. The lotion goes over clean but not conditioned towel-dried hair. Once applied, it needs to sit on hair for 4 minutes before using any other product.\n\nThe instructions are to use every time you wash your hair for 4 to 6 washes. If using a lot of product (no explanation on how 'heavy product use' is defined), the website text recommends a clarifying shampoo before application. After the initial 4-6 applications, the rate is 1 application every 3 to 4 washes.\n\nPros (and DOES IT WORK?):\n\nK18 improved the look and feel of my bleached hair ends, and the hair ends curled with no coaxing needed and felt soft/shiny again. The time my hair takes to dry without products shortened by 1.5 hours. Frizz diminished. Squishing my hair after washing produced less water. And I got to day 4 curly hair, which had not happened to me, ever.\n\nI saw significant change after application #4. I had committed to doing 6 washes/applications, so I continued. Areas of my hair that had been bleached more than the rest showed improvement last.\n\nLike Olaplex, K18 does something good, but I cannot state that it does what it claims (insert peptide chain in cortex, have peptide chain chemically link up bits and pieces in cortex). I did not test elasticity.\n\nK18 significantly improved hydrophobicity. Based on the list of ingredients I bet there is heavy adsorbtion of cationics going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLess pro, but not cons:\n\n1. The amount to apply is tiny, and spreading it throughout the hair is challenging because one cannot see where product has been applied versus where it has not, plus the product is all over your palms, so cannot feel, either. For my hair I needed 4-5 pumps (4-5 ml), so I applied in sections, ends first, and hoped for the best.\n2. For people whose curly hair routine includes putting styling products in sopping wet hair, or not touching curls, using K18 requires rethinking all that as it is applied on clean towel dried hair, and must  be applied before any other hair product.\n3. If you co-wash, I would suggest using a shampoo that does not deposit much of anything on the hair prior to using K18\n4. The dosing chart is hidden on the product page (you must select the accordion chevron--the arrow pointing down-- to the right of \"how to use\"  to see the text)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAssorted: If buying the 50 ml product in the US, your cost is $1.50/pump. The 5 ml sample cost is $2.40/pump. Also, their customer service answered my questions pretty fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill I buy again? \n\nEDITED 5 /8 / 2022: Link to Part 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18\\_my\\_experience\\_part\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18_my_experience_part_2/)",

    "body": "I have dry, eczema-prone skin, some light rosacea, and a couple of diagnosed skin allergies.  Here are reviews of the empties that have been in my bathroom recycling bin for the past few months:\n\nLa Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 - At the start of winter my skin went crazy.  I picked this up in a moment of desperation.  I'm so glad I tried this stuff.  It was a great night time occlusive.  It also made a great daytime moisturizer/primer on makeup days.  WRP\n\nInkey List Snow Mushroom Moisturizer - The first time I tried this my skin was tight, dry and itchy by late afternoon.  It's probably fine, but it's not for me, it's probably better suited for oily skin types.  I used it up by adding an oil to it.  The lesson I learned here is that I need to stop being enticed by pretty sounding ingredients.  WNRP\n\nMay Coop Raw Moisturizer - I picked this up at TJ Marshall's just before I was diagnosed with a number of allergies (fragrance high among them) in 2018.  The amount of fragrance in this stuff is eye watering.  I used this up on my feet and lower body.  After being fragrance free for over a year, I can't believe that once upon a time I would have used this stuff on my face...  WNRP\n\nCeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream - I've been through numerous jars of this cream.  It's a good stand alone product for my dry skin, it doesn't require the addition of oils or anything else to make it work.  I wish it was a little less pricey, but it's totally worth it to me.  I pick it up when it's on sale.  WRP\n\nPaula's Choice Lip & Body Treatment Balm - It's a great lip balm.  But there are lots of great lip balms out there.  I probably wouldn't have purchased this on my own, it was a free gwp, and I'm glad I tried it.  It's nicely moisturizing and fragrance-free.  Once I go through the million other lip balms I have laying around I'll probably circle back to this one.  WRP\n\nBenton Cacao Moist and Mild Toner - I picked this up when I was having moisture barrier issues.  It really is nice and mild, not particularly moisturizing though.  I'd say it's on par, maybe a step below, the Etude House SoonJung Toner.  WNRP\n\nMissha Near Skin Phyto Azulen Cream - This was just ok.  My skin didn't feel particularly calmed by this moisturizer, but it wasn't irritated either.  The packaging was annoying, it's an old school aluminum tube.  I may have liked it more had I tried it during the summer.  WNRP\n\nCosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence - I will buy this stuff as long as it's being produced.  It really is soothing.  This makes a good mixing medium for cocktailing serums that are too irritating to be put directly on my skin (vitamin C's and some retinols) and other random (mostly TO) serums that I'm trying to use up before expiration.  WRP\n\nCSI Collagen Nourish Anti-Wrinkle Serum - The ingredients list looked promising: Chondrus crispus (seaweed) extract, purified water, hyaluronic acid, pseudoalteromonas ferment extract, hydrolyzed wheat protein, hydrolyzed soy protein, tripeptide-10 citrulline, tripeptide-1, phenoxyethanol and ethylhexylglycerin.  This was ok at first.  But something irritated me while I was using this.  I stopped using it (and nearly everything else) for about a month, when I went back to try it again, it had gone cloudy, so I didn't finish it.  There are other peptide serums that I know and love.  WNRP\n\nMissha Time Revolution Night Repair - I've been using this stuff for years, it's something I always come back to.  It's a good basic all around serum.  I use it both day and night.  Missha has a number of sales throughout the year.  WRP\n\nThe Ordinary Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Solution 20% in Vitamin F - I gave TO's 23% Vitamin C a bunch of chances, but it totally messed me up.  This was a much friendlier alternative for my skin.  I didn't usually use it neat, since it was and oil I usually added it to a moisturizer or a moisturizing serum.  WRP\n\nThe Ordinary 100% Organic Virgin Chia Seed Oil - I have really dry skin, and this winter was especially bad.  I use a lot of different types of oils.  I went through this one very quickly, it was nice.  I'll probably pick it up again in the future after I finish everything else up.  WRP\n\nThe Ordinary \"B\" Oil - I wanted to like this.  But I had some irritation while I was using this.  I'm not sure if this was the culprit, but it does have rosemary.  I did finish it, mixed in with moisturizer.  But there are plenty of other oils that I like and that I'm 100% sure of.  WNRP\n\nLotioncrafter Neossance Squalane - I've tried The Ordinary, Acure, and a sample of Drunk Elephant.  I can't say I noticed a major difference between any of them.  This one is cheapest and works just as well as any of the others.  I'll stick to this one or The Ordinary.  WRP\n\nVMV Hypoallergenics Red Better Deeply Soothing Cleansing Cream - I picked this up when my skin was recovering from an allergic reaction.  It's just ok.  Nothing from this brand has been worth the high price tag in my opinion.  The CeraVe non-foaming cleanser works just as well.  And the Paula's Choice Moisture Boost One Step Cleanser is even better than the CeraVe.  WNRP",

    "body": "[Here](https://imgur.com/a/Mnijy) are some pictures of the goods! \n\nWhen you get a haul, even a mini one, there is always at least one thing that doesn't work out the way you thought it would. For my finicky skin, it's usually several things. So I was ***shocked*** when not only did everything from my recent AB haul work for me, but it all worked ***really*** well. So well that I wanted to share my excitement with all of you! I'm still mildly in disbelief right now, this never happens. \n\nCVS was having a BOGO 50% off sale so I decided to try a couple things that I’ve had my eye on. I thought these reviews might be helpful for those in this sub that aren’t very familiar with AB products. My routine is a mix of different types of brands (I do love my French pharmacy products) but I’ve had a lot more luck finding things that work for my skin type in the AB world. Some people get scared off at the idea of ordering things from overseas - either because of shipping cost or the length of shipping times. Since these are all products carried at CVS, they are a lot more accessible for those in the US. \n\n**Skin type:** Oily, dehydration-prone, sometimes sensitive (depends on its mood that day), with a very low tolerance for silicones. \n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Cleansing Foam -** I've had rough luck with foaming cleansers as they all seem to strip my skin (other than my HG LRP Toleraine but it's fun to switch it up sometimes). Not this guy! My skin loves anything aloe and this did not disappoint (aloe is the best humectant for oily skin imo). It has a very dense, thick foam that feels very nice on my skin. The scent is very fresh, it almost reminds me of fresh-cut watermelon and aloe mixed together. It leaves my skin very soft and not remotely stripped. No squeaky-clean feeling here! I'm not positive of the pH but it does contain potassium hydroxide (a pH adjuster) so I'm assuming it's in the normal range and not on the higher end. I think this is going to make a great AM cleanser since it's so gentle. \n\nIngredients: \nAloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Water, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Chlorphenesin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Palmitic Acid, Capric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Potassium Sorbate.\n\n(*Ah-ha! I just saw the watermelon extract as I was adding this, so that explains the lovely scent.)\n\n**Peach Slices Citrus-Honey Aqua Glow Hydrating Moisture Gel -** Holy shit you guys, this is ***everything*** I've been looking for in a winter moisturizer. It's lightweight, a gel, has ceramides, is hydrating *and* moisturizing and doesn't make me oily. The search is over! Seriously, I've been trying to find the perfect moisturizer for about 8 months now. I thought I had the perfect one (Etude House Moistfull Collagen Water Jelly Cream) but turns out it was perfect *for summer*. Once winters cold, dry air came it just wasn't enough. I've desperately wanted to add ceramides to my routine with no luck (Rosette Ceramide Gel was a greasy disaster). The inclusion of ceramides is what originally caught my eye and also the lack of any -cones. My skin is sensitive to silicones and finding a heavier winter moisturizer without any has been virtually impossible. This does include a couple -anes so I was skeptical at first but they don’t seem to bother me as much as straight up dimethicone. Dimethicone + my skin = a greasy mess and lots of clogged pores (and fun little whiteheads all over). The first time I used it, I squeezed out too much but thought 'what the heck, I'll see what happens'. As I began to spread it around, I realized that it was *way* too much product and figured I was doomed for an oily face that night. Cut to a few minutes later, when I was shocked to find that it had ***all*** absorbed. It dries down quickly to a soft, almost-matte finish. It legit gives my skin a healthy glow without making it oily, something that I didn't think was possible. The first time I wore it to work, I was ***incredibly*** impressed by the fact that my skin was still matte at the end of the day. My work's super dry air usually drives my dehydrated skin nuts and by the end of the day, it's over-produced a ton of oil to compensate. But not with this!! It gives my skin the hydration it always needs with just enough moisture to seal it all in. I am absolutely over-the-moon in love with this product and I can't recommend it enough! \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide Np, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol.\n\n**The Saem Iceland Hydrating Soothing Gel -** The name pretty much says it all and it lives up to those claims. It's very hydrating, soothing and feels very refreshing. The fascinating thing about this product is how it dries down. It leaves an almost undetectable finish. I've never had anything disappear into my skin before - and I say that in the best way possible. It doesn't leave a tacky film the way most gels do. I use the Skinfood aloe gel daily (which does leave a bit of stickiness) and out of curiosity, I applied this on top of it. The combo dried down to almost nothing! It took away the stickiness all together. I am highly impressed with this gel! It is definitely a staple in my routine now and (*gasp*) may just replace my beloved Skinfood aloe (at least in the AM).\n\nIngredients: Water, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Perfume, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Silica, Betaine, Heptane, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Propylene Glycol, Butylene glycol, Cetraria Islandica Extract, Sorbitol, Citric acid, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Lactic acid.\n\n**Elisha Coy Refreshing Ampoule Solution Sheet Mask -** Another product that lives up to its name. I was nervous because these are on the cheaper side and usually the quality reflects that. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised! The mask itself fit very well. It's on the thinner side and it reminds me a lot of my fav sheet masks, the Etude House 0.2mm Air Therapy. It stayed in place and despite the essence being very watery, it didn't drip everywhere. The mask really seemed to hold onto the essence. After I took it off, I patted in the remaining essence from the pouch and it all absorbed completely. I was able to continue my routine with no issues. My skin was left hydrated, soothed and happy. \n\nIngredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Chrysanthellum Indicum Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance.\n\nI haven’t had the chance yet to try the rest of the sheet masks yet but I am very excited to do so!! If anyone has any questions, I’m happy to help! :)\n",

    "body": "I’ve tried many creams and hydrating serums/toners over the years, but consistently the best one at plumping and hydrating and overall being a sponge to water has not been a face or body product but a hand cream. The LRP Cicaplast hand cream absorbs water like crazy (probably because of the 30% glycerin), plumping up the skin instantly (especially if you apply it to wet skin). It’s also got 4% niacinamide, as well as shea butter and dimethicone to complete the cream (so it’s not just a humectant-style product). It works fine alone but I like to layer another cream on top overnight to really pack in that moisture in my dry climate, my favorite combo with it being Eucerin Eczema Relief Body Cream.\n\nBecause it’s made for the hands, it seems to be formulated to not be too greasy or tacky as well.\n\n(I’ve heard people say similar things about using the Neutrogena Norwegian Formula hand cream on the face, which also has high percentage glycerin—I think 40%.)\n\nINGREDIENTS:\nAQUA/ WATER ∙ **GLYCERIN** ∙ BUTYLENE GLYCOL ∙ CETEARYL ALCOHOL ∙ **NIACINAMIDE** ∙ GLYCERYL STEARATE ∙ **BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER / SHEA BUTTER** ∙ **DIMETHICONE** ∙ PEG / PPG-18/18 DIMETHICONE ∙ GLYCERYL STEARATE SE ∙ SODIUM POLYACRYLATE ∙ CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ∙ PHENOXYETHANOL\n\nEdit: I wouldn’t suggest using this as an AM moisturizer.

    "body": "\nSkin Type: Extremely Oily and Acne Prone\n\nWeather: Hot and dry\n\nReview Type: Rave\n\nUsage Period: 3 months \n\nActive ingredients: \n\n* 3% tranexamic acid \n* 1% HPA (hydroxyphenoxy propionic acid)\n*  3% mandelic acid \n* 0.3% salicylic acid\n\nAll ingredients: aqua, avena sativa (oat) kernel extract, tranexamic acid, dimethyl isosorbide, mandelic acid, pentylene glycol, methylpropanediol, acetyl glucosamine, hydroxyphenoxy propionic acid, sodium polyglutamate, sodium hyaluronate, ethoxydiglycol, salicylic acid, xanthan gum, lecithin, phenoxyethanol, sclerotium gum, pullulan, ethylhexylglycerin, curcuma longa (turmeric) root extract, trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate.\n\nTexture: it is liquidy but not runny, and it has a yellow colour due to presence of turmeric.\n\nReview\n\nThis product is the most favourite part of my skincare because when I apply the serum at night, it always lives up to my expectation of waking up with a clean shiny skin next morning. \n\nWhen I first started using the product, I built up tolerance by starting once a week, then twice, then thrice and gradually everyday (except on the nights I use a AHA BHA Peel)\n\nI love the formulation of this serum the most because it honestly has everything which an oily, acne prone skin needs.\nMadelic acid is a really gentle exfoliant and since the serum has the same amt of Mandelic acid as Tranexamic which we can call it a gentle exfoliating serum too. It also a tiny amt salicylic acid which makes it an all rounder for my routine. \n\nI’ve been using the serum along with 2% granactive Retinod from Be Minimalist.\nI apply the Tranexamic acid serum, wait for a couple of minutes for it to sink it, and layer it with a pea size of Granactive Retinoid. This has been advised to me by the Be Minimalist team. I top it up with moisturiser. I’m the happiest when I wake up to smoother skin.\n\nOne thing I don’t understand is no matter how flawless my skin looks in the morning, it becomes a little bumpy, oily, filled with CCs by the end of the day. Does this happen to y’all too?\n\nI’ve definitely seen a reduction in hyperpigmentation and acne with this routine and especially the Tranexamic acid serum over past 3 months but I’ve been battling with greasy oily skin at the end of the day and formation of small CCs which go away in the morning. The Tranexamic acid serum fades my new acne marks a lot quicker than the amount of time it took me earlier to get rid of a scar. \nAlso, I didn’t take sunscreen seriously earlier and had grown a shade darker than my original skintone, with use of this, I’ve been back to my original skintone. \nI had this little small visible black heads on my cheeks which have faded too over past 2-3 months. \nI will definitely repurchase the serum. \n\nMy routine \nAM: \n- Pulp Vit C serum\n- Sepicalm moisturiser (sometimes)\n- Neutrogena Sheer Zinc sunscreen\n(It has white cast but it’s the only one that suits me and doesn’t irritate me or cause breakouts, idc about the white cast much because most of times I’m at home and when I’m out I wear a mask)\n\nPM:\n- Double Cleansing with\n* The Face Shop Rice cleansing oil\n* Bioderma Sebum Cleanser\n- Cosrx Snail Mucin \n(I usually go for a walk or run and come back sweaty so I splash my face with plain water and do my night routine at 11)\n- Tranexamic acid serum\n- Granactive Retinoid \n- Sepicalm Moisturiser from Be Minimalist",

        "body": "Oh, this is the first I'm noticing the mandelic acid in there! This is an exfoliating serum! 🤔 Thanks for the thorough review, OP ❤\n\nAs for your developing CCs by the end of the day - the Sepicalm moisturiser might be too heavy for you to use in the AM, but more than that, I suspect you're over-exfoliating 😅 The vitamin C in the morning, AFAIK, is an L-ascorbic one, so that's acidic, and causes some mild exfoliation. The TxA serum at night is exfoliation. Then on top of that, you do the AHA-BHA peel as well? *Plus*, getting used to a retinoid already compromises barrier function. \n\nIt's a *lot* of exfoliation, combined. You may not be peeling, but it causes that shiny-plasticky look, and makes skin more vulnerable to acne bacteria and fungal acne and general infections. \n\nLuckily, people with oily skin have a bit more of a natural barrier function. I'd say maybe stop using the peel, and dial back using the TxA serum to alternate days, and you should see your skin become more balanced. Give your skin some time to function between actives.\n\nEdit: the Minimalist team and their website have terrible suggestions for how often to use their products, don't go by that!",

I had to try tons of oil cleansers to find which one my skin likes and emulsifies well.\n\n-Mineral sunscreen\nthis one might be obvious to sensitive skin goers but i noticed it helped a lot in the skin healing. \n\nSo here is my super sime routine \nAM: Rinse with water. \ndry completely,\n apply vanicream spf 30 or versed guards up 35\n\nPM: Bioderma micellar cleansing oil (its new but its my absolute holy grail) \neucerin night balance, or cetaphil redness night moisturizer \n\nLet me know any thoughts you guys have!",

I hope I don't make too many people angry by saying this, but I have this as well. It's soothing but if I'm being completely honest, the Purito centella green level buffet serum & benton aloe BHA toner gave me better results (surprisingly,, purito has essential oils). I use both at the same time and it calms down a huge zit forming overnight. I tried to do that many times with LRP's cica balm but it;s not as anti-inflammatory as the other two, at least for my skin.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4r7uax1zxl731.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4ce9c60b5a9a66c2fc0744d75a08e95e53b50ed\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[From Geeky Posh blog](https://preview.redd.it/hetkbxbgyl731.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=46ee39406e52428f993871d1ef41049841a53157)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**16. \\[IOPE\\] Derma Repair Cica Repair Cream - 3.99/5 (2,957 Reviews)**\n\n50ml/32,000 won - $27.72\n\nWATER / AQUA / EAU, PROPANEDIOL, **SQUALANE,** CETEARYL ALCOHOL, POLYGLYCERYL-3 METHYLGLUCOSE DISTEARATE, **BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER,** CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, **PANTHENOL**, DI-C12-13 ALKYL MALATE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYL ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, HYDROXYPROPYL STARCH PHOSPHATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, **ALLANTOIN,** STEARIC ACID, **HYDROGENATED LECITHIN,** GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, DISODIUM EDTA, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, **MADECASSOSIDE**, CHAMAECYPARIS OBTUSA LEAF EXTRACT, TOCOPHEROL.

One of the main points of mango butter is that it has skin soothing/healing properties, but it's not greasy. Honey is very good for skin because of its sugars and antioxidant value. Also, a few studies show that it can be healing for wounds. Royal Jelly, however, does not have any evidence of helping skin a whole lot.*\n\n*Potentially problematic ingredients: The oils in this are great, but the high % olive oil may be bothersome to acne-prone skin types. YMMV.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I couldn't fit more pictures in this post, but the reviews say this is a light gel cream type that absorbs very fast.](https://preview.redd.it/fnpdk02yzl731.png?width=355&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bd89c8b5ffb3adb0019df2bb8a49bfb8f1209a7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm sorry to keep having to make separate posts and spamming everyone.
