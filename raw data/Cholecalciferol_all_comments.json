The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L. The largest meta-analysis ever conducted of studies published between 1966 and 2013 showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <75 nmol/L may be too low for safety and associated with higher all-cause mortality, demolishing the previously presumed U-shape curve of mortality associated with vitamin D levels. Since all-disease mortality is reduced to 1.0 with serum vitamin D levels ≥100 nmol/L, we call public health authorities to consider designating as the RDA at least three-fourths of the levels proposed by the Endocrine Society Expert Committee as safe upper tolerable daily intake doses. This could lead to a recommendation of 1000 IU for children <1 year on enriched formula and 1500 IU for breastfed children older than 6 months, 3000 IU for children >1 year of age, and around 8000 IU for young adults and thereafter. Actions are urgently needed to protect the global population from vitamin D deficiency.\"\n\n**Conclusion:** \"Unfortunately, medicine took a very long time to realize that vitamin D is not simply a vitamin that prevents rickets. For that purpose, 400-600 IU/d may be enough. However, we know today that vitamin D is a powerful nuclear receptor-activating hormone of critical importance, especially to the immune system. With the available data mentioned above, the proposed doses would probably suffice to maintain vitamin D levels around or over 75-100 nmol/L, with practically zero risk of toxicity. Undeniably, further studies are needed to clarify the optimal supplementation of vitamin D, although it is uncertain whether a universal recommended dietary allowance is feasible. Meanwhile, actions are urgently needed to protect the global population from the threats posed by vitamin D deficiency.\"\n\n**tl;dr:** Talk to your physician about measuring your Vitamin D levels and see if supplementing more would be a good idea. (You probably shouldn't take more than 10,000 IU, though.)",

It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin’s outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin’s water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin’s barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates—aspirin’s technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics. Shea butter is a rich source of antioxidants.\n\n**Ingredient Lists**\n\n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n>\n> **CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Active Ingredients: Homosalate (12%), Octinoxate (7.5%), Octocrylene (2%), Zinc Oxide (3.5%). \n> Inactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate and Boron Nitride, Dimethicone, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n> \n> **CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Mineral Oil, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Trolamine, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Dimethicone 360, Methylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Triethanolamine, Cetyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Methylparaben, Edetate Disodium, Propylparaben, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Glyceryl stearate SE, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Saccharide Isomerate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 1, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic  Acid, Caprooyl Tetrapeptide-3, Tripeptide-1, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Phytosphingosine, Dextran, Xanthan Gum\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n>\n>Purified Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Emulsifying Wax, Niacinamide, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lauric Acid, Zinc Citrate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Arginine PCA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, EDTA, Sodium PCA, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**\n>\n>Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Petrolatum, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nHopefully this information will be useful to people interested in trying Cerave.",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

Materials: The study was conducted from January to September. At the beginning of the study, 33 professional soccer players were enrolled; however, only 28 subjects (height 181.5 cm; body mass 77.81 ± 8.8 kg; body fat 12.38% ± 2.4% and muscle mass 40.27 ± 5.3 kg) completed the study. The research consisted of three stages. The first one, lasting 10 days, was conducted in January during a training camp in the south part of Cyprus at a latitude of 34 33°, where participants experienced natural sun exposure; it was called a winter sun exposure (WSE) period. The second stage, which was a supplementation period (SP), lasted 6 weeks, during which all subjects were randomly assigned either to an experimental group—EG (_n_ = 15)—or a placebo group—PG (_n_ = 13)—and were administered 6000 IU/d cholecalciferol or a placebo, respectively. The third stage took place in September, after summertime (summer sun exposure—SSE). The data of the 25(OH)D, free and total testosterone (fT, tT), cortisol as well as 5 and 30 m sprint tests (STs), power of the left leg (PLL) and VO2max were evaluated before and after the WSE period, the SP and SSE. Results: In January, the baseline value of vitamin D in 12 subjects was ≤20 ng/mL, and 14 of them had levels between 20–30 ng/mL and 2 individuals >30 ng/mL. After the WSE period, significant changes in 25(OH)D, fT, tT and cortisol concentration, as well as in the 5 m ST, were observed. After the SP, in the EG, significant changes were found in 25(OH)D, fT, tT and the 5 m ST. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the concentration of 25(OH) fT and tT was observed. After SSE, 2 out of 28 players had <20 ng/mL 25(OH)D, 12 of them had 25(OH)D between 20 and 30 ng/mL and 14 of them had 25(OH)D between 30 and 50 ng/mL. Significant differences in 25(OH)D, fT, tT concentration and the 5 m ST performance were observed following SSE compared with the WSE period. Conclusion: Due to the serum level of 25(OH)D demonstrated by most participants at the beginning of the study and after summertime, all-year-round supplementation with high doses of vitamin D seems to be a reasonable solution to enhance high 25(OH)D concentration in blood and physical performance. In the middle of the winter, almost half of the soccer players were serum deficient of 25(OH)D. After ten days of sun exposure and 6 weeks of vitamin D supplementation, the concentration of 25(OH)D significantly increased, as did testosterone and results in the 5 m sprint test also improved. Therefore, athletes should be constantly monitored for serum levels of 25(OH)D throughout the year and should be supplemented if deficiencies or insufficient amounts of this vitamin occur.\n> \n> **Keywords:** vitamin D, supplementation, soccer, testosterone, speed, power\n\nFound here:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/foundmyfitness/status/1374086433955225600\n\n>Soccer players that supplemented with 6,000 IU of vitamin D significantly improved their blood vitamin D levels, **increased their free and total testosterone**, and performed better on the 5 m sprint test compared to the placebo group.",

The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L. The largest meta-analysis ever conducted of studies published between 1966 and 2013 showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <75 nmol/L may be too low for safety and associated with higher all-cause mortality, demolishing the previously presumed U-shape curve of mortality associated with vitamin D levels. Since all-disease mortality is reduced to 1.0 with serum vitamin D levels ≥100 nmol/L, we call public health authorities to consider designating as the RDA at least three-fourths of the levels proposed by the Endocrine Society Expert Committee as safe upper tolerable daily intake doses. This could lead to a recommendation of 1000 IU for children <1 year on enriched formula and 1500 IU for breastfed children older than 6 months, 3000 IU for children >1 year of age, and around 8000 IU for young adults and thereafter. Actions are urgently needed to protect the global population from vitamin D deficiency.",

Therefore, we evaluate the effect of longitudinal supplementation of vitamin D on parameters of physical fitness in monozygotic twins. In total, 74 participants were included, with a mean age of 25 years, divided into two groups, one group received supplementation with cholecalciferol for 60 days and the other group did not. Cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength were measured before and after supplementation through maximal treadmill tests and dynamometry, respectively. Wilcoxon tests were used to compare intragroup results and the Mann-Whitney test to examine intergroup differences. There was an increase in the serum concentration of vitamin D in participants who ingested the supplementation. Cardiorespiratory fitness improved after supplementation through increases in the values of maximum oxygen consumption of 28% (p < .001). Muscle strength in left hand grip increased 18% in participants who received the supplement (p = .007). Sixty days of cholecalciferol supplementation improved cardiorespiratory fitness and upper limb muscle strength.\n\n>**Keywords:** cholecalciferol; longitudinal studies; physical fitness; twins monozygotic.\n\n\nhttps://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijsnem/32/1/article-p2.xml\n\n>...\n\n>The twins included in the SG consumed one oily capsule of cholecalciferol per day, with a concentration of 2,000 IU, for a period of 60 days in the morning. This concentration does not exceed the maximum tolerable daily intake limit, which is 4,000 IU/day ([Del Valle et al., 2011](https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijsnem/32/1/article-p2.xml#r15)), in addition to being considered a dose for maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D in individuals after treatment for deficiency of this nutrient ([Singh & Bonham, 2014](https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijsnem/32/1/article-p2.xml#r42)). All participants in the SG received a follow-up form to record daily when they ingested the capsule. Sixty days after the start of supplementation, these forms were returned to the researchers for monitoring compliance. The researchers responsible for conducting physical tests and blood collection did not know which group the individual was included in, the CG or SG.\n\n>...\n\n>Vitamin D concentration in the SG twins increased 70% after 60 days of consuming 2,000 IU cholecalciferol daily T0 = 30.00 ng/ml (18.57–57.80 ng/ml) and T60= 50.87 ng/ml (31.57–85.49 ng/ml), _p_ < .001. In the CG, there was no variation in this concentration T0 = 30.02 ng/ml (16.13–52.03 ng/ml) and T60= 31.81 ng/ml (17.96–53.05 ng/ml), _p_ = .950. At T0, there were no differences between the CG and SG (_p_ = .189). No subject presented potentially toxic concentrations of [25(OH)D]. Vitamin D deficiency was observed in three individuals in the CG and two individuals in the SG at T0, while at T60, only the three individuals in the CG remained with vitamin D < 20 ng/ml. After the end of the period of inclusion in the study, these individuals received guidance to correct this deficiency.\n\n>Cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength presented no differences between the CG and SG at T0. However, at T60, absolute VO2max was different between the CG and SG (p < .015), since after supplementation, at T60, absolute VO2max increased by 28% in the SG (p < .001). All subjects maintained their usual routine during the 2 months of participation in the study, including the level of physical exercise, which can be confirmed by the lack of variation in respiratory exchange ratio in both groups\n\n>...\n\n\n>It is possible to conclude that increasing the serum concentration of vitamin D to values above 50 ng/ml has beneficial effects on physical fitness, improving VO2max and increasing manual muscle strength. However, better clarification of the molecular mechanisms of this role of vitamin D in improving skeletal and cardiorespiratory muscles is necessary.\n\n>...",

Closest Arxur-Controlled planet to Earth.   \n(13 human years since the end of the Human-Federation War).\n\n“Um, excuse me, yes? I got a message from here saying my order got flagged and I need to pick it up personally,” Lux said, holding up a pad with the message on it.\n\n“Ah. The prey feed.”\n\n“Yes! Yes, that's mine. Where do I… sign or scan a thumb or..?” \n\nThe arxur at the counter gave Lux a strange look, before turning and shouting over his shoulder. “Emkirss! The human is here.”\n\nThey just stood there, awkwardly, waiting. A voice from behind made Lux jump a bit. “You teach at the university.”\n\nIt wasn’t a question, but they decided to answer as if it had been one. “I do, yes. I teach Terran Philosophy.”\n\nThe arxur just grunted. The arxur, Lux had noticed, had quite a wide range of conversational prowess. Sometimes, a grunt like that could carry volumes. This was not one of those times. \n\nEventually, whoever this Emkirss person was emerged from a back room. He was wearing a rather official-looking sash. He also gave Lux a strange look.\n\n“...Um… Hello? Do I–” They stammered and pulled out their identification pin. “I’ve never gotten mail here before.”\n\nEmkirss held up a claw. “We know who you are. I just need to verify some things first.” He paused to clear his throat, sounding like someone had dropped a bunch of pebbles on a tile floor to Lux's ear. “Your package was automatically flagged by our system. I have to ask you if this is for personal use, and not for… cattle. Yes? Because that would be highly illegal.”\n\n\"Yes, I um, eat it. You know. Omnivore.”\n\n“I had fish and chips once,” the arxur behind Lux said. “It was illegally imported.”\n\nEmkirss gave him a dangerous look, but said nothing.\n\n“...How were they?” Lux asked. \n\n“It was good. But it gave me indigestion.”\n\n“Ah. Makes sense. I’ll… make it known, if I can make carnivore-friendly fries.”\n\n“So why are you getting prey feed?” the first attendant asked, peeking out from behind Emkirss. “I thought humans could eat meat.”\n\n“Yes, I also eat meat. The, um, the plan I actually have for those grains is to make something we call a *burger* back on Earth. You grind them down, add some yeast for the production of air bubbles, add in water and um… cook it… I have to experiment to see how it works here, anyway, it makes this bubbly thing made of the grains that's very soft and squishy called ‘bread’, and then I put cooked meat in between two slices of that.”\n\n“Gross.”\n\nThey grimaced “...Sorry?” \n\n“Nevermind. Alright, I’ve gone ahead and signed off on this shipment,” Emkirss said, making the last few taps on his pad with an air of finality.\n\n“Thank you. I’ll be ordering a shipment on a monthly basis, if it's good.”\n\nEmkirss nodded and gave a slow blink. “Enjoy your… burger.”\n\n“I’ll try. Thank you, and have a good… day?” they said, grabbing the bag full of alien grains and legumes. Once it was in their backpack, they pulled up a pad. “Mail, check… Florist…”\n\nIt was a short walk to the florist’s. The underground shopping hub was densely packed and efficient. Trees and grasses and algae tanks lined the paths, lit from above with artificial sunlight. There was a strip of glass running down the ceiling of the main walkway, letting in the precious natural light.\n\nThe shopping hubs near Halthekar’s place had a lot more natural light. And the shops there were generally nicer, too, but they didn’t have a florist. Or a post office.\n\nStill, Lux was glad it was short walk. People were already starting to stare by the time they ducked into the florist’s shop.\n\n“Um, hi, I might have a weird question for you,” they told the florist, who at least didn't seem super busy. She whipped around, her face immediately lighting up. \n\n“Oh!” she said, looking like her day had already been made. “Ask away!”\n\n“Thanks. Do you know if any of your flowers are fruiting plants? And if so, can I buy the fruit to eat?”\n\n“You want to eat the fruit? Sorry, I mean, yes, we do have some fruiting plants. There are saplings in the back as well, if you want larger fruits. We have skyertin tr—can you eat that? Sorry, I… They are meant to be decorative, so I... You know, attract risnil gliders? For viewing?” She seemed hardly unable to stop the words from tumbling through her lips.\n\n“I don't know, but that sounds very interesting. Are they very beautiful, these gliders?”\n\nShe nodded fervently, sliding out from behind the counter to lead her customer deeper into the shop. “Did you know, the tradition originally started to help keep insect populations down on large plantations? But, obviously, that changed when we lost our non-sapient cattle, and… you know. But people keep them around still, for the gliders. Well, on Wriss anyways. No gliders here! Here, people just buy them for the looks. And the scent.”\n\n“Fascinating! I’m glad that cultural practice has survived, Arxur aesthetic sensibilities are quite a delight to experience,” they said with a cheerful smile. “So… the answer was yes, I can buy the fruit?”\n\nShe stopped in her tracks. “You want just the fruit?”\n\n“For now, yes. I might ask for a sapling later. I have no idea if I can actually eat these fruits, they might be toxic, but I need to get some to test at the university lab. Once I have a general idea of the compounds, I’ll be able to try them out.”\n\n“What do you think they will taste like?”\n\n“...Well, you haven't been breeding them to be sweeter and richer for thousands of years, so I assume pretty sour or acidic.”\n\nShe nodded quietly for a while. “What does fruit taste like?”\n\n“...What do you mean? That… They taste like a lot of things. Fruits and vegetables have a lot more structural variation than meat, and meat has a *lot* of structural variation.”\n\nMore fervent nodding. “Interesting!” she said, smiling brightly. \n\nMostly out of a vague sense of obligation, Lux kept going. “Eatth fruits usually taste pretty sweet, because we’ve been selectively breeding them for thousands of years.”\n\nShe just kept nodding.\n\n“They vary in acidity, texture, water content… you could compare the difference between eating bird wings and eating fish, for example.”\n\nShe stopped at a tree in the cozy little nursery section of the shop. There were misters and bright artificial sunlamps set into the shelves. It was humid, and warm, like stepping off the plane somewhere tropical.\n\n“These are the older ones. The fruits only start to grow after a few years— Wriss years, that is— and they grow and ripen in three to four cycles each season.”\n\n“Alright… could I buy one that is already bearing fruit, if I end up able to eat it?”\n\n“Of course!” She reached up and expertly plucked a few of the soft purple fruits, dropping them into a spare pot she’d grabbed.\n\n“Wonderful! Oh, and–this is kind of a long shot, but you presumably have dedicated pollinators, do you have honey here?”\n\nHer head tilted to the side and her brow scrunched up in confusion.\n\n“I’ll take that as a no. How much are they?”\n\n“You can just have these!” she said, laughing, “We normally throw these in the bio-recycler, they turn into horrible mush almost as soon as they fall off the tree.”\n\n“Oh, perfect! Hopefully I’ll help you out by taking them off your hands then.”\n\n“Okay!” she said. “Were you looking for anything else?”\n\n“Um… No, no that was, um, that was it, thank you.”\n\n“You’re welcome!” she said, lunging in and wrapping her arms around Lux. For their part, they yelped, and awkwardly slipped off her grasp. \n\nThe florist tilted her head. “I thought hugs were customary among humans.”\n\n“You what? I um. I mean. They’re okay, it’s–it’s usually after you get to know the person.”\n\nShe was crestfallen. “Oh. Sorry.”\n\n“No worries. Have a good rest of your day!”\n\nOnce that was done, it was time for the perfumist. This was probably the least useful thing on the list, but it *was* nearby… Just another short walk, still in the same hub. There were more and more stares and not-so-secretive glances, and Lux was getting more and more uncomfortable. The sooner these errands could be finished, the better.\n\nThey ducked into the shop. Unlike many human stores, it didn't immediately assault you with the smells. Arxur noses being more sensitive probably meant keeping perfumes better sealed. \n\nSomeone was making a purchase, so they waited for a moment, glancing around on occasion. Was that an arxur staring at them through the window? —No, probably just —oh, they walked off.\n\nThe customer ahead had finished. Lux stepped forward. “Um, hi, I was just wondering, do you use fruits in your scents?”\n\n“On occasion. Are you interested in trying any?”\n\nLux paused. “Um, maybe, but–I was more interested in the fruit. And where you got it. So I could eat it.”\n\nIt was the arxur's turn to pause. “Oh. We don’t... mix these ourselves. You would have to try an artisan place for that.”\n\n“Where is an artisan place?” they asked.\n\n“There is one in the Fine Sands hub... Would you like directions? It is very expensive.”\n\nLux winced at the prospect of going into a 'very expensive' store. “I… Would like directions, yes, but thank you for warning me. I don’t actually have a lot of funds.”\n\nThe perfumist pulled up their pad and tapped a few times, holding out a quick-scan code for Lux to copy. They did and nodded as the map came up. \n\n“I’ve got it.” \n\nThishal’s Scents and Scalecare. It even looked expensive in the pictures, with ornate stonework by the sign and—*wait*— Lux recognized that walkway! They’d passed by this shop before, back in Halthekar’s hub. *Well, that makes things easier*. \n\n“Do you know of anyone else who would have access to fruits and vegetables? I’m trying to figure out how to get all the nutrients I can’t get from meat.”\n\nThe perfumist hummed in thought for a moment, scratching dryly at their chin. “You could try a tea shop? They usually stock medicinal herbs, fortifiers, supplements… that sort of thing. Oh! Have you been to Lithvel’s feastery? They make designer meats, you might be able to order some with extra nutrients and vitamins, hrrr… built in.”\n\n“Perfect! Thank you *so much*. Have a good rest of your day!”\n\n“You are welcome. Are you sure you don’t want me to make you smell like a fruit?”\n\n“...I’m actually not, I really like some citrus scents–but not today. Another day, maybe, when I know I’m not going to die of scurvy.”\n\n“Of course. Then I look forward to your next visit.”\n\nLux gave a quick nod and turned to leave, distinctly hearing the perfumist ask their pad’s AI what scurvy was. Mail? Check. Florist? Check. Perfumist? Check. Sort of. \n\nThe slightly higher gravity meant they had to sit down to take a break. They tried to ignore the blatant stares and longer-than-usual glances from all the passers-by, but that was easier said than done. A few even took out their pads and snapped photos! Lux wondered how much of their errands were going to be documented and archived on various social media spaces.\n\nThere wasn’t that much time anyways. Lux tried to keep most excursions to the daytimes, but they were just so short! Two short ones, one sunrise and one sunset, for each of what they called a single “day.” This sun was already starting to run out, the brightness slowly faintly dimming. Lux grabbed their bag and stood back up, ready to start again.\n\nThe public shuttle system was crowded as usual, and also as usual, the arxur passengers were all taking great care to sit as far from each other as possible. They had a whole etiquette system for that, actually, though Lux hadn’t been here long enough to figure it all the way out. That was a tall order anyways, because of—\n\n“Do you know professor Kerik?” a passenger asked, scooting closer.\n\nBecause of *that*. “Uh, what? I–I do, I guess, in passing? Not closely, anyhow.” \n\n“He is my older brother. He told me about you. Has he asked you about Art History?” \n\n“Ah yes, the um, the Art History unit, he wanted to have a bit on human art. I’m not a historian but I–”\n\n“Why is your hair that color?” Another passenger interrupted.\n\n“What? Um. Genetics, I think? Brown is a very common hair colour for humans.”\n\n“Hmm,” the passenger said, as if she wasn’t sure that was quite true. “How long will it grow?”\n\n“Hopefully until I die, but it will get grey when I’m older. So if you're thinking of photos of Meier or Zhao, who had grey hair, that's why it's different.”\n\nShe nodded, hissing lightly and turning to some of the other passengers who were making similar noises of comprehension. *Hhhzzzhh-sh-sh-shhh*, they all went.\n\n“So um, art history is–”\n\n“Do you know Secretary General Zhao?” yet another passenger interrupted, likewise scooting into a closer seat.\n\n“Oh. No. Um, not at all. Also he’s not Secretary General anymore. I’m not even sure if he's still alive. He’s probably alive.”\n\nThey seemed disappointed.\n\n“Sorry, I–well, how many of you knew Chief Hunter Isif personally? It's like that. So about Art History–”\n\nAt that moment they realized the first person who had questioned them was no longer on the shuttle.\n\nOnce they got to Halthekar’s hub, their first stop was Leaves On The Wind tea shop. It had come highly recommended by Hal, who seemed to have tea in hand for at least 50% of all his waking moments. The shop wasn’t too busy, so they browsed a bit before talking to the shopkeeper.\n\n“Hi! I noticed some of your teas are based on fruiting plants. You wouldn’t by chance happen to have access to those fruits?”\n\n“Yeeesss? But why would you… Ah, I see. You want them to eat, yes?”\n\nThey nodded at that. “Got it in one, thank you.”\n\n“Which ones would you like?”\n\n“Which ones do you have? I need to run them through the university lab first to find out which ones are toxic to eat.”\n\nThe shopkeeper took Lux over to a section of fruit-based teas. There were packets, bricks, and droppers, all carefully sorted and organized. “I can sell you the fruit components of everything on this wall except for the bricks. And these ones, we don’t have these either,” he said, pointing to part of a shelf that had little symbols on the corners of the boxes. “Those are all imported.”\n\nThey gave a couple of experimental sniffs to the non-imported ones and their eyes grew huge. “This one smells *delicious.* Can I get one of this, and… this one and… oh wow, I didn't realize how much I missed this…”\n\nThe arxur let out a pleased rumble, looking proud. “I will get these ones then.”\n\n“Thank you so much!”\n\nAfter a moment, they had returned to the counter, A pile of various fruits and berries all tallied and purchased. Lux was rather disappointingly reminded that none of these fruits had been grown as *food.* They were missing all of the thousands of years of domestication and genetic modifying that made for the large, tasty, and aesthetically pleasing fruits they were used to. Most of the pile was tiny berries and hard-shelled seed-pods, a few were barely more than blossoms. They couldn’t fault the shopkeeper for that, though. *Maybe someone in genetics can speed up the clock on that?*\n\nBesides, he had added in an additional dropper bottle of tea extract “free of charge, since you seemed to enjoy it.” Lux had started to protest but he quickly assured them that it was fine since he had significantly upcharged them on the fruit already.\n\n“Really? I thought I had a monopsony here. Who else do you sell fruit to?”\n\n“Like this? No one. This was our personal supply, all the teas on that wall are prepared in-house,” he said, tilting his snout towards the wall he’d shown Lux to earlier. “I will need to resupply for our next batch and cram some work into fewer days because of it, so it seemed only fair.”\n\n“Fair indeed... Do you ever dry fruit? Berries, maybe? Not for teas, I mean.”\n\n“Like with meat?\"\n\n“Yeah. It makes them sweeter. Changes the flavour. Then again, you guys don't really taste sugar the same… Nevermind. Thank you again.” \n\nHe gave the arxur customary slow blink, and went back to whatever he was doing. Sorting bottles, it looked like. Lux left to move on to the next stop: the ‘feastery’.\n\nIt was much larger than they expected. A butcher’s place on steroids. They walked around in wonder for a while, poking through the endless displays of different meats in different cuts behind panes of glass before finding a small, almost laboratory-like section in the back.\n\nAn exceptionally tall arxur wearing what looked uncannily like a classic lab coat was dancing back and forth between the equipment, adjusting and muttering away to himself. He didn’t seem to notice Lux.\n\n“Um, excuse me? Hello?” they said, waving to see if they could catch his eye. \n\nHe didn't notice, he–was he wearing earbuds? Lux started staring until they spotted the recognizable little band. It was the same grey as his scales…\n\nThey looked around for someone else. The store was oddly empty. Was it supposed to be closed for the day? The door was open, but their understanding of Arxur signage was not exactly perfect…\n\n“Excuse me? Hello?” \n\nThe arxur glanced at them, continued to work, then reeled back, nearly knocking over some of his equipment when he saw Lux. A quick grin spread across his face. “Professor Lux-Swift!” \n\n“Yes! I–Hi, um. You make custom meats, right?”\n\nHe nodded, scrambling to put away his equipment and move over to the counter. He loomed high over Lux, tall and thin.\n\n“I was wondering if I could request some enriched meats, specifically with Vitamins C and D, I have their chemical makeup here…” they said, holding up a holopad with the chemical formulas and daily amounts. \n\nHe quickly scanned it, muttering “ascorbate, cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol…” for a moment, before nodding. “Yes. I should be able to do all of these.”\n\n“Fantastic, thank you. I, um, well, I can’t really synthesize all of these by myself—especially in the winter—and I’ve been wandering around asking people about fruits I could take to the biochemistry lab at the university, to see if they won’t kill me. Some of these are easy enough to get in synthetic organ meats at the store, but others…”\n\nThe arxur had been moving from station to station as he listened, inputting from the list Lux had given. “I see—you know, I have been trying to synthesize terran meats. If you could act as a tester for them, I would be happy to give you these on the house. Humans don’t eat that much, right?”\n\n“Not compared to an Arxur,” they said. “I think I eat around… Half as much as Halthekar?”\n\n“Then it shouldn’t be too great a cost, for *authentic terran meat testing.* In fact–would you happen to be hungry right now?” he asked, leaning in towards Lux, almost salivating at the prospect. \n\n“Um… I could eat..?”\n\n“I was *just* working on some synthetic terran fish. I think I have the texture correct, but… well, you’ll have to tell me.”\n\n“Oh, sure. I actually really like sushi, and everything you guys could make is like… Sushi-grade as far as I’m aware, so I’ll even be able to eat it raw.”\n\n“Sushi!” he cried, visibly getting more excited. “Yes! One moment.” He rushed off, and returned with testing plates. There were little bits of flesh on them, soft and vibrantly colored. “I have heard of this tradition! Humans eating raw flesh! Wonderful!”\n\n“Alright, um… You wouldn’t happen to have… Could I borrow a pair of those probes? Clean ones?”\n\nHe nodded and hurried over to get a pair of sterile dissection probes. “What are they for?”\n\n“...To eat,” Lux said. “Humans don’t, um, well sometimes but–usually humans from *my* sub-culture on Earth don’t handle raw food with their fingers.” \n\n“Ahhh, of course.”\n\nOnce they were armed with newly improvised chopsticks, it wasn’t too different from sashimi in the university cafeteria back home. Their deft fingers moved the sticks with the ease of someone who’d grown up eating sushi, quickly picking up a piece and placing it inside their mouth.  \n\nThey moaned, almost in surprise at how good it was. “Oh wow, I… Mmm! This is so good! Is this salmon? Maybe a little fattier might be good, but just a little bit, like, two percent more or something. Oh wow. This is incredible… Great job on the first one.”\n\nLux could hear the arxur’s tail quickly flicking into the chair behind him. He was nodding fervently and typing the results into a pad.\n\n“Okay, for sample two…” they dropped it on their tongue and their whole body tightened up. Their face scrunched towards the tip of their nose, like a string had been pulled on the cloth of their skin. Or like they’d sucked on a lemon. “Blegh. Egh. What–are these sardines?”\n\n“It’s, errr, tilapia.”\n\n“Oh wow. Um… Well, if you make this less acidic, you can make it pass for sardines.”\n\nHis eyes widened and he leaned in. “Perfect! This is… I am so glad you are here. I— I have been hoping to meet you!”\n\n“You have?”\n\nHe nodded. “I am fascinated with humans! I have been trying to replicate terran meats, terran culinary influences. But I have so few sources! And no one to test the results.” He deftly skewered one of the extra samples on a claw, and brought it up to eye level. His tone grew more contemplative. “This technology came from humans. It changed… everything. *Humans* changed everything. How could we not show interest in your culture?” He blinked, and moved his eyes back to Lux’s. “I insisted that my daughter take your class, you know.”\n\n“You did?” Lux asked, resisting the urge to ask which student it was.\n\nHe nodded. “She has been telling me many interesting things.”\n\n“I'm glad to hear it. Like what?”\n\n“Like your theories on skepticism and uncertainty. And, well… *any* details about humanity. From your art to your range of tolerable climates. We are starved for information here, you know.”\n\n“I do…” Lux said sadly. Even having access to pass-throughs, being inside the bubble came with a sense of separation from the SC at large that was hard to shake off. “Maybe I should start a blog.”\n\n“I am sure it would be popular. Oh! I must ask you to join us for a meal. My partner assures me this is a thing that humans do. She would insist that I ask!”\n\n“Oh. Um. Well, it is… I’d have to ask if you can cook things–or maybe if I can bring something to cook with and cook there, just because… Well, the human stomach does sometimes have a hard time with raw meat.”\n\nHe gasped. “You can cook for us! Like at The Piercing Claw! Yes! That would be wonderful, I would very much appreciate trying some of your scorched meats.”\n\nLux lit up with a smile. They hadn’t had an informal social outing with anyone other than Hal… since they got to Isifriss.“That sounds delightful. I have, um… Grarum... Grathriff? Grathriff off. The weekdays are still throwing me off, sorry. Four whole-days from now.”\n\n“Alright. We will coordinate— my partner is a very busy woman as well. I am very much looking forward to it!”\n\n“Fantastic, I–well, your daughter already has my contact information, it’s in the syllabus. Let me try this last sample…”\n\nThey picked it up with the sticks and dropped it in their mouth. Then they tilted their head and looked thoughtful for a moment. “This is… Interesting. But I have no idea what it’s supposed to be. It’s fish, by texture, but it tastes like prawns.”\n\n“Exactly!”\n\nThey pressed their lips together. “Oh. Is that on purpose? Well, then it’s working really well. I hope it takes off.”\n\n“Thank you!” He said, looking quite pleased. The chair behind him was rocking from repeated tail impacts again.\n\nA machine somewhere in the depths of the lab dinged, and the man went to go attend to it. He quickly returned and directed Lux to a pay-screen in the counter. Lux stared at the screen and paused. They had no idea what any of this meant. Types of meats, cuts, and preparations, all entirely foreign to them. “Uh,” they said, moving to pull up their pad’s visual translator in the faint hope that it might help.\n\nLithvel seemed to intuit the problem. “Shall I select a variety for you?”\n\n“That… that would be good. Thank you.”\n\nHe nodded, and reached over to deftly select options faster than Lux could read them. The price, though, they could tell stayed at zero. That was nice. He finished, and Lux tapped their own pad to the screen and a digital receipt showed. They still had no idea what most of it was. Maybe Hal could tell them when they got back.\n\n“The order should be ready by tomorrow. Pickup or delivery?”\n\n“Delivery, please,” Lux said, hefting their pack back to their shoulders. “Have a good rest of your day!”\n\nThe arxur gave a slow blink, and retreated back into their lab.\n\n*That was enough for today*, Lux figured. And the pack was beginning to feel much too heavy anyways. Another fifteen minutes of walking and they were in through Halthekar’s garage door. They hung the backpack on one of the hooks on the wall and sagged with relief once the weight was no longer there. \n\nThe garage was spacious and clean, and had been made as comfortable as Lux could manage. Shelves of physical books. Halthekar didn’t really have his own vehicle, so the garage had basically been his library before. There was a massive desk meant for arxur and a chair that had been clearly modified for human ergonomics.\n\nAnd, in the center of it all… A ship. A long-distance rally racer. Sleek, beautiful, and a little scuffed up from the journey to Isifriss. It had its own little kitchen, bathroom, and a foldable bed inside it. All within an eighteen-metre long spectacle of efficient modular design.\n\nLux’s work pad on the desk lit up automatically with their proximity. No doubt there were reading responses to grade and emails to catch up on. They took a deep breath, and finally sat down.\n\n=====\n\n[\\[Prev\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1iaz80c/intro_to_terran_philosophy_10/)[\\[First\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1gttikf/intro_to_terran_philosophy_1/)[\\[Next\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1ir594s/intro_to_terran_philosophy_12/)\n\nCowritten with u/uktabi \n\nThanks to u/Heroman3003 in the discord for coming up with “feastery”",

    "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI've been lurking on this sub for a while now, probably read upwards of thousands of posts, struggling to find an actual solution for my stubborn sebaceous filaments. When I mean stubborn, i really do mean STUBBORN! I should be studying for my exams right now and it is rare that I make a post, but i absolutely felt the need to share my results with you. Most people on this sub seem to have sebaceous filaments that are not really observable, small little black dots. However, for the few of us that have ridiculously oily skin, our filaments are more pronounced than others. When I mean pronounced, I really do mean that! You can see it from a meter away. I have struggled with acne and oily skin my entire life, and been researching the topic since I was 15, (22 now).\n\n**I believe that acne and textural irregularities (i.e pronounced filaments) have three different causes:**\n\n1. Hormones - not much you can do here other than to aggressively attack the acne if your a man or balance the hormones if ur a female. Accutane/Antibiotics/Birth Control if you are a female. I think there is other products out there for women if hormones are an issue but for men who struggle with hormonal acne, antibiotics > retinoid topicals > accutane is usually the recommended route by most dermatologists. I’ve never heard of any method that seems to adress the imbalance of hormones for men. Imbalanced hormones might definitely lead to overactive sebaceous glands. \n2. Sebaceous Glands that are naturally more active - high sebum production - not much you can do here, a lot of people have this belief that dehydrated skin may cause more oiliness, but this is not true for some of us and no matter how much moisturizer we slather on, it only makes it look more oily! I'm currently trying to incorporate a high linoleic acid oil (i.e: Hemp) into my routine to see if I can get my oil production under control but this is another matter. There are some studies that Niacinimide/Zinc/L-Carnitine helping to address overactive sebaceous glands but its minimal. I don't think topicals have the power to slow down the activity of sebaceous glands, unless you have super dehydrated skin that is prone to oiliness. For the rest of us, the only other solution is low dow accutane 10 mg/week over an indefinite period of time. This is the dosage recommended by many dermatologists if u simply want to adress the oily skin. For reference: on my last accutane round, i was at 80mg/day for 4 months, that is the equivalent of 18 years of 10mg/week and its deemed safe for long term usage at such low doses but you should ask your dermatologist. You want to stay away from high vitamin b5 doses which can help oily skin but may cause hair loss. There are some anecdotal evidences of a Vitamin D deficiency also causing oily skin. If you rarely get any sun exposure and have super oily skin, you might want to get your levels tested and experiment with D3 pills in Cholecalciferol form.\n3. Skin that doesn't shed properly - This is so HUGE!!! . Have you ever seen some people with super oily skin but skin that is flawless? With this group of people, their sebum flows freely between their pores and from my understanding, doesn't lead to the accumulation/oxidization of oil, that eventually leads to acne. AHAs/BHAS/Retinoids help address this issue of improper shedding.\n\n**Cause of my rough nose and sebaceous filaments: 2 & 3.**\n\nThe issue that I had was my skin would get so oily, and then it would lead to gunky pores, very rough to the touch, especially my nose! as the sebaceous glands here are the largest and most active.  It became so bad that my filaments became these white strands (1/4 inch), and i literally had hundreds on my nose, especially in the crease area. I resorted to charcoal peel off masks to keep it under control but they would just fill up the next day and I don't think peel off masks are good for your skin. Here is a good picture I found on Google that slightly resembles what I had: [https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QwUsYY6Wgt4/maxresdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QwUsYY6Wgt4/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\n**So here is what worked for me!**\n\n**REMOVAL**\n\n[https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2015/03/28/how-to-shrink-pores-temporarily-plus-3-pore-myths/](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2015/03/28/how-to-shrink-pores-temporarily-plus-3-pore-myths/)  This guide really helped me to remove my sebaceous filaments in a manner that was not damaging my pores (i.e: pore strips) and really sort of reset my skin. The products that I used were: Paula's Choice 2% BHA, Aztec Clay Mask (With ACV, don't bother doing it with water only as calcium bentonite clay has a high pH and ACV will help to to neutralize it), and Simple Grapeseed Cleansing Oil. **NOTE:** Aztec Clay Mask is SOOOO GOOOOOD at drawing out your sebaceous filaments and textural irregularities to the surface, but in itself it is not enough and temporarily it will make your filaments look worse. But you absolutely must follow it with a cleansing oil, it will help to get rid of all those grits that's been making your oily areas rough and to sort of reset them.\n\n**PREVENTION**\n\nSo after your skin has been sort of reset, now comes the prevention part. And it is absolutely necessary for you to do the removal part or your filaments won't get better. For me, my sebaceous filaments on my nose were my main concern so here is what I did:\n\n1. Regular nightly cleansing with an oil-based cleanser (You really wanna massage for 1-2 to minutes and get any grits. Grits basically refers to hardened sebum.\n2. Followed by a foaming cleanser. Really massage it in and let it stay on your skin for 1-2 minutes for the surfactants to dissolve all of the oil that has been accumulated throughout the day. I would only recommend you doing this on areas where your skin is really oily and doesn't get dry. I use cetaphil oily skin cleanser.\n3. Apply your choice of BHA. I use 2% Paula's Choice BHA Liquid. I'm going to try the AHA soon as well to see if it makes a difference.\n4. Apply **VERY MINIMAL** moisturizer. Ideally one that doesn't have that many ingredients and is simple. More ingredients means the greater the possibility for your large pores to lead to the accumulation of cosmetic ingredients/ hardened sebum/dead skin etc. I use the LRP Toleraine Sensitive Skin one. It has like 7-8 ingredients and is very minimalistic.\n\nRepeat these steps 2-4 both morning and night, and steps 1 at night only.\n\nNote: My sebaceous filaments still fill up, but after 2 weeks now as opposed to 1-2 days so this routine has been a saviour. I'm going to start experimenting with an AHA/High Linoleic Acid oil to see if it makes a difference and maybe a form of retinoid cream down the road. AHAs/BHAs really help to address issue 3) skin that doesn't shed properly, hence the large sebaceous filaments. If skin doesn't shed properly, you want to avoid putting on moisturizers and a lot of products that have hundreds of ingredients and rather stick with something simple. And hopefully, the linoleic acid oil will help to balance my oil productions. After two rounds of accutane, I get a lot less acne now but sebaceous filaments and super oily skin has always been a huge concern for me. 1 year after my second round, the oil returned and really caused me a lot of textural irregularities, not only on my nose but all across my face. Here is my current routine and what has really helped me so far:\n\n**AM**\n\nLRP Toleriane Sensitive Cleanser (All areas except my nose). All of my face is oily but only get sebaceous filaments on my nose.\n\nCetaphil Oily Skin Cleanser (Only on my nose).\n\nPaula's Choice 2% BHA (Helps keep acne and textural irregularities under control)\n\nLRP Toleriane Sensitive Fluide (Minimalistic moisturizer)\n\nTO NMF + HA (Apply everywhere except my nose)\n\n**PM**\n\nSimple Hydrating Cleansing Oil (Only on nose to get rid of any hardened sebum build up). Will be very few grits but you want to do it every night to prevent large accumulation over time.\n\nRest of routine is same as AM, but I also apply Vaseline all across my face. I know what you are thinking, Vaseline on oily skin??? But using BHA 2x a day for those stubborn filaments leads to some dryness, and Vaseline really normalizes skin. I'm kind of addicted to it now lol, it feels so nice putting it on my skin as it doesn't clog my skin and can also help prevent TEWL - Transepidermal Water Loss which is another huge issue in skin care and can lead to a compromised moisture barrier and therefore acne etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading my long post. Hope you got something out of it. I should get back to studying now, good luck!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

The pore strips are so bad though; they open up your pores and they will never shrink back afterwards. I think most people use them for a pleasure thing to see everything that comes out. I'd rather feel the grits lol",

It was very interesting to read your journey in reducing sebaceous filament production on your skin, in particular your nose and/or (T-zone area) - and finding routines on minimizing further production. That being said, one important point that was left out in your analyze is genetics. Everyone has their own genetic skin-print, which result in giving you your skin type. So the most you can do is understand your skin type which will in turn empower you to make wise decisions. \n\nIn addition, I think it would be also excellent to add skin treatment that will help to reduce the uneven texture, and it will aid in helping your skin better absorb ingredients.  This will help in reducing the production of your over-active sebaceous gland. In my experience, microdermabrasion and chemical peels have help immensely. Especially micro which is safe to use of open and closed comedomes, and even texture on the skin. And it if you have fitzpatrick 123 and maybe 4, there are great laser modalities that you can use as well to help remove and/or reduce the appearance of comedomes. \n\nOverall, everything that you mentioned was great, and I like that you provide several options for people.

If you applied one clogging ingredient on its own that could cause problems. Likewise a long list of ingredients might be tolerated just fine if they're pretty safe. Foaming cleansers are fine for some, but I wouldn't advise them as a rule, especially alongside a lot of drying/dehydrating actives without a strong hydrating routine. Sebacious filaments and clogging can more visible as a result of dehydrated skin and in that case that could make it worse. Likewise if you have them with dry skin they can cause issues.",

In this context, the latest research has revealed clinical benefits of high dose vitamin D3 therapy in autoimmune diseases. The necessity of high doses of vitamin D3 for treatment success can be explained by the concept of an acquired form of vitamin D resistance. Its etiology is based on the one hand on polymorphisms within genes affecting the vitamin D system, causing susceptibility towards developing low vitamin D responsiveness and autoimmune diseases; on the other hand it is based on a blockade of vitamin D receptor signaling, e.g. through pathogen infections. In this paper, we review observational and mechanistic evidence for the acquired vitamin D resistance hypothesis. We particularly focus on its clinical confirmation from our experience of treating multiple sclerosis patients with the so-called Coimbra protocol, in which daily doses up to 1000 I.U. vitamin D3 per kg body weight can be administered safely. Parathyroid hormone levels in serum thereby provide the key information for finding the right dose. We argue that acquired vitamin D resistance provides a plausible pathomechanism for the development of autoimmune diseases, which could be treated using high-dose vitamin D3 therapy.\n>",

The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. **A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L.** The largest meta-analysis ever conducted of studies published between 1966 and 2013 showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <75 nmol/L may be too low for safety and associated with higher all-cause mortality, demolishing the previously presumed U-shape curve of mortality associated with vitamin D levels. Since all-disease mortality is reduced to 1.0 with serum vitamin D levels ≥100 nmol/L, we call public health authorities to consider designating as the RDA at least three-fourths of the levels proposed by the Endocrine Society Expert Committee as safe upper tolerable daily intake doses. This could lead to a recommendation of 1000 IU for children <1 year on enriched formula and 1500 IU for breastfed children older than 6 months, 3000 IU for children >1 year of age, and around 8000 IU for young adults and thereafter. Actions are urgently needed to protect the global population from vitamin D deficiency.\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(15)00244-X/pdf\n\n>**Vitamin D Is Not as Toxic as Was Once Thought:A Historical and an Up-to-Date Perspective**\n>\n> ...\n> \n> Vitamin  D  intoxication  associated  withhypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and sup-pressed parathyroid hormone level is typicallyseen in patients who are receiving massive dosesof vitamin D in the range of 50,000 to 1 millionIU/d for several months to years. Ekwaru et al16recently reported on more than 17,000 healthyadult volunteers participating in a preventativehealth program and taking varying doses ofvitamin D up to 20,000 IU/d. These patients didnot demonstrate any toxicity, and the blood levelof 25(OH)D in those taking even 20,000IU/d was less than 100 ng/mL. For point ofreference, a 25(OH)D level of 100 ng/mL isconsidered by the Institute of Medicine, theEndocrine Society, and many reference labora-tories to be the upper limit of normal.\n> \n> ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33030138/\n\n> # How Much Vitamin D is Too Much? A Case Report and Review of the Literature\n> \n> \n> ## Abstract\n> \n> **Background:** The beneficial effects of vitamin D, together with the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, have led to an expanding use of vitamin D analogues. While inappropriate consumption is a recognized cause of harm, definition of doses at which vitamin D becomes toxic remain elusive.\n> \n> **Case presentation:** A 56-year woman was admitted to our Hospital following a 3-week history of nausea, vomiting and muscle weakness. **The patient had been assuming very high dose of cholecalciferol since 20 months (cumulative 78,000,000UI, mean daily 130,000UI)**, as indicated by a non-conventional protocol for multiple sclerosis. Before starting vitamin D integration, serum calcium and phosphorus levels were normal, while 25OH-vitamin D levels were very low (12.25 nmol/L). On admission, hypercalcemia (3.23 mmol/L) and acute kidney injury (eGFR 20 mL/min) were detected, associated with high concentrations of 25OH-vitamin D (920 nmol/L), confirming the suspicion of vitamin D intoxication. Vitamin D integration was stopped and, in a week, hypercalcemia normalized. It took about 6 months for renal function and 18 months for vitamin D values to go back to normal.\n> \n> **Conclusions:** This case confirms that vitamin D intoxication is possible albeit with a really high dose. The doses used in clinical practice are far lower than these and, therefore, intoxication rarely occurs even in those individuals whose baseline vitamin D serum levels have never been assessed. Repeated measurements of vitamin D are not necessary in patients under standard integrative therapy. However, patients and clinicians should be aware of the potential dangers of vitamin D overdose.\n> \n\n>\n\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/derm.24808\n\n> # A pilot study assessing the effect of prolonged administration of high daily doses of vitamin D on the clinical course of vitiligo and psoriasis\n> \n> ## Abstract\n> \n> Autoimmunity has been associated with vitamin D deficiency and\n> resistance, with gene polymorphisms related to vitamin D metabolism\n> frequently described in affected patients.

The primary outcome was improvement of the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score at 3 and 6 months after treatment. Serum levels of 25(OH)D, calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, and C-reactive protein and adverse events were monitored. The chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test, Student’s t-test, and Spearman’s correlation analysis were used in statistical analysis. _Results._ Of 50 subjects screened, 45 were eligible and randomized to the oral vitamin D2 group (n=23) or placebo group (n=22). At enrollment, the mean PASI score was 4.45, and 26.7% of patients had vitamin D deficiency. At 3 months, the oral vitamin D2 group had significantly higher PASI improvement than the placebo group (mean PASI improvement: 1.43 versus [vs.] -0.33, p-value=0.034; mean %PASI improvement: 34.21% vs. -1.85%, p-value=0.039). The mean serum 25(OH)D level was significantly higher in the oral vitamin D group than in the placebo group (27.4 vs. 22.4 ng/mL, p-value=0.029). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly inversely correlated with PASI scores at the 6-month follow-up. No major adverse event was observed overall. _Conclusion._ Oral vitamin D2 supplementation in patients with psoriasis increased the serum vitamin D level and significantly improved the treatment outcome without increasing adverse events. _Trial Registration._ This trial is registered with Thai Clinical Trials Registry [TCTR20180613001](http://www.clinicaltrials.in.th/index.php?tp=regtrials&menu=trialsearch&smenu=lsresult&task=search&task2=ls).",

I've been slathering sunscreen on since then, even during the winter up here in Canada (you can get a lot of exposure when bright sunshine reflects off snow!)\n\n\nAnyway, I also take 1000 IU of vitamin D (more specifically, D3 a.k.a cholecalciferol) daily. My pharmacist cousin told me that *all* Canadians should be taking a daily vitamin D supplement. She said it's really the only vitamin that we all need to take, since it is hard to get exclusively through diet.\n\n\nGiven that we all are so good about putting on our sunscreen, I just thought that I would post a PSA about vitamin D. Especially for those of us in very northern or very southern locations, getting enough D3 in the winter is critical, doubly so for women already at risk of osteoporosis. \n\n\nAlso, too little D3 seems to increase the risk of [depression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526952308001396?via%3Dihub), which is already too easy to fall prey to when the days get short in the winter. In fact, I've been dealing with serious depression for the first time this winter, and it is the first year that I was really good about applying sunscreen. For me, this could definitely just be a correlation. But - it doesn't seem that there are downsides to taking a vitamin D supplement, so if it can keep depression and osteoporosis at bay, it seems worthwhile.\n\n\nIf anyone has a good strategy for getting enough D3, please share!

Only steroids helped, and it was miserable. It wasn't until I went to a really great allergist who was a fantastic and methodical diagnostician that I discovered I was terribly vitamin D deficient. (If you've had bad luck with dermatologists, try an allergist. My allergist experience is what I was hoping to get from a derm.) \n\nMy level was 17...in the middle of summer...while I had the worst sunburn of my life. I now take 5000 IU per day per doctor recommendation and am up to 45. My eczema rarely troubles me now.\n\nGreat PSA. I would add:\n\nGet your D level checked and consult your doctor before adding a supplement. It's possible to take too much. I have to be tested every 2 years.\n\nIt is especially important to get your level checked if you have a family history of cancer. My allergist said 20-30 is usually normal, but 52 is ideal if you have cancer in your family.\n\nVitamin D levels may not be included in general metabolic or other comprehensive bloodwork. I had a bunch of bloodwork done that came back normal, so I was really surprised to find Vit D wasn't included. There is a specific test for Vitamin D. Thyroid is another test you may want to get if you have hormonal/energy issues.\n\nEdit: Paragraphs are cool.",

Being outside when it is sunny is not enough. You can google vitamin D latitude calculator for more info.\n* Darker skin tones take longer to synthesize\n* Vitamin D is fat soluble, meaning that it can be stored in the body when made in excess (yay!)",

Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

    "body": "Part I - **Introduction**\n--------------------------------------\n\nWelcome back to the second instalment of Research Review. In this series I do a review of several studies to figure out if there is academic consensus on a given topic. The goal of this is to make sidebar content for AdvancedFitness, since this has been requested previously. [Here is the previous RR I posted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/3ltpn0/research_review_the_positive_effects_of_the/). \n\nToday we're going to look at multivitamins and their purpose. I'm sure many of you take multivitamins, and you probably do it to avoid deficiencies and to fill the gaps in your diet. Before I begin, **I want to stress that this review deals specifically with multivitamins, not supplements in general. Please scroll down for a summary of the findings.**\n\n-----------------------\n\nSo what are **typical deficiencies** in the American population? Women are at greater risk for [iron and vitamin A deficiency](https://labdoor.com/article/nutritional-deficiencies-women-are-at-risk-for), especially if they are [pregnant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7283965). Vegans & vegetarians [may become b12 deficient](http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/20030618/vegetarian-diet-b12-deficiency). Black skinned people are at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency because the [\"melanin in the skin diminishes the ability to synthesize Vitamin D from the sun\"](https://labdoor.com/article/nutritional-deficiencies-women-are-at-risk-for). The elderly usually experience a decline in the gut absorption of micronutrients: [\"The age-related decline in the capacity to absorb calcium [56] appears due to a gut-resistance to the action of 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3 resulting from a loss of vitamin D receptors in the duodenal mucosa [57]\"](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/13800505_Nutritional_needs_of_seniors). The elderly may be at risk for vitamin b6, b12, d and calcium deficiency. \n\nThe American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's nutrition reports (CDC.gov) is [\"a series of publications that provide ongoing assessment of the U.S. population's nutrition status by measuring blood and urine concentrations of biochemical indicators\"](http://www.cdc.gov/nutritionreport/). \n\nThey found that between 2003 and 2006:\n\n> [\"Of all the nutrients listed, **the most people had vitamin B6, iron, and vitamin D deficiencies**, and the fewest people had  vitamin A, vitamin E, and  folate deficiencies.\" [...] \"However, for most nutrition indicators, deficiencies varied by age, gender, or race/ethnicity and could be as high as nearly one third of certain population groups.\"](http://www.cdc.gov/nutritionreport/pdf/4Page_%202nd%20Nutrition%20Report_508_032912.pdf). \n\nThis should give you a general idea of what you might be deficient in. The best way to be 100% sure of your micronutrient levels, is getting a blood test.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis brings us to **RDA**. Every country gives recommendations for micronutrient intakes. These RDAs are divided into age groups, and are designed for the general population. The problem here is that athletes usually have higher requirements for minerals (as well as fluids and macronutrients - but that is beyond the scope of this RR). Furthermore, the RDAs are usually enough to avoid deficiency, but being non-deficient is not the same as having optimal micronutrient levels, and this is especially true for athletes.\n\n> [\"For active individuals **a marginal deficiency in the nutrients may impact the body's ability to repair itself, operate efficiently and fight disease**, said Melinda Manore, researcher in the Colleges of Agricultural and Health and Human Sciences.\" [...] \"The stress on the body's energy producing pathways during exercise, the changes in the body's tissues resulting from training, an increase in the loss of nutrients in sweat, urine and feces during and after strenuous activity and the additional nutrients needed to repair and maintain higher levels of lean tissue mass present in some athletes and individuals may all affect an individual’s B-vitamin requirements, said Manore\"](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/56869.php)\n\nLarry Kenney from Pennsylvania State University states: \n\n> [\"The 2004 recommendations on water and sodium intake from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences are targeted primarily at sedentary Americans. **These guidelines for water and salt intake should not be applied to athletes**. Athletes who follow the IOM recommendations to the letter may actually put themselves at risk for unintended decreases in performance or even untoward health consequences.\"](http://www.gssiweb.org/Article/sse-92-dietary-water-and-sodium-requirements-for-active-adults)\n\nWeightlifting athletes may be particularly prone to the negative effects of vitamin D deficiency, because calcium requires vitamin D for optimal absorption. If absorption of calcium is hindered: \n\n> [\"Low vitamin D increases bone turnover, which increases the risk for a bone injury, like a stress fracture.\" [...] \"vitamin D [...] also aids in regulation of electrolyte metabolism, protein synthesis, gene expression, and immune function [10,28]. These vital functions are essential for all individuals, especially the elite and recreational athlete.\"] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3725481/)\n\nAn athlete may decide to supplement vitamin D. Unknowingly, he purchases D2: [\"Vitamin D3 increases the total 25(OH)D concentration [...] Vitamin D2 supplementation was associated with a decrease in 25(OH)D3,\"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256423512_Bioavailability_of_Vitamin_D-2_and_D-3_in_Healthy_Volunteers_a_Randomized_Placebo-Controlled_Trial)\n\nThis goes to show that there are **different forms of micronutrients**. These forms have different bioavailabilities and effects on the body. For example, magnesium oxide is maybe the most commonly supplemented form of magnesium. The problem is that [\"magnesium oxide may have an absorbable magnesium potency as low as 4%. 7 8\"](http://www.ancient-minerals.com/magnesium-sources/absorption/). I could write for days about micronutrient forms and bioavailability, but to keep it succinct: [multivitamins are usually filled with the cheapest and worst forms of vitamins and minerals](http://examine.com/insiders/multivitamins). If you want to learn more about magnesium check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3ixxkw/dietary_magnesium_is_positively_associated_with/cukru3k). To get more information about bioavailability check [this out] (http://nutrition.ansci.illinois.edu/sites/default/files/Chiba_ch15.pdf)\n\n--------------------------\n\nThis brings us to the concept of **antinutrients**: \n\n> [\"Antinutrients in foods are responsible for deleterious effects related to the absorption of nutrients and micronutrients. However, some antinutrients may exert beneficial health effects at low concentrations.\"](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/bk-1997-0662.ch001). \n\nA very potent antinutrient is **phytic acid**. It is usually found in large concentrations in seeds, nuts, grains, legumes. [\"phytic acid [has the] ability to bind to essential minerals such as iron, zinc, calcium, and magnesium in the digestive tract and inhibit their absorption by the body.1,2\"](http://breakingmuscle.com/nutrition/dissecting-anti-nutrients-the-good-and-bad-of-phytic-acid). A consequence of this is that if a person is consuming a meal rich in phytic acid along with his daily multi, the minerals in the multi may be rendered less useful. The good news is that [vitamin C partly counteracts the negative effects of phytic acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/3ov6ai/if_phytic_acid_is_an_antinutrient_should_we_be/cw1ojey)\n\n[More info on phytic acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/3ov6ai/if_phytic_acid_is_an_antinutrient_should_we_be/cw1r059)\n\n---------------------------------\n\nThere are other factors that limit micronutrient absorption. These factors are the interactions between the nutrients, called **vitamin and mineral antagonism and synergy** [1] (http://www.traceelements.com/Docs/Nutrient%20Interrelationships-Minerals-Vitamins-Endocrines.pdf) [2](http://www.return2health.net/articles/vitamin-mineral-antagonists/). Micros that have synergy, enhance each other’s uptake (i.e. Vit D enhances calcium uptake, Vitamin C enhances iron uptake). There is also antagonism, [whereby micros inhibit absorption of other micros](https://labdoor.com/article/nutrient-nutrient-interaction-in-multivitamin-supplements). For example [calcium interferes with iron absorption, zinc uptake is hindered by minerals such as cal, mag, iron, because they share a transporter](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/3hssrs/calciums_effect_on_ironzinc_absorption_and_what/cuafwt6). \n\n**The takeaway here is that if you fill a multivitamin with micro antagonists, they will compete for absorption and hinder uptake levels.**\n\n---------------------------------\n\nThe last part of the introduction deals with what I call the size paradox of multivitamins. Simply put, [it is impossible to squeeze (common values) 400mg of magnesium, 600mg of calcium, 14mg iron, 10mg zinc, 500iu vitamin d, 500mg vitamin c, all the b vitamins, trace minerals, etc. into a small tablet](http://examine.com/insiders/multivitamins)). I have a bottle of Magnesium citrate 100mg tablets, and each tablet is twice the size of my multi. \n\n> [\"**12 multivitamins provided less vitamin A, vitamin C, or folate, or than claimed, some with less than 30% of the listed amounts**. These include a prenatal vitamin and products for men, adults (general), seniors, and even pets.\"](https://www.consumerlab.com/reviews/multivitamin_review_comparisons/multivitamins/)\n\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**Summary of introduction**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n- Common micronutrient deficiencies are: Vitamin D, iron, B6. Deficiency prevalence is population based (age, sex, skin color, lifestyle)\n- Multivitamins are usually filled with the cheapest and worst forms of vitamins and minerals\n- Reaching RDAs may prevent deficiency, but may not necessarily give you optimal levels\n- Athletes need more micros than sedentary individuals\n- Antinutrients and micronutrient antagonism severely hinder the absorption rates and bioavailability of MVs\n- The minerals and vitamins found in MVs won't physically fit into a neat little pill\n- Companies may lie on the contents label (goes for all supplements)\n\n**Summary of the meta-analysis** (scroll down to see the studies)\n-----------------------------------------\n\n- Antioxidants such as vitamin C and E may help fight cancer (but they could also hinder athletic performance improvements)\n- Most research is done on the elderly\n- There is no clear consensus because of contradictory evidence. However, **the majority of the evidence points towards no effect**\n- Multivitamins have not been show to decrease risk of cancer or CV disease\n- Smokers may want to avoid MVs (especially ß-carotene)\n- High doses of fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A can be dangerous. Always check the bottle contents!\n\n**Final thoughts**\n-----------------------------------------\n**Research does not support the hypothesis that MVs give health benefits. This does not mean that targeted or isolated supplementation is useless!** For example, vitamin D3 supplementation has been shown to increase hormonal levels of vitamin D. You should probably figure out what you're deficient in and do targeted supplementation instead of buying a MV that probably won't do much for your health.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nPart II - **Studies**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nBefore looking at the studies, we must identify the possible sampling biases of multivitamin research. It is possible that people who take multivitamins do so as a way to self-medicate, because they feel unhealthy or know they have unhealthy lifestyles. It could also be the effect of marketing. In most of the studies I reviewed, the participants were aged 50+. This is an issue because they do not represent the entire population. Lastly, studies usually rely on self-reported questionnaires. The risk here is that people lie or modify the truth.\n\nI've tried to represent both sides of the debate as fairly as possible. I excluded studies with few participants, unclear methods, obvious spelling errors in the abstract (...), paid research (supplement marketing), very short trials, or generally poor design.\n\n[Example of excluded study with spelling errors, short trial, and likely paid]\n(http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/823/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00213-011-2481-3.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00213-011-2481-3&token2=exp=1447593072~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F823%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs00213-011-2481-3.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs00213-011-2481-3*~hmac=8196190f7a982c858dd95c955172ac80d284ff19ceb335859c4f9516a9be5104)\n\n[Example of excluded study because of purely self-reported statistics]\n(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16081445)\n\n\n[Example of excluded study because low N and (relatively) short trial]\n (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743504005778)\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Studies with evidence supporting multivitamin health benefits**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n**[Multivitamin Use and Risk of Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease in the Women's Health Initiative Cohorts](https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=414784)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2009\n-\tTime period: 1993-2005\n-\tParticipants: 161 808\n-\tAge: 50 to 79\n-\tInclusion criteria: postmenopausal women\n-\tExclusion criteria: alcoholism, drug dependency, dementia.\n\n> A total of 41.5% of the participants used multivitamins.\n\n**How they documented:**\n\n> Dietary supplement data were collected during in-person clinic visits.

We included fair- and good-quality randomized, controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness or safety of supplements in the primary prevention of CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality in the general adult population without a history of CVD or cancer. We included fair- and good-quality secondary prevention trials if they hypothesized effects on outcomes included in this review and not present at baseline in the study (for example, a trial of secondary skin cancer prevention that also reported on other cancers). We included only studies that were conducted among community-dwelling, nutrient-sufficient adults who had no chronic disease and were performed in countries with a Human Development Index of “very high” (11). We also required supplement doses to be lower than the upper tolerable limit set by the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board (12)\n\n**What they documented:**\n\n> We specifically sought studies of the following vitamins and minerals: vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C, D, and E; calcium; iron; zinc; magnesium; niacin; folic acid; ß-carotene; and selenium. We included studies that evaluated single, paired, and combinations of 3 or more vitamins and minerals; we use the term “multivitamin” to refer to those combinations.\n\n> We screened 12 766 abstracts, reviewed 277 full-text articles, and included 103 articles (26 studies) (Appendix Figure 2 of the Supplement). Four trials (19–22) and 1 cohort study (23) examined the benefits and harms of multivitamin supplementation (Supplement). Twenty-two trials and 2 cohort studies examined the benefits and harms of individual or paired supplements (Supplement): 6 studies of ß-carotene (24–29), 6 studies of vitamin E (22, 24, 30–33), 3 studies of selenium (33–35), 5 studies of vitamin A (23, 29, 36–38), 2 studies of vitamin C (30–31), 1 study of folic acid (39), 3 studies of vitamin D (40–42), 2 studies of vitamin D in combination with calcium (43–44), and 4 studies of calcium (40, 43, 45–46). The study sizes ranged from 128 to 72 337 individuals with average ages ranging from 22 to 77 years, although in most studies the mean age was older than 50 years (Supplement). Six studies were conducted among women only, 5 were conducted among men only, and the remaining studies were in mixed populations (24.2% to 84.7% women). The effects of the supplements were examined between 6 months and 16 years; most studies provided less than a decade of follow-up. \n\n\n**What they found:** \n> This review included 26 studies (24 randomized, controlled trials and 2 cohort studies) that examined the benefits and harms of using vitamin and mineral supplements for primary prevention of CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality in healthy individuals without known nutritional deficiencies. **We found no consistent evidence that the included supplements affected CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality in healthy individuals without known nutritional deficiencies.** Other systematic reviews have arrived at this same conclusion (56–66). The certainty of this result is tempered, however, because few fair- or good-quality studies are available for all supplements except vitamin E and ß-carotene. For vitamin E, we identified 6 fair- to good-quality trials that produced clearly null effects on these end points. This result is consistent with the conclusions of other systematic reviews and meta-analyses of vitamin E (67–71). **Our review also confirmed the established harm of ß-carotene supplementation on lung cancer incidence and death for individuals at high risk for lung cancer (24, 29, 72)**. Further, we identified 6 trials that failed to detect any benefit from ß-carotene supplementation for any individuals.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n**[Dietary Supplements and Mortality Rate in Older Women](https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1105975)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2011\n-\tTime period: 1986-2008\n-\tParticipants: 38 772 \n-\tAge: Mean age: 61,6\n-\tInclusion criteria: Female\n-\tExclusion criteria: \"[...] excluding from all analyses those who did not adequately complete a questionnaire including food frequency and supplement use at baseline in 1986\"\n\n> Of these women, 99.2% were white and 98.6% were postmenopausal\n\n**How they documented:**\n\n> Food intake was assessed at baseline and in the 2004 follow-up, using 2 nearly identical versions of the validated 127-food item Harvard Service Food Frequency Questionnaire.\n\n> Supplement use was queried in 1986, 1997, and 2004 and included the 15 supplements assessed at all 3 surveys: multivitamins; vitamins A, beta-carotene, B6, folic acid, B complex, C, D, and E; and minerals iron, calcium, copper, magnesium, selenium, and zinc. Different forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol (D3) or ergocalciferol (D2), were not distinguished. At the baseline and 2004 follow-up surveys, the supplement-related questions were part of the Food Frequency Questionnaire. \n\n**What they documented:**\n\nMortality rates.\n\nThey excluded deaths that were \"related to injury, accident, and suicide, because it is unlikely that supplement use would be causally related to these outcomes.\"\n\n**What they found:** \n\n> [...] most of the supplements studied were not associated with a reduced total mortality rate in older women. In contrast, we found that several commonly used dietary vitamin and mineral supplements, including multivitamins, vitamins B6, and folic acid, as well as minerals iron, magnesium, zinc, and copper, were associated with a higher risk of total mortality. Of particular concern, supplemental iron was strongly and dose dependently associated with increased total mortality risk. Also, the association was consistent across shorter intervals, strengthened with multiple use reports and with increasing age at reported use. Supplemental calcium was consistently inversely related to total mortality rate; however, no clear dose-response relationship was observed.\n\n> Also, supplement users were more likely to have lower intake of energy, total fat, and monounsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids and to have higher intake of protein, carbohydrates, polyunsaturated fatty acids, alcohol, whole grain products, fruits, and vegetables.\n\n**Limitations:**\n**Does not strictly deal with multivitamins**, but still interesting\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**[Enough Is Enough: Stop Wasting Money on Vitamin and Mineral Supplements](http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1789253)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2013 (META-ANALYSIS)\n\n**How they documented:**\nThe authors did a meta-analysis of other studies\n\n**What they found:** \n\n> The large body of accumulated evidence has important public health and clinical implications. **Evidence is sufficient to advise against routine supplementation**, and we should translate null and negative findings into action. The message is simple: **Most supplements do not prevent chronic disease or death, their use is not justified, and they should be avoided**. This message is especially true for the general population with no clear evidence of micronutrient deficiencies, who represent most supplement users in the United States and in other countries (9).\n\n> **In conclusion, ß-carotene, vitamin E, and possibly high doses of vitamin A supplements are harmful.** Other antioxidants, folic acid and B vitamins, and multivitamin and mineral supplements are ineffective for preventing mortality or morbidity due to major chronic diseases. Although available evidence does not rule out small benefits or harms or large benefits or harms in a small subgroup of the population, we believe that the case is closed— supplementing the diet of well-nourished adults with (most) mineral or vitamin supplements has no clear benefit and might even be harmful. These vitamins should not be used for chronic disease prevention. Enough is enough.\n\n**Limitations:**\nAuthors seem emotionally invested in the outcome of the debate.

A sample of multivitamins was evaluated for their beta-carotene content and the suggested daily dosage.\n\n**What they documented:**\nBeta-carotene's possible interaction with lung cancer in smokers\n\n**What they found:**\n\n> Four studies contributing 109,394 subjects were available for analysis. The average daily beta-carotene dosage in these trials ranged from 20 to 30 mg daily. Among current smokers, beta-carotene supplementation was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.10–1.39). Among former smokers, there was no significant increase noted (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.84–1.45). In a sample of 47 common multivitamins, beta-carotene was present in 70% of the identified formulas. The median dosage of beta-carotene was 0.3 mg (range, 0–17.2 mg) daily. The beta-carotene content was found to be significantly higher among multivitamins sold to improve visual health than among other multivitamins, with a median daily dosage of 3 mg (range, 0–24 mg).\n\n-------------------------\n\n\n\n\n**Studies with mixed findings or no effect**\n-------------------------\n\n**[Vitamin/mineral supplementation and cancer, cardiovascular, and all-cause mortality in a German prospective cohort](http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/717/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00394-011-0224-1.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00394-011-0224-1&token2=exp=1447594502~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F717%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs00394-011-0224-1.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs00394-011-0224-1*~hmac=8d15d3c2ee1a9bb806f4f0cdf9ae79b9ba0ece8d1e7532a7285550dcd69f796c)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2012\n-\tTime period: 1994-2006 (11 year average followup)\n-\tParticipants: 23 943\n-\tAge: 35-64\n-\tInclusion criteria: male and female\n-\tExclusion criteria: cancer, myocardial infarction/stroke\n\n**How they documented:**\n> In  the  EPIC-Heidelberg  cohort,  vitamin/mineral  supplementation  was  assessed   at  different time  points.

At the request of an American Cancer Society volunteer, each enrollee completed a four-page mailed questionnaire in 1982 that requested information on history of cancer and other diseases, use of medicines and vitamins, use of alcohol and tobacco, diet, as well as other factors potentially affecting mortality. This analysis includes 1,063,023 people (453,962 men; 609,061 women) who, at enrollment, reported usable data on vitamin use.\n\n**How they documented:**\n\n> [...] each enrollee completed a four-page mailed questionnaire in 1982 that requested information on history of cancer and other diseases, use of medicines and vitamins, use of alcohol and tobacco, diet, as well as other factors potentially affecting mortality. \n\n**What they documented:**\n\n> [...] we classified deaths due to ischemic heart disease (ICD-9 codes 410–414), cerebrovascular disease (stroke) (ICD-9 codes 430–438), and all cancers combined, except nonmelanoma skin cancer (ICD-9 codes 140–195 and 199–209). We examined separately the three most common causes of cancer mortality: lung (ICD-9 code 162), colo-rectal (ICD-9 codes 153–154), and (for men) prostate (ICD-9 code 185) and (for women) breast (ICD-9 code 174), and all other cancers combined. All-cause mortality included persons who died of any cause.\n\n**What they found:**\n\n> **This large prospective study provides limited support for the hypothesis that multivitamin supplements may reduce death rates from ischemic heart disease in the general population**. Men and women who took a multivitamin without other supplements had lower death rates from ischemic heart disease than did those who took no multivitamins. However, the association was attenuated when analyses were adjusted for additional cardiovascular risk factors besides age, and no consistent gradient of decreasing risk was seen with either the frequency or the duration of multivitamin use. \n\n> **Men and women who used both multivitamins and vitamin A, C, or E had lower risks of dying from heart disease and stroke than did nonusers than one might expect from the relative risks for users of either only a multivitamin or only a vitamin A, C, or E supplement.** \n\n\n\n-----------------------------\n\n**[Multivitamin use and the risk of mortality and cancer incidence: the multiethnic cohort study] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3105257/)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2011\n-\tTime period: 1993-2005 (11 year average follow-up)\n-\tParticipants: 182 099 \n-\tAge: 45-75\n-\tInclusion criteria: Living in Hawaii and California, ethnic group\n-\tExclusion criteria: \"we excluded participants who were not in one of the targeted 5 ethnic groups (n = 13,991) or who reported invalid dietary intakes based on total energy intake or its components (n = 8,264) (12). We also excluded those with missing information on multivitamin use (n = 4,451) or smoking (n = 7,013)\"\n\n**How they documented:**\n> The baseline questionnaire included questions about the use of multivitamins (with/without minerals) and 7 single vitamin/mineral supplements. Subjects were asked to indicate whether they had used any of these supplements at least weekly during the previous year.\n\n> In a follow-up questionnaire approximately 5 years after baseline (1999–2003), participants were asked the same question on multivitamin use but without duration of use. \n\n**What they documented:**\n\n> During an average 11 years of follow-up, we identified 28,851 deaths (15,962 men and 12,889 women). Death from all causes was the primary endpoint in the analyses. In addition, according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10), we categorized the primary cause of death into cardiovascular diseases (ICD-9 codes 390–434, 436–448; ICD-10 codes I00–I78), cancer (ICD-9 codes 140–208; ICD-10 codes C00–C97), and all other causes.\n\n**What they found:**\n\n> In this large multiethnic cohort, we found no associations between multivitamin use and mortality from all causes, cardiovascular diseases, or cancer. The findings did not vary across subgroups by ethnicity, age, body mass index, preexisting illness, single vitamin/mineral supplement use, hormone replacement therapy use, and smoking status. In addition, there was no evidence indicating that multivitamin use increased or decreased risk for cancer, overall or at major sites, such as lung, colorectum, prostate, and breast.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n> Multivitamin users are generally more health conscious than are nonusers (1, 36), which could confound the relation of multivitamin use with morbidity or mortality. Although we adjusted for well-known potential confounders including health-related behaviors such as smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity (37), there may still be uncontrolled bias. In particular, we were unable to adjust for changes in potential confounders over time. The longest duration category for multivitamin use in our baseline questionnaire was 5 years and longer, although the effects of multivitamins on longevity and disease might take a longer period.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**Please find the rest of the review in the comments**\n------------------------------\n",

On admission, hypercalcemia (3.23 mmol/L) and acute kidney injury (eGFR 20 mL/min) were detected, associated with high concentrations of 25OH-vitamin D (920 nmol/L), confirming the suspicion of vitamin D intoxication. Vitamin D integration was stopped and, in a week, hypercalcemia normalized. It took about 6 months for renal function and 18 months for vitamin D values to go back to normal.\n> \n> **Conclusions:** This case confirms that vitamin D intoxication is possible albeit with a really high dose. The doses used in clinical practice are far lower than these and, therefore, intoxication rarely occurs even in those individuals whose baseline vitamin D serum levels have never been assessed. Repeated measurements of vitamin D are not necessary in patients under standard integrative therapy. However, patients and clinicians should be aware of the potential dangers of vitamin D overdose.\n> \n> **Keywords:** Vitamin D; cholecalciferol; hypercalcemia.; intoxication; overdose; toxicity.\n>",

    "body": "**Background/Aim**: Low levels of vitamin D are a widespread global issue. This study aimed to determine the optimal vitamin D3 supplementation dose for healthy young adults by comparing the effectiveness of gradually increasing cholecalciferol doses over two years.\n\n**Patients and Methods**: Thirty-five volunteers participated in a two-season pilot study conducted from October to April to avoid sunlight-induced vitamin D3 synthesis. The participants used oil-based drops of cholecalciferol, increasing their dose from 1,000 to 2,000, 4,000, and then 8,000 IU daily for 60 days with a 30-day break.\n\n**Results:** Supplementing with 1,000 IU/day raised vitamin D levels to the recommended range (above 75 nmol/l), but levels dropped below this range after a 30-day break. A dose of 2,000 IU/day maintained vitamin D levels within the recommended range, even after the break. Increasing the dose to 4,000 IU/day produced a rapid rise, though levels dropped more significantly after stopping supplementation. With 8,000 IU/day, both the rise and subsequent decline in vitamin D levels were more pronounced.\n\n**Conclusion:** Effective vitamin D supplementation in healthy young adults can be achieved with a daily dose of 2,000 IU during winter. However, 4,000 IU/day was more effective for maintaining levels above 100 nmol/l, supporting broader health benefits. Regular monitoring of \\[25(OH)D\\], calcium, and phosphorus levels is essential.\n\n Full: [https://iv.iiarjournals.org/content/invivo/39/1/452.full.pdf](https://iv.iiarjournals.org/content/invivo/39/1/452.full.pdf)",

    "body": "Hi everyone, long-time lurker, first-time poster here. This is my (longwinded) theory regarding a possible cause and cure for androgenetic alopecia. I’m by no means claiming to be a scientist and I apologise in advance for how wordy this post is. Citations are at the bottom.\n\nI’ve been researching androgenetic alopecia (AGA) considerably for a few years now ever since I first noticed its effect on myself. Like many, I pussy-footed around the reality of the situation, convincing myself that the higher hairline and thinning crown was stress-related Telogen Efflivium, some basic dietary deficiency or the result of too much booze and smokes. This meant that I delayed treatment with more conventional (and proven) methods for a little longer than I probably should have.\n\nMy apprehension to begin these treatments was by enlarge because of how unsatisfied I was with the widely-accepted ‘cause’ of hair loss: that, not everybody (for some reason), but a large group (for some reason) of unlucky fellows and some women develop a bizarre, localized sensitivity (for some reason) to an androgen that their own body produces naturally and that (for some reason) this hormone ‘attacks’ tens of thousands of tiny organs on a specific part of their head (… for some reason). I thought the logic was dumb and that that kind of thinking did not a cure make.\n\nNow, the human body is by no means a perfect machine, but it didn’t sit well with me that certain genomes would evolve something as complicated and energy-consuming as hair growth only to have it inadvertently switched off by a naturally-occurring androgen. There were also other evidences that it wasn’t just a matter of androgen activity: how often people with AGA do not display more testosterone (or its more active metabolite dihydrotestosterone \\[DHT\\]) than people unaffected; that simply blocking DHT production does not regrow hair in all people; where and the pattern in which the hair is lost (and isn’t); and lastly, the irrefutable links AGA has to issues elsewhere in the body such as heart and prostate health.\n\nSo I dug deeper into other theories a little more substantial than “DHT BAD” – ideally to find one that gave some insight into the process of hair loss being something the body decides to do rather than something it has done unto it. I read through almost every major theory on the web: tension in the galea; reduced brown adipose tissue; mast cell activation, histamine or prostaglandin imbalance etc. None of them seemed outrageous, but none of them gave much reason for AGA other than some people simply lose the genetic lottery. Eventually I stumbled upon something I did like: the phenomenon of seasonal hair growth \\[1\\]. Put simply, the idea is that the scalp is like a UV-ray sponge for the body to use to produce vitamin D, and the amount of hair on the scalp can be considered a valve that closes (grows) to reduce UV exposure, or opens (sheds) to increase it.\n\nThis theory (and the various studies relating to it) appeased me because they suggested that an intentional and strategic biological hair loss mechanism exist in every human, regardless of whether they suffer from more permanent types of alopecia. It was comforting to know that even the thickest head of hair technically undergoes ‘hair loss’ for a large portion of the year. My thinking then became that some of us must get stuck in a sort of ‘perpetual winter’ state where the valve gets stuck open.\n\nI was obviously nowhere near the first person to theorise that vitamin D played a major role in alopecia (as a quick Google search would tell you), but the cure seemed simple: if the body has a mechanism to keep itself in a desired range of circulating cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), then oral supplementation – which has been proven to increase serum cholecalciferol \\[2\\] – might make the body think it’s getting enough sun exposure to close the valve and regrow hair for good. However, a quick skim of numerous Reddit and hair loss forum discussions quickly shoot down that idea, with many members reporting no major (although some minor) improvements from vitamin D3 supplementation alone, with bloodwork confirming they are not deficient. So it would appear we’re back to square one and pointing the finger angrily at DHT again.\n\nHowever, cholecalciferol in and of itself is largely useless when it comes to hair. What is important is the vitamin D Receptor (VDR). The VDR is a nuclear receptor found in almost every cell in the body – including scalp hair follicles – and plays a direct role in the cellular proliferation, function and health of hair growth \\[3\\]. To make it clear, a follicle with more activated VDR will produce thicker hair faster than a follicle with less VDR activation.\n\nThe issue with the simplicity of my initial thinking was that cholecalciferol cannot adequately activate the VDR by itself. It must first undergo conversion to calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) in the liver, and then undergo another conversion in the kidneys to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, also known as calcitriol. Calcitriol can activate the VDR and actually has such a high affinity (roughly 1000 times greater than cholecalciferol) for doing so that the VDR is sometimes referred to as the ‘calcitriol receptor’ in medical literature.\n\nWhere it gets confusing (and more than a little frustrating), is that you can have more than one blood vitamin D value that may not correlate to the other. Most doctors will test for ‘25 OH vitamin D’, also known as 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or calcifediol, as mentioned earlier. This value is good for testing for deficiency, but is more or less useless in relation to VDR activation as calcifediol cannot activate the receptor well either. Doctors can test for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), but this will not give an insight into the body’s stores of the fat-soluble vitamin. In fact, blood calcitriol can actually spike if there is a deficiency of stored calcifediol, which further complicates the results \\[4\\].\n\nDeciphering this means, basically, that your common bloodwork for vitamin D can come back with healthy (or even above-ideal) numbers of stored, inactive D3, but shed zero light on the circulating calcitriol metabolite that can activate the VDR. It’s also been established that the ratio at which calcitriol is converted from calcifediol (the 1,25D:25D) can vary substantially from person to person: “the ratio between calcitriol and calcifediol serum concentrations could suggest vitamin D hydroxylation efficiency.” \\[5\\]. Hydroxylation is “a chemical process that introduces a hydroxyl group (-OH) into an organic compound. In biochemistry, hydroxylation reactions are often facilitated by enzymes called hydroxylases.” \\[6\\]. What this means is that hydroxylation is what makes regular vitamin D (from sun exposure or a supplementation) able to activate the VDR and grow hair, and that it’s possible that a lowered natural capacity for vitamin D hydroxylation could result in less circulating calcitriol and thus lower systemic VDR activation.\n\nWhile I couldn’t find any studies alluding to what the 1,25D:25D ratio might have been in our forefathers, it is not hard to find studies referencing vitamin D’s hydroxylation cofactors – the primary one of which being magnesium, an element that a huge proportion of the population are deficient in and one stripped from the body by modern diet and lifestyle \\[7\\]. On top of magnesium being necessary to produce calcitriol (and thus directly implicated in VDR activation), it’s also been shown that inadequate magnesium levels lead to calcification of soft tissues and that adequate levels protect against it \\[8\\]. Interestingly, and as we probably all know by now, biopsies of bald scalps have shown considerable calcification in their soft tissues compared to non-balding scalps. More interestingly, is that the negative effects of low magnesium can also be seen in the heart and prostate (in hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia) – and that these are the organs and conditions that the only two FDA-approved medications for hair loss (minoxidil and finasteride) were originally designed to alleviate.\n\nSo, all I’ve really talked about thus far is the VDR. The glaring hole in the theory is that the internet has seen a plethora of success stories from people taking anti-androgens and minoxidil (among others that I probably won’t get into). “Hey, idiot, if the VDR is solely responsible for hair cycling, then why do these drugs that don’t have any direct action on the VDR work for so many people?” you might ask, and it’d be a damn good question. I stalled on this part of my theory for a long time but I’m glad I did, because I think this is where mine differs from others, so here it is, in a nutshell…\n\nI believe AGA is the result of a bad ratio of VDR to androgen receptor (AR) activation and density within the body.\n\nThere seems to me to be four primary and irrefutable facts that science has concluded regarding these receptors and their relation to hair growth and AGA:\n\n· One: activating the AR in a hair follicle (like DHT can) causes a decrease of the anagen (growth) phase and eventually a complete miniaturisation of the follicle. \\[9\\]\n\n· Two: activating the VDR in a hair follicle (like calcitriol can) causes an increase of the angagen phase which produces a thicker, faster-growing hair. \\[3\\]\n\n· Three: inhibiting activation of the AR in a hair follicle (like an anti-androgen can) arrests further hair loss in most people, regrows in some but does not prevent further loss in others. \\[10\\]\n\n· Four: inhibiting activation of the VDR in a hair follicle (like low levels of calcitriol or low VDR density can) causes a decrease of the anagen phase and eventually shedding. \\[11\\]\n\nMy theory is this: I believe there exists an ideal homeostasis of VDR and AR inside every organ in the body for healthy and proper function, but most modern diets and lifestyles are throwing out this balance. It’s important to place equal significance on each of these receptors in terms of AGA. I think of the balance as a tug-of-war, with the AR wanting to turn the follicle down to zero and the VDR wanting to turn it to max. As long as the ratio of VDR:AR tilts in the VDR’s favour by even the slightest amount, you will keep your hair.\n\nThis might also allude as to why it’s exceptionally rare, but not impossible for women to develop AGA, as they have very low (but never zero) circulating androgens.\n\nTwo quite ironic cases I came across in my research show the power of each receptor in isolation. Firstly, eunuchs (boys that are castrated before puberty and don’t ever produce considerable quantities of testosterone or DHT) never lose their hair \\[12\\], and secondly, a case of a seven year old boy with hereditary vitamin D-dependent rickets type II (\\[VDDR-II\\] (a condition where the VDR is resistant to activation from calcitriol, thus experiencing almost zero activation systemically,) who suffered alopecia totalis at an age too young to have begun developing sizeable amounts of testosterone or DHT \\[13\\]. So, we have grown men who never lost a single scalp hair because of minuscule AR receptor activation, and a young boy who never grew a single scalp hair because of miniscule VDR activation.\n\nIt was all starting to make sense to me, but I still wasn’t happy with why exactly the AR – a receptor that exists naturally in the follicle – would effectively act to damage it. With further reading, I came to the conclusion that there are two primary reasons why this homeostasis is so important and why going out of it leads to almost exponential and often irreversible loss. The first of which has to do with not only the ratio of receptors themselves, but also how they interact with the other:\n\nWhile there has not been extensive research into the interplay (crosstalk) of these two receptors within hair follicles, there have been numerous studies regarding how they react in other tissues – namely the prostate. Although vastly different organs, the 5-alpha-reductase type II enzyme (\\[5ARII\\], one of three responsible for converting testosterone into DHT,) is most prevalent in scalp and prostatic tissues \\[14\\]. Finasteride has only been approved by the FDA to deal with complications in these two tissues by selectively targeting the 5ARII enzyme, suggesting there may be a similar mode of suppression in each. In studies of prostate cancer, VDR activation has been shown to suppress AR expression in certain cell lines \\[15\\] while AR activation has been shown to suppress VDR activation \\[16\\] \\[17\\].\n\nFurther to the expressional crosstalk between the two receptors, there is also the matter of up/down regulation and receptor density. Cells in the prostate and scalp possess both AR and VDR (among other receptors) in varying densities. There have been numerous studies showing that: AR can be upregulated with regular activation \\[18\\] \\[19\\]; AR can be downregulated by prolonged inactivation \\[20\\]; VDR can be upregulated (and protected) by activation \\[21\\] \\[22\\]; VDR can be downregulated by deficiency \\[23\\].\n\nFor me, this explains why there are such varying severities of hair loss amongst individuals and why anti-androgens such as finasteride work for some better than others. I believe the issue and cure is not simply reducing AR activation, but reducing it to a point where it is exceeded by VDR activation. Finasteride reduces scalp DHT by roughly 64% at a 1mg daily dosage \\[24\\]. As a very rudimentary example, say you have some hair follicles with 20 active AR but only 12 active VDR. A 1mg dose of finasteride should (in theory) reduce that number of activated AR by 64% to around 7.2, creating a surplus of VDR activation and thus regrowing hair. This is what I believe happens in follicles that respond well to anti-androgen treatment.\n\nBut say, due to VDR downregulation and AR upregulation (which often go hand-in-hand), you had follicles with 30 active AR and only 10 active VDR. That same finasteride dose will create a larger drop in AR activation than the previous example (19.2 vs 12.8), but will only bring the total activated AR down to 10.8 – still exceeding the activated VDR count and thus maintaining an environment where the VDR is under-expressed compared to the AR and hair loss continues. My theory posits a few things here: firstly, that great responders to anti-androgens do not have a major deficit in their VDR:AR to contend with; secondly, that poor responders to anti-androgens do have a major deficit in their VDR:AR that some anti-androgens are not powerful enough to correct; and thirdly, that anti-androgens such as finasteride rarely produce a complete reversal of hair loss due to differing ratios of VDR:AR across the scalp follicles, as some follicles have gone beyond the drug’s ‘saveable threshold’.\n\nFurther to this, I feel the theory also provides some explanation as to the ‘catch up hair loss’ phenomenon, whereby people who regrow hair with an anti-androgen and then end treatment often find that their hair is lost in a more severe pattern than it was pre-treatment, i.e. they lose even more hair post-treatment than they had lost before it. In these cases, I would think the healthy hair they had at the commencement of treatment might have possessed a VDR:AR of, as an example, 15:14 (which would become 15:5 on finasteride \\[very healthy hair\\]), but in the X years of treatment, while the VDR still downregulates due to inactivation, this ratio might drop to say 11:5. So the follicle produces healthy hair while on the drug but, following cessation, drops to a ratio of 11:14 and results in the hair being lost.\n\nExplaining why VDR upregulation promotes growth or why downregulation hinders it is one thing, but explaining why the AR seems to destroy hair is another entirely. My second reason why the VDR:AR homeostasis is so important has to do with what exactly the two receptors do inside the follicles, and that can be put as simply as ‘cellular metabolism’. This was the breakthrough for me: the AR and VDR play a direct role in cellular energy production. You’ve heard it a million times before: “the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell”, but its importance cannot be understated.\n\nHair growth is a process that requires energy, cellular proliferation and DNA transcription (replication), and mitochondria provide this. A by-product of any metabolic process is oxidative waste, and the health of a cell is largely dependent on the body’s capacity to bind and remove oxidative waste from it (exactly what an anti-oxidant does), and this also contributes to the health of mitochondria. This is where my theory (in my opinion) became fully-fledged: AR has been shown to reduce mitochondrial function \\[25\\], reduce their capacity to properly replicate DNA and negatively affect oxidative processes \\[26\\]. Inversely, the VDR promotes healthy mitochondria, and “in the long run, the absence of the \\[VDR\\] caused impairment of mitochondrial integrity and, finally, cell death.” \\[27\\]. So there I had it, the reason why a naturally-produced androgen and its receptor might cause hair loss.\n\nFurther to this, it also serves to reason that this might be minoxidil’s mystery mechanism, as it seems to increase mitochondrial efficiency by mediating certain pathways at a cellular level \\[28\\] \\[29\\]. What’s interesting is that “minoxidil induced Ca2+ (calcium) influx can increase stem cell differentiation and may be a key factor in the mechanism by which minoxidil facilitates hair growth.” \\[29\\], but what’s fascinating is that “the VDR signaling system is essential in overall Ca2+ homeostasis. Acute exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 increases the mean open time and plasma membrane Ca2+ permeability…” \\[30\\]. While this last excerpt refers to blood calcium, I think logic lends itself to the idea that if the VDR can activate calcium mobility throughout the body, then an activated receptor inside a hair follicle cell could mobilise calcium into its mitochondria. I also think this is why minoxidil hair is also commonly referred to as “zombie” hair, as the drug artificially activates follicular mitochondria through a similar mechanism as the VDR does, but without any upregulation of the receptors that keep it alive for a longer period.\n\nSo where does all this leave us? I’m not sure. It’s one thing to be sure that the VDR:AR is crucial for hair growth (and overall bodily health), but improving it safely (if at all) is a different matter. Vitamin D affects calcium homeostasis, and too much of it can result in hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood) and cause more problems than it ever alleviates. I think the strategy needs to be a three-pronged approach: upregulating VDR, downregulating AR – but not to a point below healthy levels, and improving mitochondrial health.\n\nI take quite a few things for hair loss, but I think these are the main heroes: I am on 1mg daily finasteride because I believe  that (unless you’re treating hair loss pre-emptively) once you see any sign of hair loss, the cascade of AR upregulation, VDR downregulation and mitochondrial damage has well and truly begun. If I’m right in my theory, then this drug only needs to be taken until results are seen and stabilise. My thinking is that if you downregulate AR in the scalp back to a healthy density (that is lesser than VDR) then you could ween yourself off of it permanently – that is, assuming you could keep a good VDR:AR solely through VDR activation.\n\nI also believe anti-androgens are not drugs to be taken lightly. Results of receptor up/down regulation can take years and years to manifest – just think of the timeframe from the first day you noticed hair loss to now. This means any negative effects might be creeping in under the radar over a long period. I believe if you have both high VDR and high AR then anti-androgen drugs will probably work for you with next to zero side effects, as your DHT and AR expression won’t drop below functional levels systemically. However, if you have low AR but just happen to have even lower VDR, then I think that’s when you’ll run into problems, as a \\~70% reduction in serum DHT might drop you to a dangerously low level. You don’t want to be androgen-depriving receptors in important tissues like your brain, prostate and penis/testes to the point where they downregulate severely and lose function. I also think this lends itself to the idea that much less DHT inhibition would be required for hair growth if the VDR is upregulated (resulting in much safer treatment dosages).\n\nI myself started the drug at .25mg every other day and worked up to 1mg/day after four months, going from .25mg/day, .5mg/every other day and .5mg/day. I was lucky (in a strange way) to get bad forehead acne, ridiculous increases in libido and a shed every time I increased dosage/frequency because it saved me a lot in blood work. These results would last for about two weeks and then taper off, where I would then wait another fortnight and increase the dosage again to the same effect. On 1mg/day I feel absolutely fine – as sharp, fit and virile as I’ve ever been.\n\nAccompanying the finasteride, I use a topical synthetic VDR agonist (activator) called calcipotriene. This is my main weapon for increasing localised VDR activation and upregulation in the scalp to compliment supplemental cholecalciferol and magnesium (among other cofactors). This is prescription-only (in Australia), but very tame and easy to get when I asked my doctor. It’s often used to treat psoriasis – an ailment of reduced VDR activation. I usually try to do this twice a week as it’s messy so I time it with a Nizoral shampoo (see below for why). I’m not sure whether I will increase that frequency or not as I’ve only been taking it for about five months. Calcipotriene is still a relatively crude calcitriol-derivative, in that it still has a lot of the same calcemic qualities of calcitriol and can cause (if used in way, way higher dosages than I do) toxicity. But there are new, improved synthetics coming out all the time. Fingers crossed one comes out soon that is not prohibitively expensive, has no risk of hypercalcaemia and a ridiculously long half-life!\n\nFinally, one thing I started taking early on was 150mg of the ubiquinol form of co-enzyme-Q10 daily. It was the first sort of mitochondrial supplement I had ever taken, and I cannot stress the difference this made enough. Anecdotally, in the last few years I have had about 5-10 people (including my own father and close friends) ask me if I’ve started dying my hair. It’s that much darker. Also, important to note, all these comments came long before finasteride or calcipotriene. On top of this I also take 20mg PQQ, 500mg nicotinamide (B3) and 1.5g acetyl-L-carnitine each day for mitochondrial health, but it’s too early to tell if these have had any effect on hair – though I can definitely say I have more energy day to day.\n\nSo that’s about it; if you’ve made it this far then kudos to you. This blew out way more than I originally planned and is by no means an airtight theory. I’m sure plenty of you will be able to pick it apart, but if it is a step in the right direction and gets conversation happening then I’m glad.

That led to finding this study:\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25548222/\n\nWhich says progesterone up regulates VDR. Which because of this theory made me think about birth control.\n\nI couldn’t find a good study on the link between hair growth and birth control,(I was also lazy and didn’t look very hard) but there were a bunch of articles that mentioned both hair growth and hair loss. I won’t link any of the articles because they aren’t studies, but this is the first paragraph from one article that sums up the general idea:\n\n“Oral contraceptives can cause some women to experience hair loss. But for others — particularly those who have androgenetic alopecia — birth control pills actually may be an effective hair loss treatment.”\n\nNow when you take this theory and apply it to both the study and the anecdotal evidence then it makes complete sense.\n\nProgesterone up regulates VDR, so if you take it and have no hair issues beforehand then hair loss makes sense because you threw off the ratio with too much VDR. If you do have hair loss from too much AR then taking it a up regulating VDR will help you grow your hair back.\n\nI think you are actually on to something here.",

        "body": ">It’s also been established that the ratio at which calcitriol is converted from calcifediol (the 1,25D:25D) can vary substantially from person to person\n\nI've always wondered why Inuit people suffer the least from hair loss. Their ethnicity has the lowest rates in the world: some sources I've read even go as far as to say they have a 0% rate of androgenetic alopecia. All prior explanations for this fact I've heard were unsatisfying: \"they simply don't have the male pattern baldness genes.\" Meanwhile, we still haven't even identified which genes are responsible for male pattern baldness, only genetic variations that make it more or less likely.\n\nBut your theory can explain how the Inuit are immune to balding, because [it has been shown that](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00223-003-0110-9) Inuit people are much more efficient hydroxylators of inactive Vitamin D into active Vitamin D.\n\n>Compared to Danes, Greenlanders had higher 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels, but lower 25 OHD and PTH levels\n\nEdit:\n\nMoving into the land of conjecture, it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, too.\n\nFor humans evolving in Alaska, Greenland, Northern Canada, etc, those places have an average *maximum* UV index of 4 in the summer months. They would have gotten most of their Vitamin D from diet (and much less than what they would've gotten if there were more sunlight.) So there would be evolutionary pressure to evolve the ability to more efficiently convert what little inactive Vitamin D they had into the active form.\n\nAnd that's exactly what we see.\n\nYou mentioned that you take \"magnesium (among other cofactors)\" in an attempt to increase hydroxylation efficiency. Could you tell us what those other cofactors you take are?\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI know you've mentioned that you think there is basically a gradient of VDR:AR across the scalp which explains the pattern of baldness. But I have an alternate hypothesis there.\n\nStudies have shown if you transplant a miniaturizing hair into the non-balding regions of scalp, it will continue to miniaturize. Likewise, studies have shown if you transplant a non-balding hair into a balding region, it will remain healthy (this is the entire basis of hair transplants.)\n\nBut interestingly, if you transplant a miniaturizing from a human onto a *mouse...* It will completely regrow within one hair cycle. [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12734505/)\n\nI think these observations rule out the idea that there exists a gradient across the scalp of differing VDR:AR which causes the classic pattern we see in male pattern baldness.\n\nRather, I think that specific follicles *are* preprogrammed to miniaturize when the VDR:AR reaches a certain point. And I think that VDR:AR is fairly consistent across your entire scalp, which is why if you move a miniaturizing hair to a different region, it won't grow.\n\nThis explains why a miniaturizing hair transplanted from man to mouse will regrow!\n\nThe next question would then be \"Why are these hairs in this specific pattern preprogrammed to miniaturize when the VDR:AR ratio goes below a certain threshold?\" And I think there is an evolutionary explanation for that.\n\nIt all goes back to this part of your original post:\n\n>I believe there exists an ideal homeostasis of VDR and AR inside every organ in the body for healthy and proper function\n\nIf we assume this is the case, and I *do* believe this is the case, then from an evolutionary perspective it would make sense to evolve a mechanism by which you could regulate this ratio, especially for the most important organs.\n\nAnd I posit that the mechanism by which this is achieved was by evolving so that the hair follicles on the top of our heads had *most* sensitive threshold to this ratio. That would mean that as soon as your VDR:AR begins going out of wack, the hair on top of your head would be the first thing to go. The canary in the coal mine. And the reason for this would be to expose your scalp to the sun in an attempt to get more Vitamin D, to upregulate the VDR, and all the things you spoke about in your post. The idea is that if you can lose your hair and in return fix the VDR:AR in the rest of your more vital organs, then it's a worthwhile trade.\n\nAnd in the past, when this proposed mechanism would have evolved, the hair would continue to fall out until VDR:AR was brought into balance again, and hair loss would then stop. Something we sometimes see today by the way, plenty of people who reach a NW3 and then simply stop balding.\n\nBut now due to modern diet and lifestyle as you mentioned, for many people the extra UV exposure we get from having a bald head *still* isn't enough to bring the body-wide average VDR:AR ratio back to where it should be, meaning it continues falling out until there's nothing left.\n\nLast thing I'll write for now, there's been many studies showing that UV exposure is associated with a significantly *decreased* risk of prostate cancer. [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17548698/#:~:text=Frequent%20recreational%20sun%20exposure%20in,life%20protects%20against%20prostate%20cancer.) I believe the mechanism by which this happens is by improving the VDR:AR ratio in the prostate.\n\nTo me it makes perfect evolutionary sense that your body would sacrifice the hair in an attempt to save the prostate, because one of those organs is necessary for reproduction and the other is not.",

    "body": "About a month ago, I picked up the Trader Joe's Nourish Oil-Free Antioxidant Moisturizer.  Note that TJ's also sells an intensive moisturizer, which contains oil.\n\nIt's a watery lotion that is light yet moisturizing.  If I apply too much, it feels annoyingly wet on my skin for about a minute until it dries.  After that, it is perfectly comfortable.  Since it's summer here, I don't need a heavy moisturizer.  I really like this and would definitely buy it again.\n\n[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/6AvUUKs)\n\nPros:\n\n* Inexpensive at 6 oz for $6\n* Contains a bunch of different antioxidants\n* Lightweight\n* Fragrance-free\n\nCons:\n\n* Antioxidant concentration might be low.  Many are listed after the preservatives.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just unknown.\n* Clear container might let light in, which might make the antioxidants less effective\n* Pump might not be super sturdy?  I knocked mine off my counter and the pump came off.   I was not able to get it back on, so I had to transfer the lotion to another container.\n\n\nIngredients:  Water, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Ethylhexyl (Octyl) Palmitate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Polysorbate-60, Cetearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Cetearyl Glucoside, Sodium PCA, Ethylhexyglycerin (Preservative), Shea Butter Fruit, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Xanthan Gum (Thickener), Tocopherol (Antioxidant), Sorbic Acid (preservative), Soluble Collagen, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C Palmitate), Pomegranate Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Extract, Coffea Arobica (Coffee) Seed, Chamomile Flower/Leaf Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Stearate, Phytonadione (Vitamin K1), Menadione (Vitamin K3), Hydrolyzed Silk, DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol), Copper PCA, Retinol (Vitamin A), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A Palmitate), Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10),Thioctic Acid (Alpha-lipoic acid), Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3), Polysorbate-20, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Phospholipids\n\nPossible dupe?  [Skin Resource MD Oil Free Antioxidant Facial Moisturizer](https://skinresourcemd.com/collections/face-moisturizers/products/oil-free-facial-antioxidant-moisturizer#goto).  The packaging and ingredients look similar enough.  The ingredients are not listed 100% the same, but it seems that it would at least be very similar.\n\nI hadn't seen a review on this moisturizer here before, so I thought I'd write one.  Let me know if you also enjoy this product!",

I finish with the Oil-Free Antioxidant Serum. \n\nA few side notes:  I keep a bottle of the All-In-One Cleanser in the shower and use it in place of soap.

If I missed anything or said something wrong, please comment and I'll edit my post.\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nADEK is fat soluble. These dissolve directly into chylomicrons to enter lymphatic circulation like fats.\n\nBC are water soluble. These diffuse across endothelial cells like sugars + amino acids.\n\nA = carotene; unsaturated hydrocarbon involved in vision, growth and immune system. Converted into retinal for vision, retinoic acid for epithelial growth regulation.\n\nB1 = thiamine; deficiency causes Wernicke's encephalopathy which if untreated then leads to Korsakoff syndrome which causes severe memory problems (common in alcoholism and malnutrition).\n\nB2 = riboflavin; includes FAD and FMN, electron carriers in mitochondria involved in ETC and decarboxylation of pyruvate + glutathione, DNA repair, as well as many other functions.\n\nB3 = niacin; includes NAD+ and NADP+. It is important for ETC and pentose phosphate pathway.\n\nB5 = pantotheic acid, fatty acid synthase (building of palmitic acid) requires it.\n\nB7 = biotin; required in the first step of catabolism of propionyl-CoA (3 carbon remnant of odd numbered fatty acid). Gut bacteria produce it.\n\nB12 = cobalamin; parietal cells in stomach are required to absorb. Required for second step of breaking odd numbered fatty acids. Gut bacteria produce.\n\nC = ascorbic acid; important for connective tissue. Deficiency = scurvy. Vitamin is also important in immune system and wound clotting.\n\nD = cholecalciferol; can be consumed or gotten through UV light. It is an unsaturated hydrocarbon and not actually a vitamin, but a hormone and a precursor to steroids. It is involved bone breakdown (resorption) releasing calcium and phosphate to be taken up in the gut. It is converted to calciterol in liver/kidneys which is what causes calcium + phosphate uptake in gut and these can be used to make new better/stronger bones than the original. Deficiency causes rickets which results in underdeveloped curved long bones and poor growth.\n\nE = tocopherol or tocotrienol, includes aromatic ring with isoprenoid chain. The aromatic ring can capture free radicals so it prevents oxidative damage like cancer or aging.\n\nK= phylloquinone (K1), menaquinone (K2); includes aromatic ring with 2 para-carbonyls called quinone which is a resonance stablized electrophile. Makes prothrombin which is important for clotting, postranslationally modifies proteins to give them carboxylates which act as calcium binding sites. Also forms ubiquinones including CoQ which is important for ETC. Gut bacteria produce it.\n\nGut bacteria produce vitamin B7 (biotin), B12 (cobalamin), and vitamin K",

Additionally, B5 is a part of coenzyme A synthesis / the transfer of acyl groups so really anything that involves coenzyme A can be said to depend on it (like in fatty acids synthesis, you're making fatty acyl-CoAs)",

According to the supplement information, the two biggest dose strengths of the Java Burn components are 300mg of green tea extract and 200mg of chlorogenic acid from green coffee bean extract (Coffea arabica). Following that, 100mg of L-Theanine and 100mg of L-Carnitine complement the green tea and green coffee extracts, with 20mcg of Chromium, 20mcg of Vitamin D3 cholecalciferol, 1mg of Vitamin B6, and 5 mcg of Vitamin B12 methylcobalamin rounding out the package.\n\nAll of the ingredients in Java Burn have been shown to help with excessive weight gain, fat storage, and other concerns related to a slowed metabolism. These assertions are supported by a number of scientific research on each of these components, which John Barban discusses in his formal presentation. Let's look at some of the most frequent hypotheses about each of the star elements in the Java Burn coffee enhancer:\n\n**Chromium:** Chromium is a mineral that enables the body's insulin levels to stay in check. This is accomplished by regulating the rate at which glucose enters the bloodstream and the amount of sugar stored as fat. A diet high in refined sugars can cause blood sugar fluctuations, which can lead to increased food cravings, but chromium can help keep blood sugar levels in check. It may also help with weight loss due to its involvement in regulating how fat is stored for energy.\n\n**L-Carnitine:** L-Carnitine helps transport more fatty acids into your cells to be burned for energy, keeps your body's cells working smoothly, and has a secondary function in eliminating waste products from your cells.\n\n**L-theanine:** L-theanine is an amino acid with anti-oxidant effects. It has been discovered that it increases fat-burning efficiency while also improving mental performance. When you combine L-Theanine with caffeine, you may be able to burn fats stored in your stomach, arms, thighs, and waist more quickly.\n\n**Chlorogenic acid:** Chlorogenic acid, a component of green coffee bean extract, has been proven to aid in the prevention of carbohydrate absorption and the reduction of sugar spikes, both of which are beneficial. By decreasing cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood circulation, chlorogenic acid also aids in the regulation of hormones connected to obesity.\n\n**Green Tea Extract (with EGCG):** Green Tea extract is another well-known ingredient that may help with weight loss. It's known for boosting body metabolism and reducing tension and anxiety. It has a lot of advantages. Green tea extracts high in EGCG can help you maintain a healthy blood pressure level and build a fit physique.\n\n# How Does Java Burn Work? - Java Burn reviews Reddit\n\nAll of the Java Burn components are well-known for their weight-loss effects, as we all know. These substances can be found in a wide range of weight-loss solutions.\n\nHowever, according to Java Burn, combining their patent-pending 100 percent natural product with coffee generates astounding effects. This leads to a more efficient metabolism and fat-burning process.\n\nCoffee, when eaten in moderation, aids fat loss while also lowering cravings.\n\nThe Java Burn formula is designed to support this process by providing a combination of other weight-loss nutrients and metabolism-boosting ingredients, including antioxidants that fight unhealthy fat cells that form in our bodies as we age, as well as balancing insulin activity in our bodies to prevent us from becoming overweight or obese.\n\nWhen the body absorbs these nutrients, insulin function returns to normal, promoting fat loss in resistant areas like the thighs and stomach while also giving energy for your day! You will feel stimulated both mentally and physically as a result of consistently taking it.\n\nL-Theanine and chromium, for example, lower appetites and improve brain function while also stabilizing insulin levels. People with an appetite disturbance disorder, such as diabetes, will have an easier time shedding abdominal fat. Improved brain performance also offers you the strength and determination to stick to your weight-loss goals.\n\nGreen tea extract and L-Carnitine are both high in antioxidants in Java Burn. Apart from cleaning the body by removing waste products or unhealthy fat cells and lowering stress levels, they also support the immune system.\n\nChlorogenic acid and chromium also aid in blood sugar and blood pressure control.\n\nIn general, the Java Burn supplement is good for your health and well-being.\n\n# Benefits of Java Burn\n\nAccording to JavaBurn.com, \" There’s never been anything even close to Java Burn ever attempted.\" Java Burn is a fat-burning supplement that may also help with blood sugar management, blood pressure regulation, and cognitive thinking, among other biological processes.\n\nWhen you combine the fact that it works as a natural healthy coffee enhancer by combining eight proprietary blended extracts with high dosage strengths of 300mg green tea extract, 200mg green coffee bean extract \\[Chlorogenic acid from Coffea arabica\\], 100mg L-Carnitine, 100mg L-Theanine, 20mcg Chromium \\[chromium chloride\\], 20mcg Vitamin D3, this patent-pending formula becomes one of the most exotic weight loss formulas.\n\n**Let’s take a look at popular Java Burn** **supplement benefits:**\n\n· It contributes to the immune system's strengthening and resistance to infections and disease from the outside world.\n\n· It accelerates your body's metabolic rate.\n\n· Toxins and other waste items are removed from the body, which aids in thorough cleansing.\n\n· It provides you with ample energy to do your chores without becoming exhausted.\n\n· It also aids in the regulation of hormone levels in your body.\n\n· To avoid eating too much Java, control your hunger. Burn also aids in blood sugar and blood pressure regulation.\n\n· Stress and anxiety levels are reduced, and cognitive function is improved.\n\n# Java Burn reviews Reddit: java burn customer reviews\n\nCustomer testimonials abound on the Java Burn website. Many people are discussing their weight-loss journeys on social media. Let's see what they're saying about Java Burn:\n\n\"After taking Java Burn, a person claims to have lower blood pressure and cholesterol. His results astounded his doctor.\"\n\n\"A woman claims that she can now fit back into her high school jeans, which she never thought she'd be able to accomplish again, and that she drops six inches from her waistline.\"\n\nOn their official website, JavaBurn.com, you can find more Java Burn reviews.\n\nThose who watch the entire JavaBurn presentation will witness a number of video clips of Java Burn customers discussing their experiences with the simple-to-use coffee enhancing solution.\n\n# FAQ about Java Burn supplement\n\nQ: What are the adverse effects of Java Burn?\n\nA. We haven't found any significant adverse effects at this time. It's also worth noting that it's made in a cGMP-certified facility and uses only natural components.\n\nQ. Can Java Burn be mixed with other drinks?\n\nIndividual elements in Java Burn may offer health benefits when combined with other beverages. Java Burn, on the other hand, comprises a patent-pending blend of 100 percent natural chemicals that act in tandem with the coffee to increase metabolic rate and create the best possible environment for weight reduction.\n\nQ: Are there any additional fees that I should be aware of?\n\nNo, there aren't any additional fees. All you have to do now is pay for the java burn powder box you want and the shipping costs.\n\nQ: When can I expect the Java Burn to arrive?\n\nA. Your purchase will be delivered within 5-7 business days if you live in the United States or Canada. Orders from outside the United States typically arrive in 8 to 15 business days (plus customs clearance time).\n\nQ. How can I buy Java Burn online while avoiding scams?\n\nA. Unfortunately, the popularity of Java Burn has resulted in the appearance of fake product listings on major markets such as Amazon, eBay, and GNC, to name a few. This is obviously problematic for naïve customers who are wanting to buy Java Burn at a discount or somewhere else where they can save the most money, but who are falling prey to counterfeit schemes. Fortunately, as previously said, Java Burn scams are quite rare if users only visit the official website and avoid all of the extra clutter and noise. The JavaBurn.com store is the only site on the Internet where you can buy authentic Java Burn coffee mixer stick pack pouches that have been thoroughly tested and validated. By ordering directly from the manufacturer, John Barban's two-month return policy for any and all money-back guarantee requests may be conveniently maintained and managed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Get Java burn with a** **discount from the** **Official Website \"the link on Stickied comment\"**",

    "body": " People generally make a lot more Vitamin D3 with their skin in the summer sunny months than in the dark winter months. Although D3 can be acquired from the diet and diet now might be the primary source of D3 for many, most people used to get the majority of their D3 from sun exposure.Vitamin D3 is not a vitamin! It is actually a seco-steroid hormone that affects almost all the cells in your body by altering the expression of your genes. Vitamin D3 receptors are found in all the cells of your body.Vitamin D3 deficiency is associated with a huge number of diseases and disorders. Let us focus just on obesity, depression, arthritis, and susceptibility to the common cold for now. Now here is the logic: In the spring and summer your body is exposed to lots of sun, and thus your Vitamin D3 levels are high and rising. Your body, from an evolutionary perspective believes that food is abundant, days are long, and everything is good. So the sunshine hormone D3 tells your body it’s okay to burn a lot of energy and get things done, because food and vitamin resources will be available. Thus from D3 you get lots of energy; it keeps you active; keeps your hunger under control, and keeps you healthy (as will be described shortly).Obese people, depressed people, and people with arthritis or general musculoskeletal pains have been found to be overwhelmingly deficient in Vitamin D3!  \n\n\nCOVID & D3  \n\"Overall, the reduction in risk of acute respiratory infection induced by vitamin D was on a par with the protective effect of injectable 'flu vaccine against 'flu-like illnesses.\"  \nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/02/170216110002.htm  \n\n\nVitamin D is effective for COVID-19: real-time meta analysis of 38 studies• Vitamin D is effective for COVID-19.

Immunol., 07 April 2021 \n\n> # Vitamin D Resistance as a Possible Cause of Autoimmune Diseases: A Hypothesis Confirmed by a Therapeutic High-Dose Vitamin D Protocol\n> \n\n> \n> Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is a secosteroid and prohormone which is metabolized in various tissues to the biologically most active vitamin D hormone 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol). 1,25(OH)2D3 has multiple pleiotropic effects, particularly within the immune system, and is increasingly utilized not only within prophylaxis, but also within therapy of various diseases. In this context, the latest research has revealed clinical benefits of high dose vitamin D3 therapy in autoimmune diseases. The necessity of high doses of vitamin D3 for treatment success can be explained by the concept of an acquired form of vitamin D resistance. Its etiology is based on the one hand on polymorphisms within genes affecting the vitamin D system, causing susceptibility towards developing low vitamin D responsiveness and autoimmune diseases; on the other hand it is based on a blockade of vitamin D receptor signaling, e.g. through pathogen infections. In this paper, we review observational and mechanistic evidence for the acquired vitamin D resistance hypothesis. We particularly focus on its clinical confirmation from our experience of treating multiple sclerosis patients with the so-called Coimbra protocol, in which daily doses up to 1000 I.U. vitamin D3 per kg body weight can be administered safely. Parathyroid hormone levels in serum thereby provide the key information for finding the right dose. We argue that acquired vitamin D resistance provides a plausible pathomechanism for the development of autoimmune diseases, which could be treated using high-dose vitamin D3 therapy.\n>\n>...",

The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. **A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L.** The largest meta-analysis ever conducted of studies published between 1966 and 2013 showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <75 nmol/L may be too low for safety and associated with higher all-cause mortality, demolishing the previously presumed U-shape curve of mortality associated with vitamin D levels. Since all-disease mortality is reduced to 1.0 with serum vitamin D levels ≥100 nmol/L, we call public health authorities to consider designating as the RDA at least three-fourths of the levels proposed by the Endocrine Society Expert Committee as safe upper tolerable daily intake doses. This could lead to a recommendation of 1000 IU for children <1 year on enriched formula and 1500 IU for breastfed children older than 6 months, 3000 IU for children >1 year of age, and around 8000 IU for young adults and thereafter. Actions are urgently needed to protect the global population from vitamin D deficiency.\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(15)00244-X/pdf\n\n>**Vitamin D Is Not as Toxic as Was Once Thought:A Historical and an Up-to-Date Perspective**\n>\n> ...\n> \n> Vitamin  D  intoxication  associated  withhypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and sup-pressed parathyroid hormone level is typicallyseen in patients who are receiving massive dosesof vitamin D in the range of 50,000 to 1 millionIU/d for several months to years. Ekwaru et al16recently reported on more than 17,000 healthyadult volunteers participating in a preventativehealth program and taking varying doses ofvitamin D up to 20,000 IU/d. These patients didnot demonstrate any toxicity, and the blood levelof 25(OH)D in those taking even 20,000IU/d was less than 100 ng/mL. For point ofreference, a 25(OH)D level of 100 ng/mL isconsidered by the Institute of Medicine, theEndocrine Society, and many reference labora-tories to be the upper limit of normal.\n> \n> ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33030138/\n\n> # How Much Vitamin D is Too Much? A Case Report and Review of the Literature\n> \n> \n> ## Abstract\n> \n> **Background:** The beneficial effects of vitamin D, together with the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, have led to an expanding use of vitamin D analogues. While inappropriate consumption is a recognized cause of harm, definition of doses at which vitamin D becomes toxic remain elusive.\n> \n> **Case presentation:** A 56-year woman was admitted to our Hospital following a 3-week history of nausea, vomiting and muscle weakness. **The patient had been assuming very high dose of cholecalciferol since 20 months (cumulative 78,000,000UI, mean daily 130,000UI)**, as indicated by a non-conventional protocol for multiple sclerosis. Before starting vitamin D integration, serum calcium and phosphorus levels were normal, while 25OH-vitamin D levels were very low (12.25 nmol/L). On admission, hypercalcemia (3.23 mmol/L) and acute kidney injury (eGFR 20 mL/min) were detected, associated with high concentrations of 25OH-vitamin D (920 nmol/L), confirming the suspicion of vitamin D intoxication. Vitamin D integration was stopped and, in a week, hypercalcemia normalized. It took about 6 months for renal function and 18 months for vitamin D values to go back to normal.\n> \n> **Conclusions:** This case confirms that vitamin D intoxication is possible albeit with a really high dose. The doses used in clinical practice are far lower than these and, therefore, intoxication rarely occurs even in those individuals whose baseline vitamin D serum levels have never been assessed. Repeated measurements of vitamin D are not necessary in patients under standard integrative therapy. However, patients and clinicians should be aware of the potential dangers of vitamin D overdose.\n> \n\n>\n\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/derm.24808\n\n> # A pilot study assessing the effect of prolonged administration of high daily doses of vitamin D on the clinical course of vitiligo and psoriasis\n> \n> ## Abstract\n> \n> Autoimmunity has been associated with vitamin D deficiency and\n> resistance, with gene polymorphisms related to vitamin D metabolism\n> frequently described in affected patients.

    "body": "This is very long. My hope was to hit as many of those frequently asked questions and concerns I see on this sub as possible and to do so in a wide range of areas. I've left things in bold, so if you are interested in my experience in a particular area, you can just go and read that part.\n\nAs time goes on, I'll do less and less of these. Things change far more rapidly in the beginning. People considering the surgery--or behind me in the progression of post op--are curious about what to expect. They seem to be most interest on what the expect early and long term (years after the surgery and whether weight loss was sustained). It bears repeating, experiences vary. You will see that I have had many contrasting experiences with those on this sub. \n\nAgain, I apologize for the length. I will post three more times about my experience in the first year: four months, six months, and one year post op. Hopefully some of those will include pictures. In those, I can attach a link to this post and avoid the arduousness/length of this one!\n\nI am grateful if anyone benefits from this.\n\n**Pre-surgery**\n\nI was supposed to be on a purely liquid diet one week out. I was also supposed to stop drinking soda well before my surgery. My surgery had been cancelled due to COVID earlier in December. As the weeks progressed, the number were rising. I knew how many patients were on ventilators and had the virus as a smaller local hospital my wife worked out. From her, I knew that the situation was much worse were I was going to get my surgery. I felt a sense of apathy about the situation, whether it would or would not happen. My wife made sure to make comments like, \"you don't think the surgery is going to happen do you?\" Her tone suggested it would be delusional to think otherwise.\n\nI had already been well into the liquid diet when they cancelled the first time, which I found to be quite miserable. I wasn't eager to start the diet--consisting of virtually only broth, zero calorie, non carbonated beverages, and protein shakes--only to have them cancel again. I got the call exactly one week out from when my surgery was cancelled. I set my burrito down and expected to answer another cancellation call. Instead, they asked me .to move up my surgery one day. I asked about whether moving it up impacted the liquid diet and they said no. I finished my burrito and washed it down with a diet coke. I had planned that to be my last meal anyway, but now it had to be--except it wasn't. I ate another burrito (the only meal I had after that) on Friday and had my surgery on Tuesday. \n\nI was obviously ashamed of myself, but I could help but be scared after answering that call. I was struggling with the liquid diet and I went for my comfortable addiction. I stopped pop after Friday. \n\n**Surgery**\n\nI was very nervous. It was my first surgery. I expected to get something to calm my nerves before going back to the operating room. They did not give me anything.\n\nThe following will be fairly universal, so here's what you can basically expect before being knocked out: you will be taken back to the pre-surgery \"room\". They will ask you a bunch of questions, take your blood pressure, you will change into a gown, and you will probably get an IV started. I was given something for nausea (which I had from the liquid diet and anxiety). You'll wait for the anesthesiologist, who will come in first and explain things to you (probably with an assistant). After that (and it could happen before), your surgeon will come. Now they are ready to wheel you back to the OR. If you're like me, you will be very nervous at this point--especially if they didn't give you anything to calm your nerves. It'll be ok. You'll get into the OR and you will see a variety of people: the anesthesiologist, an OR nurse, and some surgical techs. They are probably going to ask you to get up/slide onto the operating table. You will be laying there, awake, as people rush around. They are going to put intermittent pneumatic compression devices on each of your legs to prevent blood clots. They are basically big cuffs that go from the ankle to the knees and swell up like a blood pressure cuff. During this time they will be asking you questions and reassuring you. They will put an oxygen mask on you, and it'll probably be a little loose and just kind of sitting on your face. Soon enough, you will be asleep and the next thing you know, you'll be in recovery, where you may see a loved one--obviously depends on the hospital and covid situation. \n\nNow, I want to get in to a few surgical details, only because I think it may benefit some people. There have been questions on here that suggest people are not fully aware of what happens during surgery, and frankly, why would you? You have plenty to worry about regarding this process and diving into what happens while you are knocked out may not be high on the list. \n\nFirst things first, the mask is loose, or at least was in my case, because they will not be using that to provide you with oxygen during surgery. You will be intubated. A tube will be inserted down your mouth and into your airway. It will be attached to a ventilator, which pushes air into your lungs. If you have a CPAP or any concerns about breathing during surgery, rest assured, there is an entire team of professionals that will monitor your breathing, which will be assisted via a ventilator.\n\nYour surgery is almost assuredly going to be done laparoscopically. This means you'll have many small incisions and they will take small cameras with high intensity lights to aid in their work. You may not see your surgeon in the OR, only before being taken back and once you are on the unit after the recovery room. \n\n**Incisions**\n\nI'll include all things related to my incisions here and avoid rehashing that information as I explain post op. I woke up to six incisions. There's one on my belly button, two on my left side, two on my right, and one larger incision closer to the right side, maybe an inch above my belly button. The large incision is where  they took my stomach out from. \n\nThat's the incision that hurt the most. The incision pain was very manageable. I didn't want to crunch, bend over and pick things up from the ground, but I wasn't dreading the surgery because of this pain. I would classify it as a 3.5-4/10 on the pain scale initially. When I woke up, they were hardly noticeable, but more on that later. When I got into the car to leave, it wasn't incredible fun to bend down and get in. Getting up from bed, I certainly felt it. I was released on Christmas Eve, around 4pm. My first full night home was Christmas. As much as I wanted to get on the floor with my 14-month old daughter and help her open her Christmas presents, the incision pain was enough for me to think that wouldn't feel good at all. That said, not a terrible time. Looking back, it was a minor pain and inconvenience of the surgery. It is not something that I would suggest factoring in to whether or not you want to get the VGS. The pain, for me, was virtually gone by week three. Six weeks out, there's absolutely zero pain. I was running hot water directly on them in the shower around week 3-4, and I would think that I was more cautious than others.\n\nMy healing has gone fine. For me, they put Steri Strips over the incisions. They are adhesive bandages that back up your dissolvable stitches, which are down under the skin. Usually, these fall off. You're not supposed to take them off yourself. When I went to my two week follow up, the physicians assistant  took them off and rubbed the incisions with some antiseptic wipes. I had no bruising whatsoever! I did, however, have a stitch pop out through where they had glued the tissue shut on my large incision. It was very red. I had no idea what was happening and was concerned at first. This is absolutely normal and resolved itself within a few days. The area started scabbing slightly and it now looks pretty much like my other incisions.  \n\n**Chest pain and heart burn**\n\nThis is by far the worst part of the surgery. Basically, they inflate you abdominal cavity with carbon dioxide so they have room to work. After words, the CO^2 gets trapped in your chest cavity. When I woke up, this pain, for me, was unreal. It is perhaps the worst pain I've felt. It may not be as bad for you. When I woke up in recovery, I was pretty heavily sedated. I remember moaning in pain, them trying to ease it, and passing out again. My wife was so sure during this process I wouldn't even remember she was there, that she took a picture of me--a very unflattering picture. I did remember she was there, but I didn't feel well enough to enjoy or be comforted by her presence. That first night was difficult for me because of the pressure I felt in my chest. My wife continuously texted me, but my phone was across the room, in the bag with my other stuff. I laid flat on the bed the entire night and didn't get up to get it, only effort I could make was to press my call light for more pain meds. \n\nLet me be clear, it seems that a fair amount of people don't experience this much pain. You'll hear the refrain, walk, walk, walk. Walk is right. I just couldn't get over the pain enough that first night and what I had just been through to get up and walk. It would have helped me, and it did that next morning. The more I walk, the better I felt. If the nurses have you laying flat--I was put on a general post surgery floor, because the bariatric unit was closed due to COVID--raise your bed. This will help. Basically, you have to work the gas down. The goal, to put it blunt, is to fart out the gas, which is achieved by moving. Each fart is a success. \n\nI did not have heartburn before the surgery but did quite badly after. It was especially worse when I laid flat. I was given a 90 day supply of pepcid (famotidine) upon discharge which has removed the heart burn for the most part. They want me to discontinue it after the 90 days. \n\n**Post Op**\n\nYou may have a sore throat and dry mouth. This is because of the intubation. Unfortunately, you won't be able to drink water, so you'll have little sponges to rub around your mouth. You will probably be discharged the night night, as long as you're walking, and your blood work comes back good. My white blood cell count was elevated, so I stayed an extra night. The day after surgery, I was taking pills that were cut in half, which included norcos for pain.\n\n**Water**\n\nWater was hard for the first week or so. At the hospital, I wanted nothing to do with water or food. It eventually got very easy for me to drink water. I am able to comfortable drink over 100oz. I no longer sip water and take my normal \"gulps.\" After drinking an entire glass of water, it is estimated that it 50% of it will pass through a normal stomach within 10 minutes. I would assume it is passing through our stomach quicker than that. Water will not stretch out your stomach. I suggest taking sips early on to avoid nausea and discomfort as your stomach heals. As soon as you feel able, take bigger and bigger sips. Make it as easy as possible to drink as much water as possible. This will help you in so many ways. \n\n**Food**\n\nThis has been a fairly uncomfortable aspect of the surgery. I am rarely every hungry in the six weeks. I find it nearly impossible, or rather undesirable to eat five meals, not matter the size. The liquid diet was not fun afterwards. I wanted a real meal, just for the increased source of energy. I lived basically on premier protein shakes. They are ok. I was able to get the Fairlife core power shake with 42g of protein at Walmart. They are better, not doubt about it. This one has more grams of carbs. I could live with that. I couldn't live with the price. I couldn't find the Fairlife nutrition plan that everyone talks about. I saw that a target thats not particularly close to me has them, but again, the price was hard to handle. Things got better when I transitioned to soft foods. \n\nMany people mention they can't handle spicy foods after surgery. I can't get enough of them. I can be happy drinking hot sauce from the container, though I am not doing that. I even took to adding ghost pepper to things. It was fine until it was not. I had what might have been my first case of dumping syndrome. It was right before bed. I couldn't get off of the toilet. I was waiting to to relieve the pressure I felt in my stomach, well, everywhere to be honest. I wanted to lay down, but any attempts to do so felt worse than just sitting on the toilet. After about 40 minutes of agony, it went away. Now, I just stick with hot sauce. I make buffalo sauce with some \"0 calorie\" I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray. \n\nI eat a lot of canned chicken and ground turkey. Things I've enjoyed eating the most are chili, Mexican chicken chili, and buffalo chicken tacos without the wrap. Obviously, I've improvised from the way I would have prepared these meals in the past, removing ingredients I can't have or are unhealthy. My wife made me some kind of healthy enchilada chicken meal for work. It's super delicious. I've searched hungry girl for some recipes and improvised ones that matched closest to what is allowed on a soft food diet. I've eaten scrambled eggs a number of time, though my taste buds seem to not like them as much as I did. One thing you may notice is that your taste buds may change after the surgery. Mine certainly have to some degree.\n\nI am consuming roughly 400-600 calories. I strive to get just north of 600. I measure everything out to a little less than half a cup. I start off probably over chewing and spending over an hour to eat that meal, stopping when I noticed I was full. In the beginning, the sign would be burping or a slight pain in my esophagus. Now, it's more akin to how I'd feel before the surgery. It takes me a bit over 35 mins to eat now. \n\n**Energy and depression**\n\nMy energy dipped very low after the surgery. It did not noticeably pick up until the soft food stage, but I still consider it lower than pre surgery. This is to be expected. We consume calories for energy and now your body is not only healing, it's at an extreme caloric deficit. I imagine it's just going to get better my body get use to things and my calories increase. \n\nI found my self very depressed a few days after being home. I was in a little bit of pain, I had very little energy, and I questioned the drastic decisions I had made. The worst part of it all was having to stop my daughter from running up to me and thrusting her hands or body on my stomach. I couldn't pick her up, even when she came to me to want to be held. In the first two weeks, I cheated and picked her up a few times. But she picked up on all of this. The days I was at the hospital and she could see me, the isolation she felt when I put my hands up to guard her from jumping on me, it all made he run to her mom more and more. Eventually, she grew to prefer her mom greatly over me and the dynamic had shift from parity. Outside of this, I was just generally sad. My comfort in food was gone. One day, I grew down right anhedonia. Luckily, by the end of the day, I didn't feel near that bad. As time has gone on, things have improved drastically and returned mostly to normal outside of the adjustments related to my new stomach and energy levels. My daughter is back to running at me and looking to both parents for comfort and cuddles. I started picking her up after two weeks and spending days with her by ourselves.   \n\n**Stalls and weight loss**\n\nI stalled around 2-3 weeks, just like everyone else. I dropped roughly a pound a day post surgery. Not only did I stall, I put on 5 pounds! I also made the all too common mistake of weighing myself nearly every day. For weeks, I'd just about lose that 5 pounds and then it would shoot up again. Here's what I did to break the stall: nothing. That's right, I did nothing and it broke right around the same time it breaks for most people. Everyone has suggestions, and that's fine. They think what they changes caused the stall to break. To me, those are correlations and nothing more. My stall happened for many of the same reasons it happens to others: I started soft foods, so my body began holding on to more water weight, my body was healing, and my body was getting use to the caloric deficit. The difference between me and others, and why I gained more weight, was my sodium content. I've been taking in too much sodium, from hot sauce and from other areas. What's more, despite all of my meals  being centered around protein, I was likely taking in slight more carbs than the recommended 30g or less. Ultimately, my body started to bring water back in around my liver and elsewhere, while I continued to lose fat in areas around my body. I was still appearing small, though the scale said otherwise. One day, it broke past the 5 pounds and then some. I had a new lowest weight. I continue not weighing myself daily and stuck to once a week or less. \n\nI have lost 36 pounds since surgery according to my last weigh in, and that was 6-weeks out. I believe this is an accurate reflection of actual weight/fat loss. One thing I didn't want to do was the keto diet. I had done that before and had bad impacts to health. I also disliked that fat that I would down to a weight and the clothes I could wear at that weight before didn't fit me at all. Being at the weight I am now plenty of times, I can say the scale is about right. At the same time, I am following the guidelines to the best I can. I want to limit carbs and fat. I want most of my meals to come from protein. I am just unconcerned with being dogmatic about a keto level of carbs. If they are good carbs, I am happy with going over 30. \n\n**Pooping**\n\nThat brings me to pooping. Sorry, there's no way to be sensitive about this issue and it's all something we will have to reckon with going into this procedure. Keto was the second to last diet I tried. I stopped keto because at the end, I had the worst constipation of my life. I was near fecal impaction levels and my wife was preparing an enema (God bless her). Luckily, after bottles of magnesium citrate, days later, and intense pain (I'll leave the rest out), I was able to avoid entering a dynamic in our relationship I hoped to avoid. This caused a lasting problem; my digestion never improved. For years later, I have had constipation. Magnesium citrate is always on hand, and there has been a few more discussions on an enema. I bailed out of an appointment with a colorectal surgeon. I regularly look Miralax, weekly, and a double dose. \n\nAfter so many posts on here and regular mentions of miralax from the surgeons office, I had a real fear of what lay ahead. I had no idea if I'd be scheduling weekly enemas with my wife despite Miralax daily, or if I'd have to finally take that appointment with the colorectal surgeon. \n\nThe opposite has happened. I haven't had a regular bowel movement yet. I've had nothing but explosive diarrhea. Still, like after keto, I go days without a bowel movement since I started soft foods. It worried me the first few times, so I took Miralax. That was a mistake. it was even more explosive. Now, I just wait it out. I contribute the difference partly to actually drinking enough water.\n\n**Vitamins and medication**\n\nAnother thing that may help is my nightly *magnesium glycinate*. This is not something listed on the bariatric guides. I took it before surgery and it kind of helped, but most of the time couldn't help enough. I take it for sleep. I wondered if I could take it after surgery. I did some research and there were studies that suggested VSG patients benefited from regularly taking magnesium supplements. Magnesium glycinate is more effective in terms of absorption than the regular magnesium you buy at the store. \n\nI take *Flintstones Complete* chewables. I started with the big prenatals prescribed by the surgeons office. They were very nasty. One day, my body noped out and I coughed it up even though it was half way down my esophagus. I called up the dieticians and asked about Flintstones. She said that was fine as long as they are the complete and you take two. The major concern here is iron. The Flintstones are a different formula than the ones from out childhood, but they are not bad. I enjoy them. It's a major upgrade over the prenatals.\n\nI was original prescribed *cholecalciferol* once a week at my two week visit. This is basically vitamin D3 and calcium. Oddly enough, they are also having me take calcium citrate with vitamin D3 3x a day.\n\n*Bariatric Fusion Calcium Citrate 500mg* fruit punch chewables is what I chose. I am probably not saving money over Bariatric Advantage, spending $25.99 for 60, but it felt like less of a gut punch than dropping about $50 on a package of Bariatric Advantage. They taste like a starburst if starburst wasn't as good. They're not bad and moderately enjoyable. \n\nI take *Ursodiol* once a day for 60 days (I think). This is to help prevent me from developing gallstones, which we are at a greater risk for. \n\nI take *Pepcid* for 90 days to prevent the post op heart burn. \n\nI was prescribed *Zofran* for nausea after surgery. I take this as needed\n\nI was sent home with *Hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Norco)*. I believe I was given 21 or less, for a 7 day supply. I mostly saved it for night time so I could sleep with less pain\n\nI take 40mg of *Linisopril* once a day for blood pressure. I hope to get off of this as weight comes off. \n\nI take 20mg of *Rosuvastatin* once a day for cholesterol. I, also, hope to get off of this. \n\nI take 500mg of *Metformin* for type 2 diabetes. Same as the above two.\n\n**Sleep**\n\nSleep was rough in the hospital. The first night, I woke up every hour or so in a lot of pain and was put to sleep with pain meds, rinse and repeat. When I got home, I slept propped up, for fear of bad acid reflux, and I'd still get some acid reflux. I am a side sleeper, so this wasn't fun. I eventually got the acid reflux under control enough where I could sleep flat, and that improved sleep. By two weekish, I was able to sleep on my side again without a lot of fear, and things got back to my baseline. My baseline is disrupted by working third shift and swinging back to first to watch my daughter every week. So it goes. \n\n-------------------------------------\n\nWell, that's it. Finally. I can't think of anything to include. Feel free to ask anything. I've benefited from asking question on this sub and going through new and old posts to find out what to expect. If I can pay it forward in any way, that would make me happy!",

After basic brainstorming and research on what could be causing the issue, I told my doctor I was taking Herbalife protein powder. Sure enough, she quickly found information about Herbalife supplements potentially causing liver damage and recommended I stop taking them immediately. I followed these instructions, and two months later, a follow-up blood test was conducted. Sure enough, my enzymes returned to normal levels.\n\nThe messed-up part was I only knew this was happening once the blood test revealed it. So let this be yet again another cautionary tale: be careful what you put into your body.\n\nNow, I have only ever tried Herbalife's protein powder.

I'm sure many of you take multivitamins, and you probably do it to avoid deficiencies and to fill the gaps in your diet. Before I begin, **I want to stress that this review deals specifically with multivitamins, not supplements in general. Please scroll down for a summary of the findings.**\n\n-----------------------\n\nSo what are **typical deficiencies** in the American population? Women are at greater risk for [iron and vitamin A deficiency](https://labdoor.com/article/nutritional-deficiencies-women-are-at-risk-for), especially if they are [pregnant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7283965). Vegans & vegetarians [may become b12 deficient](http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/20030618/vegetarian-diet-b12-deficiency). Black skinned people are at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency because the [\"melanin in the skin diminishes the ability to synthesize Vitamin D from the sun\"](https://labdoor.com/article/nutritional-deficiencies-women-are-at-risk-for). The elderly usually experience a decline in the gut absorption of micronutrients: [\"The age-related decline in the capacity to absorb calcium [56] appears due to a gut-resistance to the action of 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3 resulting from a loss of vitamin D receptors in the duodenal mucosa [57]\"](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/13800505_Nutritional_needs_of_seniors). The elderly may be at risk for vitamin b6, b12, d and calcium deficiency. \n\nThe American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's nutrition reports (CDC.gov) is [\"a series of publications that provide ongoing assessment of the U.S. population's nutrition status by measuring blood and urine concentrations of biochemical indicators\"](http://www.cdc.gov/nutritionreport/). \n\nThey found that between 2003 and 2006:\n\n> [\"Of all the nutrients listed, **the most people had vitamin B6, iron, and vitamin D deficiencies**, and the fewest people had  vitamin A, vitamin E, and  folate deficiencies.\" [...] \"However, for most nutrition indicators, deficiencies varied by age, gender, or race/ethnicity and could be as high as nearly one third of certain population groups.\"](http://www.cdc.gov/nutritionreport/pdf/4Page_%202nd%20Nutrition%20Report_508_032912.pdf). \n\nThis should give you a general idea of what you might be deficient in. The best way to be 100% sure of your micronutrient levels, is getting a blood test.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis brings us to **RDA**. Every country gives recommendations for micronutrient intakes. These RDAs are divided into age groups, and are designed for the general population. The problem here is that athletes usually have higher requirements for minerals (as well as fluids and macronutrients - but that is beyond the scope of this RR). Furthermore, the RDAs are usually enough to avoid deficiency, but being non-deficient is not the same as having optimal micronutrient levels, and this is especially true for athletes.\n\n> [\"For active individuals **a marginal deficiency in the nutrients may impact the body's ability to repair itself, operate efficiently and fight disease**, said Melinda Manore, researcher in the Colleges of Agricultural and Health and Human Sciences.\" [...] \"The stress on the body's energy producing pathways during exercise, the changes in the body's tissues resulting from training, an increase in the loss of nutrients in sweat, urine and feces during and after strenuous activity and the additional nutrients needed to repair and maintain higher levels of lean tissue mass present in some athletes and individuals may all affect an individual’s B-vitamin requirements, said Manore\"](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/56869.php)\n\nLarry Kenney from Pennsylvania State University states: \n\n> [\"The 2004 recommendations on water and sodium intake from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences are targeted primarily at sedentary Americans. **These guidelines for water and salt intake should not be applied to athletes**. Athletes who follow the IOM recommendations to the letter may actually put themselves at risk for unintended decreases in performance or even untoward health consequences.\"](http://www.gssiweb.org/Article/sse-92-dietary-water-and-sodium-requirements-for-active-adults)\n\nWeightlifting athletes may be particularly prone to the negative effects of vitamin D deficiency, because calcium requires vitamin D for optimal absorption. If absorption of calcium is hindered: \n\n> [\"Low vitamin D increases bone turnover, which increases the risk for a bone injury, like a stress fracture.\" [...] \"vitamin D [...] also aids in regulation of electrolyte metabolism, protein synthesis, gene expression, and immune function [10,28]. These vital functions are essential for all individuals, especially the elite and recreational athlete.\"] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3725481/)\n\nAn athlete may decide to supplement vitamin D. Unknowingly, he purchases D2: [\"Vitamin D3 increases the total 25(OH)D concentration [...] Vitamin D2 supplementation was associated with a decrease in 25(OH)D3,\"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256423512_Bioavailability_of_Vitamin_D-2_and_D-3_in_Healthy_Volunteers_a_Randomized_Placebo-Controlled_Trial)\n\nThis goes to show that there are **different forms of micronutrients**. These forms have different bioavailabilities and effects on the body. For example, magnesium oxide is maybe the most commonly supplemented form of magnesium. The problem is that [\"magnesium oxide may have an absorbable magnesium potency as low as 4%. 7 8\"](http://www.ancient-minerals.com/magnesium-sources/absorption/). I could write for days about micronutrient forms and bioavailability, but to keep it succinct: [multivitamins are usually filled with the cheapest and worst forms of vitamins and minerals](http://examine.com/insiders/multivitamins). If you want to learn more about magnesium check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3ixxkw/dietary_magnesium_is_positively_associated_with/cukru3k). To get more information about bioavailability check [this out] (http://nutrition.ansci.illinois.edu/sites/default/files/Chiba_ch15.pdf)\n\n--------------------------\n\nThis brings us to the concept of **antinutrients**: \n\n> [\"Antinutrients in foods are responsible for deleterious effects related to the absorption of nutrients and micronutrients. However, some antinutrients may exert beneficial health effects at low concentrations.\"](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/bk-1997-0662.ch001). \n\nA very potent antinutrient is **phytic acid**. It is usually found in large concentrations in seeds, nuts, grains, legumes. [\"phytic acid [has the] ability to bind to essential minerals such as iron, zinc, calcium, and magnesium in the digestive tract and inhibit their absorption by the body.1,2\"](http://breakingmuscle.com/nutrition/dissecting-anti-nutrients-the-good-and-bad-of-phytic-acid). A consequence of this is that if a person is consuming a meal rich in phytic acid along with his daily multi, the minerals in the multi may be rendered less useful. The good news is that [vitamin C partly counteracts the negative effects of phytic acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/3ov6ai/if_phytic_acid_is_an_antinutrient_should_we_be/cw1ojey)\n\n[More info on phytic acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/3ov6ai/if_phytic_acid_is_an_antinutrient_should_we_be/cw1r059)\n\n---------------------------------\n\nThere are other factors that limit micronutrient absorption. These factors are the interactions between the nutrients, called **vitamin and mineral antagonism and synergy** [1] (http://www.traceelements.com/Docs/Nutrient%20Interrelationships-Minerals-Vitamins-Endocrines.pdf) [2](http://www.return2health.net/articles/vitamin-mineral-antagonists/). Micros that have synergy, enhance each other’s uptake (i.e. Vit D enhances calcium uptake, Vitamin C enhances iron uptake). There is also antagonism, [whereby micros inhibit absorption of other micros](https://labdoor.com/article/nutrient-nutrient-interaction-in-multivitamin-supplements). For example [calcium interferes with iron absorption, zinc uptake is hindered by minerals such as cal, mag, iron, because they share a transporter](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/3hssrs/calciums_effect_on_ironzinc_absorption_and_what/cuafwt6). \n\n**The takeaway here is that if you fill a multivitamin with micro antagonists, they will compete for absorption and hinder uptake levels.**\n\n---------------------------------\n\nThe last part of the introduction deals with what I call the size paradox of multivitamins. Simply put, [it is impossible to squeeze (common values) 400mg of magnesium, 600mg of calcium, 14mg iron, 10mg zinc, 500iu vitamin d, 500mg vitamin c, all the b vitamins, trace minerals, etc. into a small tablet](http://examine.com/insiders/multivitamins)). I have a bottle of Magnesium citrate 100mg tablets, and each tablet is twice the size of my multi. \n\n> [\"**12 multivitamins provided less vitamin A, vitamin C, or folate, or than claimed, some with less than 30% of the listed amounts**. These include a prenatal vitamin and products for men, adults (general), seniors, and even pets.\"](https://www.consumerlab.com/reviews/multivitamin_review_comparisons/multivitamins/)\n\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**Summary of introduction**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n- Common micronutrient deficiencies are: Vitamin D, iron, B6. Deficiency prevalence is population based (age, sex, skin color, lifestyle)\n- Multivitamins are usually filled with the cheapest and worst forms of vitamins and minerals\n- Reaching RDAs may prevent deficiency, but may not necessarily give you optimal levels\n- Athletes need more micros than sedentary individuals\n- Antinutrients and micronutrient antagonism severely hinder the absorption rates and bioavailability of MVs\n- The minerals and vitamins found in MVs won't physically fit into a neat little pill\n- Companies may lie on the contents label (goes for all supplements)\n\n**Summary of the meta-analysis** (scroll down to see the studies)\n-----------------------------------------\n\n- Antioxidants such as vitamin C and E may help fight cancer (but they could also hinder athletic performance improvements)\n- Most research is done on the elderly\n- There is no clear consensus because of contradictory evidence. However, **the majority of the evidence points towards no effect**\n- Smokers may want to avoid MVs (especially ß-carotene)\n- High doses of fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A can be dangerous. Always check the bottle contents!\n\n**Final thoughts**\n-----------------------------------------\n**Research does not support the hypothesis that MVs give health benefits. This does not mean that targeted or isolated supplementation is useless!** For example, vitamin D3 supplementation has been shown to increase hormonal levels of vitamin D. You should probably figure out what you're deficient in and do targeted supplementation instead of buying a MV that probably won't do much for your health.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nPart II - **Studies**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nBefore looking at the studies, we must identify the possible sampling biases of multivitamin research. It is possible that people who take multivitamins do so as a way to self-medicate, because they feel unhealthy or know they have unhealthy lifestyles. It could also be the effect of marketing. In most of the studies I reviewed, the participants were aged 50+. This is an issue because they do not represent the entire population. Lastly, studies usually rely on self-reported questionnaires. The risk here is that people lie or modify the truth.\n\nI've tried to represent both sides of the debate as fairly as possible. I excluded studies with few participants, unclear methods, obvious spelling errors in the abstract (...), paid research (supplement marketing), very short trials, or generally poor design.\n\n[Example of excluded study with spelling errors, short trial, and likely paid]\n(http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/823/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00213-011-2481-3.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00213-011-2481-3&token2=exp=1447593072~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F823%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs00213-011-2481-3.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs00213-011-2481-3*~hmac=8196190f7a982c858dd95c955172ac80d284ff19ceb335859c4f9516a9be5104)\n\n[Example of excluded study because of purely self-reported statistics]\n(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16081445)\n\n\n[Example of excluded study because low N and (relatively) short trial]\n (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743504005778)\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Studies with evidence supporting multivitamin health benefits**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n**[Multivitamin Use and Risk of Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease in the Women's Health Initiative Cohorts](https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=414784)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2009\n-\tTime period: 1993-2005\n-\tParticipants: 161 808\n-\tAge: 50 to 79\n-\tInclusion criteria: postmenopausal women\n-\tExclusion criteria: alcoholism, drug dependency, dementia.\n\n> A total of 41.5% of the participants used multivitamins.\n\n**How they documented:**\n\n> Dietary supplement data were collected during in-person clinic visits.

We included fair- and good-quality randomized, controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness or safety of supplements in the primary prevention of CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality in the general adult population without a history of CVD or cancer. We included fair- and good-quality secondary prevention trials if they hypothesized effects on outcomes included in this review and not present at baseline in the study (for example, a trial of secondary skin cancer prevention that also reported on other cancers). We included only studies that were conducted among community-dwelling, nutrient-sufficient adults who had no chronic disease and were performed in countries with a Human Development Index of “very high” (11). We also required supplement doses to be lower than the upper tolerable limit set by the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board (12)\n\n**What they documented:**\n\n> We specifically sought studies of the following vitamins and minerals: vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C, D, and E; calcium; iron; zinc; magnesium; niacin; folic acid; ß-carotene; and selenium. We included studies that evaluated single, paired, and combinations of 3 or more vitamins and minerals; we use the term “multivitamin” to refer to those combinations.\n\n> We screened 12 766 abstracts, reviewed 277 full-text articles, and included 103 articles (26 studies) (Appendix Figure 2 of the Supplement). Four trials (19–22) and 1 cohort study (23) examined the benefits and harms of multivitamin supplementation (Supplement). Twenty-two trials and 2 cohort studies examined the benefits and harms of individual or paired supplements (Supplement): 6 studies of ß-carotene (24–29), 6 studies of vitamin E (22, 24, 30–33), 3 studies of selenium (33–35), 5 studies of vitamin A (23, 29, 36–38), 2 studies of vitamin C (30–31), 1 study of folic acid (39), 3 studies of vitamin D (40–42), 2 studies of vitamin D in combination with calcium (43–44), and 4 studies of calcium (40, 43, 45–46). The study sizes ranged from 128 to 72 337 individuals with average ages ranging from 22 to 77 years, although in most studies the mean age was older than 50 years (Supplement). Six studies were conducted among women only, 5 were conducted among men only, and the remaining studies were in mixed populations (24.2% to 84.7% women). The effects of the supplements were examined between 6 months and 16 years; most studies provided less than a decade of follow-up. \n\n\n**What they found:** \n> This review included 26 studies (24 randomized, controlled trials and 2 cohort studies) that examined the benefits and harms of using vitamin and mineral supplements for primary prevention of CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality in healthy individuals without known nutritional deficiencies. **We found no consistent evidence that the included supplements affected CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality in healthy individuals without known nutritional deficiencies.** Other systematic reviews have arrived at this same conclusion (56–66). The certainty of this result is tempered, however, because few fair- or good-quality studies are available for all supplements except vitamin E and ß-carotene. For vitamin E, we identified 6 fair- to good-quality trials that produced clearly null effects on these end points. This result is consistent with the conclusions of other systematic reviews and meta-analyses of vitamin E (67–71). **Our review also confirmed the established harm of ß-carotene supplementation on lung cancer incidence and death for individuals at high risk for lung cancer (24, 29, 72)**. Further, we identified 6 trials that failed to detect any benefit from ß-carotene supplementation for any individuals.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n**[Dietary Supplements and Mortality Rate in Older Women](https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1105975)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2011\n-\tTime period: 1986-2008\n-\tParticipants: 38 772 \n-\tAge: Mean age: 61,6\n-\tInclusion criteria: Female\n-\tExclusion criteria: \"[...] excluding from all analyses those who did not adequately complete a questionnaire including food frequency and supplement use at baseline in 1986\"\n\n> Of these women, 99.2% were white and 98.6% were postmenopausal\n\n**How they documented:**\n\n> Food intake was assessed at baseline and in the 2004 follow-up, using 2 nearly identical versions of the validated 127-food item Harvard Service Food Frequency Questionnaire.\n\n> Supplement use was queried in 1986, 1997, and 2004 and included the 15 supplements assessed at all 3 surveys: multivitamins; vitamins A, beta-carotene, B6, folic acid, B complex, C, D, and E; and minerals iron, calcium, copper, magnesium, selenium, and zinc.

Of particular concern, supplemental iron was strongly and dose dependently associated with increased total mortality risk. Also, the association was consistent across shorter intervals, strengthened with multiple use reports and with increasing age at reported use.

This message is especially true for the general population with no clear evidence of micronutrient deficiencies, who represent most supplement users in the United States and in other countries (9).\n\n> **In conclusion, ß-carotene, vitamin E, and possibly high doses of vitamin A supplements are harmful.** Other antioxidants, folic acid and B vitamins, and multivitamin and mineral supplements are ineffective for preventing mortality or morbidity due to major chronic diseases. Although available evidence does not rule out small benefits or harms or large benefits or harms in a small subgroup of the population, we believe that the case is closed— supplementing the diet of well-nourished adults with (most) mineral or vitamin supplements has no clear benefit and might even be harmful. These vitamins should not be used for chronic disease prevention. Enough is enough.\n\n**Limitations:**\nAuthors seem emotionally invested in the outcome of the debate.

A sample of multivitamins was evaluated for their beta-carotene content and the suggested daily dosage.\n\n**What they documented:**\nBeta-carotene's possible interaction with lung cancer in smokers\n\n**What they found:**\n\n> Four studies contributing 109,394 subjects were available for analysis. The average daily beta-carotene dosage in these trials ranged from 20 to 30 mg daily. Among current smokers, beta-carotene supplementation was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.10–1.39). Among former smokers, there was no significant increase noted (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.84–1.45). In a sample of 47 common multivitamins, beta-carotene was present in 70% of the identified formulas. The median dosage of beta-carotene was 0.3 mg (range, 0–17.2 mg) daily. The beta-carotene content was found to be significantly higher among multivitamins sold to improve visual health than among other multivitamins, with a median daily dosage of 3 mg (range, 0–24 mg).\n\n-------------------------\n\n\n\n\n**Studies with mixed findings or no effect**\n-------------------------\n\n**[Vitamin/mineral supplementation and cancer, cardiovascular, and all-cause mortality in a German prospective cohort](http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/717/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00394-011-0224-1.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00394-011-0224-1&token2=exp=1447594502~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F717%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs00394-011-0224-1.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs00394-011-0224-1*~hmac=8d15d3c2ee1a9bb806f4f0cdf9ae79b9ba0ece8d1e7532a7285550dcd69f796c)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2012\n-\tTime period: 1994-2006 (11 year average followup)\n-\tParticipants: 23 943\n-\tAge: 35-64\n-\tInclusion criteria: male and female\n-\tExclusion criteria: cancer, myocardial infarction/stroke\n\n**How they documented:**\n> In  the  EPIC-Heidelberg  cohort,  vitamin/mineral  supplementation  was  assessed   at  different time  points.

At the request of an American Cancer Society volunteer, each enrollee completed a four-page mailed questionnaire in 1982 that requested information on history of cancer and other diseases, use of medicines and vitamins, use of alcohol and tobacco, diet, as well as other factors potentially affecting mortality. This analysis includes 1,063,023 people (453,962 men; 609,061 women) who, at enrollment, reported usable data on vitamin use.\n\n**How they documented:**\n\n> [...] each enrollee completed a four-page mailed questionnaire in 1982 that requested information on history of cancer and other diseases, use of medicines and vitamins, use of alcohol and tobacco, diet, as well as other factors potentially affecting mortality. \n\n**What they documented:**\n\n> [...] we classified deaths due to ischemic heart disease (ICD-9 codes 410–414), cerebrovascular disease (stroke) (ICD-9 codes 430–438), and all cancers combined, except nonmelanoma skin cancer (ICD-9 codes 140–195 and 199–209). We examined separately the three most common causes of cancer mortality: lung (ICD-9 code 162), colo-rectal (ICD-9 codes 153–154), and (for men) prostate (ICD-9 code 185) and (for women) breast (ICD-9 code 174), and all other cancers combined. All-cause mortality included persons who died of any cause.\n\n**What they found:**\n\n> **This large prospective study provides limited support for the hypothesis that multivitamin supplements may reduce death rates from ischemic heart disease in the general population**. Men and women who took a multivitamin without other supplements had lower death rates from ischemic heart disease than did those who took no multivitamins. However, the association was attenuated when analyses were adjusted for additional cardiovascular risk factors besides age, and no consistent gradient of decreasing risk was seen with either the frequency or the duration of multivitamin use. \n\n> **Men and women who used both multivitamins and vitamin A, C, or E had lower risks of dying from heart disease and stroke than did nonusers than one might expect from the relative risks for users of either only a multivitamin or only a vitamin A, C, or E supplement.** \n\n\n\n-----------------------------\n\n**[Multivitamin use and the risk of mortality and cancer incidence: the multiethnic cohort study] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3105257/)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2011\n-\tTime period: 1993-2005 (11 year average follow-up)\n-\tParticipants: 182 099 \n-\tAge: 45-75\n-\tInclusion criteria: Living in Hawaii and California, ethnic group\n-\tExclusion criteria: \"we excluded participants who were not in one of the targeted 5 ethnic groups (n = 13,991) or who reported invalid dietary intakes based on total energy intake or its components (n = 8,264) (12).

Subjects were asked to indicate whether they had used any of these supplements at least weekly during the previous year.\n\n> In a follow-up questionnaire approximately 5 years after baseline (1999–2003), participants were asked the same question on multivitamin use but without duration of use. \n\n**What they documented:**\n\n> During an average 11 years of follow-up, we identified 28,851 deaths (15,962 men and 12,889 women). Death from all causes was the primary endpoint in the analyses. In addition, according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10), we categorized the primary cause of death into cardiovascular diseases (ICD-9 codes 390–434, 436–448; ICD-10 codes I00–I78), cancer (ICD-9 codes 140–208; ICD-10 codes C00–C97), and all other causes.\n\n**What they found:**\n\n> In this large multiethnic cohort, we found no associations between multivitamin use and mortality from all causes, cardiovascular diseases, or cancer. The findings did not vary across subgroups by ethnicity, age, body mass index, preexisting illness, single vitamin/mineral supplement use, hormone replacement therapy use, and smoking status. In addition, there was no evidence indicating that multivitamin use increased or decreased risk for cancer, overall or at major sites, such as lung, colorectum, prostate, and breast.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n> Multivitamin users are generally more health conscious than are nonusers (1, 36), which could confound the relation of multivitamin use with morbidity or mortality. Although we adjusted for well-known potential confounders including health-related behaviors such as smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity (37), there may still be uncontrolled bias. In particular, we were unable to adjust for changes in potential confounders over time. The longest duration category for multivitamin use in our baseline questionnaire was 5 years and longer, although the effects of multivitamins on longevity and disease might take a longer period.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**Please find the rest of the review in the comments**\n------------------------------\n",

        "body": "In short, no, this isn’t true. The consensus is that meat has been a crucial part of human diets for much of our history as a genus, and we may have a number of adaptations to eating it (which could include our short digestive systems and high stomach pH; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajpa.24247). However, few modern populations approach 90% meat consumption, because we have a physiological limit of how much meat protein we can eat, usually around 40% of dietary calories (except in the arctic, where plants are scarce, and Inuit populations have physiological adaptations to go beyond this “protein ceiling”; https://www.direct-ms.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/E10965-Cordain.pdf). We can eat more meat if it’s fatty, but that’s not always possible.\n\nMeat is also an incredibly unpredictable thing to get ahold of, even with the sophisticated technologies held by many modern human hunter-gatherer groups. Some studies suggest that the success rate for hunting large game is as low as 1 in 30 hunter days (although it is higher for small game; https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.1991.0113). And even then, it is not consistently available throughout the year. In Eastern Africa, most fossil sites have a climate in which there are distinct dry and wet seasons each year. However, animals only strongly cluster in the second half of the dry season, meaning ambush hunting is difficult until this part of the year. It is also in this part of the year that animals are most likely to die naturally due to dehydration/malnutrition, so scavenging is also biased towards this part of the year (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mam.12005). This means that meat is unlikely to have been part of the diet in consistent amounts throughout the year over our evolutionary history, with plants making up a much more important contribution during the wet seasons (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248421001226). This would have especially focused on things like tubers, honey, nuts, fruits and berries, or insects, all of which modern human groups eat today.\n\nMany use-wear studies confirm that stone tools were being used for plant processing as frequently as meat processing throughout the last 3 million years (E.g. https://www.nature.com/articles/293464a0). And the calculus studies mentioned by the person who sent the information to you, have a diversity of plant traces that go well beyond 10% of the diet (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004724841730235X).\n\nTL;DR: Throughout our evolutionary history, humans have been eating a lot of meat but also a hell of a lot of plants. This is why plants are required for any healthy diet today.",

        "body": "A key feature of human evolution was a shift in our dietary niche wherein we became specialized in acquiring skill-intensive and high value food items. We can understand high value in terms of optimal foraging theory as expected caloric acquisition rate per unit time given encountering possible food items. So animal species that provide a certain benefit that outweighs the opportunity cost of pursuing it rather than something else (and associated risk) are considered part of the optimal diet breadth in an ecology.\n\nHunted game and meat consumption was an important aspect of human evolution but I’m interested in what research they are citing their statistics from. I don’t doubt that the 90% - 10% stat was found somewhere but i suspect it’s cherry picked data. I can’t recall the exact citation but there are estimates of % of meat in the diet from various small-scale subsistence contexts studied ethnographically. I recall there being some moderate variability across groups on this metric? I’ll have to double check. This kind of cross-cultural ethnographic studies in conjunction with paleo ecology and bio archaeology studies (not just what I suspect is a cherry picked stat) should enhance our understanding of the topic.\n\nThis person is overlooking the importance of controlling and utilizing fire in food preparation in human evolution. Otherwise inedible foods become more easily digestible once they are cooked so their evoking human dietary physiology in that way isn’t really convincing.\n\nThey are also overlooking other food items that are high-value foraged resources like insects (tons of protein and fat) and marine resources (fish & mollusks). In fact honey is the most highly prized food resource that can be acquired by foraging by subsistence populations in ecologies where it can be found. This is because the reward of honey and insect larvae is so calorically dense and high-value.\n\nWhat was the context of this person’s comment to you if you don’t mind me asking?",

This is my (longwinded) theory regarding a possible cause and cure for androgenetic alopecia. I’m by no means claiming to be a scientist and I apologise in advance for how wordy this post is. Citations are at the bottom.\n\nI’ve been researching androgenetic alopecia (AGA) considerably for a few years now ever since I first noticed its effect on myself. Like many, I pussy-footed around the reality of the situation, convincing myself that the higher hairline and thinning crown was stress-related Telogen Efflivium, some basic dietary deficiency or the result of too much booze and smokes. This meant that I delayed treatment with more conventional (and proven) methods for a little longer than I probably should have.\n\nMy apprehension to begin these treatments was by enlarge because of how unsatisfied I was with the widely-accepted ‘cause’ of hair loss: that, not everybody (for some reason), but a large group (for some reason) of unlucky fellows and some women develop a bizarre, localized sensitivity (for some reason) to an androgen that their own body produces naturally and that (for some reason) this hormone ‘attacks’ tens of thousands of tiny organs on a specific part of their head (… for some reason). I thought the logic was dumb and that that kind of thinking did not a cure make.\n\nNow, the human body is by no means a perfect machine, but it didn’t sit well with me that certain genomes would evolve something as complicated and energy-consuming as hair growth only to have it inadvertently switched off by a naturally-occurring androgen. There were also other evidences that it wasn’t just a matter of androgen activity: how often people with AGA do not display more testosterone (or its more active metabolite dihydrotestosterone [DHT]) than people unaffected; that simply blocking DHT production does not regrow hair in all people; where and the pattern in which the hair is lost (and isn’t); and lastly, the irrefutable links AGA has to issues elsewhere in the body such as heart and prostate health.\n\nSo I dug deeper into other theories a little more substantial than “DHT BAD” – ideally to find one that gave some insight into the process of hair loss being something the body decides to do rather than something it has done unto it. I read through almost every major theory on the web: tension in the galea; reduced brown adipose tissue; mast cell activation, histamine or prostaglandin imbalance etc. None of them seemed outrageous, but none of them gave much reason for AGA other than some people simply lose the genetic lottery. Eventually I stumbled upon something I did like: the phenomenon of seasonal hair growth [1]. Put simply, the idea is that the scalp is like a UV-ray sponge for the body to use to produce vitamin D, and the amount of hair on the scalp can be considered a valve that closes (grows) to reduce UV exposure, or opens (sheds) to increase it.\n\nThis theory (and the various studies relating to it) appeased me because they suggested that an intentional and strategic biological hair loss mechanism exist in every human, regardless of whether they suffer from more permanent types of alopecia. It was comforting to know that even the thickest head of hair technically undergoes ‘hair loss’ for a large portion of the year. My thinking then became that some of us must get stuck in a sort of ‘perpetual winter’ state where the valve gets stuck open.\n\nI was obviously nowhere near the first person to theorise that vitamin D played a major role in alopecia (as a quick Google search would tell you), but the cure seemed simple: if the body has a mechanism to keep itself in a desired range of circulating cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), then oral supplementation – which has been proven to increase serum cholecalciferol [2] – might make the body think it’s getting enough sun exposure to close the valve and regrow hair for good. However, a quick skim of numerous Reddit and hair loss forum discussions quickly shoot down that idea, with many members reporting no major (although some minor) improvements from vitamin D3 supplementation alone, with bloodwork confirming they are not deficient. So it would appear we’re back to square one and pointing the finger angrily at DHT again.\n\nHowever, cholecalciferol in and of itself is largely useless when it comes to hair. What is important is the vitamin D Receptor (VDR). The VDR is a nuclear receptor found in almost every cell in the body – including scalp hair follicles – and plays a direct role in the cellular proliferation, function and health of hair growth [3]. To make it clear, a follicle with more activated VDR will produce thicker hair faster than a follicle with less VDR activation.\n\nThe issue with the simplicity of my initial thinking was that cholecalciferol cannot adequately activate the VDR by itself. It must first undergo conversion to calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) in the liver, and then undergo another conversion in the kidneys to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, also known as calcitriol. Calcitriol can activate the VDR and actually has such a high affinity (roughly 1000 times greater than cholecalciferol) for doing so that the VDR is sometimes referred to as the ‘calcitriol receptor’ in medical literature.\n\nWhere it gets confusing (and more than a little frustrating), is that you can have more than one blood vitamin D value that may not correlate to the other. Most doctors will test for ‘25 OH vitamin D’, also known as 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or calcifediol, as mentioned earlier. This value is good for testing for deficiency, but is more or less useless in relation to VDR activation as calcifediol cannot activate the receptor well either. Doctors can test for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), but this will not give an insight into the body’s stores of the fat-soluble vitamin. In fact, blood calcitriol can actually spike if there is a deficiency of stored calcifediol, which further complicates the results [4].\n\nDeciphering this means, basically, that your common bloodwork for vitamin D can come back with healthy (or even above-ideal) numbers of stored, inactive D3, but shed zero light on the circulating calcitriol metabolite that can activate the VDR. It’s also been established that the ratio at which calcitriol is converted from calcifediol (the 1,25D:25D) can vary substantially from person to person: “the ratio between calcitriol and calcifediol serum concentrations could suggest vitamin D hydroxylation efficiency.” [5]. Hydroxylation is “a chemical process that introduces a hydroxyl group (-OH) into an organic compound. In biochemistry, hydroxylation reactions are often facilitated by enzymes called hydroxylases.” [6]. What this means is that hydroxylation is what makes regular vitamin D (from sun exposure or a supplementation) able to activate the VDR and grow hair, and that it’s possible that a lowered natural capacity for vitamin D hydroxylation could result in less circulating calcitriol and thus lower systemic VDR activation.\n\nWhile I couldn’t find any studies alluding to what the 1,25D:25D ratio might have been in our forefathers, it is not hard to find studies referencing vitamin D’s hydroxylation cofactors – the primary one of which being magnesium, an element that a huge proportion of the population are deficient in and one stripped from the body by modern diet and lifestyle [7]. On top of magnesium being necessary to produce calcitriol (and thus directly implicated in VDR activation), it’s also been shown that inadequate magnesium levels lead to calcification of soft tissues and that adequate levels protect against it [8]. Interestingly, and as we probably all know by now, biopsies of bald scalps have shown considerable calcification in their soft tissues compared to non-balding scalps. More interestingly, is that the negative effects of low magnesium can also be seen in the heart and prostate (in hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia) – and that these are the organs and conditions that the only two FDA-approved medications for hair loss (minoxidil and finasteride) were originally designed to alleviate.\n\nSo, all I’ve really talked about thus far is the VDR. The glaring hole in the theory is that the internet has seen a plethora of success stories from people taking anti-androgens and minoxidil (among others that I probably won’t get into). “Hey, idiot, if the VDR is solely responsible for hair cycling, then why do these drugs that don’t have any direct action on the VDR work for so many people?” you might ask, and it’d be a damn good question. I stalled on this part of my theory for a long time but I’m glad I did, because I think this is where mine differs from others, so here it is, in a nutshell…\n\nI believe AGA is the result of a bad ratio of VDR to androgen receptor (AR) activation and density within the body.\n\nThere seems to me to be four primary and irrefutable facts that science has concluded regarding these receptors and their relation to hair growth and AGA:\n\n· One: activating the AR in a hair follicle (like DHT can) causes a decrease of the anagen (growth) phase and eventually a complete miniaturisation of the follicle. [9]\n\n· Two: activating the VDR in a hair follicle (like calcitriol can) causes an increase of the angagen phase which produces a thicker, faster-growing hair. [3]\n\n· Three: inhibiting activation of the AR in a hair follicle (like an anti-androgen can) arrests further hair loss in most people, regrows in some but does not prevent further loss in others. [10]\n\n· Four: inhibiting activation of the VDR in a hair follicle (like low levels of calcitriol or low VDR density can) causes a decrease of the anagen phase and eventually shedding. [11]\n\nMy theory is this: I believe there exists an ideal homeostasis of VDR and AR inside every organ in the body for healthy and proper function, but most modern diets and lifestyles are throwing out this balance. It’s important to place equal significance on each of these receptors in terms of AGA. I think of the balance as a tug-of-war, with the AR wanting to turn the follicle down to zero and the VDR wanting to turn it to max. As long as the ratio of VDR:AR tilts in the VDR’s favour by even the slightest amount, you will keep your hair.\n\nThis might also allude as to why it’s exceptionally rare, but not impossible for women to develop AGA, as they have very low (but never zero) circulating androgens.\n\nTwo quite ironic cases I came across in my research show the power of each receptor in isolation. Firstly, eunuchs (boys that are castrated before puberty and don’t ever produce considerable quantities of testosterone or DHT) never lose their hair [12], and secondly, a case of a seven year old boy with hereditary vitamin D-dependent rickets type II ([VDDR-II] (a condition where the VDR is resistant to activation from calcitriol, thus experiencing almost zero activation systemically,) who suffered alopecia totalis at an age too young to have begun developing sizeable amounts of testosterone or DHT [13]. So, we have grown men who never lost a single scalp hair because of minuscule AR receptor activation, and a young boy who never grew a single scalp hair because of miniscule VDR activation.\n\nIt was all starting to make sense to me, but I still wasn’t happy with why exactly the AR – a receptor that exists naturally in the follicle – would effectively act to damage it. With further reading, I came to the conclusion that there are two primary reasons why this homeostasis is so important and why going out of it leads to almost exponential and often irreversible loss. The first of which has to do with not only the ratio of receptors themselves, but also how they interact with the other:\n\nWhile there has not been extensive research into the interplay (crosstalk) of these two receptors within hair follicles, there have been numerous studies regarding how they react in other tissues – namely the prostate. Although vastly different organs, the 5-alpha-reductase type II enzyme ([5ARII], one of three responsible for converting testosterone into DHT,) is most prevalent in scalp and prostatic tissues [14]. Finasteride has only been approved by the FDA to deal with complications in these two tissues by selectively targeting the 5ARII enzyme, suggesting there may be a similar mode of suppression in each. In studies of prostate cancer, VDR activation has been shown to suppress AR expression in certain cell lines [15] while AR activation has been shown to suppress VDR activation [16] [17].\n\nFurther to the expressional crosstalk between the two receptors, there is also the matter of up/down regulation and receptor density. Cells in the prostate and scalp possess both AR and VDR (among other receptors) in varying densities. There have been numerous studies showing that: AR can be upregulated with regular activation [18] [19]; AR can be downregulated by prolonged inactivation [20]; VDR can be upregulated (and protected) by activation [21] [22]; VDR can be downregulated by deficiency [23].\n\nFor me, this explains why there are such varying severities of hair loss amongst individuals and why anti-androgens such as finasteride work for some better than others. I believe the issue and cure is not simply reducing AR activation, but reducing it to a point where it is exceeded by VDR activation. Finasteride reduces scalp DHT by roughly 64% at a 1mg daily dosage [24]. As a very rudimentary example, say you have some hair follicles with 20 active AR but only 12 active VDR. A 1mg dose of finasteride should (in theory) reduce that number of activated AR by 64% to around 7.2, creating a surplus of VDR activation and thus regrowing hair. This is what I believe happens in follicles that respond well to anti-androgen treatment.\n\nBut say, due to VDR downregulation and AR upregulation (which often go hand-in-hand), you had follicles with 30 active AR and only 10 active VDR. That same finasteride dose will create a larger drop in AR activation than the previous example (19.2 vs 12.8), but will only bring the total activated AR down to 10.8 – still exceeding the activated VDR count and thus maintaining an environment where the VDR is under-expressed compared to the AR and hair loss continues. My theory posits a few things here: firstly, that great responders to anti-androgens do not have a major deficit in their VDR:AR to contend with; secondly, that poor responders to anti-androgens do have a major deficit in their VDR:AR that some anti-androgens are not powerful enough to correct; and thirdly, that anti-androgens such as finasteride rarely produce a complete reversal of hair loss due to differing ratios of VDR:AR across the scalp follicles, as some follicles have gone beyond the drug’s ‘saveable threshold’.\n\nFurther to this, I feel the theory also provides some explanation as to the ‘catch up hair loss’ phenomenon, whereby people who regrow hair with an anti-androgen and then end treatment often find that their hair is lost in a more severe pattern than it was pre-treatment, i.e. they lose even more hair post-treatment than they had lost before it. In these cases, I would think the healthy hair they had at the commencement of treatment might have possessed a VDR:AR of, as an example, 15:14 (which would become 15:5 on finasteride [very healthy hair]), but in the X years of treatment, while the VDR still downregulates due to inactivation, this ratio might drop to say 11:5. So the follicle produces healthy hair while on the drug but, following cessation, drops to a ratio of 11:14 and results in the hair being lost.\n\nExplaining why VDR upregulation promotes growth or why downregulation hinders it is one thing, but explaining why the AR seems to destroy hair is another entirely. My second reason why the VDR:AR homeostasis is so important has to do with what exactly the two receptors do inside the follicles, and that can be put as simply as ‘cellular metabolism’. This was the breakthrough for me: the AR and VDR play a direct role in cellular energy production. You’ve heard it a million times before: “the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell”, but its importance cannot be understated.\n\nHair growth is a process that requires energy, cellular proliferation and DNA transcription (replication), and mitochondria provide this. A by-product of any metabolic process is oxidative waste, and the health of a cell is largely dependent on the body’s capacity to bind and remove oxidative waste from it (exactly what an anti-oxidant does), and this also contributes to the health of mitochondria. This is where my theory (in my opinion) became fully-fledged: AR has been shown to reduce mitochondrial function [25], reduce their capacity to properly replicate DNA and negatively affect oxidative processes [26]. Inversely, the VDR promotes healthy mitochondria, and “in the long run, the absence of the [VDR] caused impairment of mitochondrial integrity and, finally, cell death.” [27]. So there I had it, the reason why a naturally-produced androgen and its receptor might cause hair loss.\n\nFurther to this, it also serves to reason that this might be minoxidil’s mystery mechanism, as it seems to increase mitochondrial efficiency by mediating certain pathways at a cellular level [28] [29]. What’s interesting is that “minoxidil induced Ca2+ (calcium) influx can increase stem cell differentiation and may be a key factor in the mechanism by which minoxidil facilitates hair growth.” [29], but what’s fascinating is that “the VDR signaling system is essential in overall Ca2+ homeostasis. Acute exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 increases the mean open time and plasma membrane Ca2+ permeability…” [30]. While this last excerpt refers to blood calcium, I think logic lends itself to the idea that if the VDR can activate calcium mobility throughout the body, then an activated receptor inside a hair follicle cell could mobilise calcium into its mitochondria. I also think this is why minoxidil hair is also commonly referred to as “zombie” hair, as the drug artificially activates follicular mitochondria through a similar mechanism as the VDR does, but without any upregulation of the receptors that keep it alive for a longer period.\n\nSo where does all this leave us? I’m not sure. It’s one thing to be sure that the VDR:AR is crucial for hair growth (and overall bodily health), but improving it safely (if at all) is a different matter. Vitamin D affects calcium homeostasis, and too much of it can result in hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood) and cause more problems than it ever alleviates. I think the strategy needs to be a three-pronged approach: upregulating VDR, downregulating AR – but not to a point below healthy levels, and improving mitochondrial health.\n\nI take quite a few things for hair loss, but I think these are the main heroes: I am on 1mg daily finasteride because I believe that (unless you’re treating hair loss pre-emptively) once you see any sign of hair loss, the cascade of AR upregulation, VDR downregulation and mitochondrial damage has well and truly begun. If I’m right in my theory, then this drug only needs to be taken until results are seen and stabilise. My thinking is that if you downregulate AR in the scalp back to a healthy density (that is lesser than VDR) then you could ween yourself off of it permanently – that is, assuming you could keep a good VDR:AR solely through VDR activation.\n\nI also believe anti-androgens are not drugs to be taken lightly. Results of receptor up/down regulation can take years and years to manifest – just think of the timeframe from the first day you noticed hair loss to now. This means any negative effects might be creeping in under the radar over a long period. I believe if you have both high VDR and high AR then anti-androgen drugs will probably work for you with next to zero side effects, as your DHT and AR expression won’t drop below functional levels systemically. However, if you have low AR but just happen to have even lower VDR, then I think that’s when you’ll run into problems, as a ~70% reduction in serum DHT might drop you to a dangerously low level. You don’t want to be androgen-depriving receptors in important tissues like your brain, prostate and penis/testes to the point where they downregulate severely and lose function. I also think this lends itself to the idea that much less DHT inhibition would be required for hair growth if the VDR is upregulated (resulting in much safer treatment dosages).\n\nI myself started the drug at .25mg every other day and worked up to 1mg/day after four months, going from .25mg/day, .5mg/every other day and .5mg/day. I was lucky (in a strange way) to get bad forehead acne, ridiculous increases in libido and a shed every time I increased dosage/frequency because it saved me a lot in blood work. These results would last for about two weeks and then taper off, where I would then wait another fortnight and increase the dosage again to the same effect. On 1mg/day I feel absolutely fine – as sharp, fit and virile as I’ve ever been.\n\nAccompanying the finasteride, I use a topical synthetic VDR agonist (activator) called calcipotriene. This is my main weapon for increasing localised VDR activation and upregulation in the scalp to compliment supplemental cholecalciferol and magnesium (among other cofactors). This is prescription-only (in Australia), but very tame and easy to get when I asked my doctor. It’s often used to treat psoriasis – an ailment of reduced VDR activation. I usually try to do this twice a week as it’s messy so I time it with a Nizoral shampoo (see below for why). I’m not sure whether I will increase that frequency or not as I’ve only been taking it for about five months. Calcipotriene is still a relatively crude calcitriol-derivative, in that it still has a lot of the same calcemic qualities of calcitriol and can cause (if used in way, way higher dosages than I do) toxicity. But there are new, improved synthetics coming out all the time. Fingers crossed one comes out soon that is not prohibitively expensive, has no risk of hypercalcaemia and a ridiculously long half-life!\n\nFinally, one thing I started taking early on was 150mg of the ubiquinol form of co-enzyme-Q10 daily. It was the first sort of mitochondrial supplement I had ever taken, and I cannot stress the difference this made enough. Anecdotally, in the last few years I have had about 5-10 people (including my own father and close friends) ask me if I’ve started dying my hair. It’s that much darker. Also, important to note, all these comments came long before finasteride or calcipotriene. On top of this I also take 20mg PQQ, 500mg nicotinamide (B3) and 1.5g acetyl-L-carnitine each day for mitochondrial health, but it’s too early to tell if these have had any effect on hair – though I can definitely say I have more energy day to day.\n\nSo that’s about it; if you’ve made it this far then kudos to you. This blew out way more than I originally planned and is by no means an airtight theory. I’m sure plenty of you will be able to pick it apart, but if it is a step in the right direction and gets conversation happening then I’m glad.

    "body": "Part I - **Introduction**\n--------------------------------------\n\nToday we're going to look at multivitamins and their purpose. I'm sure many of you take multivitamins, and you probably do it to avoid deficiencies and to fill the gaps in your diet. Before I begin, **I want to stress that this review deals specifically with multivitamins, not supplements in general. Please scroll down for a summary of the findings.**\n\n-----------------------\n\nSo what are **typical deficiencies** in the American population? Women are at greater risk for [iron and vitamin A deficiency](https://labdoor.com/article/nutritional-deficiencies-women-are-at-risk-for), especially if they are [pregnant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7283965). Vegans & vegetarians [may become b12 deficient](http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/20030618/vegetarian-diet-b12-deficiency). Black skinned people are at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency because the [\"melanin in the skin diminishes the ability to synthesize Vitamin D from the sun\"](https://labdoor.com/article/nutritional-deficiencies-women-are-at-risk-for). The elderly usually experience a decline in the gut absorption of micronutrients: [\"The age-related decline in the capacity to absorb calcium [56] appears due to a gut-resistance to the action of 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3 resulting from a loss of vitamin D receptors in the duodenal mucosa [57]\"](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/13800505_Nutritional_needs_of_seniors). The elderly may be at risk for vitamin b6, b12, d and calcium deficiency. \n\nThe American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's nutrition reports (CDC.gov) is [\"a series of publications that provide ongoing assessment of the U.S. population's nutrition status by measuring blood and urine concentrations of biochemical indicators\"](http://www.cdc.gov/nutritionreport/). \n\nThey found that between 2003 and 2006:\n\n> [\"Of all the nutrients listed, **the most people had vitamin B6, iron, and vitamin D deficiencies**, and the fewest people had  vitamin A, vitamin E, and  folate deficiencies.\" [...] \"However, for most nutrition indicators, deficiencies varied by age, gender, or race/ethnicity and could be as high as nearly one third of certain population groups.\"](http://www.cdc.gov/nutritionreport/pdf/4Page_%202nd%20Nutrition%20Report_508_032912.pdf). \n\nThis should give you a general idea of what you might be deficient in. The best way to be 100% sure of your micronutrient levels, is getting a blood test.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis brings us to **RDA**. Every country gives recommendations for micronutrient intakes. These RDAs are divided into age groups, and are designed for the general population. The problem here is that athletes usually have higher requirements for minerals (as well as fluids and macronutrients - but that is beyond the scope of this RR). Furthermore, the RDAs are usually enough to avoid deficiency, but being non-deficient is not the same as having optimal micronutrient levels, and this is especially true for athletes.\n\n> [\"For active individuals **a marginal deficiency in the nutrients may impact the body's ability to repair itself, operate efficiently and fight disease**, said Melinda Manore, researcher in the Colleges of Agricultural and Health and Human Sciences.\" [...] \"The stress on the body's energy producing pathways during exercise, the changes in the body's tissues resulting from training, an increase in the loss of nutrients in sweat, urine and feces during and after strenuous activity and the additional nutrients needed to repair and maintain higher levels of lean tissue mass present in some athletes and individuals may all affect an individual’s B-vitamin requirements, said Manore\"](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/56869.php)\n\nLarry Kenney from Pennsylvania State University states: \n\n> [\"The 2004 recommendations on water and sodium intake from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences are targeted primarily at sedentary Americans. **These guidelines for water and salt intake should not be applied to athletes**. Athletes who follow the IOM recommendations to the letter may actually put themselves at risk for unintended decreases in performance or even untoward health consequences.\"](http://www.gssiweb.org/Article/sse-92-dietary-water-and-sodium-requirements-for-active-adults)\n\nWeightlifting athletes may be particularly prone to the negative effects of vitamin D deficiency, because calcium requires vitamin D for optimal absorption. If absorption of calcium is hindered: \n\n> [\"Low vitamin D increases bone turnover, which increases the risk for a bone injury, like a stress fracture.\" [...] \"vitamin D [...] also aids in regulation of electrolyte metabolism, protein synthesis, gene expression, and immune function [10,28]. These vital functions are essential for all individuals, especially the elite and recreational athlete.\"] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3725481/)\n\nAn athlete may decide to supplement vitamin D. Unknowingly, he purchases D2: [\"Vitamin D3 increases the total 25(OH)D concentration [...] Vitamin D2 supplementation was associated with a decrease in 25(OH)D3,\"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256423512_Bioavailability_of_Vitamin_D-2_and_D-3_in_Healthy_Volunteers_a_Randomized_Placebo-Controlled_Trial)\n\nThis goes to show that there are **different forms of micronutrients**. These forms have different bioavailabilities and effects on the body. For example, magnesium oxide is maybe the most commonly supplemented form of magnesium. The problem is that [\"magnesium oxide may have an absorbable magnesium potency as low as 4%. 7 8\"](http://www.ancient-minerals.com/magnesium-sources/absorption/). I could write for days about micronutrient forms and bioavailability, but to keep it succinct: [multivitamins are usually filled with the cheapest and worst forms of vitamins and minerals](http://examine.com/insiders/multivitamins). If you want to learn more about magnesium check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3ixxkw/dietary_magnesium_is_positively_associated_with/cukru3k). To get more information about bioavailability check [this out] (http://nutrition.ansci.illinois.edu/sites/default/files/Chiba_ch15.pdf)\n\n--------------------------\n\nThis brings us to the concept of **antinutrients**: \n\n> [\"Antinutrients in foods are responsible for deleterious effects related to the absorption of nutrients and micronutrients. However, some antinutrients may exert beneficial health effects at low concentrations.\"](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/bk-1997-0662.ch001). \n\nA very potent antinutrient is **phytic acid**. It is usually found in large concentrations in seeds, nuts, grains, legumes. [\"phytic acid [has the] ability to bind to essential minerals such as iron, zinc, calcium, and magnesium in the digestive tract and inhibit their absorption by the body.1,2\"](http://breakingmuscle.com/nutrition/dissecting-anti-nutrients-the-good-and-bad-of-phytic-acid). A consequence of this is that if a person is consuming a meal rich in phytic acid along with his daily multi, the minerals in the multi may be rendered less useful. The good news is that [vitamin C partly counteracts the negative effects of phytic acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/3ov6ai/if_phytic_acid_is_an_antinutrient_should_we_be/cw1ojey)\n\n[More info on phytic acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/3ov6ai/if_phytic_acid_is_an_antinutrient_should_we_be/cw1r059)\n\n---------------------------------\n\nThere are other factors that limit micronutrient absorption. These factors are the interactions between the nutrients, called **vitamin and mineral antagonism and synergy** [1] (http://www.traceelements.com/Docs/Nutrient%20Interrelationships-Minerals-Vitamins-Endocrines.pdf) [2](http://www.return2health.net/articles/vitamin-mineral-antagonists/). Micros that have synergy, enhance each other’s uptake (i.e. Vit D enhances calcium uptake, Vitamin C enhances iron uptake). There is also antagonism, [whereby micros inhibit absorption of other micros](https://labdoor.com/article/nutrient-nutrient-interaction-in-multivitamin-supplements). For example [calcium interferes with iron absorption, zinc uptake is hindered by minerals such as cal, mag, iron, because they share a transporter](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/3hssrs/calciums_effect_on_ironzinc_absorption_and_what/cuafwt6). \n\n**The takeaway here is that if you fill a multivitamin with micro antagonists, they will compete for absorption and hinder uptake levels.**\n\n---------------------------------\n\nThe last part of the introduction deals with what I call the size paradox of multivitamins. Simply put, [it is impossible to squeeze (common values) 400mg of magnesium, 600mg of calcium, 14mg iron, 10mg zinc, 500iu vitamin d, 500mg vitamin c, all the b vitamins, trace minerals, etc. into a small tablet](http://examine.com/insiders/multivitamins)). I have a bottle of Magnesium citrate 100mg tablets, and each tablet is twice the size of my multi. \n\n> [\"**12 multivitamins provided less vitamin A, vitamin C, or folate, or than claimed, some with less than 30% of the listed amounts**. These include a prenatal vitamin and products for men, adults (general), seniors, and even pets.\"](https://www.consumerlab.com/reviews/multivitamin_review_comparisons/multivitamins/)\n\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**Summary of introduction**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n- Common micronutrient deficiencies are: Vitamin D, iron, B6. Deficiency prevalence is population based (age, sex, skin color, lifestyle)\n- Multivitamins are usually filled with the cheapest and worst forms of vitamins and minerals\n- Reaching RDAs may prevent deficiency, but may not necessarily give you optimal levels\n- Athletes need more micros than sedentary individuals\n- Antinutrients and micronutrient antagonism severely hinder the absorption rates and bioavailability of MVs\n- The minerals and vitamins found in MVs won't physically fit into a neat little pill\n- Companies may lie on the contents label (goes for all supplements)\n\n**Summary of the meta-analysis** (scroll down to see the studies)\n-----------------------------------------\n\n- Antioxidants such as vitamin C and E may help fight cancer (but they could also hinder athletic performance improvements)\n- Most research is done on the elderly\n- There is no clear consensus because of contradictory evidence. However, **the majority of the evidence points towards no effect**\n- Smokers may want to avoid MVs (especially ß-carotene)\n- High doses of fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A can be dangerous. Always check the bottle contents!\n\n**Final thoughts**\n-----------------------------------------\n**Research does not support the hypothesis that MVs give health benefits. This does not mean that targeted or isolated supplementation is useless!** For example, vitamin D3 supplementation has been shown to increase hormonal levels of vitamin D. You should probably figure out what you're deficient in and do targeted supplementation instead of buying a MV that probably won't do much for your health.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nPart II - **Studies**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nBefore looking at the studies, we must identify the possible sampling biases of multivitamin research. It is possible that people who take multivitamins do so as a way to self-medicate, because they feel unhealthy or know they have unhealthy lifestyles. It could also be the effect of marketing. In most of the studies I reviewed, the participants were aged 50+. This is an issue because they do not represent the entire population. Lastly, studies usually rely on self-reported questionnaires. The risk here is that people lie or modify the truth.\n\nI've tried to represent both sides of the debate as fairly as possible. I excluded studies with few participants, unclear methods, obvious spelling errors in the abstract (...), paid research (supplement marketing), very short trials, or generally poor design.\n\n[Example of excluded study with spelling errors, short trial, and likely paid]\n(http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/823/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00213-011-2481-3.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00213-011-2481-3&token2=exp=1447593072~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F823%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs00213-011-2481-3.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs00213-011-2481-3*~hmac=8196190f7a982c858dd95c955172ac80d284ff19ceb335859c4f9516a9be5104)\n\n[Example of excluded study because of purely self-reported statistics]\n(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16081445)\n\n\n[Example of excluded study because low N and (relatively) short trial]\n (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743504005778)\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Studies with evidence supporting multivitamin health benefits**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n**[Multivitamin Use and Risk of Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease in the Women's Health Initiative Cohorts](https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=414784)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2009\n-\tTime period: 1993-2005\n-\tParticipants: 161 808\n-\tAge: 50 to 79\n-\tInclusion criteria: postmenopausal women\n-\tExclusion criteria: alcoholism, drug dependency, dementia.\n\n> A total of 41.5% of the participants used multivitamins.\n\n**How they documented:**\n\n> Dietary supplement data were collected during in-person clinic visits.

We included fair- and good-quality randomized, controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness or safety of supplements in the primary prevention of CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality in the general adult population without a history of CVD or cancer. We included fair- and good-quality secondary prevention trials if they hypothesized effects on outcomes included in this review and not present at baseline in the study (for example, a trial of secondary skin cancer prevention that also reported on other cancers). We included only studies that were conducted among community-dwelling, nutrient-sufficient adults who had no chronic disease and were performed in countries with a Human Development Index of “very high” (11). We also required supplement doses to be lower than the upper tolerable limit set by the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board (12)\n\n**What they documented:**\n\n> We specifically sought studies of the following vitamins and minerals: vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C, D, and E; calcium; iron; zinc; magnesium; niacin; folic acid; ß-carotene; and selenium. We included studies that evaluated single, paired, and combinations of 3 or more vitamins and minerals; we use the term “multivitamin” to refer to those combinations.\n\n> We screened 12 766 abstracts, reviewed 277 full-text articles, and included 103 articles (26 studies) (Appendix Figure 2 of the Supplement). Four trials (19–22) and 1 cohort study (23) examined the benefits and harms of multivitamin supplementation (Supplement). Twenty-two trials and 2 cohort studies examined the benefits and harms of individual or paired supplements (Supplement): 6 studies of ß-carotene (24–29), 6 studies of vitamin E (22, 24, 30–33), 3 studies of selenium (33–35), 5 studies of vitamin A (23, 29, 36–38), 2 studies of vitamin C (30–31), 1 study of folic acid (39), 3 studies of vitamin D (40–42), 2 studies of vitamin D in combination with calcium (43–44), and 4 studies of calcium (40, 43, 45–46). The study sizes ranged from 128 to 72 337 individuals with average ages ranging from 22 to 77 years, although in most studies the mean age was older than 50 years (Supplement). Six studies were conducted among women only, 5 were conducted among men only, and the remaining studies were in mixed populations (24.2% to 84.7% women). The effects of the supplements were examined between 6 months and 16 years; most studies provided less than a decade of follow-up. \n\n\n**What they found:** \n> This review included 26 studies (24 randomized, controlled trials and 2 cohort studies) that examined the benefits and harms of using vitamin and mineral supplements for primary prevention of CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality in healthy individuals without known nutritional deficiencies. **We found no consistent evidence that the included supplements affected CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality in healthy individuals without known nutritional deficiencies.** Other systematic reviews have arrived at this same conclusion (56–66). The certainty of this result is tempered, however, because few fair- or good-quality studies are available for all supplements except vitamin E and ß-carotene. For vitamin E, we identified 6 fair- to good-quality trials that produced clearly null effects on these end points. This result is consistent with the conclusions of other systematic reviews and meta-analyses of vitamin E (67–71). **Our review also confirmed the established harm of ß-carotene supplementation on lung cancer incidence and death for individuals at high risk for lung cancer (24, 29, 72)**. Further, we identified 6 trials that failed to detect any benefit from ß-carotene supplementation for any individuals.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n**[Dietary Supplements and Mortality Rate in Older Women](https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1105975)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2011\n-\tTime period: 1986-2008\n-\tParticipants: 38 772 \n-\tAge: Mean age: 61,6\n-\tInclusion criteria: Female\n-\tExclusion criteria: \"[...] excluding from all analyses those who did not adequately complete a questionnaire including food frequency and supplement use at baseline in 1986\"\n\n> Of these women, 99.2% were white and 98.6% were postmenopausal\n\n**How they documented:**\n\n> Food intake was assessed at baseline and in the 2004 follow-up, using 2 nearly identical versions of the validated 127-food item Harvard Service Food Frequency Questionnaire.\n\n> Supplement use was queried in 1986, 1997, and 2004 and included the 15 supplements assessed at all 3 surveys: multivitamins; vitamins A, beta-carotene, B6, folic acid, B complex, C, D, and E; and minerals iron, calcium, copper, magnesium, selenium, and zinc. Different forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol (D3) or ergocalciferol (D2), were not distinguished. At the baseline and 2004 follow-up surveys, the supplement-related questions were part of the Food Frequency Questionnaire. \n\n**What they documented:**\n\nMortality rates.\n\nThey excluded deaths that were \"related to injury, accident, and suicide, because it is unlikely that supplement use would be causally related to these outcomes.\"\n\n**What they found:** \n\n> [...] most of the supplements studied were not associated with a reduced total mortality rate in older women. In contrast, we found that several commonly used dietary vitamin and mineral supplements, including multivitamins, vitamins B6, and folic acid, as well as minerals iron, magnesium, zinc, and copper, were associated with a higher risk of total mortality. Of particular concern, supplemental iron was strongly and dose dependently associated with increased total mortality risk. Also, the association was consistent across shorter intervals, strengthened with multiple use reports and with increasing age at reported use. Supplemental calcium was consistently inversely related to total mortality rate; however, no clear dose-response relationship was observed.\n\n> Also, supplement users were more likely to have lower intake of energy, total fat, and monounsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids and to have higher intake of protein, carbohydrates, polyunsaturated fatty acids, alcohol, whole grain products, fruits, and vegetables.\n\n**Limitations:**\n**Does not strictly deal with multivitamins**, but still interesting\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**[Enough Is Enough: Stop Wasting Money on Vitamin and Mineral Supplements](http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1789253)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2013 (META-ANALYSIS)\n\n**How they documented:**\nThe authors did a meta-analysis of other studies\n\n**What they found:** \n\n> The large body of accumulated evidence has important public health and clinical implications. **Evidence is sufficient to advise against routine supplementation**, and we should translate null and negative findings into action. The message is simple: **Most supplements do not prevent chronic disease or death, their use is not justified, and they should be avoided**. This message is especially true for the general population with no clear evidence of micronutrient deficiencies, who represent most supplement users in the United States and in other countries (9).\n\n> **In conclusion, ß-carotene, vitamin E, and possibly high doses of vitamin A supplements are harmful.** Other antioxidants, folic acid and B vitamins, and multivitamin and mineral supplements are ineffective for preventing mortality or morbidity due to major chronic diseases. Although available evidence does not rule out small benefits or harms or large benefits or harms in a small subgroup of the population, we believe that the case is closed— supplementing the diet of well-nourished adults with (most) mineral or vitamin supplements has no clear benefit and might even be harmful. These vitamins should not be used for chronic disease prevention. Enough is enough.\n\n**Limitations:**\nAuthors seem emotionally invested in the outcome of the debate.

A sample of multivitamins was evaluated for their beta-carotene content and the suggested daily dosage.\n\n**What they documented:**\nBeta-carotene's possible interaction with lung cancer in smokers\n\n**What they found:**\n\n> Four studies contributing 109,394 subjects were available for analysis. The average daily beta-carotene dosage in these trials ranged from 20 to 30 mg daily. Among current smokers, beta-carotene supplementation was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.10–1.39). Among former smokers, there was no significant increase noted (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.84–1.45). In a sample of 47 common multivitamins, beta-carotene was present in 70% of the identified formulas. The median dosage of beta-carotene was 0.3 mg (range, 0–17.2 mg) daily. The beta-carotene content was found to be significantly higher among multivitamins sold to improve visual health than among other multivitamins, with a median daily dosage of 3 mg (range, 0–24 mg).\n\n-------------------------\n\n\n\n\n**Studies with mixed findings or no effect**\n-------------------------\n\n**[Vitamin/mineral supplementation and cancer, cardiovascular, and all-cause mortality in a German prospective cohort](http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/717/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00394-011-0224-1.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00394-011-0224-1&token2=exp=1447594502~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F717%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs00394-011-0224-1.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs00394-011-0224-1*~hmac=8d15d3c2ee1a9bb806f4f0cdf9ae79b9ba0ece8d1e7532a7285550dcd69f796c)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2012\n-\tTime period: 1994-2006 (11 year average followup)\n-\tParticipants: 23 943\n-\tAge: 35-64\n-\tInclusion criteria: male and female\n-\tExclusion criteria: cancer, myocardial infarction/stroke\n\n**How they documented:**\n> In  the  EPIC-Heidelberg  cohort,  vitamin/mineral  supplementation  was  assessed   at  different time  points.

At the request of an American Cancer Society volunteer, each enrollee completed a four-page mailed questionnaire in 1982 that requested information on history of cancer and other diseases, use of medicines and vitamins, use of alcohol and tobacco, diet, as well as other factors potentially affecting mortality. This analysis includes 1,063,023 people (453,962 men; 609,061 women) who, at enrollment, reported usable data on vitamin use.\n\n**How they documented:**\n\n> [...] each enrollee completed a four-page mailed questionnaire in 1982 that requested information on history of cancer and other diseases, use of medicines and vitamins, use of alcohol and tobacco, diet, as well as other factors potentially affecting mortality. \n\n**What they documented:**\n\n> [...] we classified deaths due to ischemic heart disease (ICD-9 codes 410–414), cerebrovascular disease (stroke) (ICD-9 codes 430–438), and all cancers combined, except nonmelanoma skin cancer (ICD-9 codes 140–195 and 199–209). We examined separately the three most common causes of cancer mortality: lung (ICD-9 code 162), colo-rectal (ICD-9 codes 153–154), and (for men) prostate (ICD-9 code 185) and (for women) breast (ICD-9 code 174), and all other cancers combined. All-cause mortality included persons who died of any cause.\n\n**What they found:**\n\n> **This large prospective study provides limited support for the hypothesis that multivitamin supplements may reduce death rates from ischemic heart disease in the general population**. Men and women who took a multivitamin without other supplements had lower death rates from ischemic heart disease than did those who took no multivitamins. However, the association was attenuated when analyses were adjusted for additional cardiovascular risk factors besides age, and no consistent gradient of decreasing risk was seen with either the frequency or the duration of multivitamin use. \n\n> **Men and women who used both multivitamins and vitamin A, C, or E had lower risks of dying from heart disease and stroke than did nonusers than one might expect from the relative risks for users of either only a multivitamin or only a vitamin A, C, or E supplement.** \n\n\n\n-----------------------------\n\n**[Multivitamin use and the risk of mortality and cancer incidence: the multiethnic cohort study] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3105257/)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2011\n-\tTime period: 1993-2005 (11 year average follow-up)\n-\tParticipants: 182 099 \n-\tAge: 45-75\n-\tInclusion criteria: Living in Hawaii and California, ethnic group\n-\tExclusion criteria: \"we excluded participants who were not in one of the targeted 5 ethnic groups (n = 13,991) or who reported invalid dietary intakes based on total energy intake or its components (n = 8,264) (12). We also excluded those with missing information on multivitamin use (n = 4,451) or smoking (n = 7,013)\"\n\n**How they documented:**\n> The baseline questionnaire included questions about the use of multivitamins (with/without minerals) and 7 single vitamin/mineral supplements. Subjects were asked to indicate whether they had used any of these supplements at least weekly during the previous year.\n\n> In a follow-up questionnaire approximately 5 years after baseline (1999–2003), participants were asked the same question on multivitamin use but without duration of use. \n\n**What they documented:**\n\n> During an average 11 years of follow-up, we identified 28,851 deaths (15,962 men and 12,889 women). Death from all causes was the primary endpoint in the analyses. In addition, according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10), we categorized the primary cause of death into cardiovascular diseases (ICD-9 codes 390–434, 436–448; ICD-10 codes I00–I78), cancer (ICD-9 codes 140–208; ICD-10 codes C00–C97), and all other causes.\n\n**What they found:**\n\n> In this large multiethnic cohort, we found no associations between multivitamin use and mortality from all causes, cardiovascular diseases, or cancer. The findings did not vary across subgroups by ethnicity, age, body mass index, preexisting illness, single vitamin/mineral supplement use, hormone replacement therapy use, and smoking status. In addition, there was no evidence indicating that multivitamin use increased or decreased risk for cancer, overall or at major sites, such as lung, colorectum, prostate, and breast.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n> Multivitamin users are generally more health conscious than are nonusers (1, 36), which could confound the relation of multivitamin use with morbidity or mortality. Although we adjusted for well-known potential confounders including health-related behaviors such as smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity (37), there may still be uncontrolled bias. In particular, we were unable to adjust for changes in potential confounders over time. The longest duration category for multivitamin use in our baseline questionnaire was 5 years and longer, although the effects of multivitamins on longevity and disease might take a longer period.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**Please find the rest of the review in the comments**\n------------------------------\n",

Assure pharma   claims to be a \" biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies intended to improve outcomes in patients sufferings\"  and provides all sorts of products like soap, detergent etc. An obscure pharma company ( at least to me) . \n\nBonex 60K is Cholecalciferol 60000 IU capsules, basically Vitamin D3 to my understanding.

Is Bonex 60k, the recommended vitamin d3 supplement as per the test results? i.e. would going for a generic Cholecalciferol 60000 IU be less affective in this case? \n\n3. Is it legal/ethical for pharma companies to promote  their branded products by Incentivising doctors? And is that why doctors prefer to prescribe branded medicines rather then generic ones?

I remember being on duty once and having to take the generic Paracetamol from my hospital pharmacy since I didn't have time to go get the branded ones. It did not work. So, as someone who has been on both sides, generic medicines that are available at a lower/free cost aren't as effective as branded ones (generally speaking). They are available because not everyone can afford the ones from big pharmaceuticals.\n\nHaving said that, I am also aware of doctors prescribing drugs from a certain brand for their commission but sometimes, they do it because they've had good experience with that particular formulation. \nRemind you, drugs from different brands usually have slight differences in their effects.\n\nIf you have the money, get better formulations.

If we trust a brand and know it works we prescribe that. I have seen how effective or ineffective generic meds can be and would be cautious about trusting them blindly. I'll give you an example. \n\nMy mother is diabetic and for years was on a particular antidiabetic drug glimiperide from a brand(say xyz). Now I came to know that there's a Jan aushadhi Kendra near my house so switched to that. I check her random blood sugar every week and after i started her on generic meds her sugar kept fluctuating. Even her hba1c(test to see long term diabetes) rose for the first time in 10 years. Seeing this I took a consult and started her on insulin for a few months and when sugar was under control switched again to tablets from Jan aushadhi. Same thing happened again. This time I started her on the older xyz brand she used to take, kept checking sugar as usual every week and after 3 months checked her hba1c. It was within normal limits. Now it's been over 2 years and she's not needed insulin and is on the xyz brand of tablets. \n\nSee what you need to understand is that different company drugs have different bio efficacies. I'm not saying generics are useless, I use them all the time too. But if I know a brand is reliable and have seen its effects I'd rather prescribe that. As a practice I mention generic name of the meds in bracket along with the brand name so that patient knows they can go for generics or a different brand if it's available. Personally, I'd prefer a known brand than a generic one. \n\nAlso women over 60 have had their menopause and post menopause, they tend to have bone defects due to the stoppage/decrease in secretion of certain hormones that regulate bone formation/maintenance. They tend to have bone and joint pains and it's a common practice to prescribe calcium and vit d3 to them. I'm not mentioning doses because this is not a proper medical advice and you should always rely on the advice of a doctor who has seen you or your family physically and examined them and then prescribed meds. \n\nHope this helped.",

    "body": "Why are enveloped respiratory viruses generally seasonal?\n\nA few of the potential explanations:\n\nOutdoor temperature/humidity\n\nIndoor humidity\n\nMore time spent indoors in winter\n\nAdaptation to the seasonality of the host's physiology\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOutdoor conditions make a lot of sense for wild hosts, but we live climate-controlled 93% indoor lives.\n\nExtra time spent indoors in winter can't matter all that much since that's where we spend almost all of our time anyway.\n\nIndoor air is significantly drier in the winter thanks to heating. Furthermore [infectivity of droplets goes up very sharply as humidity is lowered below 40%](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0057485). This is at least roughly where it would be expected to.\n\nSo problem solved. We don't even need to look at that last option do we?\n\nOf course we do! No one ever said there was only one option.\n\nIn fact there almost never is only one.\n\nEvolution is messy and it always hill climbs its way up along every dimension of freedom it has.\n\nDNA is just big long strings of base pairs, and any of them can be changed.\n\nSo adapting to seasonal changes in the host must happen.\n\nThe only questions are how much it matters and whether it contributes or detracts from seasonality.\n\nTurns out there are a thousand lines that suggest it favors seasonality and by a respectable amount too.\n\nHere's one that is unconfounded by [any other reason](https://jvi.asm.org/content/81/11/5429):\n\n\"In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted in the Soviet Union during different seasons, nonimmune volunteers were given attenuated live influenza vaccine intranasally. Febrile reactions attributable to vaccine(calculated by subtracting the proportion of participants with reactions in the placebo group from the proportion in the vaccine group) were observed in 6.7% of 360 volunteers inoculated in Leningrad in January, compared with 0.8% of 197 inoculated in June (p = 0.003). Fourfold rises in antibody titer were seen in 31% to 40% in Krasnodar in January, depending on the vaccine strain, compared with 4.3% to 4.8% given the same strains in May and October (all p <0.001). Similar trends with less significant differences were seen in three other cities.\" [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2631809/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2631809/)\n\nTLDR: Inoculating soviets in the summer avoided fevers and prevented the adaptive immune system from learning how to recognize the virus quite as well.\n\nIf we are certain that everyone was infected then the cause must come from within the summertime host and not the wintertime one.\n\nPotential mechanisms for how aren't hard to come up with. So instead lets ask, 'Can we find reasons that explain why?'\n\nWhat is the evolutionary purpose of the seasonality of enveloped respiratory viruses?\n\nERVs evolved outdoors and weather conditions result in an evolutionary preference about when to spread and when to simmer.\n\nConditions below room temperature freeze their lipid envelope into a semisolid fatty shell. This is butter-clad armor; it helps them spread.\n\nSo it is more cost-effective to proliferate in the winter. But with what coin is the cost paid?\n\nNonimmune hosts are the scarce resource. Hosts come in herds, herds are easy to propagate in until you run out of hosts.\n\nA frugal virus conserves hosts until fall when it has the best chance of spreading to new herds.\n\nThe seasonal change in host immune tactics is the signal it takes advantage of. An upregulated adaptive immune system is easy to taunt into coughing.\n\nAll it has to do is let the innate immune system keep its numbers in check during the spring and summer. The thinned numbers helps it avoid adaptive detection. This stretches out each host. Infection is asymptomatic, so no coughing and so less propagation. This stretches out each herd.\n\nThe evolutionary game theoretic analysis has an equilibrium because the host's choice of tactics has a cost to it as well. Boosting innate immunity is like posting a guard at every corner and guards cost food. Stable play in the winter involves the host upregulating costly defenses to honestly signal to the virus whenever it is provoking the immune system too much. The virus prefers to not kill what could be a parent of future hosts. Virus and host come to a compromise.\n\nThere are quite a few different costly signals that hosts can use. Fevers cost energy. Inflammation costs damage. All of these things are also inherently effective, they actually do things that kill viruses. It isn't just a request. But if a virus wanted you dead, you would be dead. They evolve so much faster. Fortunately the only way I can see this happening is if your species competes with a species they strongly prefer as hosts. Usually though before your kind is completely wiped out a strain of the virus will speciate to prefer your kind. They then quickly adapt to play mostly nice and your species gains a symbiotic guardian whose purpose is to keep your immune system capable against its murderous parent. This is a charitable view of viruses as actors akin to militant warlords competing with one another for host species, ie territory. Like any military, they only have to exist because other militaries exist.\n\nWhat would a 'strongly preferred host' look like? How about one that doesn't aggressively fight off viruses, yet never gets particularly sick from them, hibernates, lives in giant closely bunched herds, flies, lives everywhere, and is more diverse than any other mammal order besides their flightless cousins? Why, it's the goddamn bat's man! Ok yeah, my jokes aren't bat great... Anywho, bats seem like some kind of ecological appendix but for viruses and not bacteria. It's a bit of a mystery how their viruses remain so well-behaved. Bats can't signal to a virus when it is overstepping via fevers because they already get that hot every evening because flight is so demanding. Nocturnal frugivorous bats are completely disconnected from the vitamin D ecology. So no signals there either. Do they just have more effective innate immune responses always at the ready?\n\nThis next paragraph is very speculative but intriguing. I wouldn't put too much stock in it.\n\nCOVID-19 made the jump from bats to humans possibly stopping for a bit of pangolin on the way. Pangolins, with their modesty perfectly covered in scales and a thriving on a diet of nothing but ants, make me wonder how their vitamin D system works. No skin is showing and pangolin chow must be fortified. I wonder if anyone really knows. Also I can't seem to quickly find any estimate of how much vitamin D is in a gram of ants. Nutritiondata.whatever doesn't seem to have any ants in their food database. Antyways, if COVID-19 went from bats to pangolins and if pangolins are a bit idiosyncratic w.r.t. vitamin D then this could be expected to result in a virus which has not yet re-tuned itself to live once again in a vitamin D-typical host species. Add to that high levels of human deficiency and you have a recipe for a disease which might respond dramatically to improvement in D status.\n\nLet's look at our vitamin D system. Dietary D3, cholecalciferol, immediately predominantly partitions itself into our lipid fraction. Thus it is doubtful it has any activity itself. It seems to simply be a buffer, storing and smoothing our supply. Calcitriol is thought of as \\*the\\* active natural form, but I think something important may have been overlooked. Calcitriol is indeed the form that activates the vitamin D receptor but I think that it's precursor, calcifediol, may deserve independent recognition. Calcifediol is an inhibitor of VDR. I don't know if it is potent enough to matter but let's assume that it plausibly might be. There are half-lives associated to each of the 3 reservoirs of D and they are nicely spaced out. This suggests to me that there may be two signals. That's what made me look to see whether calcifediol was an inhibitor.\n\nThe fluctuation of calcitriol level will trail that of calcifediol because it is made from it. The combination of a time-delayed agonist signal and a more immediate inhibitor signal allows our chemistry to derive what is effectively a time-delta of the agonist signal. That is, VDR expression can react to not only the level of calcitriol but also the rate of change of that level.\n\nThere is a problem though. The signal would be very weak given how closely -triol tracks -diol. Fortunately this ain't no deal for our ever clever evolution. The VDR actually significantly upregulates its own expression! This is an unusual feature; we expect biochemistry to predominantly favor stability. However such homeostasis would muffle the time-delta signal. Instead, there is self-upregulation of the impact of both agonist and inhibitor. Is this something that is known to happen elsewhere?\n\nAbout 2 hours ago I realized that this means that you can simulate the signal that winter is becoming spring by administration of the inhibitor. A sudden dose of calcifediol in someone deficient looks like if you went instantly from a winter pallor to a summer sunburn. The significance of this is that if enveloped respiratory viruses are generally attuned to the vitamin D host seasonal status responses then this wouldn't merely just signal to the virus that winter has ended, it would scream it. This is a signal that is impossible for our natural physiology to make.\n\n(EDIT: I just realized I had seen what I now realize is the reverse transition\\[summer->winter\\] actually being observed in [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5259864/) and the experimenter simply had no way to know how exactly this paradoxical effect happened. I wonder if exactly why this happens is still considered unresolved. \n\nEDIT2: Unliganded VDR also affects gene expression. This means that a cell reacts to VDR expression in a manner that is not entirely dependent on VDR activation. This certainly looks like it would if calcifediol and calcitriol communicated independent signals.\n\nEDIT3: An inhibitor of VDR activation would be expected to downregulate the expression of VDR because of the self-upregulating nature of VDR activation. Calcifediol is an inhibitor but nevertheless [it was observed to increase the expression of VDR in T cells](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096695). So you can increase the number of unliganded VDRs without increasing activated VDR by increasing both calcifediol and calcitriol. Thus the pure unliganded signal is a sum of the 2 stages of active D and similarly the pure liganded signal is a difference.)\n\nThere was a pilot RCT that did exactly this for COVID-19 pre-ICU patients some months ago. Its results were literally too good to be believed. I am writing this today because the medical community has been largely dismissive to the very possibility that the study observed what it claims. No one wants to talk about it. There certainly is a lot about it that just doesn't smell right to many a fine epistemic nose. I personally can't see any reasonable way for the study to be anything except either fraud or truth or a 7.7\\*10\\^-7 ≈ one-in-a-million fluke or something I personally can't see. Please excuse the tautology.\n\nLately it feels like vitamin D has been vitamin disappointment. Study after study of disappointing and sometimes conflicting results. Vitamin Disappointment is the zeitgeist. Add to it the idea of effectively treating an infectious disease with a vitamin. It's no wonder people are so skeptical, and rightly so. Medicine and nutrition are incredibly epistemically noisy fields. It ain't easy.\n\nI sincerely believe that diligence is due here. In this case its not just the same old parable of the people who cried 'wolf!' one million times too many. This time the cry happens to be a surprisingly detailed credible description of a wolf.\n\nIf you agree with me that it should be talked about even if only to make a cogent counter-case, I encourage you to please share this with a peer or maybe a superior and spark a discussion. We are in bystander effect territory. Those who feel the same as I have been trying to figure out how to call the police, but there doesn't seem to be anyone who will listen. If you know the right number for me to dial please tell me.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nResources:\n\n[An in depth analysis of the pilot RCT](https://blog.rootclaim.com/vitamin-d-can-likely-end-the-covid-19-pandemic/)\n\n[A summary of evidence both pro and con](https://vitamin-d-covid.shotwell.ca/)\n\n[An excellent philosophical treatment of the decision theory](https://shotwell.ca/posts/good-decisions-bad-data/)",

After a couple months, I made entries for all 170 champs - up to date as of Mel's release, January 23rd, 2025.

We conducted a prospective, observational study of patients, hospitalized with COVID-19. Serum 25-OHD level < 20 ng/mL was considered VDD. Patients were classified as having mild and severe disease on basis of the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement (OSCI). Of the 410 patients recruited, patients with VDD (197,48∙2%) were significantly younger and had lesser comorbidities. The proportion of severe cases (13∙2% vs.14∙6%), mortality (2% vs. 5∙2%), oxygen requirement (34∙5% vs.43∙4%), ICU admission (14∙7% vs.19∙8%) was not significantly different between patients with or without VDD. There was no significant correlation between serum 25-OHD levels and inflammatory markers studied. Serum parathormone levels correlated with D-dimer (r 0∙117, p- 0∙019), ferritin (r 0∙132, p-0∙010), and LDH (r 0∙124, p-0∙018). Amongst VDD patients, 128(64.9%) were treated with oral cholecalciferol (median dose of 60000 IU). The proportion of severe cases, oxygen, or ICU admission was not significantly different in the treated vs. untreated group. In conclusion, serum 25-OHD levels at admission did not correlate with inflammatory markers, clinical outcomes, or mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Treatment of VDD with cholecalciferol did not make any difference to the outcomes.",

It involves a lot of knowledge about flavors from nutrients, like minerals, which I don't know much about. \n\nHere is a listing of the ingredients for reference https://www.fmsc.org/get-involved/volunteer-info/allergy-information#:~:text=MannaPack%E2%84%A2%20Rice%20ingredients,%2C%20Dehydrated%20Carrots%2C%20Dehydrated%20Potatoes.\n\n1. I have most of the main ingredients down, and need help matching the flavor. It really lacks right now and I think that's largely because there are so many vitamins and minerals in the mix, so I need to add those too. I have to figure out which ones add to flavor and which don't matter. \n\n- Dicalcium Phosphate (Calcium) - i hear this affects mostly mouthfeel, makes it dry, so I'll exclude it\n- Magnesium Oxide (Magnesium) - this was identified on a few websites about tea preparation as a good enhancement, so I think I will include it\n- Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) - acids were mentioned elsewhere as a flavor enhancer, and this is extremely easy to find, so ill include it\n- Ferric Orthophosphate (Iron), Copper Sulfate (Copper) - these are normally detectable in water and were on the site for tea aficionados, so I'll include them\n\nI havent looked into these yet and would appreciate knowing if they would contribute to the flavor or where to get them:\n\nd-1 alpha Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E)\nMaltodextrin\nNiacinamide (Niacin)\nD-Calcium Pantothenate (Pantothenic Acid)\nZinc Oxide(Zinc)\nManganese Sulfate (Manganese)\nVitamin A Palmitate\nPyridoxine Hydrochloride(Vitamin B6)\nThiamin Hydrochloride (Thiamin)\nRiboflavin\nFolic Acid\nBiotin\nPotassium Iodide (Iodine), Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3)\nCyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12)\n\n2. The dried carrot and TVP I use are very sweet, but the dish is definitely supposed to be savory and chicken-y. Do I need to try different brands or methods? Or is this an issue of im lacking other seasonings, like my question in #1?\n\n3. I'm less worried about the main ingredients, but in case it can help, here's what I've figured out\n\n- White Rice, Textured Soy Protein (Soy Flour), Dehydrated Carrots, Dehydrated Potatoes - self explanatory \n- Vegetarian Flavoring (salt, corn starch, soybean oil) - also simple, although I was gonna substitute the oil since thats less available \n- Hydrolyzed Corn Protein - basically protein powder made of corn, couldnt find anywhere, I was substituting more corn starch\n- Dextrose - going to substitute cane sugar\n- Disodium Inosinate, Disodium Guanylate - research revealed this combo is a MSG substitute for umami, and I already have msg, but this was one of the industrial ingredients I was actually able to find consumer packaging of lol\n\n\nThe MannaPack rice meals are not sold, only donated to areas experiencing mass starvation, so my only honest hope is just puzzling it out myself. It might seem like a silly thing to put so much effort into but I am neurodivergent and have mental and physical health struggles - this is shelf stable, saves forever, is incredibly easy to prepare and eat, is stuffed with vitamins I miss out on bc of my difficulty eating, and one of the few things I have really genuinely enjoyed eating that also fit all of the previous requirements. It would make me very happy and help improve my life a lot to figure this out. So if you can help any, thanks so much!!!",

        "body": "The vitamins probably contribute almost nothing to the flavor. Most of them are present in incredibly tiny quantities. For example, vitamin E has a (mild) flavor, but it's probably something like 10 ppm in the recipe and that's not enough to taste. In general you need to be cautious with these ingredients, as some are toxic in large quantities (be careful with the metals -- copper, manganese, and zinc).\n\nThe key to the flavor is almost certainly the \"vegetarian flavoring.\" In addition to the umami ingredients, this contains \"natural flavor\" which could be just about anything and is likely very important.\n\nThe best bet may be to track down the source of the stuff. If you are good at making cold phone calls, maybe you could get in touch with someone who knows the exact product they are using. Otherwise, it's going to be quite difficult to replicate. It looks like the rice was originally made by Cargill, and maybe still is. If so, this \"natural flavor\" may be a Cargill product. However, I couldn't find any evidence that Cargill makes such things with a quick search.",

        "body": "Coming into this thread very late but I have some notes to add:\n\n- the vitamins probably add little to no flavor but are necessary because the primary ingredients provide calories and that's it. They will not provide a lot of the necessary nutrients your body needs if you only eat this. You would get serious nutritional deficiencies if you ate only this instant food — for example, the vitamin C is there to prevent scurvy.\n\nAlthough the vegetarian flavoring claims to be made of salt, corn starch, and soybean oil, that corn starch is almost certainly modified during some process to make it into something no longer similar to corn starch. It's probably that. You can read this article on modified corn starch: [\"What is Modified Corn Starch: Types, vs Corn Starch, is it Gluten Free?\" on the Food Additives website](https://foodadditives.net/starch/modified-corn-starch/).\n\nHydrolyzed Corn Protein is literally the opposite of corn starch — it is *protein* extracted from corn, and it is used to flavor the food. I think the goal might be umami, it's basically a variant of MSG. Nutritional Yeast would be a good substitue, as would powdered bouillon. \n\nThose two corn additives are the flavor bombs in the ingredients. And substituting with corn starch, which is on its own flavorless, will result in a tastely, gummy outcome.\n\nBest of luck getting the recipe right. I would guess, however, that most packaged rice meals you can buy at a local grocery store will work better.",

Besides sunshine and food sources, vitamin D supplements can be helpful if you have low levels of this essential nutrient.\n\nI've put together this guide on the most important things to look for when choosing a vitamin D supplement...\n\n# Form\n\nVitamin D supplements are available in two forms: vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). You should choose a supplement that uses vitamin D3 because this is the more natural form that is better absorbed and utilized by the body than the D2 form.\n\nMost vitamin D3 supplements are made from lanolin, which is a waxy substance sourced from sheep's wool. There is also vegan vitamin D3 sourced from lichen (algae and fungi growths).\n\n# Dosage\n\nThe best safe and effective vitamin D dosage for adult men and women is between 1000 and 2000 IU daily. This is how much you should take per day for general supplementation.\n\nIf you have a deficiency, your doctor may recommend a higher dosage (e.g. 5000 IU or more daily). Higher doses are usually taken for a limited period of time and with regular testing until your vitamin D levels return to normal.\n\nThe dosage can be displayed in either micrograms (mcg) or International Units (IU). Each microgram of vitamin D equals 40 IU. I made the following conversion table with some common dosages in micrograms and their equivalent in international units.\n\n|Dosage (micrograms)|Dosage (international units)|\n|:-|:-|\n|25 mcg|1,000 IU|\n|50 mcg|2,000 IU|\n|75 mcg|3,000 IU|\n|125 mcg|5,000 IU|\n|250 mcg|10,000 IU|\n\n**Note:** When taking 5000 IU of vitamin D or more per day, it is recommended to take vitamin K2 with it to reduce the risks of a vitamin D overdose.\n\n# Additives\n\nLook for a vitamin D supplement that has minimal additives. Softgels and liquid drops usually have fewer additives and fillers than tablets. Softgels also usually contain an oil (e.g. coconut or soybean oil) to help with absorption since vitamin D is fat-soluble. Just be careful in case you have an allergy.\n\n# Recommended brands\n\nYou don't have to be very picky - any reputable brand should do. Some of the most trusted vitamin D supplement brands on Reddit include Thorne, Nature Made, NOW, and Sports Research.\n\nI like the Sports Research brand - it's high quality, non-GMO tested, free from fillers, and the softgels are small and easy to swallow. It contains MCT coconut oil to help with absorption. They make two forms: regular [vitamin D3 with MCT oil](https://www.breezybrain.com/get/cg-vitamin-d3-sports-research) (1000-5000 IU) and [vegan vitamin D3 + K2](https://www.breezybrain.com/get/cg-vitamin-d3-k2-sports-research) (2500-5000 IU).",

Vitamin D (in its “parent” form, cholecalciferol) has been proposed in the pharmacological management of COVID-19 by various sources. We aimed to determine whether COVID-19 mortality was affected by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, vitamin D status, or cholecalciferol therapy, and to elucidate any other predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were opportunistically recruited from three UK hospitals, and their data were collected retrospectively. Logistic regression was used to determine any relationships between COVID-19 mortality and potential predictors, including 25(OH)D levels and cholecalciferol booster therapy. A total of 986 participants with COVID-19 were studied, of whom 151 (16.0%) received cholecalciferol booster therapy. In the primary cohort of 444 patients, cholecalciferol booster therapy was associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality, following adjustment for potential confounders (ORadj 0.13, 95% CI 0.05–0.35, *p* < 0.001). This finding was replicated in a validation cohort of 541 patients (ORadj 0.38, 95% CI 0.17–0.84, *p* = 0.018). In this observational study, treatment with cholecalciferol booster therapy, regardless of baseline serum 25(OH)D levels, appears to be associated with a reduced risk of mortality in acute in-patients admitted with COVID-19. Further work with large population studies needs to be carried out to determine adequate serum 25(OH)D levels, as well as multi-dose clinical trials of cholecalciferol therapy to assess maximum efficacy.",

A day during the rest of the year all from a liquid supplement which has a better absorption rate than pills.\n> \n> Its important to increase magnesium rich foods in your diet (kale, broccoli, or salmon, tuna etc) if you take more vitamin d because vitamin d will reduce the amount of your magnesium because it takes magnesium to convert vitamin d into its active form. This reduction of magnesium can lead to symptoms of a magnesium deficiency such as cramps, palpitations, depression etc. You can also supplement magnesium which is always a good idea I take 400 to 500 mg of magnesium malate a day if I didn't eat magnesium rich foods that day. (make sure to take 100 mg of magnesium 4 or 5 times a day with at least 2 hours apart because your body can't absorb more than that at once) It increases the amount of active vitamin d that your body can properly utilize for immune modulation , up regulation of thousands of genes and it's anti inflammatory properties.\n> \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/iq4nm9/vitamin_d_and_covid19/\n\n>**Vitamin-D And Covid**\n>\n> From close to the beginning of this pandemic people have been speculating that vitamin D status could be helpful for combating Sars-CoV-2. It has been known for a long time that vitamin D plays a big role in immunity, both innate and adaptive and also inflammation.[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3738984/) The vitamin D receptor helps to regulate over 900 genes in the body, so it shouldn't be surprising to find out that deficiency can have health consequences. Interestingly, meta-analysis using of over 11,000 individual participants data from 25 RCTs found vitamin D supplementation decreased upper respiratory infections by 19%. [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28202713/) That was the basis for why vitamin D was being recommended early on.\n> \n> Now that we're further along we've been getting more specific information about the relationship between vitamin D status and covid-19. I'll try to go over most of the main points.\n> \n> **Mechanisms by which vitamin D could help mitigate covid-19:**\n> \n> -   Sars-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors to get into cells. In animal models ace2 receptors are downregulated after infection.[[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079827/) This may be important because ACE2 converts angiotensin II into smaller peptides with lung protective effects. Angiotensin II itself exerts a proinflammatory action and may a key factor in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. [[4]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31723629/) Vitamin D upregulates ACE2 expression, thereby helping to clear proinflammatory angiotensin II. Vitamin D has been shown to decrease lung injury through this mechanism. [[5]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28944831/)\n>     \n> -   In animal experiments, getting rid of the vitamin D receptor was shown to increase pulmonary vascular leakiness, pulmonary edema, apoptosis, neutrophil infiltration and pulmonary inflammation. [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24196349/) Conversely, the overexpress of vitamin D receptors in animals was shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects in lung tissue. [[7]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28803336/)\n>     \n> -   Animal models suggest the vitamin D receptor may exert anti-thrombotic effects,[[8]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11104746/) potentially helping to mitigate the pro-clotting dynamic seen in covid-19.\n>     \n> \n> **Associations:**\n> \n> -   Association of Vitamin D Status and Other Clinical Characteristics With COVID-19 Test Results [[9]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2770157) (Deficient vitamin D status was associated with increased COVID-19 risk)\n>     \n> -   25-Hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are lower in patients found to be PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. [[10]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32397511/)\n>     \n> -   Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 are associated with greater disease severity [[11]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7361912/)\n>     \n> -   Perspective: Vitamin D deficiency and COVID‐19 severity – plausibly linked by latitude, ethnicity, impacts on cytokines, ACE2, and thrombosis (R1) [[12]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7361294/)\n>     \n> -   Vitamin D Deficiency and Outcome of COVID-19 Patients [[13]](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/9/2757/htm)\n>     \n> -   Low plasma 25 (OH) vitamin D level is associated with increased risk of COVID‐19 infection: an Israeli population‐based study [[14]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7404739/)\n>     \n> -   Vitamin D sufficiency, a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at least 30 ng/mL reduced risk for adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection [[15]](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239799)\n>     \n> -   Analysis of vitamin D level among asymptomatic and critically ill COVID-19 patients and its correlation with inflammatory markers [[16]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77093-z)\n>     \n> \n> **The Trial:**\n> \n> The information above does not prove anything, it just makes the case for the importance of vitamin D more plausible. What we really needed were randomized trials to show that increasing vitamin D has beneficial effects. Although many randomized trials of vitamin D are now underway as of early September 2020, those studies have not been published.\n> \n> There was recently a small trial of the active form of vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D, Calcifediol), which is produced from vitamin D3 in the liver. The trial was called [\"Effect of Calcifediol Treatment and best Available Therapy versus best Available Therapy on Intensive Care Unit Admission and Mortality Among Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19: A Pilot Randomized Clinical study\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7456194/) This trial appears to show a giant reduction in the need for intensive care following the administration of the active form of vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D, Calcifediol), (2% in the calcifediol arms of the study vs. 50% in the no calcifediol arm). The arms of the trial seem to be fairly well balanced with fairly even risk factors in each group. C-reactive protein levels, a marker of inflammation, were higher in the control arm, but not by a lot.\n> \n> It should be noted that 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcifediol) is not vitamin D3, it's a related compound. Our bodies make calcifediol from vitamin d3. But 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcifediol) is faster acting and more potent by weight, since it can act directly instead of needing to be converted in the liver. Supplementing vitamin D3 will surely raise 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcifediol) levels in the body, but it won't necessarily raise 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels as quickly or effectively as 25-hydroxyvitamin D itself. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcifediol),\n> \n> **Take away:**\n> \n> During these coming winter months it's going to be especially important to go out of your way to get vitamin D for you and for people who may be at high risk of having severely negative outcomes of covid-19. Vitamin D deficiency is common, especially in winter months, but it could become even more common when people are trying to stay in their houses as much as possible to limit the spread of Sars-CoV-2. Generally, taking between 2000 iu (50 mcg) to 4000 iu (100 mcg) of vitamin D per day is enough to raise vitamin D levels while also not being toxic. Sun exposure, can be another good way, but the amount of vitamin D your body produces will be dependent on skin color, latitude, time of day, weather, and the amount of skin you have exposed.\n> \n> **TL;DR**\n> \n> There's more evidence supporting vitamin D supplementation to help combat the most severe negative outcomes of COVID-19. It's highly advisable that you are everyone in your orbit make sure they aren't vitamin D deficient, either naturally through getting enough vitamin D producing sun exposure or through supplementation.\n> \n> _Note: there is still not enough evidence to prove that vitamin D has a big effect or even any effect at all. Larger confirmatory studies are needed._\n>",

Of all the samples 16% contained  less than 13,000 IU/100 grams (less than 200,000 IU in the entire  liver.), 45% had 33,000-100,000 IU/100 grams (495,000-1,500,000 IU in  the entire liver.), while 9% contained more than 167,000 IU/100 grams  (more than 2,505,000 IU in the entire liver) and 1% of the subjects had  concentrations above 333,333 IU/grams (concentrations above 4,999,995 IU  in the entire liver, that's one fifth the vitamin A content of Polar  Bear liver!). The study concluded that the vitamin A  status of all Singaporean ethnic groups is reasonably  satisfactory,   although vitamin A deficiency  is  not  uncommon  in  the  neighbouring  populations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Vitamin B12             | Range and average values are reported for the vitamin B12  content of liver tissue obtained at autopsy from 132 individuals. The  average value for all age groups was approximately 70 mcg/100 grams of wet  tissues (1,050 mcg in the entire liver). In cirrhosis the average value was 26 mcg/100 grams of wet tissues (390 mcg in the entire liver). It was  concluded that there are no apparent differences in vitamin B12  stores in the various age groups (although the highest values present were in humans over 40, contradicting this statement). The highest value in a single person was 141 mcg/100 grams of wet tissues (2,115 mcg in the entire liver), while the lowest was just 6 mcg/100 grams of wet tissues (90 mcg in the entire liver!, albeit in the case of cirrhosis). The study concluded that the amount of vitamin stored is  relatively large in terms of requirement and is probably sufficient to  last for a period of several years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Vitamin C               | The tissues used for analysis were obtained from hospital autopsies and used within 24 hours after death. The quantities and relative distributions of vitamin C, found by direct chemical titration of human tissues from 67 hospital autopsies, were found to correspond fairly closely with data obtained from titration of guinea pig tissues. The general order according to concentration was adrenal, brain, pancreas, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, heart, muscle. In the younger age groups the thymus content was about as high as that of the pancreas. The average values ranged from about 55 mg/100 grams for adrenal tissue, down to about 4mg/100 grams for heart tissue. Individual cases varied from approximately 3 times higher than the average, down to less than 0.1 the average values. The average for each of the tissues from those under 10 years of age was distinctly higher than from those over 10 years of age. Approximately 20% of the cases gave evidence of a condition of latent scurvy. The highest amount of vitamin C present in a person in adrenal tissue was 130 mg/100 grams (3 months old), while the lowest was 2.7 mg/100 grams /70 year old. It should be noted that another person, just 6 years younger (64 year old), has levels of 70 mg/100 grams, indicating that the 70 year old was indeed deficient.                        |\n| Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B7 (Biotin)                | The   vitamin B6 content of  40  human    malignant tumors and samples of   human normal tissue was  determined, as  well  as  the  biotin   content of malignant tumors    and   9 samples   of  human    normal tissue.   The   vitamin    B6 content    of  all  malignant tumors, irrespective of  origin,   fell  within    a  narrow range    of 33   to   135  mcg/100 grams. This   range    was similar   to  that   of  those   normal    tissues   having   a  low vitamin B6  content. The    various normal tissues studied had   a  wide   range    of  values,    from 60 to 890  mcg/100 grams. The   biotin    content of  all malignant    tumors fell  within    the   range    of O to 16  mcg/100 grams, while   the   normal tissues   had   a  range of 3  to 66  mcg/100 grams. The   vitamin content of the   neoplasms did   not   seem   to   bear   any   relation to  the   vitamin content of  the   surrounding normal tissue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Vitamin D3              |  A study of the Inuit living in Greenland has found that the more  western-type foods, such as fruits, vegetables, breads and pastries,  milk and milk products, the local indigenous Inuits ate, the lower the  vitamin D level in their blood was. And, conversely, the more  traditional Inuit foods like meat and fat they consumed (that is, the  more they retained the paleo-ketogenic diet), the higher the vitamin D  level was in their blood. The Inuit had vitamin D3 levels of around 30 ng/ml. The vitamin D3 blood levels in the Komi living a traditional life in  the tundra and those living in town showed a significant difference. The vitamin D levels of the Komi herdsmen were 28-32 ng/ml, while the vitamin D levels of the Komi town dwellers were around 18 ng/ml. The distribution of vitamin D and its metabolites in human  tissues has been studied by the combined use of radioactive  cholecalciferol and biological assays of antiricketic activity in tissue  extracts. Injected radioactive cholecalciferol was cleared rapidly  from the blood; unchanged vitamin D and various metabolites were  detected subsequently in all tissues examined. The highest concentration  of biological activity and radioactivity was in fat; this and, to a  lesser extent, other tissues were shown to retain activity over a  prolonged period of time.   |\n| Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) | Riboflavin was estimated by a fluorimetric method in the organs  of 6 persons killed in accidents and presenting no apparent  abnormalities. The values in fresh tissue were 1.8 to 2.8 mg/100 grams for liver, 1.3 to 1.7 mg/100 grams for heart, 0.3 to 0.4 mg/100 grams for lungs, 1.3 to 2.8 mg/100 grams for kidney and  0.3 to 1.2 mg/100 grams for brain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\nGenerally vitamin levels were lower in sick people, and in the case of vitamin D3, the levels of the Komi herdsmen were almost twice as high as the levels of the Komi town dwellers. Vitamin B6 and biotin (Vitamin B7) were both lower in tumors as well. Regarding Vitamin A, B12, C, B6, B7 and B2, the studies were done on \"normal\" people, so it is not related to the vitamin levels of carnivorous humans. Vitamin A and B12 are great examples of the massive differences between the low end and the high end, and just how much Vitamin A, B12 (along with other vitamins not mentioned) the human body can store (I would be interested if anyone has any information on the vitamin/mineral levels in people like the Inuit/Komi herdsmen. Obviously the ones that eat their ancestral diet.) In comparison, those sick and ill usually had low vitamin A and B12 stores, making them even weaker. Low vitamin/minerals levels could be a potential cause for many diseases, while also hindering the person's ability to heal said diseases.\n\nThank you for reading, and please, if you have any information to add or something to correct (bad grammar, false information), it would be appreciated. I would be particularly interested in more information for this post, as it is hard to find. I will probably make a post about mineral levels in human tissue, as well, eventually.\n\nSources:\n\n- [Vitamin A](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19937610_Vitamin_A_reserve_of_liver_in_health_and_coronary_heart_disease_among_ethnic_groups_in_Singapore)\n\n- [Vitamin B12](http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/bloodjournal/12/1/24.full.pdf?sso-checked=true)\n\n- [Vitamin C](http://www.jbc.org/content/106/2/525.full.pdf)\n\n- [Vitamin B6](http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/9/11/689.full.pdf)\n\n- [Vitamin D3](https://www.paleomedicina.com/en/vitamin_D_sunshine_vitamin_cause_of_vitamin_d_deficiency)",

We have admired the work of this sub for many years.\n\nThe authors are experts in vitamin D/ immunoloy. We immediately saw the relationship between the corona virus and the ongoing, world-wide epidemic of vitamin D deficiency and wrote this paper to inform the world and it was ignored.\n\nWe noticed that the immune system has been pretty much ignored in favor of completely unproven practices like distancing and masks.\n\nIT’S VITAMIN D, STUPID\n\nEvery aspect of the Covid-19 pandemic (except the virus, itself) is explained by the on-going world-wide epidemic of vitamin D deficiency. The world is deficient in vitamin D. For the past 15 years, hundreds of studies have found vitamin D deficiency to be endemic from Labrador to Lima, from Wuhan to Wellington. Vitamin D is essential to multiple systems in the body. One of those systems is the immune system that protects you from viruses. Another is the respiratory system, the lungs. Vitamin D deficiency opens you up to virtually every pulmonary disease from the common cold to Lung cancer. Vitamin D deficiency causes a double whammy with Covid-19.\n\nIt has long been recognized that seasonal Influenza is associated with seasonal changes in vitamin D secondary to seasonal changes in sunlight. Multiple studies have found that vitamin D levels are negatively correlated with many pulmonary pathologies ranging from emphysema to asthma. Vitamin D plays an important role in the process of innate immunity and vitamin D deficiency can be described as a form of immune-deficiency. Vitamin D supplements have been therapeutic in multiple forms of respiratory disease.\n\nCovid-19 is a new virus of the Corona family, related to SARS and MERS. It was first described in November, 2019, in Wuhan, China. It is very infectious, is spreading rapidly and can now (April, 2020) be found throughout the world. It has proven to be exceptionally lethal as respiratory viruses go, especially when it infects individuals with serious pre-existing conditions.\n\nVitamin D deficiency interacts with latitude, altitude, sunlight, diet, air pollution, cigarette smoking, age, air pollution, skin color, obesity and all of these factors came together in places like Wuhan and Teheran and Seattle and New York. B-type Ultraviolet light (280-315 nm) (UVB), the frequency of light at which vitamin D is produced in the skin, changes intensity as one moves either north or south from the equator. Hence, 15 minutes of direct sunlight produces more vitamin D at the Mexican-American border than at the American-Canadian border. It also changes with the changing tilt of the planet as it move through its yearly orbit. In autumn, when the Earth tilts away from the Sun in the Northern hemisphere, vitamin D production is reduced. At my latitude, 40°N, the intensity of UVB on skin produces vitamin D between March 15 and October 15. Further south, the number of vitamin D producing days is greater, further north it is less.\n\nVitamin D Deficiency causes a state of increased systemic oxidative load in the body, raising the level of systemic inflammation. Cigarette smoking, obesity, age and air pollution are additional sources of inflammation. According to the popular press, the following cities are or have been centers of Covid-19 infection: Wuhan, China is at 30.56° N and experiences heavy air pollution , Teheran, Iran is at 35.70° N and experiences heavy air pollution, Milan, Italy is at 45.46° N and experiences heavy air pollution, Seattle, USA is at 47.60° N and experiences heavy air pollution, New York, USA is at 40.71° N and experiences heavy air pollution, Los Angeles, USA is at 34.05 and experiences heavy air pollution. At this time of year, the people living in these cities are experiencing their lowest vitamin D levels of the year and it is lower still because of air pollution. Covid-19 has been particularly lethal to elderly men. In China, smoking is much more prevalent in men than women. Age and smoking are both risk factors for vitamin D deficiency.\n\nDiseases of the kidney, liver, lungs, digestive tract, pancreas and, perhaps, the heart are associated with vitamin D deficiency. So, when an elderly, dark skinned, over-weight, male, smoker, suffering from one or more of these comorbidities contracts Covid-19 and dies, the primary cause of death could be described as vitamin D deficiency with multiple contributing factors.\n\nAir pollution interacts with vitamin D deficiency at multiple levels (20). High altitude aerosols alter the frequency of ambient UVB reducing its ability to generate Vitamin D in the skin. Low altitude (visible) air pollution (PM2.5) acts as a barrier to UVB, reducing its intensity, altering the skin’s ability to produce vitamin D. People who live away from the sun: shift-workers, miners, shut-ins (shelerers-in-place), nursing home residents are vitamin D deficient. Submariners are supplemented with vitamin D. When we spend time in the summer sunshine, our skin becomes “tan”. This is to protect us from too much UVB. Highly pigmented skin does not absorb UVB as well as light colored skin. People with dark colored skin are much more likely to be vitamin D deficient. Immigrants who have highly pigmented skin, who move north, such as Africans who relocate to London, are at serious risk of vitamin D deficiency and all the diseases that go with it. African Americans are likely to be vitamin D deficient which explains Covid-19 hot spots in cities like New Orleans, Chicago and St. Louis. On this point, people with dark skin frequently cannot digest milk. That deprives them of the primary dietary source of vitamin D, fortified milk products.\n\nFew vitamin D-rich foods are in a usual diet: Fatty fish, egg yolk, mushrooms, blubber. Fortified foods are the chief dietary sources of vitamin D. Those foods vary by country but vitamin D fortified milk is commonly consumed by children. This might explain why Covid-19 has had a reduced impact on children. We feed our children vitamin D fortified food but not ourselves. A note: the manufacture of active Vitamin D in the liver and kidneys absolutely requires adequate amounts of magnesium as cofactor. Magnesium is frequently deficient from the usual diet and should be provided to insure adequate vitamin D.\n\nA 2000 IU capsule of vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) will cost about a nickel (15 minutes in the noon-day sun is free) and a 500 mg tablet of Magnesium Oxide about the same are available at Amazon, E-Bay or any healthfood store. The two together, every morning, will prevent deficiency and strengthen your immune system Many pathologies are associated with vitamin D deficiency, ranging from hypertension to macular degeneration … but that is for another day.\n\nAUTHORS: JAMES LANDAUER, B.S. and THOMAS BURKE, PhD.",

While this is partially true however throughout the body certain cells can activate cholecalciferol in situ and we must also understand that in it's cholecalciferol (before the first hydroxylation) it has been shown to stabilise endothelial function and enable the signalling that inhibits inflammation. Because the half-life of cholecalciferol is just 24 hours in serum only daily cholecalciferol dosing maintaining natural 25(OH)D levels well above 40ng/ml 100nmol/l enable these actions.

        "body": "Abstract:\n>We previously determined that different vitamin D metabolites can have opposite effects on C2C12 myotubes, depending on the sites of hydroxylation or doses. Specifically, 25(OH)D3 (25VD) has an anti-atrophic activity, 1,25(OH)2D3 induces atrophy, and 24,25(OH)2D3 is anti-atrophic at low concentrations and atrophic at high concentrations. This study aimed to clarify whether cholecalciferol (VD3) too, the non-hydroxylated upstream metabolite, has a direct effect on muscle cells.\n\n>Assessing the effects of VD3 treatment on mouse C2C12 skeletal muscle myotubes undergoing atrophy induced by interleukin 6 (IL6), we demonstrated that VD3 has a protective action, preserving C2C12 myotubes size, likely through promoting the differentiation and fusion of residual myoblasts and by modulating the IL6-induced autophagic flux. The lack, in C2C12 myotubes, of the hydroxylase transforming VD3 in the anti-atrophic 25VD metabolite suggests that VD3 may have a direct biological activity on the skeletal muscle. Furthermore, we found that the protective action of VD3 depended on VDR, implying that VD3 too might bind to and activate VDR. However, despite the formation of VDR-RXR heterodimers, VD3 effects do not depend on RXR activity.\n\n>In conclusion, VD3, in addition to its best-known metabolites, may directly impact on skeletal muscle homeostasis.",

We have been at this for 3 weeks now, and still have no clear diagnosis. \n\nDate format I will be using (as will most of the images / tests) is (MM/DD/YYYY). Blood work format is (DD/MM/YYYY)\n\n**Patient information:**\n\n\\[Age\\] 60 years old.\n\nDiabetic (T2).\n\nHigh cholesterol (CHOL 6.4, HDL 1.29, LDL 4.64) \n\nNo hypertension, but did show low blood pressure over the last couple of tests (110/60).\n\nThere is a history of heart issues (prolapsed valve, diagnosed at a young age).\n\nNo other chronic illnesses.\n\nHeight is 167 cm (5’5).\n\nWeight is 56 kg (123 lbs). Was 70 kg about 2 years ago.\n\nMiddle-eastern.\n\n\\[Sex\\] Male.\n\nDoesn’t drink or smoke.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current symptoms:**\n\n* Primary complaint: heat / pressure / numb sensation in the head. Gets very close to causing fainting.\n   * He’s having difficulty relaying exactly how this feels. He believes it is not a headache, but rather the feeling of being jet-lagged x 100. Sometimes explains it as heat and someone pulling his scalp from the sides.\n   * The pain is not 100% all of the time, but it never fully goes away. Some days he will get half of the day with only slightly dealing with the pain and other days he doesn’t want to / can’t leave the house.\n* Fatigue.\n* General loss of sensitivity in skin and peripherals (numbness).\n   * Wakes him up constantly from his sleep (which in and of itself is causing a lot of issues for him). He says as soon as he falls asleep on his head / arm whatever it is, it will start to go numb.\n   * He also says when he feels water on his skin, it feels like there’s a thin layer between him and the liquid.\n* There was loss of appetite and weight that seems to be improving recently (after he started taking insulin).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current medications:**\n\n* Tresiba (insulin degludec) - Long term insulin. \n   * 24 hour insulin (dosage set to 6 - 8 units).\n      * Started 1 week ago\n* NovoRapid - Short term insulin. \n   * 2 of the 4 hour insulin. Taken with breakfast and lunch (dosage set to 4).\n      * Started 11 days ago\n* Metformin (Glucophage).\n   * Started 3 years ago\n\n**Tests that have been performed, images and results are below.**\n\n**Useful history:**\n\nThe fatigue and numbness has started with him back in 2017, and makes a reappearance every now and then. Generally when it happens it is debilitating. There were a couple of times back then where he couldn’t work anymore and spent a lot of time going to the ER and his main hospital’s doctors (no issue was found).  He also had days over the past few years where he would wake up out of breath.\n\nHe has known he’s diabetic for over 15 years. Up until 3 years ago, he has treated it with exercise and diet. He would walk for a long time before going to bed (until his sugar drops to the 80’s). When his symptoms started appearing, he assumed it was caused by his diabetes. Doctors have not confirmed his suspicion and told him his diabetic tests are fine and should not be causing such severe symptoms. At some point around June, he visited a doctor who pointed him in the direction of **Metformin (Glucophage)**. He has been taking it ever since. Using a combination of exercise, diet and the new-found Metformin, my father kept his sugar levels in-check. However, he noticed that without exercise or after a non-restricted meal, his sugar goes well within the 300 range.\n\nMore recently (past 11 days) he started taking **insulin (NovoRapid)** and a 24-hour shot **(Tresiba)**. After taking insulin, his situation has noticeably improved, but not resolved. So, now he is just living with the belief that this will eventually deteriorate to a point his body cannot recover from.\n\n**Tests performed:**\n\n* **CT-Scan** (11-30-2019)\n   * [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/24qzyrewisc4gsg/AABbc4DrR48t8jTX92dZ1fr\\_a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/24qzyrewisc4gsg/AABbc4DrR48t8jTX92dZ1fr_a?dl=0)\n* **Blood work** (12-01-2019)\n   * [https://www.dropbox.com/s/qpmgnu67bchzanz/lab-test-01-12-2019.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qpmgnu67bchzanz/lab-test-01-12-2019.pdf?dl=0)\n   * Low MPV\n      * **Normal range 7.4 - 10.4 (Patient value: 5.72)**\n   * Vitamin-D Insufficiency (25-OH-Cholecalciferol)\n      * Deficiency range < 50\n      * **Insufficiency range 50 - < 75  (Patient value: 52.9)**\n      * Sufficiency range 75 - 250 nmol/L\n* **MRI Brain + MRI Angio Brain Circle of Willis** (12-11-2019)\n   * [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/j5sytdct71j1ga5/AABzEP5fBCuZpz541vw\\_13ffa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/j5sytdct71j1ga5/AABzEP5fBCuZpz541vw_13ffa?dl=0)\n   * MRI report: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/wlpo0n859d21dra/Report%20Text.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wlpo0n859d21dra/Report%20Text.txt?dl=0)\n* **(older blood work) (06-22-2017).

Magnesium is also crucial for bone health, as it helps regulate calcium metabolism.\n\nMetabolism - \nBoron can help the body absorb and use magnesium more effectively, which can boost metabolism and improve blood glucose levels. Magnesium is also important for metabolizing carbohydrates, and deficiencies can make insulin resistance worse.\n\nOsteoporosis -\nSome preliminary research suggests that boron supplements can reduce the amount of calcium and magnesium lost in urine.

Supposedly, having a mutation where your body doesnt produce myostatin has no negative consequences. While I doubt that, I have actual confidence in the fact that Epicatechin will reduce the quality of the muscle THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE. I would only reccomend trying it if A, you are going purely for aesthetic, B, you have yet to start your muscle gaining journey, or C, you are absolutely struggling to put on muscle mass. I am confident that it is legitimate in its ability to make you gain muscle faster, but I am also confident that it is not worth it if you care about speed or athleticism",

However, it's been proving more difficult than expected.\n\nWe finally settled on a manufacturer, [NutraScience Labs](https://www.nutrasciencelabs.com/), and sent them a purchase order yesterday, after being assured that they could meet all our requirements, including using only vegan ingredients. However, this morning they got back saying *they can't make it vegan after all*. :p\n\nSo we're stuck. And the main sticking point is the **Vitamin D3**, aka [cholecalciferol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol).\n\nPretty much all supplemental D3 is manufactured from lanolin, the oil in sheep's wool. So it's not vegan. Vegetarian, perhaps, but not vegan.\n\nThere is one company, [VitaShine](http://vitashine-d3.com/), that makes a D3 from lichen and markets itself as the only vegan D3 available.\n\nBecause our optimal mix uses Vitamin D3 and must be vegan, we figured we could find a manufacturer that would use VitaShine's vegan D3. But after more than two months of searching and talking with different manufacturers, we could not find a single one that carried VitaShine D3 or would buy it to use in our premix. Turns out it's orders of magnitude more expensive than lanolin-based D3, and hardly anyone uses it. The only way we could get it would be to pay for an entire minimum order of VitaShine D3 ourselves, which is way more D3 than we could ever use at our current rate, and way out of our price range.\n\nHowever, there is another form of Vitamin D which *is* vegan: **Vitamin D2**, or [ergocalciferol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergocalciferol).\n\nBoth D2 and D3 are commonly used and many studies show them to be equally effective, but D3 has gained popularity perhaps due to [a frequently-cited study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15531486) showing that D3 is more effective than D2.\n\nTo be fair, the study specifically showed that a single megadose (50,000 IU) of Vitamin D3 elevated Vitamin D levels in the blood for 28 days afterward, while the same megadose of Vitamin D2 elevated Vitamin D levels for a shorter period of time before dropping off. [Other studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2266966/) where subjects took D2 or D3 daily showed the two forms to be equal in their effect on blood levels of Vitamin D.\n\nSo we could easily make our mix vegan by using D2 instead of D3. Because it would be taken daily, my understanding is that the effect would be the same. The downside is that people will complain that we are using an \"inferior\" form of Vitamin D, and it's possible that there are important differences between D2 and D3 that are not currently understood (kind of like Vitamin K1 and K2).\n\n**What do you think?** Especially if you're vegan, what would you say?\n\nTo help in understanding this problem and its possible solutions, I looked at some competing products that claim to be vegan.\n\nInterestingly, some of them use D2, but many use D3.\n\nVegan products that use Vitamin D2, ergocalciferol:\n\n* Soylent 1.5 - [\"Vitamin D2 (as Ergocalciferol)\"](http://files.soylent.com/pdf/soylent-nutrition-facts-1-5-en.pdf)\n\n* Huel - [\"Vitamin D2 (as Ergocalciferol)\"](https://huel.com/pages/nutritional-information-and-ingredients#ingredients)\n\nVegan products that use Vitamin D3, cholecalciferol:\n\n* Joylent Vegan - [\"Vitamin D3\"](https://www.joylent.eu/products/joylent-vegan)\n\n* Jake - [\"cholecalciferol\"](https://jakefood.com/compare/)\n\n* Vexx - [\"vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)\"](http://vexx.eu/nutrition-label/?tve=true)\n\n~~I'm pretty sure that neither Joylent Vegan, Jake, nor Vexx use VitaShine's vegan D3, because VitaShine *requires* that you put their logo on your product packaging if you use their D3 as an ingredient! And I don't see it anywhere. So if that's the case, then technically, none of those products are *actually* vegan.~~ Fortunately, it looks like [Joylent and Jake claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/3b1s1r/vegan_alternatives_in_europe_and_vitamin_d3/) to use VitaShine's D3 in their vegan products!\n\n**But does anyone even care?**\n\nLet me know what you think, whether you're vegan or not! Thanks. :)",

        "body": "Jack Norris is a prominent vegan RD who has studied the D3 vs D2 debate extensively.  He links to many papers on [this page](http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/bones#d2d3).  The tl;dr is that D3 has been shown to be 'more effective' than D2 in a few studies, but these studies also show that D2 was 'effective enough' at raising blood D levels.  Some studies have indicated that vitamin D is better absorbed when taken with vitamin K2, although I'm not sure if your products will have any K2.  Also, D absorption increases when taken with fat, which people will definitely have with your products. ;)\n\nPersonally I am fine with a supplier using D2, *however*, I am more concerned with the quantity.  I know that 400 IU is the current recommended amount, but from what I have seen, that is an outdated standard based on how much sun people *used to get* and not how much sun the modern population gets.  It also seems to under-represent dark-skinned populations.  It is also a baseline considered to prevent obvious D deficiency, but not the optimal amount to promote long-term health.  One of my big complaints with Soylent and some of it's competitors is that they only hit the RDA for certain vitamins and ignore more recent science.  Since the toxicity limit for D is much higher than the RDA (especially for D2), I would prefer to see a product with 800 or even 1000 IU versus the typical 400.  From what I recall, chronic toxicity with vitamin D supplementation has only been seen at 5000+ IU daily.  Obviously it would cost more to include 800 IU versus 400 IU, but D2 is cheap enough that it probably wouldn't hurt your bottom line much?",

All of this knowledge was gleaned from the textbook Biochemistry 7th ed. (Berg, Tymockzo), so it is decently valid.  As a disclaimer, I'm SURE vitamin lists have been posted here in the past, but this one is straight from the source (Biochemistry 7th. ed), so I thought it would be helpful to provide an updated list that is a little more valid. Lastly, the Anki card that I put these into had pictures as well, but I couldn't post them on reddit , so without further ado, here y'all go! Feel free to do whatever the hell you want with this list: look at it, copy-and-paste it, share it with your mom, put it on your grocery list, etc.\n\nvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv\n\n***(1)*** ***Vitamins*** are organic molecules that are needed in small amounts in the diets of some higher animals. In [biochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry), ***activation***, specifically called [***bioactivation***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioactivation), is where enzymes or other biologically active molecules acquire the ability to perform their biological function, such as inactive [proenzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proenzyme) being converted into active [enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzymes) that are able to [catalyze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalyze) their [substrates'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substrate_(chemistry)) reactions into [products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(biology)).\n\n***COFACTOR ENZYMES***\n\n***(2a)*** ***Vitamin*** *B1 (thiamine)* is the precursor of the cofactor *thiamine pyrophosphate*. This cofactor is *the prosthetic group for three important enzymes:* *pyruvate dehydrogenase*, *a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex*, and *transketolase*. In beriberi, the levels of pyruvate and a-ketoglutarate in the blood are higher than normal. The increase in the level of pyruvate in the blood is especially pronounced after the ingestion of glu- cose. \n\n***(2b)*** ***Vitamin*** *B2 (riboflavin)* is the precursor to *flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)* which is a coenzyme that is used in electron transport (as FADH2).\n\n***(2c)*** ***Vitamin*** *B3 (niacin)* is the precursor to *nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD+)* which is a coenzyme that is used in electron transport (as NADH).\n\n***(2d)*** ***Vitamin*** *B5 (pantothenic acid)* is the precursor to *coenzyme A (in acetyl-CoA)* which is a coenzyme that is used in many *central metabolic functions*.\n\n***(2e)***  ***Vitamin*** *B6 (pyridoxine)* is the precursor to *pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)*, which is a *prosthetic group that is central to the function of all aminotransferases*.\n\n***(2f)*** ***Vitamin*** *B7 (biotin)* is the precursor to *byocitin, which is* *a prosthetic group of* *pyruvate carboxylase* and serves as the carrier for activated CO2 in the conversion of pyruvate into oxaloacetate.\n\n***(2g)*** ***Vitamin*** *B9 (folic acid)* is a precursor to a coenzyme called *tetrahydrofolate*, which is involved in the correct formation of the neural tube in early development.\n\n***(2h)*** ***Vitamin*** *B12 (cyanocobalamin)* is the precursor to *cobalamin coenzymes*, which is a subclass of coenzymes which play three critical enzymatic functions: ***(a)*** *intramolecular rearrangements*, ***(b)*** *methylations*, ***(c)*** and reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides.\n\n📷  \n\n\n***NON-COFACTOR ENZYMES***\n\n***(3a) Vitamin*** ***A (retinol)*** is the precursor to a *chromophore called* *retinal*, the light-sensitive group in rhodopsin and other visual pigments.\n\n***(3b) Vitamin*** ***C (ascorbic acid)*** is an *antioxidant* responsible for the formation of stable collagen fibers (through the synthesis of 4-hydroxyproline, an amino acid necessary for collagen stability).\n\n***(3c) Vitamin*** ***D (calceferol,calcitriol)*** is generated through the modification of cholesterol, where 7-Dehydrocholesterol is photolyzed by the UV light from sunlight to previtamin D3, which isomerizes into vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), and is then converted to active vitamin D3 calcitriol) through hydroxylation reactions in the liver and kidneys.\n\n***(3d) Vitamin*** ***E*** ***(tocopherol)*** is an *antioxidant* that inactivates certain hydroxy radicals before they can oxidize unsaturated membrane lipids and damage cell structures.

    "body": "I’ve had extreme bruxism for most of my adult life, grinding thru night guards, waking up every morning with migraines, fatigue, and my adult molars wiggling like I’m 6 years old again waiting for the tooth fairy to come. I’ve tried every possible supplement and behavioral change the internet has to offer. \n\nLike many of you, I’m sure, I also have an extensive history of antibiotic use/gut issues. Many hardcore bruxers also have crohn’s disease, ibs, and fibromyalgia. I had chronic diarrhea as a child for many years (was thought to have crohn’s but just “grew out of it”), c. diff in my 20s, and SIBO in my 30s. Not to mention recurring sinus infections, chronic strep requiring hospitalization and IV antibiotics, and a bout of cholera from a trip to Cambodia. These details are just to paint a picture of how fucked my microbiome is. \n\nThe thing that was the most puzzling about my grinding is that it got so much worse when I took vitamin d supplements. I couldn’t take any multivitamins with even a small amount of d3 which is typically cholecalciferol. I would get worsening teeth grinding on top of new symptoms resembling osteomalacia (adult rickets) or fibromyalgia— all the bones and muscles from my hips down would ache. \n\nMy symptoms flew in the face of established research connecting vitamin d deficiency and bruxism and were particularly frustrating given my constant vit d deficiency. \n\nI also had a strange peeling on the inside of my cheeks and lips all the time that would go away for a week or so when i was on amoxicillin. That would also coincide with my grinding getting better. \n\nHang in there with me (or scroll down), I’m getting to the point soon. \n\nI recently went down a rabbit hole with my grinding and fibromyalgia-type symptoms after discovering the dr. Berg youtube video on B1 and vit d for bruxism, then the research on high dose thiamine from dr. Lonsdale and Elliot Overton and it’s implications on down regulation of the thiamine enzyme cascade. I went all in with the high dose from the start, eager for some kind of relief and experienced the paradoxical reaction (refeeding syndrome) myself where the symptoms I was looking to treat initially got worse with high dose supplements. Now I know why slow and steady wins the race!\n\nOnce I backed off the thiamine then slowly titrated back up, my body aches and extreme fatigue completely went away. But I was still tired, and still grinding. But that was the breakthrough in thinking that I needed. \n\nSeveral years ago I realized that my body couldn’t process normal vit d3 supplements. There are lots of reasons why this could be, maybe a genetic mutation, maybe bc of my altered microbiome — still trying to figure out the “why” of it all. I usually resorted to weekly tanning sessions, until I found another form of vitamin D that has been historically prescribed for people with chronic kidney disease called calcifediol — it’s just one more step further “activated” in the usual processing the stomach, liver, and kidneys do in the body from typical d3 pills. Finally I found a d3 supplement that didn’t make my grinding worse and make me feel like my bones were breaking! \n\nMy experience with the thiamine made me wonder, if maybe I just needed a lot more vitamin d in the form i could tolerate to stop the bruxism. And if the reason why it gets worse on traditional d3 is a kind of refeeding syndrome bc I’ve been deficient for so long, my body can no longer process it correctly. \n\nI’m now two weeks into taking 30,000 iu each day of calcifediol (along with my usual probiotic and multivitamin that doesn’t contain vit d) and my teeth are no longer loose, my headaches are gone, my mouth isn’t peeling, and I feel like a new person. If this continues, I might even be brave enough to try ditching the mouthguard! \n\nThe research on chronic thiamine deficiency and the metabolic/neurological implications are very new, but if my application of the overall theory to vitamin d deficiency is correct, I may be able to back off of the large doses of calcifediol and take normal d3 supplements again in a few months — assuming there isn’t an underlying genetic/permanent microbiome/immune system issue. \n\nAlso want to call out here that it’s not normal for even healthy people to lack sun exposure the way we do in modern society and that research indicates “traditionally living populations” have on average serum vit d levels far higher than the “healthy” range currently established by western medicine: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/traditionally-living-populations-in-east-africa-have-a-mean-serum-25hydroxyvitamin-d-concentration-of-115-nmoll/6188564A01361C5CF5F196229430E475 \n\nAlso, the ideal range for your body to feel good may just be higher than for others. This is also part of the thiamine research if you want to dive into it: some people may need to take it long term at high levels as a therapeutic to compensate for mitochondrial issues. \n\nSpeaking of mitochondria, the only other thing that has helped my grinding has been acetyl l-carnatine at 2000mg/day. \n\nHere is where I’ve been getting my vit d supplements:\n\nThere was a US company called d.velop that sold it over the counter but they are in the process of going out of business. There is also an affordable version from a UK company called Nouveau Healthcare that I’m currently using. \n\nIt is also safer/easier to take higher doses of calcifediol than traditional d3 bc you don’t need to worry about the k2 and magnesium cofactors to convert it, it’s already converted. \n\nAlso, shoutout to this post summarizing the research on glutamate in the brain and bruxism: https://www.reddit.com/r/bruxism/s/kVvFctB9Zj \n\nMy experience here is consistent with this theory as vit d helps protect against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity!\n\nI know so many people are suffering the way that I have, so hopefully this can help someone. Eager to hear your thoughts/experiences if you try it!\n\n\n",

Materials: The study was conducted from January to September. At the beginning of the study, 33 professional soccer players were enrolled; however, only 28 subjects (height 181.5 cm; body mass 77.81 ± 8.8 kg; body fat 12.38% ± 2.4% and muscle mass 40.27 ± 5.3 kg) completed the study. The research consisted of three stages. The first one, lasting 10 days, was conducted in January during a training camp in the south part of Cyprus at a latitude of 34 33°, where participants experienced natural sun exposure; it was called a winter sun exposure (WSE) period. The second stage, which was a supplementation period (SP), lasted 6 weeks, during which all subjects were randomly assigned either to an experimental group—EG (_n_ = 15)—or a placebo group—PG (_n_ = 13)—and were administered 6000 IU/d cholecalciferol or a placebo, respectively. The third stage took place in September, after summertime (summer sun exposure—SSE). The data of the 25(OH)D, free and total testosterone (fT, tT), cortisol as well as 5 and 30 m sprint tests (STs), power of the left leg (PLL) and VO2max were evaluated before and after the WSE period, the SP and SSE. Results: In January, the baseline value of vitamin D in 12 subjects was ≤20 ng/mL, and 14 of them had levels between 20–30 ng/mL and 2 individuals >30 ng/mL. After the WSE period, significant changes in 25(OH)D, fT, tT and cortisol concentration, as well as in the 5 m ST, were observed. After the SP, in the EG, significant changes were found in 25(OH)D, fT, tT and the 5 m ST. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the concentration of 25(OH) fT and tT was observed. After SSE, 2 out of 28 players had <20 ng/mL 25(OH)D, 12 of them had 25(OH)D between 20 and 30 ng/mL and 14 of them had 25(OH)D between 30 and 50 ng/mL. Significant differences in 25(OH)D, fT, tT concentration and the 5 m ST performance were observed following SSE compared with the WSE period. Conclusion: Due to the serum level of 25(OH)D demonstrated by most participants at the beginning of the study and after summertime, all-year-round supplementation with high doses of vitamin D seems to be a reasonable solution to enhance high 25(OH)D concentration in blood and physical performance. In the middle of the winter, almost half of the soccer players were serum deficient of 25(OH)D. After ten days of sun exposure and 6 weeks of vitamin D supplementation, the concentration of 25(OH)D significantly increased, as did testosterone and results in the 5 m sprint test also improved. Therefore, athletes should be constantly monitored for serum levels of 25(OH)D throughout the year and should be supplemented if deficiencies or insufficient amounts of this vitamin occur.\n> \n> **Keywords:** vitamin D, supplementation, soccer, testosterone, speed, power\n\n---\n\nFound here:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/foundmyfitness/status/1374086433955225600\n\n>Soccer players that supplemented with 6,000 IU of vitamin D significantly improved their blood vitamin D levels, **increased their free and total testosterone**, and performed better on the 5 m sprint test compared to the placebo group.",

    "body": "I am here to expose my theory, of what I consider could be one of the mechanisms behind the quinolone toxicity syndrome **(my opinion, I am not a medical authority)**.\n\nI suffered a severe reaction after only 2 applications of moxifloxacin eye drops, in total I applied 4 drops, two in each eye.  I have read in this group people who also had a severe reaction with topical quinolones.\n\nI was a healthy person and after those 4 drops, I was unable to walk for months to the point of almost rupturing my achilles and forearm tendons. I had to stop training and lost more than 20 kilos, I developed a plethora of neurological symptoms, tinnitus, vertigo, fasciculations, neuropathy, dysautonomia and a long list of other symptoms .... after what? only 4 drops!!! \n\nIn studies in healthy volunteers, a tear concentration of ofloxacin was observed of 5.7 - 31 micrograms/g for 40 minutes after the last dose on day 11. Peak serum concentrations of ofloxacin, after 10 days of topical dosing were approximately 1000 times lower than those reported after standard oral doses of ofloxacin.\n\nWould a ridiculous dose of 4 drops be enough to account for global mitochondrial damage affecting all organ systems of the body? Could an immunological reaction be a possible explanation in which it would make sense that the amount of drug would not correlate with the severity of the reaction? \n\nBefore taking moxifloxacin, I was taking cholecalciferol (vitamin D), omeoprazole, NAC, topical minoxidil (for growing my bear \\^\\^ ) daily and with the moxifloxacin treatment I was prescribed dexamethasone to reduce inflammation and naproxen. Guess what? Surprisingly enough, the only meds I can't tolerate under any circumstances because they cause severe tendon relapse, neurological symptoms and what appears to be a cascade of vascular inflammation with splinter hemorrhages in my hands, are the ones I take in conjunction with the moxifloxacin.\n\nI have tried taking them one by one, even when I fully recovered for two years, and they all activate that inflammatory response within a few hours.\n\nIt is amazing, but what is even more amazing is that I can tolerate ibuprofen, prednisone, esomeprazole, pantoprazole and topical finasteride with no problem, they are all analogous brothers to the drugs that cause brutal relapses in my body and yet I can take them with no problem.\n\nIf there was prior damage at the cellular level one should expect a similar result with those sister drugs, some of which are even more toxic than the ones I discussed at the beginning.\n\nI asked two guys from a whatsapp group in my city who had suffered an acute reaction to quinolones and they both had splinter hemorrhages in their nails, some very subtle, but they had started to notice them since taking the fluoroquinolone.\n\nOne told me that these hemorrhages were made much worse by taking a medicine that he had been taking since he was a child for an ADHD: atomoxetine and that he also associated the splinter hemorrhages with a general worsening of tendons and neurological symptoms. They changed his medication to viloxazine and all of his symptoms improved.\n\nWhat am I trying to say with this? Can the reaction by quinolones be divided into two phases? An acute phase, where regardless of the amount ingested, quinolones would produce direct toxic damage to tendons and tissues of the nervous system and this in turn, in some people due to genetic or multifactorial factors, activates an aberrant immune response, an inflammatory cascade mediated by a type III (antibody-mediated) or type IV (cellular mediated) hypersensitivity reaction that, for unknown reasons, in many cases, cannot be abated with drug withdrawal, causing persistent damage at the microcirculation level, which could be an explanation for the multiple symptoms that most of us experience?\n\nReferring to the flox report, although it is an old document, it comments on several things that I find interesting.\n\nI quote what it says: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*Blood has to travel all over the body in order to supply every cell of the body with nutrients and oxygen, and to remove the wastes from all the tissues. The blood has to be able to send its white blood cells into the surrounding tissue cells to clean it up and respond to injury.*  \n>  \n>*These functions of blood require that it can exchange its materials with its surrounding tissues. Arteries and veins are not designed for exchange but merely for transport. It is in the tissue where the exchange has to take place. Therefore, the capillaries (microvessels), which lie in the cellular matrix between arteries and veins, must be the regions for exchange. The quinolone antibiotics alter the cellular matrix and also target the vasa vasorum and vasa nervorum, either changing the capillaries permeability (the microvessels are one cell thick and allow the exchange of substances through openings), or inducing the deposition of immunological complexes inside them, or causing a spasm-like narrowing of their ducts, or simply chemically damaging them. In any case, the result is the same: muscles, skin, nerves, heart, brain and other organs are deprived of adequate blood flow (ischemia), and owerwhelmed by toxic intermetiate compounds and they die or do not work properly.*  \n>  \n>*For the sake of simplicity, in this report we call quinolone-vasculitis the degradation of the extracellular matrix plus an alteration of the microvessel walls with vascular damage or attending tissue injury.*  \n>  \n>*What nobody knows and requires much more research are the factors that determine the duration of disease, the type of tissues involved and their damage, as well as how to target therapies at inflammation without interfering with healing. Apparently, part of the process explained earlier is conveyed through an immune response of the body.*  \n>  \n>***Immune complexes with certain immuno-chemical characteristics activate a complementary cascade that induces neutrophil mediated damage to the vessel wall. The presence of granulocytes is usually associated with fibrinoid necrosis as would be expected on the basis of their release of toxic enzymes during inflammation. Necrosis in the vessel wall is a large contributor to scarring and the delayed sequelae present in some cases of vasculitis, such as the quinolone-induced vasculitis.***  \n>  \n>*Accumulation of inflammatory cells in the vessel wall is the common feature of common vasculitis, although it is not well understood how tissue damage occurs. It is widely admitted that there is a threestage process:*  \n>  \n>**1-** ***initiation of the injury***  \n>  \n>**2-** ***recruitment of inflammatory cells and tissue damage***  \n>  \n>**3-** ***regulation of the immune response.***  \n>  \n>***Quinolone vasculitis is a systemic vasculitide (so called because of its multi-organ nature). Inflammation and damage can be transient or more permanent. The alterations in coagulation and vasomotor tone result from local damage to the endothelium (inner part of the walls of the ducts of large caliber and is the only layer of the wall of microvessels) as well as intrinsic components of the cytokines that are released through the process. Drug toxicities are among the causes and processes strongly associated with vascular injury.***  \n>  \n>***Normally, quinolone vasculitis appears some time after exposure, and is a link in the chain of adverse events that take place for months on end. All of the vasculitides are likely secondary to some form of***  \n>  \n>***inflammatory stimulus, usually infectious or toxic, as in our case. In quinolone vasculitis the real underlying cause either cannot be identified (no doctor is willing to admit that quinolones are the direct cause of vascular disorders) or has long since been cleared by the host, leaving only a chronic or recurrent inflammation focused on the vasculature.***  \n>  \n>*Then, there is the issue of diagnosis. The diagnosis of vasculitis is fundamentally an invasive process (biopsy). A critical feature is the identification of inflammatory cells that diminish the delivery of blood to tissue. Furthermore, the numerous causes that may result in vasculitis can often be distinguished only at the cellular level. Histological studies characterizing injuries on the basis of the infiltrating cells may provide information on both the mechanisms inducing inflammation and predict the sequelae of the injuries. There is an urgent need to determine the underlying mechanism for appropriate treatment.*   \n>  \n>*For most floxed persons the blood studies may be entirely normal. There is no serological test that confirms or excludes a vasculitis. Quinolone-vasculitis is:*   \n>  \n>* Seronegative (non-ANCA, negative SSA, SSB, anti-Sm, normal anticardiolipine, antiphospholipid, soft muscle markers, halotypes....). This alone convinces all doctors that floxed persons do not have any alteration in their inmune system.*  \n>  \n> * Drug-induced, non-abating with drug withdrawal, delayed-onset, and typically reaches its acute phase many months after drug discontinuation, when the ischemic process has managed to kill enough nerves or cells. This is considered impossible by almost all doctors, although is a proven fact.*  \n>  \n> * Not responsive to any known treatment; very long lasting or permanent, because many nerves die and cannot be regenerated.*   \n>  \n>*Being non-ANCA, the floxing vasculitis is normally classified by some advanced doctors as drug-induced immuno-complex vasculitis that shares similarities with other immuno-complex vasculitides like systemic lupus erithematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren’s disease.*  \n\nCould it be that this loss of tolerance to medicines that we previously tolerated, particularly, in my experience, those that I have taken together with moxifloxacin, is due to a fight response of our immune system, which, after having suffered a toxic reaction from a drug, rejects anything exogenous that it considers a threat in a context of immune deregulation, so many people after taking cipro, levo etc... develop IgE-mediated drug allergies, mast cell syndromes and greater susceptibility to suffer side effects from the drugs....\n\nMolecules smaller than 1000 daltons do not have the capacity to provoke an immune response per se (what are known as haptens), but when they bind to plasma proteins, they form a new molecule of greater weight, that is, an antigen, and It does have the ability to stimulate immune cells by producing antibodies by B cells or stimulate T cells that in turn secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. \n\nQuinolones and other drugs could bind to albumin or other proteins, generating a cellular memory response that would be activated every time that substance was taken, generating the same symptoms typical of the chronic phrase of quinolone syndrome without it having to be a quinolone per se. .\n\nWould it make sense then that some patients would have benefited from biologic therapies such as infliximab, immunomodulatory drugs like IVIG etc...?\n\nThis should be investigated by those who screwed up our lives with these drugs. Until there is real interest on the part of the entire medical community to clarify what is behind quinolone toxicity syndrome, everything will be unknowns and unresolved questions.\n\n**It's just my theory, assumptions, I'm not a scientist nor do I claim to be.**\n\nAnd forgive me for my poor English, I'm trying to improve it without using the translator :)",

    "body": "Part I - **Introduction**\n--------------------------------------\n\nWelcome back to the second instalment of Research Review. In this series I do a review of several studies to figure out if there is academic consensus on a given topic. The goal of this is to make sidebar content for AdvancedFitness, since this has been requested previously. [Here is the previous RR I posted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/3ltpn0/research_review_the_positive_effects_of_the/). \n\nToday we're going to look at multivitamins and their purpose. I'm sure many of you take multivitamins, and you probably do it to avoid deficiencies and to fill the gaps in your diet. Before I begin, **I want to stress that this review deals specifically with multivitamins, not supplements in general. Please scroll down for a summary of the findings.**\n\n-----------------------\n\nSo what are **typical deficiencies** in the American population? Women are at greater risk for [iron and vitamin A deficiency](https://labdoor.com/article/nutritional-deficiencies-women-are-at-risk-for), especially if they are [pregnant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7283965). Vegans & vegetarians [may become b12 deficient](http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/20030618/vegetarian-diet-b12-deficiency). Black skinned people are at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency because the [\"melanin in the skin diminishes the ability to synthesize Vitamin D from the sun\"](https://labdoor.com/article/nutritional-deficiencies-women-are-at-risk-for). The elderly usually experience a decline in the gut absorption of micronutrients: [\"The age-related decline in the capacity to absorb calcium [56] appears due to a gut-resistance to the action of 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3 resulting from a loss of vitamin D receptors in the duodenal mucosa [57]\"](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/13800505_Nutritional_needs_of_seniors). The elderly may be at risk for vitamin b6, b12, d and calcium deficiency. \n\nThe American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's nutrition reports (CDC.gov) is [\"a series of publications that provide ongoing assessment of the U.S. population's nutrition status by measuring blood and urine concentrations of biochemical indicators\"](http://www.cdc.gov/nutritionreport/). \n\nThey found that between 2003 and 2006:\n\n> [\"Of all the nutrients listed, **the most people had vitamin B6, iron, and vitamin D deficiencies**, and the fewest people had  vitamin A, vitamin E, and  folate deficiencies.\" [...] \"However, for most nutrition indicators, deficiencies varied by age, gender, or race/ethnicity and could be as high as nearly one third of certain population groups.\"](http://www.cdc.gov/nutritionreport/pdf/4Page_%202nd%20Nutrition%20Report_508_032912.pdf). \n\nThis should give you a general idea of what you might be deficient in. The best way to be 100% sure of your micronutrient levels, is getting a blood test.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis brings us to **RDA**. Every country gives recommendations for micronutrient intakes. These RDAs are divided into age groups, and are designed for the general population. The problem here is that athletes usually have higher requirements for minerals (as well as fluids and macronutrients - but that is beyond the scope of this RR). Furthermore, the RDAs are usually enough to avoid deficiency, but being non-deficient is not the same as having optimal micronutrient levels, and this is especially true for athletes.\n\n> [\"For active individuals **a marginal deficiency in the nutrients may impact the body's ability to repair itself, operate efficiently and fight disease**, said Melinda Manore, researcher in the Colleges of Agricultural and Health and Human Sciences.\" [...] \"The stress on the body's energy producing pathways during exercise, the changes in the body's tissues resulting from training, an increase in the loss of nutrients in sweat, urine and feces during and after strenuous activity and the additional nutrients needed to repair and maintain higher levels of lean tissue mass present in some athletes and individuals may all affect an individual’s B-vitamin requirements, said Manore\"](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/56869.php)\n\nLarry Kenney from Pennsylvania State University states: \n\n> [\"The 2004 recommendations on water and sodium intake from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences are targeted primarily at sedentary Americans. **These guidelines for water and salt intake should not be applied to athletes**. Athletes who follow the IOM recommendations to the letter may actually put themselves at risk for unintended decreases in performance or even untoward health consequences.\"](http://www.gssiweb.org/Article/sse-92-dietary-water-and-sodium-requirements-for-active-adults)\n\nWeightlifting athletes may be particularly prone to the negative effects of vitamin D deficiency, because calcium requires vitamin D for optimal absorption. If absorption of calcium is hindered: \n\n> [\"Low vitamin D increases bone turnover, which increases the risk for a bone injury, like a stress fracture.\" [...] \"vitamin D [...] also aids in regulation of electrolyte metabolism, protein synthesis, gene expression, and immune function [10,28]. These vital functions are essential for all individuals, especially the elite and recreational athlete.\"] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3725481/)\n\nAn athlete may decide to supplement vitamin D. Unknowingly, he purchases D2: [\"Vitamin D3 increases the total 25(OH)D concentration [...] Vitamin D2 supplementation was associated with a decrease in 25(OH)D3,\"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256423512_Bioavailability_of_Vitamin_D-2_and_D-3_in_Healthy_Volunteers_a_Randomized_Placebo-Controlled_Trial)\n\nThis goes to show that there are **different forms of micronutrients**. These forms have different bioavailabilities and effects on the body. For example, magnesium oxide is maybe the most commonly supplemented form of magnesium. The problem is that [\"magnesium oxide may have an absorbable magnesium potency as low as 4%. 7 8\"](http://www.ancient-minerals.com/magnesium-sources/absorption/). I could write for days about micronutrient forms and bioavailability, but to keep it succinct: [multivitamins are usually filled with the cheapest and worst forms of vitamins and minerals](http://examine.com/insiders/multivitamins). If you want to learn more about magnesium check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3ixxkw/dietary_magnesium_is_positively_associated_with/cukru3k). To get more information about bioavailability check [this out] (http://nutrition.ansci.illinois.edu/sites/default/files/Chiba_ch15.pdf)\n\n--------------------------\n\nThis brings us to the concept of **antinutrients**: \n\n> \"Antinutrients in foods are responsible for deleterious effects related to the absorption of nutrients and micronutrients. However, some antinutrients may exert beneficial health effects at low concentrations.\" ([Shaidi, 1997 - \"Beneficial Health Effects and Drawbacks\nof Antinutrients and Phytochemicals in Foods\"](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/bk-1997-0662.ch001)). \n\nA very potent antinutrient is **phytic acid**. It is usually found in large concentrations in seeds, nuts, grains, legumes. [\"phytic acid [has the] ability to bind to essential minerals such as iron, zinc, calcium, and magnesium in the digestive tract and inhibit their absorption by the body.1,2\"](http://breakingmuscle.com/nutrition/dissecting-anti-nutrients-the-good-and-bad-of-phytic-acid). A consequence of this is that if a person is consuming a meal rich in phytic acid along with his daily multi, the minerals in the multi may be rendered less useful. The good news is that [vitamin C partly counteracts the negative effects of phytic acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/3ov6ai/if_phytic_acid_is_an_antinutrient_should_we_be/cw1ojey)\n\n[More info on phytic acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/3ov6ai/if_phytic_acid_is_an_antinutrient_should_we_be/cw1r059)\n\n---------------------------------\n\nThere are other factors that limit micronutrient absorption. These factors are the interactions between the nutrients, called **vitamin and mineral antagonism and synergy** [1] (http://www.traceelements.com/Docs/Nutrient%20Interrelationships-Minerals-Vitamins-Endocrines.pdf) [2](http://www.return2health.net/articles/vitamin-mineral-antagonists/). Micros that have synergy, enhance each other’s uptake (i.e. Vit D enhances calcium uptake, Vitamin C enhances iron uptake). There is also antagonism, [whereby micros inhibit absorption of other micros](https://labdoor.com/article/nutrient-nutrient-interaction-in-multivitamin-supplements). For example [calcium interferes with iron absorption, zinc uptake is hindered by minerals such as cal, mag, iron, because they share a transporter](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/3hssrs/calciums_effect_on_ironzinc_absorption_and_what/cuafwt6). \n\n**The takeaway here is that if you fill a multivitamin with micro antagonists, they will compete for absorption and hinder uptake levels.**\n\n---------------------------------\n\nThe last part of the introduction deals with what I call the size paradox of multivitamins. Simply put, [it is impossible to squeeze (common values) 400mg of magnesium, 600mg of calcium, 14mg iron, 10mg zinc, 500iu vitamin d, 500mg vitamin c, all the b vitamins, trace minerals, etc. into a small tablet](http://examine.com/insiders/multivitamins)). I have a bottle of Magnesium citrate 100mg tablets, and each tablet is twice the size of my multi. \n\n> [\"**12 multivitamins provided less vitamin A, vitamin C, or folate, or than claimed, some with less than 30% of the listed amounts**. These include a prenatal vitamin and products for men, adults (general), seniors, and even pets.\"](https://www.consumerlab.com/reviews/multivitamin_review_comparisons/multivitamins/)\n\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**Summary of introduction**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n- Common micronutrient deficiencies are: Vitamin D, iron, B6. Deficiency prevalence is population based (age, sex, skin color, lifestyle)\n- Multivitamins are usually filled with the cheapest and worst forms of vitamins and minerals\n- Reaching RDAs may prevent deficiency, but may not necessarily give you optimal levels\n- Athletes need more micros than sedentary individuals\n- Antinutrients and micronutrient antagonism severely hinder the absorption rates and bioavailability of MVs\n- The minerals and vitamins found in MVs won't physically fit into a neat little pill\n- Companies may lie on the contents label (goes for all supplements)\n\n**Summary of the review** (scroll down to see the studies)\n-----------------------------------------\n\n- Antioxidants such as vitamin C and E may help fight cancer (but they could also hinder athletic performance improvements)\n- Most research is done on the elderly\n- There is no clear consensus because of contradictory evidence. However, **the majority of the evidence points towards no effect**\n- Multivitamins have not been show to decrease risk of cancer or CV disease\n- Smokers may want to avoid MVs (especially ß-carotene)\n- High doses of fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A can be dangerous. Always check the bottle contents!\n\n**Final thoughts**\n-----------------------------------------\n**Research does not support the hypothesis that MVs give health benefits. This does not mean that targeted or isolated supplementation is useless!** For example, vitamin D3 supplementation has been shown to increase hormonal levels of vitamin D. You should probably figure out what you're deficient in and do targeted supplementation instead of buying a MV that probably won't do much for your health.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nPart II - **Studies**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nBefore looking at the studies, we must identify the possible sampling biases of multivitamin research. It is possible that people who take multivitamins do so as a way to self-medicate, because they feel unhealthy or know they have unhealthy lifestyles. It could also be the effect of marketing. In most of the studies I reviewed, the participants were aged 50+. This is an issue because they do not represent the entire population. Lastly, studies usually rely on self-reported questionnaires. The risk here is that people lie or modify the truth.\n\nI've tried to represent both sides of the debate as fairly as possible. I excluded studies with few participants, unclear methods, obvious spelling errors in the abstract (...), paid research (supplement marketing), very short trials, or generally poor design.\n\n[Example of excluded study with spelling errors, short trial, and likely paid]\n(http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/823/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00213-011-2481-3.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00213-011-2481-3&token2=exp=1447593072~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F823%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs00213-011-2481-3.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs00213-011-2481-3*~hmac=8196190f7a982c858dd95c955172ac80d284ff19ceb335859c4f9516a9be5104)\n\n[Example of excluded study because of purely self-reported statistics]\n(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16081445)\n\n\n[Example of excluded study because low N and (relatively) short trial]\n (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743504005778)\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Studies with evidence supporting multivitamin health benefits**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n**[Multivitamin Use and Risk of Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease in the Women's Health Initiative Cohorts](https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=414784)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2009\n-\tTime period: 1993-2005\n-\tParticipants: 161 808\n-\tAge: 50 to 79\n-\tInclusion criteria: postmenopausal women\n-\tExclusion criteria: alcoholism, drug dependency, dementia.\n\n> A total of 41.5% of the participants used multivitamins.\n\n**How they documented:**\n\n> Dietary supplement data were collected during in-person clinic visits.

We included fair- and good-quality randomized, controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness or safety of supplements in the primary prevention of CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality in the general adult population without a history of CVD or cancer. We included fair- and good-quality secondary prevention trials if they hypothesized effects on outcomes included in this review and not present at baseline in the study (for example, a trial of secondary skin cancer prevention that also reported on other cancers). We included only studies that were conducted among community-dwelling, nutrient-sufficient adults who had no chronic disease and were performed in countries with a Human Development Index of “very high” (11). We also required supplement doses to be lower than the upper tolerable limit set by the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board (12)\n\n**What they documented:**\n\n> We specifically sought studies of the following vitamins and minerals: vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C, D, and E; calcium; iron; zinc; magnesium; niacin; folic acid; ß-carotene; and selenium. We included studies that evaluated single, paired, and combinations of 3 or more vitamins and minerals; we use the term “multivitamin” to refer to those combinations.\n\n> We screened 12 766 abstracts, reviewed 277 full-text articles, and included 103 articles (26 studies) (Appendix Figure 2 of the Supplement). Four trials (19–22) and 1 cohort study (23) examined the benefits and harms of multivitamin supplementation (Supplement). Twenty-two trials and 2 cohort studies examined the benefits and harms of individual or paired supplements (Supplement): 6 studies of ß-carotene (24–29), 6 studies of vitamin E (22, 24, 30–33), 3 studies of selenium (33–35), 5 studies of vitamin A (23, 29, 36–38), 2 studies of vitamin C (30–31), 1 study of folic acid (39), 3 studies of vitamin D (40–42), 2 studies of vitamin D in combination with calcium (43–44), and 4 studies of calcium (40, 43, 45–46). The study sizes ranged from 128 to 72 337 individuals with average ages ranging from 22 to 77 years, although in most studies the mean age was older than 50 years (Supplement). Six studies were conducted among women only, 5 were conducted among men only, and the remaining studies were in mixed populations (24.2% to 84.7% women). The effects of the supplements were examined between 6 months and 16 years; most studies provided less than a decade of follow-up. \n\n\n**What they found:** \n> This review included 26 studies (24 randomized, controlled trials and 2 cohort studies) that examined the benefits and harms of using vitamin and mineral supplements for primary prevention of CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality in healthy individuals without known nutritional deficiencies. **We found no consistent evidence that the included supplements affected CVD, cancer, or all-cause mortality in healthy individuals without known nutritional deficiencies.** Other systematic reviews have arrived at this same conclusion (56–66). The certainty of this result is tempered, however, because few fair- or good-quality studies are available for all supplements except vitamin E and ß-carotene. For vitamin E, we identified 6 fair- to good-quality trials that produced clearly null effects on these end points. This result is consistent with the conclusions of other systematic reviews and meta-analyses of vitamin E (67–71). **Our review also confirmed the established harm of ß-carotene supplementation on lung cancer incidence and death for individuals at high risk for lung cancer (24, 29, 72)**. Further, we identified 6 trials that failed to detect any benefit from ß-carotene supplementation for any individuals.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n**[Dietary Supplements and Mortality Rate in Older Women](https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1105975)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2011\n-\tTime period: 1986-2008\n-\tParticipants: 38 772 \n-\tAge: Mean age: 61,6\n-\tInclusion criteria: Female\n-\tExclusion criteria: \"[...] excluding from all analyses those who did not adequately complete a questionnaire including food frequency and supplement use at baseline in 1986\"\n\n> Of these women, 99.2% were white and 98.6% were postmenopausal\n\n**How they documented:**\n\n> Food intake was assessed at baseline and in the 2004 follow-up, using 2 nearly identical versions of the validated 127-food item Harvard Service Food Frequency Questionnaire.\n\n> Supplement use was queried in 1986, 1997, and 2004 and included the 15 supplements assessed at all 3 surveys: multivitamins; vitamins A, beta-carotene, B6, folic acid, B complex, C, D, and E; and minerals iron, calcium, copper, magnesium, selenium, and zinc. Different forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol (D3) or ergocalciferol (D2), were not distinguished. At the baseline and 2004 follow-up surveys, the supplement-related questions were part of the Food Frequency Questionnaire. \n\n**What they documented:**\n\nMortality rates.\n\nThey excluded deaths that were \"related to injury, accident, and suicide, because it is unlikely that supplement use would be causally related to these outcomes.\"\n\n**What they found:** \n\n> [...] most of the supplements studied were not associated with a reduced total mortality rate in older women. In contrast, we found that several commonly used dietary vitamin and mineral supplements, including multivitamins, vitamins B6, and folic acid, as well as minerals iron, magnesium, zinc, and copper, were associated with a higher risk of total mortality. Of particular concern, supplemental iron was strongly and dose dependently associated with increased total mortality risk. Also, the association was consistent across shorter intervals, strengthened with multiple use reports and with increasing age at reported use. Supplemental calcium was consistently inversely related to total mortality rate; however, no clear dose-response relationship was observed.\n\n> Also, supplement users were more likely to have lower intake of energy, total fat, and monounsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids and to have higher intake of protein, carbohydrates, polyunsaturated fatty acids, alcohol, whole grain products, fruits, and vegetables.\n\n**Limitations:**\n**Does not strictly deal with multivitamins**, but still interesting\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**[Enough Is Enough: Stop Wasting Money on Vitamin and Mineral Supplements](http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1789253)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2013 (META-ANALYSIS)\n\n**How they documented:**\nThe authors did a meta-analysis of other studies\n\n**What they found:** \n\n> The large body of accumulated evidence has important public health and clinical implications. **Evidence is sufficient to advise against routine supplementation**, and we should translate null and negative findings into action. The message is simple: **Most supplements do not prevent chronic disease or death, their use is not justified, and they should be avoided**. This message is especially true for the general population with no clear evidence of micronutrient deficiencies, who represent most supplement users in the United States and in other countries (9).\n\n> **In conclusion, ß-carotene, vitamin E, and possibly high doses of vitamin A supplements are harmful.** Other antioxidants, folic acid and B vitamins, and multivitamin and mineral supplements are ineffective for preventing mortality or morbidity due to major chronic diseases. Although available evidence does not rule out small benefits or harms or large benefits or harms in a small subgroup of the population, we believe that the case is closed— supplementing the diet of well-nourished adults with (most) mineral or vitamin supplements has no clear benefit and might even be harmful. These vitamins should not be used for chronic disease prevention. Enough is enough.\n\n**Limitations:**\nAuthors seem emotionally invested in the outcome of the debate.

Among former smokers, there was no significant increase noted (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.84–1.45). In a sample of 47 common multivitamins, beta-carotene was present in 70% of the identified formulas. The median dosage of beta-carotene was 0.3 mg (range, 0–17.2 mg) daily.

At the request of an American Cancer Society volunteer, each enrollee completed a four-page mailed questionnaire in 1982 that requested information on history of cancer and other diseases, use of medicines and vitamins, use of alcohol and tobacco, diet, as well as other factors potentially affecting mortality. This analysis includes 1,063,023 people (453,962 men; 609,061 women) who, at enrollment, reported usable data on vitamin use.\n\n**How they documented:**\n\n> [...] each enrollee completed a four-page mailed questionnaire in 1982 that requested information on history of cancer and other diseases, use of medicines and vitamins, use of alcohol and tobacco, diet, as well as other factors potentially affecting mortality. \n\n**What they documented:**\n\n> [...] we classified deaths due to ischemic heart disease (ICD-9 codes 410–414), cerebrovascular disease (stroke) (ICD-9 codes 430–438), and all cancers combined, except nonmelanoma skin cancer (ICD-9 codes 140–195 and 199–209). We examined separately the three most common causes of cancer mortality: lung (ICD-9 code 162), colo-rectal (ICD-9 codes 153–154), and (for men) prostate (ICD-9 code 185) and (for women) breast (ICD-9 code 174), and all other cancers combined. All-cause mortality included persons who died of any cause.\n\n**What they found:**\n\n> **This large prospective study provides limited support for the hypothesis that multivitamin supplements may reduce death rates from ischemic heart disease in the general population**. Men and women who took a multivitamin without other supplements had lower death rates from ischemic heart disease than did those who took no multivitamins. However, the association was attenuated when analyses were adjusted for additional cardiovascular risk factors besides age, and no consistent gradient of decreasing risk was seen with either the frequency or the duration of multivitamin use. \n\n> **Men and women who used both multivitamins and vitamin A, C, or E had lower risks of dying from heart disease and stroke than did nonusers than one might expect from the relative risks for users of either only a multivitamin or only a vitamin A, C, or E supplement.** \n\n\n\n-----------------------------\n\n**[Multivitamin use and the risk of mortality and cancer incidence: the multiethnic cohort study] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3105257/)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2011\n-\tTime period: 1993-2005 (11 year average follow-up)\n-\tParticipants: 182 099 \n-\tAge: 45-75\n-\tInclusion criteria: Living in Hawaii and California, ethnic group\n-\tExclusion criteria: \"we excluded participants who were not in one of the targeted 5 ethnic groups (n = 13,991) or who reported invalid dietary intakes based on total energy intake or its components (n = 8,264) (12).

Subjects were asked to indicate whether they had used any of these supplements at least weekly during the previous year.\n\n> In a follow-up questionnaire approximately 5 years after baseline (1999–2003), participants were asked the same question on multivitamin use but without duration of use. \n\n**What they documented:**\n\n> During an average 11 years of follow-up, we identified 28,851 deaths (15,962 men and 12,889 women). Death from all causes was the primary endpoint in the analyses. In addition, according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10), we categorized the primary cause of death into cardiovascular diseases (ICD-9 codes 390–434, 436–448; ICD-10 codes I00–I78), cancer (ICD-9 codes 140–208; ICD-10 codes C00–C97), and all other causes.\n\n**What they found:**\n\n> In this large multiethnic cohort, we found no associations between multivitamin use and mortality from all causes, cardiovascular diseases, or cancer. The findings did not vary across subgroups by ethnicity, age, body mass index, preexisting illness, single vitamin/mineral supplement use, hormone replacement therapy use, and smoking status. In addition, there was no evidence indicating that multivitamin use increased or decreased risk for cancer, overall or at major sites, such as lung, colorectum, prostate, and breast.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n> Multivitamin users are generally more health conscious than are nonusers (1, 36), which could confound the relation of multivitamin use with morbidity or mortality. Although we adjusted for well-known potential confounders including health-related behaviors such as smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity (37), there may still be uncontrolled bias. In particular, we were unable to adjust for changes in potential confounders over time. The longest duration category for multivitamin use in our baseline questionnaire was 5 years and longer, although the effects of multivitamins on longevity and disease might take a longer period.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**Please find the rest of the review in the comments**\n------------------------------\n",

References of articles were checked, experts were contacted, and tables of contents for 15 relevant journals were searched from January 2005 to February 2006. Search terms were reported in the full report (see Other Publications of Related Interest). Only studies reported in English were eligible for inclusion.\n\n> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which assessed the efficacy of a multivitamin/mineral supplement for the prevention of one or more of the following chronic diseases were eligible for inclusion: cancer; myocardial infarction or stroke; type 2 diabetes; Parkinson's disease or dementia; cataracts; macular degeneration or hearing loss; osteoporosis; osteopenia; rheumatoid arthritis; osteoarthritis; non-alcoholic steatorrheic hepatitis; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; chronic renal insufficiency; chronic nephrolithiasis; HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection; hepatitis C; tuberculosis; and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Studies which included only the following types of participants were excluded from the review: pregnant women; people aged up to 18 years; people with a chronic disease or those receiving treatment for such a disease; patients in long-term care facilities; or people with a clinical nutritional deficiency. Studies which assessed only safety or which did not assess supplement use separately from dietary intake were also excluded. For the assessment of safety observational studies in adults and children were also eligible for inclusion.\n\n**What they documented:**\n\n> To assess the efficacy and safety of multivitamin and mineral supplements for the primary prevention of cancer and chronic disease in the general population.\n\n**What they found:** \n\n> There was insufficient evidence to determine the presence or absence of benefits from the use of multivitamin and mineral supplements for the prevention of cancer and chronic disease.\n\n-----------------------------\n\n**[Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for slowing the progression of age-related macular degeneration] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23152201)**\n\n-\tPublished: 2012 (META-ANALYSIS)\n\n> The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplementation, alone or in combination, on the progression of AMD.\n\n**What they found:** \n\n> **People with AMD may experience delay in progression of the disease with antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation**. This finding is drawn from one large trial conducted in a relatively well-nourished American population. The generalisability of these findings to other populations is not known.

The value of vitamins that naturally occur in food and the use of vitamin supplements for the prevention of other conditions (for example, neural tube defects) and for the secondary prevention of complications in patients with existing disease are outside the scope of this review.\n\n**What they documented:**\n\n> This recommendation applies to healthy adults without special nutritional needs (typically aged 50 years or older). It does not apply to children, women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, or persons who are chronically ill or hospitalized or have a known nutritional deficiency.\n\n**What they found:**\n\n> The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of multivitamins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer. (I statement)The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of single- or paired-nutrient supplements (except ß-carotene and vitamin E) for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer.

However, there is no consensus on the optimal dose and duration of vitamin D supplementation. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on symptoms and clinical outcomes in adults with insufficient or deficient baseline vitamin D levels.\n\n**Method:** A pre-post two-month intervention with 50,000 IU vitamin D3 supplementation for adults with documented insufficient or deficient baseline vitamin D levels, presented at Jazan University Hospital from August to December 2022.\n\n**Results:** Of the 204 participants, 65.1% had baseline vitamin D levels < 30 nmol/L. Vitamin D insufficiency is more prevalent among females, older adults, married individuals, and those with low income. However, these differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.5). The symptoms and clinical outcomes were significantly improved after 2 months of vitamin D3 supplementation for the participants who achieved vitamin D levels > 50 nmol/L (p = 0.000). After adjusting for multiple confounders, the significant determinants of symptom improvement and clinical outcomes post-supplementation included education level, income, smoking status, and baseline vitamin D level.\n\n**Conclusions:** Hypovitaminosis D or vitamin D deficiency was observed in study participants. The use of a 50,000 IU cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) orally once per week for two months is sufficient to improve the symptoms and clinical outcomes of vitamin D deficiency. However, long-term follow-up could better assess the sustainability of benefits and explore long-term outcomes, such as the risk of deficiency recurrence.\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12123802/",

Patients requiring invasive ventilation or with significant comorbidities were excluded. 25(OH)D levels were assessed at day 7, and cholecalciferol supplementation was continued for those with 25(OH)D <50 ng/ml in the intervention arm. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and inflammatory markers fibrinogen, D-dimer, procalcitonin and (CRP), ferritin were measured periodically.*  \n>  \n>Outcome measure *Proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative before day-21 and change in inflammatory markers.*  \n>  \n>Results *Forty SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive individuals were randomised to intervention (n=16) or control (n=24) group. Baseline serum 25(OH)D was 8.6 (7.1 to 13.1) and 9.54 (8.1 to 12.5) ng/ml (p=0.730), in the intervention and control group, respectively. 10 out of 16 patients could achieve 25(OH)D>50 ng/ml by day-7 and another two by day-14 \\[day-14 25(OH)D levels 51.7 (48.9 to 59.5) ng/ml and 15.2 (12.7 to 19.5) ng/ml (p<0.001) in intervention and control group, respectively\\]. 10 (62.5%) participants in the intervention group and 5 (20.8%) participants in the control arm (p<0.018) became SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative. Fibrinogen levels significantly decreased with cholecalciferol supplementation (intergroup difference 0.70 ng/ml; P=0.007) unlike other inflammatory biomarkers.*  \n>  \n>Conclusion *Greater proportion of vitamin D-deficient individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection turned SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative with a significant decrease in fibrinogen on high-dose cholecalciferol supplementation.*\n\n**A few things about the study stand out to me and I want opinions about it!**\n\nIn my opinion, the paper isn’t very well written, and it appears the authors aren’t quite grasping the English language. Although not worrying without other causes for concern, well, keep reading, folks…\n\nThe main outcome is PCR-negativity at day 21 and all information we’re given about it are the frequencies 10/16 and 5/24 in the intervention and control group, respectively, and a p-value (.018). Why aren’t we shown PCR-negativity at days 5/7/10/14/18? Measurements were made on these dates as well. I understand the main outcome is the main outcome, but the main outcome appears to contradict:\n\n>*The mean duration to SARS-CoV-2 negativity was 17.6±6.1 and 17.6±6.4 days (p=0.283) in the intervention and control arm, respectively.*\n\nIn other words, the main outcome appears to be a complete coincidence thanks to arbitrary endpoint. It’s also not clear how averages were made. I can’t calculate any combination of 5 numbers which have a mean of 17.6 and standard deviation of 6.4 if the numbers I use are 5, 7, 10, 14, 18, and 21. And now for the spicy stuff, get ready:\n\nIntervention and control groups are unequal sizes (16:24)! This is quite anomalous and stands without explanation. According to the trial pre-registration, there was supposed to be 30 participants and according to the paper there was supposed to be 32 participants, however, there are 40 participants in the study. In other words, 8 participants were added later. The intervention and control groups have 10 women. However, there are exactly 8 extra men in the control group compared to the intervention group. A coincidence, or could there originally have been equal numbers of women and men in each group after which 8 men who are generally known to be more affected by the virus added to the control group in order to make the outcome of the study statistically significant?\n\nTable 1 has significance tests for differences in all baseline variables… except… you guessed it: genders. Although if I make a significance test now, it shows no significant imbalance in genders between the groups it’s curious why this was omitted. In my opinion, it suggests an eleventh-hour change.\n\nUnder “What we have found”, there’s a weird statement which isn’t supported anywhere in the paper:\n\n>*Therapeutic, high-dose cholecalciferol supplementation led to SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative in additional 41.7% participants (p<0.001) and was useful for viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance.*\n\nThe “41.7%” appears to be the fraction 5/12, but it’s not clear where this comes from. The only instance of the number 5 anywhere in the paper is the number of individuals in the control group who attained PCR-negativity by day 21 and the only instance of the number 12 is the number of individuals in the intervention group who attained >50 ng/ml 25(OH)D by day 14, which obviously aren’t comparable numbers, and the associated significance test isn’t shown anywhere.\n\nFinally, the trial pre-registration suggests the control group was supposed to get intervention upon hospital admission. Obviously, the control group getting the intervention makes no sense and apparently wasn’t actually carried out!\n\n**All in all, the study doesn’t strike me as if it were done by someone who knew what they were doing and that’s sus. Ought I contact the authors, journal, or Retraction Watch, or am I merely jumping to conclusions?**",

The aim of the study was to assess the outcome of Ivermectin-Azithromycin-Cholecalciferol combination therapy on early stages (I-IIa) of COVID-19 patients. This proof of concept study was carried out on confirmed COVID-19 patients in Mexico City, from April 01 to April 20, 2020. Patients who met inclusion criteria were invited to take Ivermectin (6 mg once daily in day 0,1,7 and 8) plus Azithromycin (500 mg once daily for 4 days) plus Cholecalciferol (4000 UI twice daily for 30 days). Treatment outcome was evaluated on the 10th day onward from the first day of the drug intake. Recovery rate of the 28 patients that received the combination therapy was 100%, the mean symptomatic recovery duration was 3.6 days and negative PCR was confirmed on day 10. Imaging findings of patients with pneumonia were improved on day 10. Transient and mild degree of adverse effect like diarrhea and nausea was noted by 3 (10.7%) patients. This study found that the combination treatment might mitigate disease progression without significant adverse effects. Further studies are needed in order to extrapolate these findings to moderate and severe COVID-19.",

It is classified as a vitamin due to its availability in small amounts in food. However, it’s actually a hormone, which makes it different from other vitamins. When people refer to vitamin D in supplement form, they are usually referring to cholecalciferol.\n\nThe impacts of vitamin D on human health are far reaching. The most commonly referred to benefit of vitamin D has to do with making strong bones. This is because vitamin D plays a role in calcium uptake from food by enabling active absorption. When people started to live in dense, urban environments, some kids started having an issue with bone development called rickets. Scientists realized that this was due to lack of sun exposure and could be treated with vitamin D. Some governments decided to fortify foods like dairy with small amounts of vitamin D in order to reduce this problem in the general population.\n\nThe amount of vitamin D needed to make sure that the body can absorb adequate calcium to prevent rickets is rather low compared to the amount that can be obtained from the sun. Vitamin D, when provided to the body in adequate doses, does much more than just help absorb calcium. It regulates the expression of over a thousand genes, is integral to proper function of the immune system, and can interact with vitamin D receptors that are present in every cell in the human body.\n\nOver time, populations have developed lifestyles that involve spending more and more time indoors. Newer research has shown that many people are missing out on the benefits of optimal vitamin D levels in respect to their physical and mental health. Some academics even consider the prevalence of low levels of vitamin D to be a global health crisis.\n\n**2. How do I get it?**\n\nNaturally, the human body produces vitamin D3 from direct exposure to ultraviolet B radiation. Ultraviolet radiation, which is invisible to the human eye, makes up about 10% of sunlight and consists of three types, A, B, and C. About 5% of the ultraviolet light that we get from the sun is UVB, which makes it only about 0.05% of sunlight.\n\nA form of cholesterol reacts with UVB in the skin and forms vitamin D3. The compound formed in the skin is cholecalciferol, which then goes on to be metabolized into calcifediol by the liver and calcitriol by the kidneys. Some vitamin D can be metabolized on a local basis in tissues.\n\nStudies show that the body can produce 10-25K IU of vitamin D3 when exposed to sufficient UVB light. Unfortunately, in modern society there are several factors which affect our ability to get sufficient D3 from the sun:\n\n* We spend the majority of our time indoors. Glass blocks UVB, so sitting in a car or by a window does not count.\n* When outside, we cover most of our body with clothing which blocks UVB.\n* We wear sunscreen for skincare reasons. Sunscreen blocks UVB like clothing. In fact, many people mistakenly believe that all sun exposure is bad for them. While sensible use of sunscreen to prevent excessive sun exposure is important, its effect on D3 production should be noted.\n* The availability and intensity of UVB depends on the distance from the equator. UVB is measured on an index. Some governments provide UVB forecasts. The number on the index must be at least 3 in order for vitamin D3 to be produced. Many people live in places in the north, such as New York, Canada, or Germany where UVB is only available during the summer, and even during the spring and fall, the window of opportunity during the day when the UVB index is above 3 is limited. So, one could lay out and sunbathe on a sunny morning, but not make any D3.\n* The evolutionary advantage of melanin is to protect the skin from excessive UVB exposure. This means that people with dark skin need more sun exposure to make the same amount of D3. Dark skinned people who are living in places that are far from the equator will not be able to get adequate D3 from the sun even if they tried.\n* Guidelines for sun exposure are written with the idea of most of the body being exposed. That means when they talk about being out in the sun it’s not just about your hands and neck or even your arms and legs but also having your torso exposed. If one works an office job, then it is probably difficult for them to find a place to be shirtless outside on their lunch break.\n* People who live in urban environments may not have the opportunity to get direct sun exposure because they don’t have a place like a balcony to lay out, or it faces the wrong direction.\n* Weather is another factor worth noting. Clouds reduce UVB. If one lives in a place that is often overcast, then their opportunity to make D3 naturally is diminished.\n* As the body ages, its ability to produce and metabolize D3 decreases.\n\nSo, we turn to supplements in order to get vitamin D. The ingredient in supplements, cholecalciferol, is identical to the compound that the skin makes, and it can be absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract the same way vitamin D is absorbed from food. The main idea behind supplementing vitamin D3 is to replace what one should be getting from sunlight. The question of how much that should be remains and is answered in #11.\n\n**3. Which supplement should I buy?**\n\nVitamin D3 is a basic supplement, so it is cheap and widely available. It can be found at your local grocery store. Some governments regulate the amount available in individual pills. Some of these regulations are outdated, and you may find yourself with a smaller dose than you were looking for. You may take multiple pills to make your desired dose. Another option is to order appropriate doses from international, online retailers.\n\nVitamin D3 is available in tablets, softgels, tinctures, and oral sprays. Softgels contain a carrier oil that aids in absorption, as vitamin D is fat soluble.\n\nGummies are not a good choice for vitamin D (or really any supplement) as the formula is less stable, the containers tend to be clear which lets in light that degrades the contents, and the dosing is known to be less accurate than other options. Persons who don’t want to swallow pills can turn tablets into powder with a pill crusher, and mix it with liquid, or purchase a liquid form.\n\nMultivitamins usually do not contain significant amounts of D3, so a standalone supplement is required. If you take a multivitamin, the vitamin D content can be factored into your total intake.\n\nA traditional way to supplement vitamin D is with cod liver oil. It does contain D3, but the amount is small.\n\nBe sure to read the information regarding dosage and serving size on the label of any supplement you buy.\n\nVitamin D dosage in measure in International Units (IU’s). This is a scientific system of measurement. It can be confusing because it makes a small amount of something sound like a large amount. 1 microgram (mcg) of vitamin D is 40 International Units (IU’s). So, if I tell you to take 10,000 of something, then that sounds like a lot, but if I tell you to take 250 of something, then it might sound more reasonable. 10,000 IU is 250 mcg which is a quarter of a milligram. If you took 10K IU every day for 80 years, that would add up to 7.3 grams of vitamin D, which is about one and a half teaspoons.\n\nSince D3 is a basic supplement, it’s best to keep things simple and go with a big name brand. As with any supplement, it is important to pay attention to factors which determine the quality of a supplement such as:\n\n* Does this brand appear to be reputable? Is it widely available?\n* Does the label clearly display relevant information about ingredients and dosage?\n* Does the product have indications of third party testing or a certification like USP which indicates it is tested for quality?\n* Does the label have a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) indication or other information about the quality of the supplement?\n\n**4. How are vitamin D3 supplements made?**\n\nVitamin D3 is made commercially by taking lanolin, the grease from sheep’s wool, and irradiating it to form cholecalciferol. This is then extracted and packaged into a supplement. So, D3 supplements are typically made from an animal product.\n\nIf you want a vegan vitamin D3, then look for a product that is made from lichen. If a supplement label does not specify that the D3 is made from lichen or that it is vegan, then assume it was made from lanolin.\n\n**5. How do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient?**\n\nVitamin D status is assessed with a blood test that looks at the level of calcifediol in the blood. This is the storage form of vitamin D that cholecalciferol (the D3 from the sun or supplements) is turned into. The name of the test is 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 or 25(OH)D3. A 25(OH)D3 serum level is considered to be a reliable indicator of vitamin D status and is the standard for diagnosing vitamin D deficiency.\n\nThe results of the test are indicated by two different kinds of units depending on the country one lives in. There is nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) which usually has a reference range of 30-100 ng/ml at the lab and nanomole per liter (nmol/L) which usually has a reference range of 75-250 nmol/L. They can be converted back and forth with the following ratio: 1 ng/ml = 2.5 nmol/L.\n\nPlease specify units when sharing test results.\n\nVitamin D deficiency is typically diagnosed if the level is under the lower end of the reference range, 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/L). This can get confusing because sometimes the threshold for deficiency is 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L) while 20-30 ng/ml (50-75 nmol/L) is referred to as insufficient.\n\nTo put it plainly, the threshold for deficiency in these reference ranges is too low. They were established to prevent rickets and serve as guidelines for food fortification. Newer research reveals that there are many benefits to a daily, adequate supply of vitamin D3 which correlates with higher serum levels. Many vitamin D researchers consider 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/L) as the threshold for benefits to the immune system. Generally, we think anyone below this level can benefit from supplementing D3.\n\nSymptoms of low vitamin D can include: fatigue, poor sleep quality, compromised immune function (being sick all the time), allergies, muscle weakness, poor digestion, cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, and hair loss.\n\nIf you just got diagnosed as deficient and are focused on getting into the reference range, then you may wonder why people here aim for higher levels of vitamin D. That is because they are in pursuit of the full benefits of vitamin D3 as part of an effort to optimize their health. Many doctors operate based on outdated information concerning vitamin D and its importance, and as a result, they just top you off to get you into the reference range without paying more attention to it. Some doctors don’t even have vitamin D on their radar and don’t bother testing for it. So, keep in mind that while correcting your deficiency is your priority, it’s important to think long term about reaching an optimal vitamin D level.\n\nIf you can’t get a test, then you can reasonably predict your vitamin D status by considering your lifestyle in terms of sun exposure, your skin color, and location. Basically, if you aren’t making a deliberate effort to get sun (if it’s available), then you aren’t getting enough D3. It is useful to make a plan to get tested at some point to see how your body is responding to supplementation.\n\n**6. How do I get tested?**\n\nTalk to your doctor, or go to a private lab. In the United States, a blood test should be covered by insurance or run about $50 at a private lab.\n\nThere are two different types of vitamin D tests, immunoassay and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS). Both are fine options, but an LCMS test is preferable if it is available as it is more accurate at higher levels. Usually, having the “3” in 25(OH)D3 indicates and orders an LCMS test whereas 25(OH)D is an immunoassay.\n\nSometimes the test results will display D2 and D3. We don’t really care about D2. You can simply look at the total vitamin D to see your level.\n\nAs discussed in the previous question, note whether your test results are in ng/ml or nmol/L.\n\nMake sure that you (or your doctor) doesn’t accidentally test for calcitriol instead which is 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or 1,25(OH)2D. This test looks at the active form of vitamin D that is made by the kidneys. That test is only ordered for specific diagnostic reasons, and the number it gives you is not your vitamin D level.\n\nThere are at-home tests. They can be an effective way to screen for vitamin D deficiency but are not accurate enough to be useful for tracking progress or dialing in dosage.\n\n**7. Do I need to stop taking vitamin D before my test?**\n\nNo. Vitamin D takes time to metabolize into the form that shows up on the test, and blood serum level does not widely fluctuate with daily dosing. If you think about it, the doctor doesn't ask if you spent all day at the beach the day before your test.\n\n**8. Why did my doctor prescribe me D2 instead of D3?**\n\nD2 (ergocalciferol) was discovered before D3 (cholecalciferol), and much of the early research on vitamin D and bones was done with D2, so it became the standard for treating deficiency. It remains because of legacy reasons. In other words, it’s outdated. D3 is what we get from the sun, and that’s what we want from supplements. D2 is for mushrooms.\n\nD3 is a better choice for supplementing than D2 because it is more effective at raising serum level, and it provides the full benefits of vitamin D. D2 does not have the same vitamin D activity as D3. Pretty much all over the counter supplements contain D3.\n\n**9. Why did my doctor prescribe me a large weekly dose of vitamin D?**\n\nAnother thing doctors tend to do when they treat vitamin D deficiency is to give infrequent, large doses, often on a weekly basis. This approach is outdated. It’s conceivable that some practitioners just stick with what they can order through insurance or the healthcare system.\n\nConsistent, daily dosing of vitamin D3 is the best way to treat vitamin D deficiency and maintain an optimal vitamin D level.\n\nDaily dosing is more effective at raising serum level than weekly or monthly doses even when the total amounts are equivalent. Daily dosing ensures that a consistent supply of D3 is available which is necessary to access the full benefits of vitamin D to the immune system and other parts of the body such as the brain. Think about the fact that humans evolved outside and they got sunlight pretty much every day. We can optimize our health by making sure we get a consistent supply of D3 regardless of our sun exposure.\n\n**10. Well, my doctor gave me the wrong thing, so what should I do?**\n\nThat’s for you to decide. It really depends on how hands on you are with your health and what your relationship with your doctor is like. You can disregard their prescription, and take a daily dose of D3. If you don’t want to blow them off, then you can take what they gave you, and also start daily dosing. D2 is not harmful. Keep in mind that, either way, you will eventually need a consistent, daily dose of vitamin D to maintain your level.\n\n**11. How much vitamin D3 should I take?**\n\nThis is the big question for many people. Dosing should generally be discussed in terms of a target vitamin D level and not just in terms of IU’s. Depending on one’s goals, that target level may be different. This is a topic of ongoing discussion within the community and a subject of emerging research. Our goal is to equip people to make the best decisions for themselves, not to prescribe a one size fits all solution.\n\nThere are several variables which can affect dosage requirements and cause the same dose to yield different effects between individuals.\n\n* Body mass: Larger persons require more D3 as with any nutrient.\n* Body fat: Fat sequesters vitamin D, and overweight individuals can require higher doses to get the same effect. The dose may have to be 1.5-2 times higher.\n* Absorption issues: Persons with malabsorption will need higher doses because not all of it is absorbed.\n* Genetics: Differences in individual physiology or genetic resistance to vitamin D can mean that a different amount of vitamin D3 or even a higher serum level is required to get the same effects.\n\nEarlier, the difference between correcting a deficiency and reaching an optimal level was mentioned. Most persons at r/VitaminD want the full benefits of vitamin D3 and take a dose that approximates what can be achieved from sunlight. This is done by targeting the upper end of the reference range.\n\nA good level for an adult to aim for is about 80 ng/ml (200 nmol/L) or a range of 75-85 ng/ml (188-213 nmol/L).\n\nSome individuals with certain health issues wish to access the therapeutic value of higher vitamin D levels that go above the reference range. We know that these serum levels are safe. That doesn’t mean that you need to aim that high.\n\nFor most people to get the full benefits of vitamin D, they will want to aim for >80 ng/ml. This is still within the commonly used reference range which is safe and achievable through sunlight. Studies on populations living indigenous lifestyles measure levels around 70-80 ng/ml. Levels as high as 120 ng/ml from sunlight alone have been reported in lifeguards who spend all day in the sun.\n\nIn order to reach this level, most adults will need to take about 10K IU (250 mcg) D3 every day. It can take months for your vitamin D level to rise and stabilize. Some individuals need 10K IU just to get above 50 ng/ml. Others will end up closer to 100 ng/ml.\n\nOne approach is to dose based on body mass with 100 IU per kilogram. So, a 70 kilogram individual (154 lb) would take 7000 IU a day. As this equation may produce a number which is hard to precisely dose with pills, some rounding is appropriate.\n\nIntake of vitamin D3 correlates with serum level on a curve, meaning that taking double the dose will not double your level. For example: One tests at 42 ng/ml. They take 5K IU daily. Their level gets up to 68  ng/ml. Taking 10K IU will not increase their level by twice the amount. They decide to take 10K IU daily, and their level goes up to 84 ng/ml. They continue to take 10K IU every day, and their level stays more or less the same.\n\nTesting can be used to monitor and adjust dosage.\n\nHere are some hypothetical examples to illustrate the point:\n\n* A 5'11\", 260 lb person with light skin who gets lots of sun has a vitamin D level of 57 ng/ml. They want to be at 85 ng/ml for benefits to immune function and sleep. Due to their size, they need 10K IU daily to hit that target.\n* A 5'7\" 140 lb person who gets less sun has a level of 46 ng/ml and the same target level but only needs 5K IU to hit it.\n* A 5'3\" 120 lb person who gets tons of sun but has a generic resistance to vitamin D has a level of 34 ng/ml, and they need 15K IU daily to hit 85 ng/ml.\n* Another 5'3\" 120 lb person also gets tons of sun, but they have dark skin and live in France, so they don't get much vitamin D3 naturally due to a lack of UVB. They have a level of 27 ng/ml and need 10K IU to hit 85 ng/ml.\n\nWe can make educated guesses, but ultimately, testing is the only thing that will give you an objective answer about how much vitamin D3 supplementation your body needs. Technically speaking, the correct amount of D3 one should take is what is needed for them to reach their target vitamin D level.\n\nSo, why do other recommendations, like those from governments, suggest so little vitamin D intake? It is because they are outdated and do not consider the full functions of vitamin D3 in the human body. 800 IU a day is turning out to not be enough to avoid vitamin D deficiency in people who barely get sunlight.\n\nIn fact, you'll find a lot of disagreement between different sources on what an optimal vitamin D level is. It is fair to say that an optimal level is debatable. There is a good possibility that your doctor will not agree with supplementing to levels on the higher end of the reference range. Keep in mind that the 80 ng/ml number reflects the opinions of enthusiasts in this community based on the research they've seen and the experiences they've had and does not come from a medical authority.\n\nWe know that there are studies which show benefits to the 40-60 ng/ml range, that doctors have worked with higher ranges, such as 60-80 ng/ml to treat sleep disorders, or over 100 ng/ml to treat autoimmune disorders, and that supplementing to these levels does not cause adverse effects. Unfortunately, research is ongoing, and the amount needed to conclusively revise clinical recommendations is not available, and optimal guidelines have not been officially established.\n\nThis guide discusses vitamin D primarily in the context of replacing what one would get from sunlight. Many studies fail to demonstrate benefits from higher doses of serum levels because they do not use the daily dosing interval and/or sufficient amounts to see those benefits. At the end of the day, it is your job to make the best decisions regarding your health.\n\n**12. When should I take vitamin D?**\n\nTake vitamin D at the start of your day. For most people, that is in the morning. Naturally, you’d get D3 during the day. Taking it at night can disrupt sleep.\n\n**13. How long will it take to treat my deficiency?**\n\nThis depends on several factors. You may start to see progress and feel better in just a few weeks, but it can take months for your level to get to where you want it. Some people find that they are not responding well to their dosage when they retest and have to increase their dosage. Some people prefer to treat their deficiency aggressively with a higher dose, known as a loading dose, and then switch to a long term maintenance dose.\n\nHere are some hypothetical examples to illustrate the point:\n\n* Someone tests at 21 ng/ml. They take 10K IU daily. They retest in six weeks, and their level has gone up. Six months later they are at 83 ng/ml. They continue to take that dose to stay around that level.\n* Someone else also tests at 21 ng/ml. They take 5K IU. When they retest a month later, their level has barely gone up. They decide to increase their dosage to 15K IU. They retest in another month to see how that is going.\n* Someone tests at 9 ng/ml. They decide to aggressively treat their deficiency by taking 20K IU a day. After two months, they are at 74 ng/ml. They decide to cut it down to 10K IU as a maintenance dose.\n\n**14. Do I have to take vitamin D supplements for the rest of my life?**\n\nYes. The body continuously uses vitamin D3, so one needs to keep providing D3 to it. Vitamin D supplementation is indefinite. Pretty much everyone should be supplementing D3. Remember, it’s replacing what you should be getting from sunlight, so unless you have a lifestyle change that involves more UVB exposure, you're not changing your vitamin D intake outside of supplements.\n\nOne does not need to be concerned that their vitamin D level will keep going up and up. Any dose you take will eventually plateau. That means taking D3 does not continually raise your level to a higher number. This may be because more vitamin D is utilized at higher levels.\n\n**15. Do I really need a supplement, or can I just use the sun?**\n\nThe sun is obviously a valid source of UVB, but your ability to get sufficient D3 from the sun depends on the factors mentioned in #2.\n\nIt is worth considering that supplementation allows us to go beyond the limitations of natural factors to optimize our health and treat illness with the therapeutic value of D3.\n\nIf you get lots of sun while the UVB index is above 3, then you can factor that into your vitamin D3 intake. If you test before supplementing, then that result provides a baseline in terms of how much vitamin D you are getting from the sun and dietary sources.\n\n**16. Do I need to take anything with vitamin D?**\n\n**Fat**\n\nVitamin D is fat soluble, so taking it with a meal that contains fat is a good idea. However, if you take a softgel with a carrier oil that serves as a fat source, then that’s probably good enough. The idea of vitamin D being fat soluble has to do more with fat being available than specifically consuming them both at the same time, but individuals who are having trouble absorbing supplements or who want to get the best absorption should take it with food.\n\n**Magnesium**\n\nThe most important thing to pay attention to when supplementing vitamin D is magnesium. This mineral is utilized for many purposes by the body. Magnesium is used by D3 metabolism at several steps, from cholecalciferol to calcifediol to calcitriol. Adequate magnesium intake is necessary to support vitamin D supplementation.\n\nMagnesium is obtained through diet. Food sources of magnesium include dark leafy greens, nuts and seeds, beans and lentils, whole grains, and dairy. Unfortunately, modern diets tend to be lacking in magnesium content due to processing of foods, preference of refined grains over whole grains, growing of commercial varieties of produce that are less nutrient dense, and possibly due to nutrient depletion in soil. So, many people do not get enough magnesium from their diet. This can be addressed with dietary changes, but to correct low magnesium status, and to help back up D3 supplementation when treating a deficiency, it is a good idea to supplement magnesium.\n\nThere are different forms of magnesium available in supplements. All magnesium supplements are chelated, meaning that the magnesium is bound to something else. Popular choices include magnesium glycinate (typically taken at night), magnesium malate (typically taken in the morning), and magnesium citrate (too much has a laxative effect). Additional details about the types of magnesium can be found in threads in the subreddit or elsewhere.\n\nMagnesium supplements are best tolerated when the dose is worked up in increments. Magnesium is also best absorbed in small doses, so that means instead of taking 400 mg of elemental magnesium all at once, one might take 200 mg in the morning and then another 200 mg with lunch.\n\nVitamin D3 actually increases the absorption of magnesium, so it is conceivable that your need for supplements may diminish over time. However, as it’s hard to overdo magnesium supplements, and magnesium has many benefits on its own, people choose to continue to take it.\n\nIt is important not to rely solely on supplements for magnesium intake. Magnesium rich foods are more bioavailable than supplements and should be added to or increased in the diet.\n\nMagnesium is one of the four main electrolytes. The others are potassium, sodium, and calcium. They all work together in a balance. When supplementing magnesium, it is important to ensure that one is consuming adequate calcium through their diet.\n\nUnfortunately, using a test to assess magnesium status is not reliable as the tests only look at magnesium content in the blood or red blood cells. 99% of the body’s magnesium is in intracellular storage in bones in tissues, and 1% is extracellular fluids. Only 0.3% is in the blood. So, the test can come back within the range, but you still need to increase magnesium intake to top off your stores.\n\nReplenishing magnesium in the body can take time, several weeks or even months. Some people experience side effects from vitamin D supplementation like body aches, twitching, constipation, anxiety, or trouble sleeping due to a lack of magnesium. If these issues persist, it’s best to back off on the D3 by reducing dosage or pausing supplementation, and focus on building up magnesium in the body.\n\n**Vitamin K2**\n\nAnother cofactor that is often discussed online is vitamin K2. This is suggested because D3 helps absorb calcium, and K2 helps move calcium around in the body. Is it absolutely necessary to take K2 with D3? The short answer is no. A better statement is that it can be a good idea to take K2 with D3.\n\nNaturally, we get D3 from the sun, and the K2 that the body needs to move around calcium comes from diet and bacteria in the gut. There are more forms of K2 from these sources than the ones available in supplements. One may benefit from a K2 supplement if their diet doesn't have enough. Dietary sources include animal products and fermented foods like cheese. Vegetables have K1, which the body can convert some of to K2, but if someone is vegan, it may be a good idea to supplement K2.\n\nPeople disagree about the best form and ideal dose of K2, so one should focus on D3 first. You can take your time to research K2 MK-4 and MK-7. A failure to take a K2 supplement will not result in arterial calcification or deposition of calcium into soft tissues from D3 supplementation. People online claim this but never back it up with research.\n\nSo, why do so many people insist that you \\*need\\* K2? The idea probably came from thinking that we need some kind of insurance to make up for taking doses that are higher than the recommended 4K IU upper limit. A simpler explanation is that this limit is outdated and too low. You can get more than 4K IU by going out in the sun, and nobody talks about taking a K2 supplement for that.\n\nK2 is used to manage the risks associated with very high doses (ex. 50K IU) of  D3 that are administered under medical supervision to treat autoimmune disease.\n\nIf you decide to supplement K2, which has many benefits on its own, then it is best to avoid combination D3+K2 supplements at first. This enables you to figure out what works for you. If you take a combination supplement and experience side effects, then you won’t know which of the two is causing problems. Some people experience heart palpitations from K2 MK-7. Once you figure out your routine and preferred form, you can opt for the convenience of the combo supplement.\n\n**17. Can I take too much vitamin D?**\n\nIt is possible, but it likely requires far more than you think. The conservative range of 30-100 ng/ml and the outdated threshold for toxicity of 150 ng/ml were established with wide safety margins and are unlikely to be exceeded with a daily dose of 10K IU which approximates sunlight exposure. Updated literature suggests that vitamin D toxicity does not occur until well over 300 ng/ml (750 nmol/L) and is simply not a concern with the amounts of vitamin D3 that people should be taking.\n\nDoses over 50K IU daily can potentially cause issues over an extended period of time. Megadosing something like 100K IU is reckless unless you are under medical supervision that monitors relevant factors through testing.\n\nThe concern you’ll read about is that too much vitamin D causes hypercalcemia which is too much calcium in the blood. There are a few things that one should note:\n\n* It’s more useful to speak in terms of serum level instead of just dosage as different doses can lead to different levels in different people. Basically, a one size fits all claim that X amount is too much vitamin D, without discussion of serum level, is misleading.\n* Hypercalcemia is diagnosed with a blood test that shows an elevated level of calcium. Without that result, you do not have hypercalcemia.\n* It is possible to experience side effects from vitamin D supplementation for other reasons. These are discussed in #24. Do not jump to a conclusion and assume you have hypercalcemia which is very serious.\n\nOne of the advantages of getting a vitamin D blood test is that you can accurately monitor your vitamin D status to make sure your level is where you want it.\n\n**18. Will any of my medications interact with vitamin D?**\n\nSome drugs can cause vitamin D to be less effective, meaning that a higher dose of D3 is required to get the same blood level. One example is long term use of glucocorticoids, such as the nasal spray Flonase. It is best to consult your medical provider concerning any potential contradictions with your prescriptions.\n\n**19. My level is too high. What should I do?**\n\nIf your level got higher than you'd like, then simply halt or reduce your vitamin D intake, and it will go down as the body uses it up.\n\nFor example, someone tackles a deficiency by supplementing 15K IU vitamin D3. They respond well and end up testing at 114 ng/ml. They only wanted to be around 85 ng/ml. They reduce dosage to 10K IU, and their level begins to decline. Six weeks later, they test at 91 ng/ml.\n\n**20. My vitamin D is low, but my calcium is high. How does that work?**\n\nThere are glands in your neck next to the thyroid called parathyroid glands. They secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH). Higher PTH causes higher blood calcium. Vitamin D3 helps to regulate PTH, and D3 supplementation will generally lower PTH. So, despite the concern that is expressed about vitamin D and high calcium, vitamin D deficiency can actually cause elevated calcium.\n\n**21. Can vitamin D help me lose weight?**\n\nIt's definitely possible. Vitamin D3 helps to regulate metabolism and appetite, so correcting low vitamin D can be an important part of your weightloss journey. Body fat takes up vitamin D, so overweight or obese persons may require higher doses of vitamin D to get the same effect.\n\n**22. Will vitamin D treat my X?**\n\nMaybe.\n\nVitamin D3 affects nearly every aspect of human health. It’s hard to say if it will treat your issue if it’s not a common side effect of low vitamin D, but you may be pleasantly surprised. Think of it like drinking water to correct dehydration which then gets rid of your fatigue. You’ll have to supplement, and find out. We love to hear success stories, so feel free to post about your experience.\n\n**23. Why won't my level go up even though I'm taking D3?**\n\nThere are three possible explanations for this: \n\n* You aren't taking enough. Increase your dosage. Remember that the correct amount to take is the one that gets you to your target level.\n* You don’t have enough magnesium available to metabolize vitamin D properly.\n* You have issues with malabsorption. Try bypassing the gastrointestinal tract with sublingual dosing. This involves absorption of D3 through the membranes in the mouth. Take a softgel, poke a hole in it, squirt it under your tongue, and hold the liquid there for at least several minutes. There are also tinctures and vitamin D spray products on the market.",

        "body": "Thought of another question to add:\n\n**X. Should I take a different amount of D3 in the summer vs. winter?**\n\nSome guidelines, specifically in places up north, advise vitamin D supplementation during winter months. This is because the sun is less intense, the UVB index is lower, and people spend more time indoors. This recommendation is reasonable to help prevent vitamin D deficiency, but it is not adequate to get the full benefits of vitamin D.\n\nNaturally and without supplements, one's vitamin D level will fluctuate a bit throughout the year with a peak during the summer and a low during the winter. The body would build up a vitamin D store during summer months. In modern society, most people aren't getting enough sun exposure for that to happen.\n\nSupplementing a consistent amount of D3 every day will maintain a stable baseline for one's level which may go up during the summer based on sun exposure. Unless your lifestyle fluctuates widely, from being a lifeguard on the beach in Mexico during the summer, to working at an oil outpost in North Dakota during the winter, you shouldn't worry about adjusting your dose based on the season.",

        "body": "Two more:\n\n**X. Is taking D3 the same as getting sunlight?**\n\nIn regards to vitamin D, the effect of getting D3 (cholecalciferol) from a pill is the same as getting it from sunlight. When the skin is exposed to UVB, there are some other steps and metabolites involved, but they have no extra biological activity.\n\nHowever, a vitamin D supplement does not replace the full benefits of sunlight. The sun also emits visible and infrared light which have benefits for health. In general, spending time outdoors and getting some sun is good for you.\n\n**X. Can I take vitamin D once every few days?**\n\nSome people end up with a supplement that has a dose larger than what they would like to take daily. For example, one wants to take about 8K IU daily, but they have 25K IU pills, so they are thinking about taking one every three days. This is better than once a week or not at all with respect to raising or maintaining one's vitamin D level. However, it does not capture the full benefits of D3.\n\nVitamin D3 must be dosed every single day in order to access its full benefits to the human body. That doesn't mean that skipping a dose is a big deal, but when establishing your routine, it would be better to acquire pills that provide the dose you want.\n\nAnother example is someone who has 5K IU pills and wants to take 7500 IU every day. They alternate between taking 5K and 10K. This is an acceptable compromise, but perhaps it would be better to find 2500 IU pills to take with the 5K IU.",

        "body": "I hit the character limit so here are the last two questions:\n\n**24. Why is vitamin D giving me side effects?**\n\nMagnesium (see #16) is the most common solution to vitamin D side effects, but it does not resolve 100% of cases of vitamin D intolerance. Some trial and error may be required to figure out the problem, but with some patience, it is likely that it can be resolved.\n\nIf vitamin D is causing side effects, then you should do two things. First, write down the symptoms you are experiencing. This will help you isolate exactly what you’re feeling, which can give clues for solving the problem. Second, reduce your vitamin D dosage. See if you can tolerate a lower dose of vitamin D, such as 1000 IU. You may simply have to go slow, and increase your dosage in small increments over time in order to let your body acclimate.\n\nTolerance of oral supplementation and symptoms such as stomach upset may be improved by taking D3 with food. Sublingual dosing (discussed in the previous question) can be used to bypass the gut and avoid gastrointestinal issues.\n\nSometimes, vitamin D causes gut discomfort at first due to its role in regulating bacteria in the intestines. D3 causes the microbiome to rebalance, and the dying off of bad bacteria causes side effects like gut discomfort and body odor. This should resolve itself.\n\nAfter magnesium, vitamin K2 is the next step in terms of supplements. Bone pain can indicate a lack of K2. It’s also important to consume a balanced diet with adequate electrolytes (potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium), and to stay hydrated.\n\nDeficiencies in vitamin B12 and iron often coincide with vitamin D deficiency. Both of these nutrients are important for liver and kidney function, which are both involved in vitamin D metabolism. Treating low B12 and/or low iron may help to resolve symptoms of vitamin D intolerance.\n\nSometimes individuals experience issues due to lack of an additional cofactor involved in vitamin D metabolism. Those are: zinc, vitamin A, and boron. It may be useful to take a multivitamin to help cover your bases. You can look up symptoms of low zinc or vitamin A to see if it sounds like what you are experiencing. You can also try supplementing these things individually. Be aware that it is possible to take too much zinc or vitamin A, and generally one should not exceed 40 mg a day for zinc or 3000 mcg (10K IU) a day for vitamin A.\n\nIt’s worth trying a D3 supplement from a different brand as one may be reacting to an ingredient in the supplement that is not the vitamin D. Pay attention to the ingredients on the label.\n\nSome doctors give vitamin D injections. While this has the advantage of bypassing the gut, these doses are usually large, and larger doses are more likely to cause issues in those who do not respond well to vitamin D supplementation.",

    "body": "My theory on PSSD: I'm listing 42 things that have helped someone with PSSD and they all have to do with Dopamine regulation:\n\nIn my personal notes, I have a list of everything I've seen that has helped or hurt someone with PSSD, my hypothesis is simple, PSSD is not necessarily a lack of dopamine, but dopamine is Neurotransmitter that is affected, ie:\n\n1- Dopamine may be being produced in too little quantity \n2- Everything may be fine with dopamine, but Serotonin and Noradrenaline are being produced in absurdly greater quantities than Dopamine, preventing the Brain from making perfect use of it.\n   ** Personal account: I suffered from generalized anxiety for 4 years, with unbearable physical symptoms, I took desvenlafinaxine and it produces much more serononin and noradrenaline, \n      during its use my anxiety was not resolved (I believe I would need a 3x higher dose to reach the therapeutic point of the drug).\nHowever, I had a degree of sexual dysfunction that frightened me and I immediately decided to abandon the treatment, after which my libido disappeared, severe ED, genital numbness, as well as emotional anesthesia and other cognitive symptoms.\nWell, after 30 days of abstinence from the drug, the symptoms of PSSD really took hold in full force and at this exact point my anxiety also disappeared overnight and I feel as if it's asleep, \nand that at some point when serononin is low, it's there, ready to come back.\n\nTake a look at the list below:\n\n1- Natural substances\n2- Oils and Vitamins\n3- Dopamine precursors\n4- Hormone replacement\n5- Relaxing drugs\n6- Prolactin reducers\n7- Neurogenesis drugs\n8- Peptides, nootropics and amino acids that facilitate the interaction of neurotransmitters\n9- Psychotropic drugs\n10- Psychedelics\n\n\nZinc -> Zinc promotes a proper balance between sleep and wakefulness, as well as promoting the synthesis of Dopamine and Serotonin, low levels of which are associated with depression.\nGreen tea -> Green tea contains L-theanine, an amino acid that increases dopamine production in the brain.\nGarlic -> Yes, pre-clinical studies indicate that garlic may have neuroprotective effects, including increasing dopamine levels in the brain.\nGinger -> Yes, ginger can stimulate dopamine production, which can help relieve depression and anxiety. Ginger can also improve memory, focus and reaction time. \nPeppermint -> a popular tea that can help produce more dopamine is peppermint, as its fragrance can have stimulating and revitalizing effects. In turn, this can positively influence alertness and motivation.\nCardamom -> There is no evidence that cardamom increases dopamine, but studies on rats indicate that cardamom oil can improve behavioral disorders. \nMelatonin oil -> Recent findings indicate that melatonin can modulate the dopaminergic pathways involved in movement disorders in humans.\nOil of Oregano -> Oil of oregano can increase dopamine levels, according to animal studies. Oregano oil contains carvacrol, an antioxidant that can inhibit the breakdown of dopamine. \n\nVitamin-C -> Vitamin C helps produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter that regulates mood. Vitamin C also helps produce other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, adrenaline and noradrenaline. \nVitamin-D -> Vitamin D (cholecalciferol) and dopamine are related, as vitamin D helps regulate the production of dopamine in the brain. \nVitamin-B12 -> Vitamin B12 is necessary for the synthesis of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood and well-being.\nVitamin-B1 -> There is no evidence that vitamin B1 directly increases dopamine levels. However, vitamin B1 is important for brain function and energy production.\nVitamin-B6 -> Yes, vitamin B6 helps produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is related to pleasure and happiness. Vitamin B6 also helps produce other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and noradrenaline, which regulate mood. \nOmega 3 -> Yes, omega 3 increases the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is associated with mood and well-being. Omega 3 also increases serotonin and noradrenaline levels. \n\nShilajit -> Shilajit increases levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, helping with attention, reducing tiredness and increasing mood, as well as having an anxiolytic action, reducing stress.\nGinko Biloba -> Ginkgo biloba is known for modulating dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine signaling.\nTongkat-ali -> TA roots are a traditional “anti-aging” remedy and modern supplements aim to improve libido, energy, sports performance and weight loss. Previous studies have shown that properly standardized AT stimulates the release of free testosterone, improves sexual desire, reduces fatigue and improves well-being.\nPeruvian maca -> Mood enhancement: Many individuals who consume maca supplements report an increase in overall mood and energy levels. While this could be attributed to various factors, including improved nutrition and stress reduction, some users suggest that maca may contribute to these mood-enhancing effects by indirectly influencing dopamine levels.\n\nN-acetylcysteine (NAC) -> N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a derivative of the amino acid cysteine that can increase the release of dopamine in the brain. NAC is also an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory that can help treat psychiatric disorders. \nL-Tyrosine -> L-Tyrosine is a precursor of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, which plays a key role in regulating mood and feelings of well-being.\nMucuna (L-Dopa) -> This is a drug that treats Parkinson's disease. It acts by crossing the blood-brain barrier and converting into dopamine in the brain. Dopamine activates dopamine receptors, compensating for the decrease in the body's natural dopamine. \n\nTRT -> Testosterone, which is treated in Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT), modulates dopamine activity in the brain. Dopamine is related to pleasure and motivation. \nDHEA ->In humans, a LORETA study indicated that DHEA administration increases activity in the ACC and can impact activity in the hippocampus and insula ( Alhaj et al , 2006 ). DHEAS also modulates the release of dopamine and serotonin in hippocampal neurons ( Zajda et al , 2012 ).\n\nBaclofen -> Preclinical studies have shown that baclofen, by inhibiting the release of somatodendritic dopamine, prevents the development of cocaine-induced behavioural sensitization and abolishes the motor stimulant actions of cocaine ( Kalivas and Steward 1991 ).\nPregabalin -> Remarkably, pregabalin can produce changes in dopamine levels similar to other drugs of abuse. Previous findings indicate that the dopamine-1 (D 1 ) receptor is an important factor in dopaminergic neurotransmission 24 , 25 , 26 .\nKetamine -> Ketamine also has effects on the availability of some neurotransmitters, especially norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin.\nGHB      ->GHB has a biphasic effect on dopamine. Lower doses stimulate the release of dopamine by binding to receptors\n\nNaltrexone -> Naltrexone modulates dopamine release after chronic administration\nNSI 189 -> NSI-189 stimulated the neurogenesis of neural stem cells derived from the human hippocampus in vitro. In mice, NSI-189 stimulated the neurogenesis of the hippocampus and also increased its total volume. Therefore, NSI-189 can reverse the human hippocampal atrophy observed in severe depression and schizophrenia.The hippocampus is known to project and regulate the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway\nOleo Rosa - Damascena -> Animal studies have helped to understand how essential oils (EOs) work. It was discovered that EOs help increase levels of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA), which are substances in the brain linked to mood (happiness and motivation, respectively), which explains their calming effects. The antidepressant effect of EOs is related to an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that helps neuron health.\nCyproeptadine -> Cyproeptadine has historically been used as a prophylactic treatment for migraines due to its effects on serotonin and histamine. These effects may have some benefit in children with abdominal migraines over a short period, although further studies are needed.\n\nCabergoline -> Reduces prolactin production, excess prolactin inhibits dopamine production, so when we reduce prolactin it means we have a greater potential for dopamine release.\nKisspeptin -> Yes, kisspeptin is related to dopamine and other neurotransmitters, such as dynorphin and neurokinin B. Kisspeptin is a hormone that regulates fertility and brain sexual processing. \nPeptide BPC 157 -> BPC 157 modulates the activity of the dopaminergic system.\nAcetyl-L-carnitine -> Alpha Lipoic Acid and Acetyl-L-carnitine work together to maintain levels of dopamine, which is an important neurotransmitter for energy metabolism. These two antioxidants are also crucial for weight loss and strength training, and are indicated for increasing sports performance.\nAlpha Lipoic Acid -> Alpha Lipoic Acid and Acetyl-L-carnitine work together to maintain dopamine levels.\nMethylcobalamin -> Yes, methylcobalamin is related to the production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in mood. Methylcobalamin is an active form of vitamin B12 that helps maintain the health of the central nervous system. \n\nBupropion -> Drugs that raise dopamine levels in the brain, such as bupropion, have the potential to inhibit the feeling of hunger. \nLithium -> At the neuronal level, lithium reduces excitatory neurotransmission (dopamine and glutamate) but increases inhibitory neurotransmission (GABA), although these general effects are accompanied by complex compensatory changes that strive to achieve homeostasis.\n\nPsilocybin -> Psilocybin produces an increase in dopamine (which regulates mood) and another neurotransmitter that can promote brain plasticity, said Rucker. Psilocybin acts predominantly by modulating serotonin receptors, particularly 5-HT2A, promoting changes in brain connectivity that can redefine thinking patterns associated with depression.\nAshwagandha -> Yes, ashwagandha can increase dopamine levels in the body. Ashwagandha is a plant that can help regulate mood, reduce stress and improve quality of life. \nAyuasca -> Scientists concluded that in the brains of animals that took ayahuasca there were different levels of neurotransmitter production - noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin. Neurotransmitters propagate stimuli between neurons.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn a nutshell: \n\nIf we scan the entire Internet about PSSD, we'll be running a loop that will always come up with the same results: one of these 42 items has already helped someone to be cured of PSSD, either Partially or Completely.\n\nHaving said that, I think that the biomarker we need, and which doesn't exist yet, would be to measure our levels of Serotonin, Dopamine and Noradrenaline, not least because we must never forget that the basis of all the drugs that have caused PSSD has a direct action on neurotransmitters.\nWhat is the mechanism used by the industry/students to claim that drugs modify our neurotransmitters? It would be this same mechanism that could validate what I'm saying here.\n\nWe'll have questions involving things like: \n* SIBO - (Our entire microbiome is closely linked to the system and production of neurotransmitters, which may be why many suffer from and test positive for SIBO)\n* Methylation - (Methylation is a process that helps produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter). - In other words, if we have a problem with dopamine synthesis, it also makes perfect sense, and it's part of the way our RNA works.\n* SFN - Many people test positive for SFN, but I don't know how a treatment on peripheral nerve fibers could reverse damage to our emotions, for example.\n* Autoimmune system - Yes, dopamine regulates the immune system, acting on both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Dopamine may be related to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (just as serotonin and noradrenaline can affect our immune system).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI think that some things work for some and bring others down because we don't have a bio-marker telling us how dysregulated each individual's system is, which is why some even have more symptoms than others, greater or lesser intensity and longer/shorter recovery times.\n\nExample: When instead of trying to ingest a certain substance to stimulate dopamine, it might be necessary to ingest something to reduce serotonin, and for this reason they end up getting worse than they already were.\n\nI hope that I have contributed to the community and that the MODS allow the study to be shared so that we can develop discussions on this topic.\n\n\n** IMPORTANT **\n\nAt no point am I suggesting that you try the things in this POST!\n\nI'm just highlighting something in common between all the supplements/medicines I've studied and anecdotal reports that have had some result for someone with PSSD, I believe we can focus on this study and try to make a biomarker viable that will show us a path to follow in the future regarding dopamine x serotonin x noradrenaline indexes.\n\nUnknown data that can only be clarified by scientific researchers is the impact of steroids on our bodies. Melcangi is suspicious of changes in Pregnenolone, for example, which is the mother of many of our hormones and plays a major role in the way we feel about things:\nPregnenolone: Produces steroid hormones that play an important role in modulating brain activity and behavior. Steroids are also needed to regulate physiological activities such as memory, mood, food intake, awakening and reproduction. (All of the latter are affected in PSSD).",

    "body": "This is part of a series that highlights important supplements that helped me on my ongoing recovery from Long Covid.\n\nIt seems that one of the causes for my Long Covid symptoms has been a Vitamin D deficiency. Early on in the pandemic, low vitamin D was correlated with poor outcomes for those infected.\n\nI suspect this is due to Vitamin D's role in the body: it regulates both innate and adaptive immune sytem responses, helps the body deal with inflammation, supports regulatory t-cells, counters oxidative stress, supports both the mitochondria and vascular/endothelial health. This might also be low due to lack of exposure to sunlight, poor absorption due to damage to the intestinal lining, and also poor metabolism of vitamin D.\n\n[Vitamin D3](https://imgur.com/a/sczC7v8) (cholecalciferol) is made in the skin and then moves to the blood. It reaches the Liver where it is metabolizes using magnesium [(see my post on Magnesium deficiency)](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1k6y0ka/getting_over_it_magnesium/) into 25-hydroxy D3, and then to the kidneys where it uses Calcium and Phosphate to make 1,25-hydroxy D3 (calcitriol) or the active hormone version of D3. Deficiencies in Magnesium, Calcium, and Phosphate coould contribute to Vitamin D deficiency.\n\n# ***Signs of Vitamin D Deficiency***\n\nVitamin D deficiency can cause a range of symptoms, some of which are subtle and easily mistaken for other conditions. Here’s a rundown of common ones:\n\n### 🧬 **General Symptoms**\n- Fatigue and low energy\n- Muscle weakness or cramps\n- Bone pain, especially in the lower back or legs\n- Joint pain\n- Frequent infections (due to immune system suppression)\n\n### 🧠 **Mood & Cognitive Symptoms**\n- Depression or low mood\n- Anxiety\n- Brain fog or difficulty concentrating\n\n### 🦴 **Skeletal Issues**\n- Osteomalacia (soft bones in adults)\n- Osteoporosis (especially in older adults)\n- Increased risk of fractures\n\n### 🧪 **Other Possible Signs**\n- Hair loss\n- Slow wound healing\n- Impaired wound healing\n\n# ***Forms of Vitamin D Supplements I Like***\n\n- Vitamin D3 in an soft gel with oil, vitamin D3 needs oil to be absorbed properly.\n- Taken at breakfast with vitamin K2, which is used along with D3 to properly move calcium into our bones\n- Needs magnesium to function\n\n# ***Potential Issues***\n\n- Needs magnesium to function, which may be low for other reasons\n- I've experienced dizzyness when going into strong sunlight after a long winter, which resolved with magnesium",

One of them is that an employee in the laboratory gets infected out in the field while he or she collects samples in a bat cave.  \n>  \n>“Although it is part of the laboratory hypothesis, it is also part of the first hypothesis we have, i.e. direct transfer from bats to humans, **and we have considered that hypothesis as a probable hypothesis**.”\n\n(Danish translation by the [South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3145061/who-denies-shift-covid-19-origin-probe-after-china-mission). In the article, WHO also denies shifting opinion.)\n\nIn other words, he was saying \"direct transfer from bats to humans\" was a \"probable hypothesis\". This is in agreement with the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/origins-of-the-virus), which calls it a \"possible to likely\" hypothesis and calls a leak an \"extremely unlikely\" hypothesis, although Peter Embarek claims he himself thought it was merely \"unlikely\" when working on the report. The leak hypothesis was only included because Peter Embarek insisted on it and \"extremely unlikely\" was the worst alternative, \"impossible\" wasn't on the scale.\n\n# #2\n\nThere are two conspiracy theories about deleted data.\n\nOne is about internet activists claiming WIV deleted a database in September 2019, which is before evidence suggests human-to-human transmission started in November 2019. I.e. it's not causally connected to the outbreak.\n\nThe other conspiracy theory was about data apparently uploaded in 2020 and deleted later in 2020. This was spotted by [Jesse Bloom](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.18.449051v2.full.pdf) and even though an explanation was given he created a moronic conspiracy theory out of thin air about it, going at far as to accuse the authors of the data of obfuscation, which is an outrageous accusation to make in a paper.\n\nWell, [the data is now back](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/science/coronavirus-sequences-lab-leak.html) and available. There's apparently nothing interesting in there, which is unsurprising since it was uploaded in 2020 and there are no signs of any cover-up, which is unsurprising since it was available for months.\n\n# #3\n\n[Science is again stacking up against Vitamin D](https://www.eunethta.eu/rcr20/), \"the sunshine vitamin\" in scientific terms more accurately known as cholecalciferol and calciol... or \"snake oil\". I called it in 2020, currently there are 6 RCTs on its effect against the pandemic and 4 show no effect what so ever. One of the other two is the \"Spanish study\" which was [retracted](https://retractionwatch.com/2021/02/19/widely-shared-vitamin-d-covid-19-preprint-removed-from-lancet-server/) in the preprint stage and [the other one](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/o3na9p/opinions_on_a_covid19sarscov2_vitamin_d_rct_sus/) I'm currently working on getting retracted although the authors, journal, and publisher are stonewalling me, hopefully because they're on vacation. Unfortunately, there are still at least 24 on-going trials only on its effect against the pandemic. The reason I called is calciol has zero evidence of effect in treating any health condition. Although some critics claim it's effective against rickets, I've yet to see any evidence of that as rickets hardly exists in the industrialised world. [I've debunked another study](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/o4fkyy/another_doubtful_vitamin_d_study_in_the_pandemic/) which was reported in media around the world linking calciol with infections. Almost all evidence supporting calciol is observational without any casual evidence and since calciol is a negative acute phase reactant it's inhibited by inflammation, which is often misinterpreted as deficiency causing disease. Unless deficiency causes disease, it's not a vitamin. As such, it's more accurately called a pro-hormone. Calciol is extremely controversial, since there's great confusion about what it even is, how to measure it, what units to measure it in, and what range can be considered healthy or toxic. It's also the most common laboratory analysis and possibly the most common prescription in the US and this issue isn't isolated to the US.",

Again, I only supplement once a week, in the case of the Jarrow Multi I'm only taking one tablet, not the 3 they recommend daily.  So, a relatively small dose of all of these -- my strategy is I'm just trying to make sure I'm not critically missing any of the below in my food intake, to make sure I'm not on the edge of any bathtub curves.  My diet is heavy on mixed vegetables, natural fats, meat/seafood a couple times a week, a moderate amount of A2 and aged dairy; I avoid seed oils, added sugar, alcohol, and mostly avoid factory/packaged food products.  Not keto or paleo or low-carb/high-fat.\n\nI don't experience Niacin flush, or any other obvious skin/hair/nail symptoms (dry/flaky/cracking).

No matter what, vitamin d supplementation gives me terrible symptoms: anxiety, increased heart rate, insomnia, headaches, weakness etc.\n\nToday I tried dvelop brand vitamin d, which is calcifediol instead of cholecalciferol. Calcifediol is the active form of vitamin d that your body does not need to convert.\nSo far, a few hours after taking the supplement I can feel the vitamin d, but I have no side effects that I experienced before. I will keep updating\n\nDay 1 update: this was one of the first days I actually felt my deficiency symptoms lift. I felt pretty good and energized all day, my near constant anxiety went away and last night I also slept pretty good, compared to the broken sleep I am used to getting every night for the past 8 months. Since my deficiency, I fall asleep then wake up after a few hours, then have trouble falling back asleep and if I do it’s short lived. Last night I fell asleep and didn’t wake up until around 6am, but the difference was this time when I woke up I felt very tired and easily went back to sleep for another 2-3 hours.\n\nDay3: I got the classic night of insomnia from normal d3 supplementation, where I wake up in the middle of the night completely alert. This is the only side effect I have experienced so far with this type of d3 though. I am not experiencing any of the side effects I am used to, other than insomnia at this point. I have a very sunny week of UVI 10 where I live currently so I am going to take a break from the dvelop and get sunlight daily until it’s cloudy again. It seems that I can take it 1 day on, two days off and not experience any insomnia which is my plan going forward",

As the difference is cholecalciferol requires magnesium in the liver to be converted into calcifediol and obviously calcifediol is already in that form. \n\nMost people are magnesium deficient or borderline deficient. It might help you to supplement with magnesium if you can. On my website I just posted this as I am working on my second book and this is a rough draft of the chapter on magnesium for that book. https://judsonsomerville.com/magnesium-and-vitamin-d3/\nAs even calcifediol requires lots of magnesium.

        "body": "Yes there's more to the story. Do additional reading on the actual pathologies of hypoparathyroidism and CKD and it should make more sense.\n\nOne misconception you have is thinking vit d deficient = calcitriol deficient. The Vitamin D tests that are done to diagnose patients measure the prodrugs (ie the body's own store of vitamin D). One doesn't need much active calcitriol to sustain normal functions. That's part of the whole controversy of treating vitamin D deficiency according to what a supposed level based on a population statistic. \n\nHowever, the other side of the argument for treating deficiency is the actual prodrugs (vit D3 etc) being active themselves. There are receptors for them present outside of the skeletal system, alluding to a role in muscular/neuro/skin tissues. Thus supplementing with calcitriol would not fix a perceived deficit in function of these other systems as it does not act on those receptors.  \n\nAlso, using your T4/T3 analogy. Calcitriol has a much shorter half-life with a much quicker onset/offset, making it prone to cause dangerous swings in serum calcium level (which would be made worse in patient with an otherwise normal calcitriol level). So before picking an agent you'd need to ask yourself the question of what exactly are you setting out to treat lest you cause problems where none existed in the first place.",

I also know it \"bypasses the kidneys\", which may be why it has better absorption.

Likewise observed in the alfacalcidol as compared to the vitamin D group, respectively: a 3 year rate of patients with > or = 1 new vertebral fracture of 9.7% versus 24.8% (risk reduction: 0.61; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.81; p = 0.005); a 3 year rate of patients with > or = 1 new nonvertebral fracture of 15% versus 25% (risk reduction: 0.41; 95% CI -0.06 to 0.68; p = 0.081); a 3 year rate of patients with > or = 1 new fracture of any kind of 19.4% versus 40.6% (risk reduction: 0.52; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.71; p = 0.001). In accordance with the observed fracture rates, the alfacalcidol group showed a substantially larger decrease in back pain than the plain vitamin D group (p < 0.0001). Generally, side effects in both groups were mild, and only 3 patients in the alfacalcidol group and 2 patients in the vitamin D group had moderate hypercalcemia. We conclude that alfacalcidol plus calcium is highly superior to plain vitamin D3 plus calcium in the treatment of established GC induced osteoporosis, and the latter should no longer be used as monotherapy.\n\nAs a side note, my guess is the hypercalcemia had more to do with the 500mg supplementation of Calcium than either form of vitamin D.\n\nThere are also these studies I found comparing the two:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16142848\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10485984\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14513268\n\n",

    "body": "I’ve had extreme bruxism for most of my adult life, grinding thru night guards, waking up every morning with migraines, fatigue, and my adult molars wiggling like I’m 6 years old again waiting for the tooth fairy to come. I’ve tried every possible supplement and behavioral change the internet has to offer. \n\nLike many of you, I’m sure, I also have an extensive history of antibiotic use/gut issues. Many hardcore bruxers also have crohn’s disease, ibs, and fibromyalgia. I had chronic diarrhea as a child for many years (was thought to have crohn’s but just “grew out of it”), c. diff in my 20s, and SIBO in my 30s. Not to mention recurring sinus infections, chronic strep requiring hospitalization and IV antibiotics, and a bout of cholera from a trip to Cambodia. These details are just to paint a picture of how fucked my microbiome is. \n\nThe thing that was the most puzzling about my grinding is that it got so much worse when I took vitamin d supplements. I couldn’t take any multivitamins with even a small amount of d3 which is typically cholecalciferol. I would get worsening teeth grinding on top of new symptoms resembling osteomalacia (adult rickets) or fibromyalgia— all the bones and muscles from my hips down would ache. \n\nMy symptoms flew in the face of established research connecting vitamin d deficiency and bruxism and were particularly frustrating given my constant vit d deficiency. \n\nI also had a strange peeling on the inside of my cheeks and lips all the time that would go away for a week or so when i was on amoxicillin. That would also coincide with my grinding getting better. \n\nHang in there with me (or scroll down), I’m getting to the point soon. \n\nI recently went down a rabbit hole with my grinding and fibromyalgia-type symptoms after discovering the dr. Berg youtube video on B1 and vit d for bruxism, then the research on high dose thiamine from dr. Lonsdale and Elliot Overton and it’s implications on down regulation of the thiamine enzyme cascade. I went all in with the high dose from the start, eager for some kind of relief and experienced the paradoxical reaction (refeeding syndrome) myself where the symptoms I was looking to treat initially got worse with high dose supplements. Now I know why slow and steady wins the race!\n\nOnce I backed off the thiamine then slowly titrated back up, my body aches and extreme fatigue completely went away. But I was still tired, and still grinding. But that was the breakthrough in thinking that I needed. \n\nSeveral years ago I realized that my body couldn’t process normal vit d3 supplements. There are lots of reasons why this could be, maybe a genetic mutation, maybe bc of my altered microbiome — still trying to figure out the “why” of it all. I usually resorted to weekly tanning sessions, until I found another form of vitamin D that has been historically prescribed for people with chronic kidney disease called calcifediol — it’s just one more step further “activated” in the usual processing the stomach, liver, and kidneys do in the body from typical d3 pills. Finally I found a d3 supplement that didn’t make my grinding worse and make me feel like my bones were breaking! \n\nMy experience with the thiamine made me wonder, if maybe I just needed a lot more vitamin d in the form i could tolerate to stop the bruxism. And if the reason why it gets worse on traditional d3 is a kind of refeeding syndrome bc I’ve been deficient for so long, my body can no longer process it correctly. \n\nI’m now two weeks into taking 30,000 iu each day of calcifediol (along with my usual probiotic and multivitamin that doesn’t contain vit d) and my teeth are no longer loose, my headaches are gone, my mouth isn’t peeling, and I feel like a new person. If this continues, I might even be brave enough to try ditching the mouthguard! \n\nThe research on chronic thiamine deficiency and the metabolic/neurological implications are very new, but if my application of the overall theory to vitamin d deficiency is correct, I may be able to back off of the large doses of calcifediol and take normal d3 supplements again in a few months — assuming there isn’t an underlying genetic/permanent microbiome/immune system issue. \n\nAlso want to call out here that it’s not normal for even healthy people to lack sun exposure the way we do in modern society and that research indicates “traditionally living populations” have on average serum vit d levels far higher than the “healthy” range currently established by western medicine: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/traditionally-living-populations-in-east-africa-have-a-mean-serum-25hydroxyvitamin-d-concentration-of-115-nmoll/6188564A01361C5CF5F196229430E475 \n\nAlso, the ideal range for your body to feel good may just be higher than for others. This is also part of the thiamine research if you want to dive into it: some people may need to take it long term at high levels as a therapeutic to compensate for mitochondrial issues. \n\nSpeaking of mitochondria, the only other thing that has helped my grinding has been acetyl l-carnatine at 2000mg/day. \n\nHere is where I’ve been getting my vit d supplements:\n\nThere was a US company called d.velop that sold it over the counter but they are in the process of going out of business. There is also an affordable version from a UK company called Nouveau Healthcare that I’m currently using. \n\nIt is also safer/easier to take higher doses of calcifediol than traditional d3 bc you don’t need to worry about the k2 and magnesium cofactors to convert it, it’s already converted. \n\nAlso, shoutout to this post summarizing the research on glutamate in the brain and bruxism: https://www.reddit.com/r/bruxism/s/kVvFctB9Zj \n\nMy experience here is consistent with this theory as vit d helps protect against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity!\n\nI know so many people are suffering the way that I have, so hopefully this can help someone. Eager to hear your thoughts/experiences if you try it!\n\n\n",

I ordered it from Vecado along with small bags of Ami and Benevo kibbles to try, thinking \"what the hey, might be fun to cook my dogs dinner sometimes\" \n\nIt's a supplement powder that contains all the essential vitamins and minerals that are likely to be lacking in homemade food. It comes with recipes that you can make with normal (vegan) human food ingredients, and when you add the Vegedog powder it provides balanced nutrition. \n\nWarning: it SMELLS. When I first opened the bag, I did a double take at how stinky it is. I had to put the container inside a ziploc bag.  \n\nSupplement powder ingredients: Calcium Carbonate, Dicalcium Phosphate, DL-Methionine, Choline Chloride, Dried Kelp, Taurine, d-alpha tocopherol acetate, Sodium Selenite, Ferrous Fumarate, Zinc Oxide, Vitamin A Palmitate, Mixed Tocopherols, Copper Amino Acid Chelate, Cholecalciferol, Riboflavin, Vitamin B12 Supplement\n\nI tried the Oats and TVP recipe that came with the Vegedog, adding in some pureed raw fruits and vegetables (those are ok to ad lib in moderation since they are mostly water.) \n\nIngredients in the food I made (so you can see it's normal stuff):\n\n rolled oats, textured soy protein, fruit/vegetable mix (strawberry, broccoli, sweet pepper, carrot, cilantro) nutritional yeast, grapeseed oil, flaxseed meal, soy sauce, Vegedog powder\n\nI halved the original recipe because it was a huge amount of food and I wasn't sure they would like it. Even the half recipe was enough for 4 days for 2 small dogs. \n\nOMG they looooooooooved it. One was yipping and trying to jump on the counter while I was filling their bowls, and the other  was doing a little happy dance and he gobbled his serving in about 2 seconds without chewing. \n\nSo if you want to try something different, or you don't have any available premade vegan pet food where you live, Vegedog is an option. If you follow the recipes exactly, it meets AAFCO standards for complete nutrition for dogs. If you only want to home cook your dogs food occasionally as a treat it's still peace of mind that they're getting a balanced meal. And mine love it!\n\nThe manufacturer is US-based and you can order directly: https://compassioncircle.com \n\nI didn't get paid for this review, just wanting to share my experience and make it easy for others to explore more vegan pet food options.",

Given the assumption that the intake of any nutrient will deliver defined effects \\[ie, supplementation with vitamin D will lead to an increase in 25(OH)D or fracture prevention\\], it is clear that vitamin D2 does not fit this current nutritional notion. This is not to suggest that vitamin D2 is not efficacious, but, because the units of the 2 forms is clearly not equivalent, likely due to its distinct metabolic features and diminished binding of vitamin D2 metabolites to DBP in plasma, continual application of vitamin D2 in clinical use, including in research trials, only serves to confound our understanding of optimal vitamin D dosing recommendations. Furthermore, the public expects to derive the equivalent effect per unit dose of vitamin D, whether it is vitamin D2 or vitamin D3. The scientific community is aware that these molecules are not equivalent. Therefore, vitamin D2 should no longer be regarded as a nutrient appropriate for supplementation or fortification of foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n##",

The circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (mean ± sd) increased to the same extent in the groups that received 1000 IU daily as vitamin D2 (baseline 16.9 ± 10.5 ng/ml; 11 wk 26.8 ± 9.6 ng/ml), vitamin D3 (baseline 19.6 ± 11.1 ng/ml; 11 wk 28.9 ± 11.0 ng/ml), or a combination of 500 IU vitamin D2 and 500 IU vitamin D3 (baseline 20.2 ± 10.4 ng/ml; 11 wk 28.4 ± 7.7 ng/ml). The 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels did not change in the group that received 1000 IU vitamin D2 daily. The 1000 IU dose of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 did not raise 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in vitamin D-deficient subjects above 30 ng/ml.  \n>  \n>**Conclusion:** A 1000 IU dose of vitamin D2 daily was as effective as 1000 IU vitamin D3 in maintaining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and did not negatively influence serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels. Therefore, vitamin D2 is equally as effective as vitamin D3 in maintaining 25-hydroxyvitamin D status.\n\n[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2266966](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2266966/)",

Pharmacopoeias have officially regarded these 2 forms as equivalent and interchangeable, yet this presumption of equivalence is based on studies of rickets prevention in infants conducted 70 y ago. The emergence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D as a measure of vitamin D status provides an objective, quantitative measure of the biological response to vitamin D administration. As a result, vitamin D3 has proven to be the more potent form of vitamin D in all primate species, including humans. Despite an emerging body of evidence suggesting several plausible explanations for the greater bioefficacy of vitamin D3, the form of vitamin D used in major preparations of prescriptions in North America is vitamin D2. The case that vitamin D2 should no longer be considered equivalent to vitamin D3 is based on differences in their efficacy at raising serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, diminished binding of vitamin D2 metabolites to vitamin D binding protein in plasma, and a nonphysiologic metabolism and shorter shelf life of vitamin D2. Vitamin D2, or ergocalciferol, should not be regarded as a nutrient suitable for supplementation or fortification.",

Main things I found and that have MASSIVELY helped are:\n\n- Instead of just avoiding citric acid just the recommended hour before/after I now avoid it for basically as long as possible. \n\n- I also found that other vitamins etc have been shown to impact them including Niacin (B3), Cholecalciferol (D), Magnesium, sodium bicarbonate, choline and also probiotics. \n\nThey’re all in so many things so it can be a little time consuming to check the foods and drinks they’re in and the ingredients in packaged foods (especially all the forms of Vit C eg ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate) but once you’ve done it for a bit you know what to look for, what to avoid and when to eat what etc. \n\n- Also, for me personally (though I do have diagnosed gluten intolerance), gluten makes my ADHD symptoms way worse and have seen this elsewhere so I try to limit that. \n\n- Also, caffeine can reduce their effectiveness too, especially when having it so close to taking them.\n\nI still get all my nutrients/vitamins etc but have just changed the way/times that I have them and this has really helped.\n\nI’ve found this website super helpful - \n\nhttps://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01255 \n\nIt gives you a list of all the interactions etc and you can type ones in there and it’ll say whether is or isn’t impacted and some info.. I use this a lot and then look further into scientific studies and research etc (though I wish there was more done on adult adhd and diet and adult adhd in general). I have Elvanse/Vynase so it’s set to that but you can change it. \n\nI’m not a health professional this is just my own experience and countless hours of hyper-focused research (lol). However, changing these things has really helped me and I hope this is of some help to people, especially as I was previously on Xaggatin/Concerta which worked well in many ways and switched to Elvanse which I’ve stayed with. I think maybe if I’d done this before I’d not have needed to change and it could have saved me a lot of time, stress, and money.",

A brief review of research and evidence.\n\nQuestion: If our pituitary gland completely atrophies, will our reproductive system collapse?\n\nChatgpt: Yes, complete atrophy of the pituitary gland can seriously affect the reproductive system\n\nand even lead to a situation that can be called \"collapse\". The pituitary gland is a small gland located\n\nat the bottom of the brain and is responsible for the production of many hormones in the body.\n\nThese hormones regulate many important functions in the body, including reproductive functions.\n\nPituitary Gland and Reproductive System\n\nThe pituitary gland produces several hormones that have an important effect on the reproductive\n\nsystem. These hormones are necessary for regulating reproductive health for women and men.\n\nAtrophy of the pituitary gland leads to disorders in the production of these hormones.\n\nFor women:\n\nThe pituitary gland produces follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). These\n\nhormones:\n\nFSH ensures that the ovaries function properly, initiating egg production.\n\nLH triggers ovulation, which is the release of a mature egg from the ovary.\n\nThe pituitary gland also produces a hormone called prolactin. Prolactin is necessary for milk\n\nproduction and regulates breastfeeding after pregnancy.\n\nIf the pituitary gland atrophies, the production of these hormones can stop or decrease. This can stop\n\novulation, disrupt the menstrual cycle, and prevent pregnancy and childbirth. As a result, women's\n\nfertility is greatly affected.\n\nFor men:\n\nThe pituitary gland also produces FSH and LH in men. These hormones:\n\nFSH initiates sperm production in the testicles.\n\nLH triggers testosterone production in the testicles, which is necessary for sperm production and the\n\nmaintenance of male sex characteristics.\n\nA malfunctioning pituitary gland can lead to lower testosterone levels, a halt in sperm production,\n\nand therefore impaired male reproductive health.\n\nPituitary Gland Insufficiency and Reproduction\n\nIf the pituitary gland completely atrophies and hormone production stops, this condition is called\n\nhypopituitarism (insufficient pituitary gland function). Hypopituitarism can lead to complete\n\ncessation or serious impairment of the reproductive system. For women and men, this condition can\n\nresult in the menstrual cycle stopping, sperm production ceasing, decreased sexual desire, and\n\ninfertility.\n\nConclusion:\n\nComplete atrophy of the pituitary gland has profound effects on the reproductive system and can\n\nlead to loss of fertility. However, there are some medical treatments (hormone therapy, etc.) to\n\nsupport the function of the pituitary gland again, and some functions can be restored with these\n\ntreatments. However, when the pituitary gland completely atrophies, the reproductive system is\n\nusually severely impaired.\n\nSubtle interaction between vitamin D and the pituitary gland\n\n\"Unlike other vitamins, vitamin D is a fat-soluble steroid hormone rather than a cofactor for\n\nenzymatic reactions. The main role of vitamin D is to regulate bone metabolism and calcium-\n\nphosphate homeostasis. Vitamin D deficiency causes osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults and\n\nrickets in children. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression levels in the body are highly variable.\n\nInterestingly, VDRs are found in pituitary tissue. Not surprisingly, vitamin D levels can affect pituitary\n\nproduction or activity of hormones such as growth hormone, gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating\n\nhormone, luteinizing hormone), prolactin, corticotropin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). On\n\nthe other hand, pituitary hormones also affect vitamin D metabolism, and several pituitary diseases\n\nare known to affect bone health. The purpose of the present review is to collect available data on the\n\ncrosstalk between vitamin D and the pituitary gland.\"\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372663738\\_The\\_fine\\_crosstalk\\_between\\_vitamin\\_D\\_an](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372663738_The_fine_crosstalk_between_vitamin_D_an)\n\nd\\_pituitary\\_gland\n\nQuestion: How many percent of the pituitary gland is lecithin?\n\nChatgpt: Yes, the pituitary gland is estimated to contain lecithin up to 70%. This indicates that the\n\npituitary gland contains high levels of lecithin in its cell membranes and especially in its neural\n\nstructures, indicating that this chamber plays a critical role in cell properties, density, and healthy\n\nfunctioning of its structures. The high level of lecithin is essential for the generalized, permeability,\n\nand overall structural integrity of cell membranes, which ensures the proper maintenance of vital\n\nfunctions such as the production and release of hormones.\n\nquestion: so how many grams does the pituitary gland weigh in a normal person?\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nIn a normal adult, the pituitary gland usually weighs between 0.5 and 1 gram. This gland is located in\n\nthe lower part of the brain, in the bone structure called sella turcica. The pituitary gland is an\n\nimportant endocrine organ responsible for hormone production in the body, and performs many\n\nbasic functions such as growth, metabolism, and reproduction.\n\nquestion: are there receptors in the pituitary gland that affect vitamin d? how do these receptors\n\nwork?\n\nchatgpt: Yes, there are receptors in the pituitary gland that interact with vitamin D. These receptors\n\nare known as Vitamin D receptors (VDR) and are responsible for transmitting the effects of vitamin D\n\nat the cellular level. Vitamin D is a lipid-soluble vitamin that has many important functions in the\n\nbody, especially having critical effects on bone health, calcium balance, and immune functions.\n\nVitamin D Receptors (VDR) and Pituitary Gland\n\nVitamin D receptors located in the pituitary gland are activated to transmit the effects of vitamin D to\n\ncells. VDRs are located in the nuclei of cells and these receptors initiate certain changes at the\n\ngenetic level as a result of vitamin D binding to the cell. The working mechanism of these receptors is\n\nas follows:\n\nBinding of Vitamin D: After vitamin D (especially vitamin D3, cholecalciferol) is taken into the blood, it\n\nis activated in the liver and kidneys and turns into its active form, 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This\n\nactive form binds to the Vitamin D receptors on the cell membrane.\n\nReceptor Activation: When active vitamin D binds to the VDR, the receptor undergoes a\n\nconformational change. This change allows the receptor to transport it to the cell nucleus and\n\nregulate gene expression.\n\nGenetic Effects: When the VDR in the nucleus binds to vitamin D, it initiates the transcription of\n\ngenes (i.e. the conversion of genes to RNA). This can result in the production of certain proteins. In\n\nthe pituitary gland, this can lead to the activation of genes related to calcium metabolism and\n\nhormone production, for example.\n\nHormone Regulation: In the pituitary gland, vitamin D can interact with parathyroid hormone (PTH)\n\nand other hormones that regulate calcium balance. In addition, vitamin D can affect certain\n\nhormones in the pituitary gland, such as prolactin and ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone).\n\nPituitary Gland and Vitamin D\n\nThe pituitary gland is sensitive to vitamin D levels, and a deficiency or excess of vitamin D can affect\n\nthe pituitary gland’s hormone production and release. For example, a deficiency in vitamin D can\n\nprevent the pituitary gland from properly producing hormones related to calcium metabolism (for\n\nexample, parathyroid hormone).\n\nIn summary, vitamin D receptors in the pituitary gland are proteins that transmit the cellular effects\n\nof vitamin D, alter gene expression, and play an important role in the body’s calcium metabolism and\n\nhormone regulation. These receptors are critical for vitamin D to work effectively.\n\nA person taking 1600 IU of vitamin D each day increased their semen (ejaculate) volume by 23.5%.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/cumbiggerloads/comments/18ipv81/vitamin\\_d\\_study\\_235\\_increase/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cumbiggerloads/comments/18ipv81/vitamin_d_study_235_increase/)\n\nHira ratan manek and pineal gland.\n\n\"It is the center from which the sun's rays are received and once received, they are sent to different\n\nparts of the body.

Vitamin D is a vitamin that has many important\n\nfunctions in the body and plays a role in calcium metabolism in particular. The pituitary gland is a\n\ngland responsible for the production of many hormones in the body and can indirectly interact with\n\nvitamin D.\n\nIn addition to helping regulate calcium levels, vitamin D can also affect the function of the pituitary\n\ngland. The pituitary gland regulates the body's hormone balance, and these hormones can affect\n\nvitamin D levels. For example, the pituitary gland regulates the production of parathyroid hormone\n\n(PTH). PTH interacts with vitamin D to control calcium levels. Vitamin D plays a role in balancing PTH\n\nlevels and maintaining bone health.\n\nQuestion: How much vitamin D is in the gray matter of the human brain?\n\nChatgpt: In the gray matter of the human brain, vitamin D is usually found in very low\n\nconcentrations. Vitamin D levels in the brain can be quite low compared to blood levels, because\n\nvitamin D is usually concentrated in bones and tissues related to the immune system. However, there\n\nare also vitamin D receptors in the gray matter of the brain, and there are some studies that suggest\n\nthat this vitamin may have a potential effect on neurological functions. It has been suggested that\n\nvitamin D in the gray matter of the brain may provide neuroprotective effects and may affect the\n\ndevelopment of some neurological diseases.\n\nVitamin D levels in the gray matter of the brain are also related to an individual's blood vitamin D\n\nlevels. However, more research is needed on this topic.\n\nQuestion: How much vitamin D is in the prefrontal cortex?\n\nChatgpt: Although it is difficult to determine the exact amount of vitamin D in the prefrontal cortex,\n\nsome studies provide important clues on this subject. Vitamin D can be effective through vitamin D\n\nreceptors (VDR) found in brain cells. These receptors are found in various regions of the brain, and\n\nthe prefrontal cortex is one of these regions.\n\nVitamin D levels in the brain are generally thought to be related to vitamin D levels in the\n\nbloodstream. However, different parts of the brain may have different rates for vitamin D\n\nmetabolism. Since the prefrontal cortex is particularly associated with cognitive functions and higher-\n\nlevel mental processes, it is suggested that vitamin D levels in this region may have an effect on\n\nmental health and cognitive performance.\n\nSome animal studies and limited human studies suggest that vitamin D receptors and vitamin D\n\nmetabolism play an important role in different regions of the brain, especially in the prefrontal\n\ncortex. However, there is no definitive information on the amount of vitamin D in the prefrontal\n\ncortex, and more research is needed on this subject.\n\nIn conclusion, it is certain that vitamin D is present in the prefrontal cortex, but there is no definitive\n\ndata on the exact amount of this vitamin. Vitamin D is considered a component that affects brain\n\nfunctions, but research on its density in a specific area is still limited.\n\nVitamin D has been found to speed up the clearance of tuberculosis (TB) bacteria from the lungs of\n\npeople with multi-drug resistant TB, according to a study of 1,850 patients receiving antibiotic\n\ntreatment.\n\n[https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/early/2018/12/14/13993003.02003-2018](https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/early/2018/12/14/13993003.02003-2018)\n\nVitamin D deficit is associated with accelerated brain aging in the general population\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925492722001172](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925492722001172)\n\nTaking higher-than-recommended doses of vitamin D for five years reduced the risk of atrial\n\nfibrillation.

This research underscores the importance of vitamin D supplements,\n\nparticularly during winter, for immune health\n\n[https://www.mcgill.ca/channels/channels/news/how-vitamin-d-deficiency-can-lead-autoimmune-](https://www.mcgill.ca/channels/channels/news/how-vitamin-d-deficiency-can-lead-autoimmune-)\n\ndiseases-360580\n\nQuestion: Vitamin D and brain volume relationship\n\nChatgpt: Vitamin D can have an important effect on brain function, and some studies show that\n\nvitamin D levels may be related to brain volume. While vitamin D regulates the balance of calcium\n\nand phosphorus in the body, it also affects some mechanisms that support neurological health.\n\nStudies on the relationship with brain volume suggest a link between vitamin D deficiency and\n\nshrinkage of brain volume. In particular, the decrease in brain volume with age has been associated\n\nwith Alzheimer's disease and other neurological diseases. Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the\n\ndevelopment of such diseases.\n\nHowever, more research is needed to fully understand the effects of vitamin D levels on brain\n\nvolume. While some studies suggest that vitamin D supplements may improve brain function and\n\nslow down cognitive decline, there are no definitive and generally accepted results on this subject.\n\nIn summary, there is a possible relationship between vitamin D and brain volume, but more scientific\n\nresearch is needed to understand exactly how this relationship works.\n\nVitamin D deficiency weakens dopamine system, leading to overeating and obesity - Calcitriol (active\n\nVitamin D) Upregulates Dopamine D2 receptors, Increases Dopamine Production (↑ Tyrosine\n\nHydroxylase \\[↑TH\\]) \\[mice\\] (2016)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4875352/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4875352/)\n\nOptimal vitamin D spurs serotonin: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D represses serotonin reuptake transport (\n\nSERT) and degradation ( MAO-A) gene expression in cultured rat serotonergic neuronal cell lines\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6042449/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6042449/)\n\nIrish scientists prove Vitamin D levels linked to depression (source: Irishcentral.com)\n\n[https://www.irishcentral.com/news/trinity-dublin-irish-scientists-vitamin-d-depression](https://www.irishcentral.com/news/trinity-dublin-irish-scientists-vitamin-d-depression)\n\nVitamin D Improves Neurogenesis and Cognition in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease (high\n\ndose)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29318446](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29318446)\n\nAdult vitamin D deficiency disrupts hippocampal-dependent learning and structural brain\n\nconnectivity in BALB/c mice.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712221/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712221/)\n\nLow-vitamin-D diet lowers cerebral serotonin concentration in mature female mice \\[2020\\]\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32920521/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32920521/)\n\nDouble blind, clinical trial shows that the use of vitamin D supplement improves sleep quality,\n\nreduces sleep latency, raises sleep duration and improves subjective sleep quality in people of 20-50\n\nyear-old with sleep disorder.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28475473](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28475473)\n\nGeneral result: Vitamin D increases the volume of the pituitary gland because the pituitary gland uses\n\nit to renew itself. This is exactly what is called brain nutrition. It is very strange that the human body\n\nneeds a very high amount of vitamin D, but it is a bit difficult to meet this need in the world we live in\n\ndue to the weather conditions. Then only one question arises. In which climate did humans grow up?\n\nOr did we come from a planet with different climates? The half-life of the vitamin D we get from the\n\nsun is about 3/6. It is very difficult to get vitamin D in winter. How did we manage to adapt to a world\n\nthat does not suit our body's reactions? What if this planet is not ours? Did we occupy this planet?\n\nWhat if this is the only reason we suffer? What if the real owners of our planet are reptiles?\n\n>\n\nThe original creator of this is u/Mononoawarre",

    "body": "I'm vitamin D deficient - had a 15 ng/ml reading of 25(OH)D in December 2022, likely got even worse since.\n\nI've tried vitamin D supplements at various doses and forms - both D2 and D3 give me tachycardia (racing heart rate up to 130 BPM) and high blood pressure (up to 150/100), in addition to an extremely irritable / \"off\" feeling, of being both sleepy and angry at the same time - super tired and frustrated with everything. This happens even with just 1000 IU of either form of vitamin D.\n\nIt's almost paradoxical in a way - it feels like I'm on a strong adrenaline surge of anxiety and irritability, but I'm very sleepy at the same time. This almost reminds me of the irritability and anger from sleep deprivation, but with a very high heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nTo my surprise, I've noticed this starting to happen also after days with 30 minutes of sun exposure (in shorts) or more. My heart rate starts rising 8-10 hours after sun exposure, and the irritability starts the next day. Both symptoms go away pretty quickly though, within 48 hours from when they began: my blood pressure, heart rate normalize within 48 hours, and my irritability, anger, and anxiety disappear too.\n\nIf I avoid the sun and completely remove vitamin D from my diet, I have none of these symptoms. My heart rate returns to 65-70 BPM at rest, my blood pressure to around 110/70 - which are both normal. I realize it's not an acceptable solution to completely avoid vitamin D, though, as a deficiency can get life-threatening at some point.\n\nThe measured form of vitamin D in the blood, 25(OH)D, obviously has a long half life of 14-15 days, so this form is unlikely to be the culprit. However, Cholecalciferol (D3) - the form of vitamin D made in the skin from UV ray exposure - has a short half life of only around 24-25 hours, so unlike its metabolite 25(OH)D, it doesn't accumulate or build up in the blood significantly.\n\nI'm therefore thinking I directly have a negative reaction to the precursor forms of vitamin D - both Cholecalciferol (D3) and Ergocalciferol (D2) - but not to their active metabolites with long half lives: 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2, respectively. I'll try getting sun exposure anyway since as said, vitamin D deficiency can become life-threatening if severe; perhaps at some point my body will get used to this.\n\nHas anyone else gone through something similar?",

I've asked multiple doctors and they all say they've never heard of such a thing (pretty sure they all think it's in my head). There are tons of posts here of people with the same or very similar issues and nobody seems to have an answer. \n\nI've been taking the supplements that people here always claim will fix the problem like Vitamin K (my supplement has K1 and two different forms of K2), Magnesium, B vitamins. I've been on those for a couple of years now. Has not had any effect on the problems from D. Zinc supplementation has had a bit of an effect, in that the heart palpitations at night don't wake me up as frequently if I take Zinc. \n\nWhenever my blood calcium levels are measured, I'm always almost at the top of the normal/acceptable range. I feel pretty sure that this has something to do with it, because I've noticed similar symptoms when I take other drugs that also affect calcium. Unfortunately, I'm unsure what kind of steps I can take with that information.\n\nOut of curiosity, has your calcium level been measured, and is it kind of high?",

I get similar mood effects but for me I get symptoms like muscle tension and pain, insomnia, acid reflux, pimples appearing overnight and aching testicles. But I do not get these side effects from the alternative form calcifediol you can get it from the brand d.velop. It still causes some problems like making me sleepy or possibly interfering with libido but it was definitely a net gain since it stopped the brutal depression and cognitive impairment I was experiencing from D deficiency. \n\nI believe some foods also have this active form like mussels and oysters. I get a better effect from those than the supplements but could be all the minerals.\n\nAlso look into the whole magnesium vitamin D relationship I think it has everything to do with these side effects. For some reason it seems like I have issues retaining magnesium and vitamin D just quickly induces deficiency or imbalance.",

    "body": "Hello, my fellow \"lucky\" club members! :)\n\nI've purchased the above book, read 15% so far and it's looking very promising. You can read an overview and reviews here:\n\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35166778-the-keystone-approach](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35166778-the-keystone-approach)\n\nThe author says she has PsA. She references hundreds of research studies, many of which can be found online and checked. The book is pretty up to date and even references studies as recent as 2018.\n\nSome quotes from the book here:\n\n\"New evidence is emerging on a daily basis that points to the gut and the microbiome as the origin of a variety of autoimmune diseases.\"\n\n\"But what exactly causes the immune system to become confused and lose the ability to accurately distinguish between normal proteins and foreign antigens? In most cases the cause is some combination of the following factors:\n\n\\- Damage to the gut barrier\n\n\\- Immune activation from certain gut microbes or other infections\n\n\\- Genetics\"\n\n\"When the intestinal barrier becomes damaged and allows bacterial toxins to cross through the resulting gaps, the immune system is bombarded, triggering immune activation on a massive scale. Critically, the resulting immune activation is not limited to the gut. The end result is systemic inflammation and damage to the skin and joints.\"\n\n\"How exactly can inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract drive autoimmune diseases that primarily affect other parts of the body? For many years, this was a mystery because it was thought that the primary immune cells involved in autoimmunity were “specific responders” (such as B cells and T cells), which recognize specific proteins in the skin and joints. With these cells at the center of the process, it was not clear how leaky gut could influence joint pain or psoriasis. Yet it is now known that other nonspecific “first responder” cells play a key role.\\[21\\]\n\nThese nonspecific immune cells include mast cells and T helper 17 cells (Th17 cells). Unlike other immune cells, they do not need to recognize a specific antigen to become activated. Instead, they can be spurred into action by a variety of molecules derived from the gut, including food proteins and bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide.\n\nLipopolysaccharide, which is a toxin produced by many species of gut bacteria, is a particularly strong trigger for these nonspecific immune cells. If we have both a compromised intestinal barrier and a lot of gut bacteria producing lipopolysaccharide, this toxin can cross the gut barrier and bind to receptors on the surface of nonspecific immune cells.\n\nWhen the cells detect the presence of lipopolysaccharide, they switch into “inflammation mode” and start producing chemical mediators that drive the inflammatory response.\\[22\\] (These mediators include TNF and Interleukin-17, which are the targets of biologic medications). This process is now thought to be a key mechanism underlying many autoimmune diseases.\\[23\\]\n\nTo stop this process and halt inflammation, we need to reduce the population of bacteria producing lipopolysaccharide while also addressing the root causes of increased intestinal permeability. These causes include\n\n\\- Celiac disease\n\n\\- Food allergy\n\n\\- A lack of beneficial microbes\n\n\\- An excess of specific inflammatory gut bacteria or yeast\n\n\\- Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"The Basic Plan.\n\nIf you suffer from any form of autoimmune disease, there is a small set of fundamental dietary changes and supplements that can produce an immense payoff when it comes to calming inflammation. These basic steps are the most critical for shifting the balancing of species in the microbiome, healing the gut barrier, and giving the immune system the healthy fats it needs to return to a normal equilibrium.\n\nDiet\n\n\\- Start by focusing on what you should be eating more of: high-fiber and antioxidant-rich vegetables, fish, poultry, lean meat, and olive oil. These foods should be the foundation of most meals.\n\n\\- Adopt the Level 1 low-starch diet by removing gluten-containing grains, corn, soy, peanuts, quinoa, and potatoes. Limit other starches to two servings per day (preferably rice, legumes, or starchy vegetables).\n\n\\- Cut back on added sugar.\n\n\\- Try to space meals four hours apart with no snacking, to allow time for the digestive system to perform its important cleaning cycle.\n\nSupplements\n\n\\- To help support the levels of other anti-inflammatory resident microbes, suppress harmful bacteria, and heal the gut, start taking a Level 1 probiotic with breakfast each day. Look for a product that includes L. rhamnosus GG (e.g., Culturelle) or B. infantis, B. breve, or B. longum (e.g., Jarro-dophilus Allergen-Free, Klaire Ther-Biotic Metabolic Formula). Take the probiotic with breakfast each day.\n\n\\- Consider adding a vitamin D supplement containing at least 2000 IU of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in an oil-based liquid or soft-gel. You may need a short-term treatment with a higher dose, such as 5000 IU per day, if you are deficient.\n\n\\- On days that you do not eat oily fish such as salmon, sardines, or mackerel, add a fish oil supplement containing at least 2 grams of DHA and EPA.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor now I've only started taking probiotics and replacing sugar with stevia, but I'll try to take a serious approach and follow the recommendations from the book for a couple of months and see.\n\nHave anyone of you read this book or tried what it recommends? Also, would be interesting to see comments from doctors, if we have doctors here.\n\nUPDATES:\n\n\\- The author says she has PsA\n\n\\- I've just found this article:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5440529/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5440529/)  which is very similar to what the author writes in her book.",

Yes, you read that right. This is an entirely non-intrusive procedure, it’s just taken from the wool itself of course. So this type of vitamin D3 is acceptable for use by vegetarians, however we know that this isn’t a product any real, convinced vegan would want. So we needed a new source for it. We finally managed to get our hands on a plant-based vitamin D3 variant, extracted from lichen. This is great news! However, because it has to be integrated into the rest of our vitamin/mineral mix, the internal process at our manufacturers is long and boring. It has now been accepted to be put into production but we are looking at a good 6 weeks before we can actually use the product in our own production.\"",

What is vitamin D, and why do I need it?**\n\nVitamin D refers to a group of fat-soluble compounds that is essential for human health. It is classified as a vitamin due to its availability in small amounts in food. However, it’s actually a hormone, which makes it different from other vitamins. When people refer to vitamin D in supplement form, they are usually referring to cholecalciferol.\n\nThe impacts of vitamin D on human health are far reaching. The most commonly referred to benefit of vitamin D has to do with making strong bones. This is because vitamin D plays a role in calcium uptake from food by enabling active absorption. When people started to live in dense, urban environments, an issue with bone development in kids called rickets became a problem. Scientists realized that this was due to lack of sun exposure and could be treated with vitamin D. Some governments decided to fortify foods like dairy with vitamin D in order to reduce this problem in the general population.\n\nThe amount of vitamin D needed to make sure that the body can absorb adequate calcium to prevent rickets is rather low compared to the amount that can be obtained from the sun. Vitamin D, when provided to the body in adequate doses, does much more than just help to help absorb calcium. It regulates the expression of over a thousand genes, is integral to proper function of the immune system, and can interact with vitamin D receptors that are present in every cell in the human body.\n\nOver time, populations have developed lifestyles that involve spending more and more time indoors. Newer research has shown that many people are missing out on the benefits of optimal vitamin D levels in respect to their physical and mental health. Some academics even consider the prevalence of low levels of vitamin D to be a global health crisis.\n\n**2. How do I get it?**\n\nNaturally, vitamin D3 is produced in the skin from direct exposure to ultraviolet B radiation, which makes up approximately 5% of sunlight. A form of cholesterol in the skin reacts with UVB and forms vitamin D3. The compound formed in the skin is cholecalciferol, which then goes on to be metabolized into calcifediol by the liver and calcitriol by the kidneys.\n\nSome D3 exists in animal products or foods that have been fortified. The highest concentrations are found in organ meats like liver. Mushrooms are sometimes referred to as a source of vitamin D, but they contain a different form, D2 (ergocalciferol). Generally speaking, there are no significant dietary sources of vitamin D.\n\nStudies show that the body can produce 10-25K IU of vitamin D3 when exposed to sufficient UVB light. Unfortunately, in modern society, there are several factors which affect our ability to get sufficient vitamin D3 from the sun:\n\n* We spend the majority of our time indoors. Glass blocks UVB, so sitting in a car or by a window does not count.\n* When outside, we cover most of our body with clothing which blocks UVB. We wear sunscreen for skincare reasons. Sunscreen blocks UVB like clothing. In fact, many people mistakenly believe that all sun exposure is bad for them. While sensible use of sunscreen to prevent excessive sun exposure is valid, its effect on vitamin D3 production should be noted.\n* UVB is measured on an index. Some governments provide UVB forecasts. The number on the index must be at least 3 in order for vitamin D3 to be produced. The availability and intensity of UVB depends on the distance from the equator. Many people live in places in the north, such as New York, Canada, or Germany where UVB is only available during the summer, and even during the spring and fall, the window of opportunity during the day when the UVB index is above 3 is limited. So, one could lay out and sunbathe on a sunny morning, but not make any vitamin D3.\n* The evolutionary advantage of melanin is to protect the skin from excessive UVB exposure. This means that people with dark skin need more sun exposure to make the same amount of vitamin D3. Dark skinned people who are living in places that are far from the equator will not be able to get adequate vitamin D3 from the sun even if they tried.\n* Guidelines for sun exposure are written with the idea of much of the body being exposed. That means when they talk about being out in the sun it’s not just about your hands and neck or even your arms and feet but having your torso exposed. If one works an office job, it is probably difficult for them to find a place to be shirtless outside on their lunch break.\n* People who live in urban environments may not have the opportunity to get direct sun exposure because they don’t have a place like a balcony to lay out, or it faces the wrong direction.\n* Weather is another factor worth noting. Clouds reduce UVB. If one lives in a place that is often overcast, then their opportunity to make vitamin D3 naturally is diminished.\n\nSo, we turn to supplements in order to get vitamin D. The main idea behind supplementing vitamin D3 is to replace what one should be getting from sunlight. The question of how much that should be remains, and is answered below.\n\n**3. Which vitamin D3 should I buy?**\n\nVitamin D3 is a basic supplement, so it is cheap and widely available. It can be found at your local grocery store. Some governments regulate the amount available in individual pills. Some of these regulations are outdated, and you may find yourself with a smaller dose than you were looking for. You may turn to international, online retailers to acquire appropriate doses. Or, you may simply take multiple pills to make your desired dose.\n\nVitamin D3 is available in tablets, softgels, tinctures, and sprays. Softgels contain a carrier oil that aids in absorption, as vitamin D is fat soluble. Persons who don’t want to swallow pills can get tablets and use a pill crusher or purchase a liquid form.\n\nMultivitamins usually do not contain significant amounts of vitamin D3, so a standalone supplement is required.\n\nVitamin D dosage in measure in International Units (IU’s). This is a scientific system of measurement. It can be misleading because it makes a small amount of something sound like a large amount. 1 microgram (mcg) of vitamin D is 40 International Units (IU’s). So, if I tell you to take 10,000 of something, that sounds like a lot, but if I tell you to take 250 of something, then it might sound more reasonable. 10K IU is 250 mcg which is a quarter of a milligram. If you took 10K IU every day for 80 years, that would add up to 7.3 grams of vitamin D, which is about one and a half teaspoons.\n\nSince vitamin D3 is a basic supplement, it’s best to keep things simple and go with a big name brand. As with any supplement, it is important to pay attention to factors which determine the quality of a supplement:\n\n* Does this brand appear to be reputable? Is it widely available?\n* Does the label clearly display relevant information about ingredients and dosage?\n* Does the product have indications of third party testing or a certification like USP which indicates it is tested for quality?\n* Does the label have a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) indication or other information about the quality of the supplement?\n\n**4. How are vitamin D3 supplements made?**\n\nVitamin D3 is made commercially by taking lanolin, the grease from sheep’s wool, and irradiating it to form cholecalciferol. So, vitamin D3 supplements are made from an animal product.\n\nIf you want a vegan vitamin D3, look for a product that is made from lichen. If a supplement label does not specify that the D3 is made from lichen or that it is vegan, then assume it was made from lanolin.\n\n**5. How do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient?**\n\nSymptoms of low vitamin D can include: fatigue, poor sleep quality, compromised immune function (being sick all the time), allergies, muscle weakness, poor digestion, cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, and hair loss.\n\nVitamin D status is assessed with a blood test that looks at the level of calcifediol in the blood. This is the storage form of vitamin D that cholecalciferol (the D3 from the sun or supplements) is turned into. The name of the test is 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 or 25(OH)D3. A 25(OH)D3 serum level is considered to be a reliable indicator of vitamin D status.\n\nThe results of the test are indicated by two different kinds of units depending on the country one lives in. There are nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) which usually has a reference range of 30-100 ng/ml at the lab and nanomole per liter (nmol/L) which usually has a reference range of 75-250 nmol/L. Please specify units when sharing test results. They can be converted back and forth with the following ratio: 1 ng/ml = 2.5 nmol/L.\n\nVitamin D deficiency is typically diagnosed if the test result is under the end of the reference range, 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/L). This can get a little confusing because sometimes the threshold for deficiency is 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L) and 20-30 ng/ml (50-75 nmol/L) is referred to as insufficient.\n\nTo put it plainly, the threshold for deficiency in these reference ranges is too low. They were established based on the role of vitamin D to help absorb calcium to prevent rickets. Newer research reveals that there are many benefits to a daily, adequate supply of vitamin D which correlates with higher serum levels. Many vitamin D researchers consider 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/L) as the threshold for benefits to the immune system. Generally, we advise anyone below this level to supplement vitamin D.\n\nIf you just got diagnosed as deficient, you may wonder why people here aim for higher levels of vitamin D. That is because they are in pursuit of optimal health and the full benefits of vitamin D3. Many doctors operate based on outdated information concerning vitamin D and its importance, and as a result, they are happy to just top you off to get you into the reference range without paying more attention to it. Some doctors don’t even have vitamin D on their radar and don’t bother testing for it. So, keep in mind that while correcting your deficiency is your priority, it’s important to think long term about reaching an optimal vitamin D level.\n\nIf you can’t get a test, then you can reasonably predict your vitamin D status by considering your lifestyle in terms of sun exposure, your skin color, and location. Basically, if you aren’t making a deliberate effort to get sun (if it’s available), then you aren’t getting enough vitamin D3.\n\n**6. How do I get tested?**\n\nTalk to your doctor or go to a private lab. In the United States, a blood test should be covered by insurance or run about $50 at a private lab.\n\nThere are two different types of the vitamin D test, immunoassay and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS). Both are fine options, but an LCMS is preferable if it is available as it is more accurate at higher levels. Usually having the “3” in 25(OH)D3 indicates and orders an LCMS test whereas 25(OH)D is immunoassay.\n\nSometimes the test will display D2 and D3. We don’t really care about D2. You can simply look at the total vitamin D.\n\nMake sure you (or your doctor) doesn’t accidentally test for calcitriol instead which is 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or 1,25(OH)2D. This looks at the active form of vitamin D that is made by the kidneys. That test is only ordered for specific diagnostic reasons, and the number it gives you is not your vitamin D level.\n\nThere are at-home tests. They can be an effective way to screen for vitamin D deficiency but are not useful for tracking progress or dialing in dosage.\n\n**7. Do I need to stop taking vitamin D supplements before my test?**\n\nNo. Vitamin D takes time to metabolize into the form that shows up on the test, and blood serum level does not widely fluctuate with daily dosing.\n\n**8. Why did my doctor prescribe me D2 instead of D3?**\n\nD2 (ergocalciferol) was discovered before D3 (cholecalciferol), and much of the early research on vitamin D and bones was done with D2, so it became the standard for treating deficiency. It remains because of legacy reasons. In other words, it’s outdated. D3 is what we get from the sun, and that’s what we want from supplements. D2 is for mushrooms.\n\nD3 is a better choice for supplementing than D2 because it is more effective at raising serum level, and it provides the full benefits of vitamin D for the immune system. D2 does not have the same vitamin D activity as D3.\n\n**9. Why did my doctor prescribe me a large weekly dose of vitamin D?**\n\nAnother thing doctors tend to do with the standard protocol to treat vitamin D deficiency is give infrequent, large doses, often on a weekly basis. This is referred to as bolus dosing. It is outdated, and only looks at vitamin D through the endocrine system. It’s conceivable that some practitioners just stick with what they can order through insurance/the healthcare system.\n\nConsistent, daily dosing of vitamin D3 is the best way to treat vitamin D deficiency and maintain an optimal vitamin D level. Daily dosing is more effective at raising serum level than weekly or monthly dose even when the total amounts are equivalent. Daily dosing ensures consistent supply of vitamin D3 available which is necessary to access the full benefits of vitamin D3 to the immune system and other parts of the body such as the brain. Think about the fact that humans evolved outside and they got sunlight pretty much every day. We can optimize our health by making sure we get a consistent supply of D3 regardless of our sun exposure.\n\n**10. Well, my doctor gave me the wrong thing, so what should I do?**\n\nThat’s for you to decide. It really depends on how hands on you are with your health and what your relationship with your doctor is like. You can disregard their prescription, and take a daily dose of D3. If you don’t want to blow them off, then you can take what they gave you, and also start daily dosing. Keep in mind that, either way, you will need a daily dose of D3 to maintain your level.\n\n**11. How much vitamin D3 should I take?**\n\nThis is the big question for many people. Dosing should generally be discussed in terms of a target vitamin D level. Depending on one’s goals, that target level may be different. This is a topic of ongoing discussion within the community.\n\nThere are several variables which can affect dosage requirements and cause the same dose to yield different effects between individuals.\n\n* Body mass: Larger persons require more vitamin D3 as with any nutrient.\n* Body fat: Fat sequesters vitamin D and overweight individuals can require higher doses to get the same effect.\n* Absorption issues: Persons with malabsorption issues will need higher doses because not all of it is absorbed.\n* Genetics: Differences in individual physiology or genetic resistance to vitamin D can mean that a different amount of vitamin D3 is required.\n\nEarlier, the difference between correcting a deficiency and achieving optimal level was mentioned. Most persons here want the full benefits of vitamin D3 and take a dose that approximates what can be achieved from sunlight. They target the upper end of the reference range, 80-100 ng/ml. Some individuals with certain health issues wish to access the therapeutic value of higher vitamin D levels that go above the reference range. We know that these serum levels are safe. That doesn’t mean that you need to aim that high.\n\nFor most people to get the full benefits of vitamin D, they will want to aim for >80 ng/ml. This is still within the commonly used reference range which is safe and achievable through sunlight. Studies on populations living indigenous lifestyles measure levels around 70-80 ng/ml. Levels as high as 120 ng/ml from sunlight alone have been reported in lifeguards who spend all day in the sun.\n\nIn order to reach this level, most people will need to take at least 10K IU (250 mcg) D3 every day. It can take months for your vitamin D level to stabilize. Some individuals need 10K IU just to get above 50 ng/ml. Others will end up closer to 100 ng/ml.\n\nHere are some fictional examples to illustrate the point:\n\n* A 5'11\", 260 lb person with light skin who gets lots of sun has a vitamin D level of 57 ng/ml. They want to be at 90 ng/ml for benefits to immune functions and sleep. Due to their size, they need 10K IU daily to hit that target.\n* A 5'7\" 140 lb person who gets less sun has a level of 46 ng/ml and the same target level but only needs 5K IU to hit it. A 5'3\" 120 lb person who gets tons of sun but has a generic resistance to vitamin D has a level of 34 ng/ml, and they need 15K IU daily to hit 90 ng/ml.\n* Another 5'3\" 120 lb person also gets tons of sun, but they have dark skin and live in France, so they don't get much vitamin D3 naturally. They have a level of 27 ng/ml and need 10K IU to hit 90 ng/ml.\n\nTesting is helpful because it gives a metric that one can use to dial in vitamin D3 dosage. Technically, the correct amount of vitamin D3 one should take is what is needed for them to reach their target vitamin D level.\n\n**12. When should I take vitamin D3?**\n\nTake D3 in the morning. Naturally, you’d get D3 during the day. Taking it at night can disrupt sleep.\n\n**13. How long should I take vitamin D3 for?**\n\nThe body continuously uses vitamin D3, so one needs to keep providing D3 to the body. Vitamin D supplementation is indefinite. Remember, it’s replacing what you should be getting from sunlight.\n\nIntake of vitamin D3 correlates with serum level on a curve, meaning that taking double the dose will not double your level. Any dose you take will eventually plateau. This may be because more vitamin D is utilized at higher levels.\n\n**14. Do I really need supplements, or can I just use the sun?**\n\nThe sun is obviously a valid source of vitamin D3, but your ability to get sufficient D3 from the sun depends on the factors mentioned previously.\n\nIt is also worth considering that supplementation allows us to go beyond the limitations of natural factors to optimize our health and treat illness with the therapeutic value of D3.\n\nIf you get a lot of sun while the UVB is above 3, then you can factor that into your vitamin D3 intake.\n\n**15. How long will it take to treat my deficiency?**\n\nThis depends on several factors. You may start to see progress and feel better in just a few weeks, but it can take months for your level to stabilize. Some people find that they are not responding well to their dosage when they retest and have to increase their dosage. Some people prefer to treat their deficiency aggressively with a higher dose, known as a loading dose, before switching to a long term maintenance dose.\n\nHere are some fictional examples to illustrate the point:\n\n* Someone tests at 21 ng/ml. They take 10K IU daily. They retest in six weeks. Their level is going up. Six months later they are at 83 ng/ml. They continue to take that dose to stay around that level.\n* Someone else also tests at 21 ng/ml. They take 5K IU. When they retest a month later, their level has barely gone up. They decide to increase their dosage to 15K IU. They then have to retest in another month to see how that is going.\n* Someone tests at 9 ng/ml. They decide to treat their deficiency aggressively by taking 20K IU a day. After two months, they are at 74 ng/ml. They decide to cut it down to 10K IU as a maintenance dose.\n\n**16. Do I need to take anything with vitamin D?**\n\n**Fat**\n\nVitamin D is fat soluble, so taking it with a meal that contains fat is a good idea. However, if you take a softgel with a carrier oil that serves as a fat source, then that’s probably good enough. The idea of vitamin D being fat soluble has to do more with fat being available than specifically consuming them both at the same time, but individuals who are having trouble absorbing supplements or who want to get the best absorption should take it with food.\n\n**Magnesium**\n\nThe most important thing to pay attention to when supporting vitamin D metabolism is magnesium. This mineral is utilized for many purposes by the body. Magnesium is used by vitamin D3 metabolism at several steps, from cholecalciferol to calcifediol to calcitriol. Adequate magnesium intake is necessary to support vitamin D supplementation.\n\nMagnesium is obtained through diet. Food sources of magnesium include dark leafy greens, nuts and seeds, beans and lentils, whole grains, and dairy. Unfortunately, modern diets tend to be lacking in magnesium content due to processing of foods, preference of refined grains over whole grains, growing of commercial varieties of produce that are less nutrient dense, and possibly due to nutrient depletion in soil. So, most people don’t get enough magnesium from their diet. This can be addressed with dietary changes, but to correct low magnesium status, and to help back up vitamin D3 supplementation when treating a deficiency, it is a good idea to supplement magnesium.\n\nThere are different forms of magnesium available in supplements. All magnesium supplements are chelated, meaning that the magnesium is bound to something else. Popular choices include magnesium glycinate (typically taken at night), magnesium malate (typically taken in the morning), magnesium citrate (too much has a laxative effect). Additional details about the types of magnesium can be found in threads in the subreddit or elsewhere.\n\nMagnesium supplements are best tolerated when the dose is worked up in increments. Magnesium is also best absorbed in small doses, so that means instead of taking 400 mg of elemental magnesium all at once, one might take 200 mg in the morning and then another 200 mg with lunch.\n\nVitamin D3 actually increases the absorption of magnesium, so it is conceivable that your need for supplements may diminish over time. However, as it’s hard to overdo magnesium supplements and magnesium has many benefits on its own, people choose to continue to take it.\n\nIt is important not to rely solely on supplements for magnesium intake. Magnesium rich foods are more bioavailable than supplements and should be added to or increased in the diet.\n\nTesting for magnesium is not reliable as the tests only look at magnesium content in the blood or red blood cells. 99% of the body’s magnesium is in intracellular storage in bones in tissues, and 1% is extracellular fluids. Only 0.3% is in the blood. So, unlike vitamin D testing, a test for magnesium is not a good indicator of magnesium status. In other words, the test can come back within the range, but you still need to increase magnesium intake to top off your stores.\n\nReplenishing magnesium in the body can take time, several weeks, or even months. Some people experience side effects like body aches, twitching, constipation, anxiety, or trouble sleeping from vitamin D supplementation due to a lack of magnesium. If these issues persist, it’s best to back off on the vitamin D by reducing dosage or pausing supplementation, and focus on building up magnesium in the body.\n\n**Vitamin K2**\n\nAnother cofactor that is often discussed online is vitamin K2, which helps move calcium around in the body. Is it absolutely necessary to take K2 with D3? The short answer is no. A better statement is that it can be a good idea to take K2 with D3.\n\nNaturally, we get D3 from the sun. The K2 that the body needs to move around calcium comes from diet and bacteria in the gut. There are more forms of K2 from these sources than the ones available in supplements. One may benefit from a K2 supplement if their diet doesn't have enough. Dietary sources include animal products and fermented foods like cheese. Vegetables have K1, which the body can convert some of to K2, but if someone is vegan, it may be a good idea to supplement K2.\n\nPeople disagree about the best form and ideal dose, so one should focus on D3 first. You can take your time to research K2 MK-4 and MK-7. A failure to take a K2 supplement will not result in arterial calcification or deposition of calcium into soft tissues from D3 supplementation. People say this but never back it up with evidence. That’s because there’s no research to support this claim.\n\nSo, why do so many people insist that you *need* K2? The idea probably came from thinking that we need some kind of insurance or extra thing to make up for taking doses that are higher than the recommended 4K IU upper limit when a simpler explanation is that this limit is simply outdated and too low. We do not discourage vitamin K2 supplementation, but the need for it should be understood in the appropriate context. For example, K2 is used to manage the risks associated with very high doses of vitamin D3 that are administered under medical supervision to treat autoimmune disease. If you decide to supplement K2, which has many benefits for cardiovascular health on its own, then it is best to avoid combination D3+K2 supplements at first. This enables you to figure out what works for you. If you take a combination supplement and experience side effects, then you won’t know which of the two is causing problems. Some people experience heart palpitations from K2 MK-7. Once you figure out your routine and preferred form, you can opt for the convenience of the combo supplement.\n\n**17. Can I take too much vitamin D?**\n\nIt is possible, but it likely requires far more than you think. The conservative range of 30-100 ng/ml and the threshold for toxicity of 150 ng/ml were established with wide safety margins and are unlikely to be exceeded with a daily dose of 10K IU which approximates sunlight exposure. Updated literature suggests that vitamin D toxicity does not occur until well over 300 ng/ml (750 nmol/L) and is simply not a concern with the amounts of vitamin D3 that people should be taking. Doses over 50K IU daily can potentially cause issues over an extended period of time. Megadosing something like 100K IU is reckless unless you are under medical supervision that monitors relevant factors through testing.\n\nThe concern you’ll read about is that too much vitamin D causes hypercalcemia which is too much calcium in the blood. There are three things one should note:\n\n* It’s more useful to speak in terms of serum level instead of dosage as different doses can lead to different levels in different people. Basically, a one size fits all claim that X amount is too much vitamin D, without discussion of serum level, is misleading.\n* Hypercalcemia is diagnosed with a blood test that shows an elevated level of calcium. Without that result, you do not have hypercalcemia.\n* It is possible to experience side effects from vitamin D supplementation for other reasons. These are discussed below. Do not jump to a conclusion and assume you have hypercalcemia which is very serious.\n\nOne of the advantages of getting a vitamin D blood test is that you can accurately monitor your vitamin D status to make sure your level is where you want it.\n\n**18. My level is too high. What should I do?**\n\nIf your level got higher than you'd like, simply halt or reduce your vitamin D intake, and it will go down as the body uses it up.\n\nFor example, someone tackles a deficiency by supplementing 15K IU vitamin D3. They respond well and end up testing at 112 ng/ml. They only wanted to be around 85 ng/ml. They reduce dosage to 10K IU. Eventually, their level drops to 93 ng/ml.\n\n**19. Will vitamin D3 cure my X?**\n\nMaybe.\n\nVitamin D3 affects nearly every aspect of human health. It’s hard to say if it will treat your issue if it’s not a common side effect of low vitamin D, but you may be pleasantly surprised. Think of it like drinking water to correct dehydration which then gets rid of your fatigue. You’ll have to supplement and find out. We love to hear success stories, so feel free to post about your experience.\n\n**20. Why won't my level go up even though I'm taking D3?**\n\nThere are three possible explanations for this:\n\n* You aren't taking enough. Increase your dosage. Remember that the correct amount to take is the one that gets you to your target level.\n* You don’t have enough magnesium available to metabolize vitamin D properly.\n* You have issues with malabsorption. Try bypassing the gastrointestinal tract with sublingual dosing. This involves absorption of D3 through the membranes in the mouth. Take a softgel, poke a hole in it, squirt it under your tongue, and hold the liquid there for at least several minutes. There are also tinctures and vitamin D spray products on the market.\n\n**21. Why is vitamin D giving me side effects?**\n\nMagnesium is the most common solution to vitamin D side effects, but it does not resolve 100% of cases of vitamin D intolerance. Some trial and error may be required to figure out the problem, but with some patience, it is likely that it can be resolved.\n\nIf vitamin D is causing side effects, you should do two things. First, write down the side effects you are experiencing. This will help you isolate exactly what you’re feeling, which can give clues for solving the problem. Second, reduce your vitamin D dosage. See if you can tolerate a lower dose of vitamin D, such as 1000 IU. You may simply have to go slow, and increase your dosage in increments over time in order to let your body acclimate.\n\nTolerance of oral supplementation and symptoms such as stomach upset can be improved by taking D3 with food. Sublingual dosing (discussed in the previous question) can be used to bypass the gut and avoid gastrointestinal issues.\n\nSometimes, vitamin D3 causes gut discomfort at first due to its role in regulating bacteria in the intestines. D3 causes the microbiome to rebalance, and the dying off of bad bacteria causes side effects like body odor. This should resolve itself.\n\nVitamin K2 is the next step in terms of supplements. Bone pain can indicate a lack of K2. It’s also important to consume a balanced diet with adequate sodium, potassium, and calcium and to stay hydrated.\n\nDeficiencies in vitamin B12, which is important for kidney function (remember that the kidneys make calcitriol), and iron (the relationship here is more complex, but vitamin D helps to regulate iron status), often coincide with vitamin D deficiency. Treating low B12 and iron many help to resolve symptoms of vitamin D intolerance.\n\nSometimes individuals experience issues due to lack of an additional cofactor involved in vitamin D metabolism. Those are: zinc, vitamin A, and boron. It may be helpful to take a multivitamin to help cover your bases. Look up symptoms of low zinc or vitamin A to see if it sounds like what you are experiencing. You can also try supplementing these things individually.\n\nIt’s worth trying a D3 supplement from a different brand as one may be reacting to an ingredient in the supplement. Pay attention to the ingredients on the label.\n\nAnother form of vitamin D3 called calcifediol is available for oral supplementation. This is the form that the liver converts cholecalciferol into. Some individuals who have exhausted all other options find that taking this form works for them. It is typically available by prescription but is sometimes found over the counter. Caution should be exercised with calcifediol supplementation as it behaves differently in regards to serum level than normal vitamin D3 supplements. It will raise 25(OH)D3 in a linear manner instead of on a curve, and it will not simply plateau, so figuring out a maintenance dose is different.\n\nAn individual with a rare allergy to lanolin can react negatively to D3 as it’s commonly made from this. The side effects will be like those of an allergic reaction such as trouble breathing and itching, rashes, or hives on the skin. An alternative form of D3 is made from lichen and marketed as vegan D3.\n\nIf you’re still having trouble, seek help by posting in the sub with the “Please Assist” flair.\n\n**22.

This is referred to as bolus dosing. \n\nIt's true that bolus dosing has been used here to describe weekly dosing but bolus dosing is a medical term, and I really think medical terms should be used here as they are by doctors otherwise things get very confusing, when doctors talk about bolus dosing they are talking about yearly or sometimes quarterly doses, not weekly or monthly. \n\n>Earlier, the difference between correcting a deficiency and achieving optimal level was mentioned. Most persons here want the full benefits of vitamin D3 and take a dose that approximates what can be achieved from sunlight. They target the upper end of the reference range, 80-100 ng/ml. \n\nI don't think this section is worded in a very realistic manner if you are just a rando passing by.\n\n1. The evidence for benefits above 70ng outside of rare autoimmune disorders is very poor as far as I've seen (if you have studies saved that indicate the opposite I'd love to see them) expecting benefits above 100ng is really quite fringe as far as I can tell (not that I haven't considered it myself lol)\n2. Realistically, if a person tests above 90ng the odds that their doctor is going to start shouting and become rather uncooperative is nontrivial and that's just not how that section reads\n3. It's perfectly fine to take a fringe stand or have activist opinions on health but it should be represented as such in some way so that people know what they are getting into, if you round up 100 doctors very very few of them would think it sensible to target 100ng or above.\n4. There is enough cognitive dissonance on the topic of health, best to acknowledge what is consensus and what is not, even if some of that consensus is not wise.\n\nThe magnesium section makes me a little bit uncomfortable but I guess that's just my own experience, I've seen basically 0 studies showing problems with it but personally I became calcium deficient when I supplemented too much (200-300mg elemental) and got better by doing less. It's weird when people talk about it as a panacea but I guess it is what it is.\n\nAll in all I think it's a pretty awesome FAQ, clearly a lot of work went into this 👍",

        "body": "How about a section on UVB Lamps for Supplementing Vitamin D?\n\nCertain lamps are designed specifically to stimulate the skin’s natural production of vitamin D. These use special bulbs that emit a narrow band of ultraviolet B (UVB) light, typically in the 280–320 nm range. This wavelength mimics the portion of sunlight responsible for triggering vitamin D synthesis in the skin.\n\nUnlike other types of UV light, these lamps do not emit harmful UVC rays, nor do they produce significant amounts of UVA, which is primarily responsible for tanning and skin aging.\n\nManufacturers generally recommend using these lamps 3–5 times per week for just a few minutes per session. These guidelines are conservative and intended for individuals with normal vitamin D levels. People who are deficient may need to start with short sessions and gradually increase exposure based on skin response. Overexposure to UVB can cause sunburn and skin peeling, so it’s important to increase duration cautiously.\n\nProfessional-grade UVB lamps typically cost $300–600. While this may seem expensive, they can be a worthwhile investment, especially for those who don’t respond well to oral supplementation.\n\n⚠️ What are not UVB lamps:\n\nThese do not produce sufficient UVB and are ineffective for vitamin D production.\n\n* Full-spectrum lamps\n* Grow lights\n* SAD lamps (for seasonal affective disorder)\n* Tanning lamps\n\n⚠️ DIY UVB Lamps:\n\nThere are online guides for building your own setup, but be very cautious. It is essential that the bulbs:\n\n* Emit only UVB (not UVC or excessive UVA)\n* Are tested using a reliable UV meter capable of detecting UVC\n\nDo not rely solely on packaging or manufacturer claims. Many bulbs marketed for reptiles or plant growth can emit dangerous wavelengths that pose serious health risks.",

        "body": "I have revised #11 as follows (Reddit is bugging out, so I'm doing two comments):\n\n11. How much vitamin D3 should I take?\n\nThis is the big question for many people. Dosing should generally be discussed in terms of a target vitamin D level and not just in terms of IU’s. Depending on one’s goals, that target level may be different. This is a topic of ongoing discussion within the community. Our goal is to equip people to make the best decisions for themselves, not to prescribe a one size fits all solution.\n\nThere are several variables which can affect dosage requirements and cause the same dose to yield different effects between individuals.\n\n* Body mass: Larger persons require more vitamin D3 as with any nutrient.\n* Body fat: Fat sequesters vitamin D and overweight individuals can require higher doses to get the same effect. The dose may have to be 1.5-2 times higher.\n* Absorption issues: Persons with malabsorption issues will need higher doses because not all of it is absorbed.\n* Genetics: Differences in individual physiology or genetic resistance to vitamin D can mean that a different amount of vitamin D3 or even a higher serum level is required to get the same effects.\n\nEarlier, the difference between correcting a deficiency and achieving optimal level was mentioned. Most persons here want the full benefits of vitamin D3 and take a dose that approximates what can be achieved from sunlight. This is done by targeting the upper end of the reference range.\n\nA good level for an adult to aim for is about 80 ng/ml or a range of 75-85 ng/ml (188-213 nmol/L).\n\nSome individuals with certain health issues wish to access the therapeutic value of higher vitamin D levels that go above the reference range. We know that these serum levels are safe. That doesn’t mean that you need to aim that high.\n\nFor most people to get the full benefits of vitamin D, they will want to aim for >80 ng/ml. This is still within the commonly used reference range which is safe and achievable through sunlight. Studies on populations living indigenous lifestyles measure levels around 70-80 ng/ml. Levels as high as 120 ng/ml from sunlight alone have been reported in lifeguards who spend all day in the sun.\n\nIn order to reach this level, most adults will need to take about 10K IU (250 mcg) D3 every day. It can take months for your vitamin D level to rise and stabilize. Some individuals need 10K IU just to get above 50 ng/ml. Others will end up closer to 100 ng/ml.\n\nOne approach is to dose based on body mass with 100 IU per kilogram. So, a 70 kilogram individual (154 lb) would take 7000 IU a day. As this equation may produce a number which is hard to precisely dose with pills, some rounding is appropriate.",

    "body": "Sorry for the lack of updates as of late - the times when we're working on the most things are often the times we have the least time to say anything about them. I'm hoping to have all of the above out by the end of Q1 2018, but we'll say Q2 just to give some leeway and so people aren't disappointed.\n\nSo in order from the title:\n\n**Keto/GlycoGenesis V1.3 & MicroGenesis V1.0**\n\nOur most recent order of the SBF micronutrient mix from the US was held up in customs for a long time. Had we not purchased earlier than normal, we'd have run out and not been able to ship orders. This is obviously bad, so we've accelerated the rate at which we get our own mix made by a UK manufacturer. \n\nThis mix will go into both KetoGenesis and GlycoGenesis, and is fairly similar to Super Micros, with a few changes to its contents - in fact, it is more similar to their intended 2018 micronutrient mix, in that it removes all cyanocobalamin and folic acid in favour of other forms that don't require any methylation. In addition, it incorporates all 8 vitamin E isomers, some adenosylcobalamin, the active forms found in the body of riboflavin and B6, some vegan cholecalciferol and some MK4 in addition to the MK7 and phytonadione.\n\nDue to the quantity required to buy in, we will be releasing this mix for sale to DIYers. I still need to run through quotes from the manufacturer before even estimating a price, but it will be offered. The mix is currently set to weigh 24 grams for a day's worth, which can easily be split into 3 or 4 meals. I may add in some gum arabic so portions can be measured with teaspoons or tablespoons, but I'm unsure as of yet.\n\nFor a full view of the mix including the quantities and forms of all micronutrients and some notes, please [see here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sysZ9ZoRAmqZkr8vb6lPl3TWD8xEb9q8B9X8UPkdWsg/edit#gid=0). \n\n\n**PhytoGenesis V1.1**\n\nIn that same spreadsheet, you may have seen the sheet for PhytoGenesis v1.1 [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sysZ9ZoRAmqZkr8vb6lPl3TWD8xEb9q8B9X8UPkdWsg/edit#gid=1682358783). Some of you may remember we released a phytonutrient mix a while back, but unfortunately we were unable to make it price competitive and there wasn't enough interest to justify its continued stocking. In this version, I've been able to source some cheaper components, and by splitting the mix into a base mix and some optional extras, it has become a lot easier to offer. \n\nAs detailed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sysZ9ZoRAmqZkr8vb6lPl3TWD8xEb9q8B9X8UPkdWsg/edit#gid=1682358783), we'll sell this in 1-month and 6-month packs, with the base mix being £1/day for 1-month orders and £0.80/day for 6-month orders. Then CoQ10 will be available for £0.10/day extra, sulforaphane for £0.40/day extra, and pterostilbene + grape seed extract for £0.45/day extra. \n\nYou may notice looking at the spreadsheet that a few of the ingredients are different to the thread I linked above, namely ellagic acid, hesperidin and bromelain, which have been replaced by promegranate juice extract, orange peel extract and pineapple stem extract respectively. This is partially due to issues with stocking these ingredients in isolated forms, due to shipping times often being upwards of one month. There are some benefits to the new ingredients - in particular pomegranate juice extract - however, hence their inclusion. \n\nMuch like with MicroGenesis, I'm going to need to do some testing to ensure serving sizes are convenient, but that won't take too long.\n\n**Higher protein versions of KetoGenesis and GlycoGenesis**\n\nI've been mentioning these for some time, and they are absolutely on the way. As we like aiming for exact quantities of micronutrients (in particular electrolytes) and protein powders contain these, it hasn't been quite as simple as just adding an extra amount of protein powder, as electrolyte sources would have to be adjusted. However, this is pretty much done now.\n\nAs such, these versions will be coming out along with v1.3, though in order to keep our SKUs from increasing by an unmanageable number, at least for the foreseeable future, these will only be available in a limited number of flavours. These will cost £0.60/day more than their normal protein-content equivalents, and naturally have a higher protein content. The calorie content will also be higher as a result of this, both for KetoGenesis and GlycoGenesis.\n\nPlease note that this is not going to contain extras like creatine or beta-alanine - those are inclusions I have planned for a future potential product that is designed more as a pre-workout shake, but will not be released for some time.\n\n**New packaging**\n\nThis only concerns KetoGenesis 5-day packs and is fairly minor. We've been testing with a slightly smaller oxo-degradable bag, and have found that it is still able to easily and efficiently store 5 day's worth of KetoGenesis powder, regardless of flavour. The current bags we are using measure 33.5cm x 23.5cm, with the new bags we are trialling measuring 31cm x 21cm. This will both decrease waste and increase the amount that can be stored in a given area, which can increase convenience.\n\nAs always, if you have any comments on any of these changes, or suggestions for other things you would like to see, please get in touch either here or via contact@genesisfoods.eu - we'd love to hear from you.",

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI had chronic mild acne and keratosis pilaris since my early twenties (I’m 36 now). Never had the classic teen breakouts, but I went through puberty quite late, so that may have delayed the onset. Thinking back, it was definitely mild, but chronic in that it was always there; I can’t remember going more than a month without at least one pimple showing up. The problem was always made infinitely worse because I had a bad habit of squeezing them. It wasn’t so much an issue in my twenties as collagen production was still high and I had fairly quick wound healing; however, reaching my thirties and doing the same thing has resulted in a combination of hypertrophic scarring, PIE, and PIH. The emotional, self-esteem hit was enough to the point where I would put on light makeup (somewhat emasculating as a man) to cover the damage before going to work and sometimes even calling in sick.\n\nBelow, I’ve laid out what has worked for me to clear up the recurring acne, and what I’m currently doing to heal the scarring/pigmentation left behind. The high-level approach here starts with the diet; approach all food as a diabetic and become a chronic label reader. Don’t rush out to the drug-store to find a quick fix; 99% of these brands, even those marketed towards clearing your acne, are actually highly comedogenic and will only make the problem worse. I also think it’s important that the solutions are simple and efficient, as this will develop proper habits without thinking or wasting time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Clearing the Breakouts\n\n* **Eliminate or significantly reduce refined carbohydrates** (cake, cookies, potato chips, pasta, soda, etc.). Committing to this one item alone is what cleared the root of the breakouts for me.\n   * Studies/abstracts regarding refined carbohydrates and acne: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=refined+carbohydrates+acne](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=refined+carbohydrates+acne)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Control the overproduction of sebum with retinol**. If you can, try to find a product that combines vitamin A/D3/K2 (retinol/cholecalciferol/menaquinone) as the three together are synergistic.  Alternatively, you can find a similar vitamin profile by taking cod liver oil/butter oil together. These are the only vitamins I recommend, everything else you should be getting through food.\n   * Studies/abstracts regarding retinol and acne: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=retinol+acne](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=retinol+acne)\n   * Studies/abstracts regarding cholecalciferol and acne: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=cholecalciferol+acne](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=cholecalciferol+acne)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Avoid the top allergens** (soy, wheat, dairy, etc.). Important for clearing symptoms of leaky gut syndrome and dirty blood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Healing the Damage\n\n* **Avoid comedogenic and inflammatory ingredients**. The general consensus is to avoid anything with oils, dyes, and synthetic fragrances. I’ve included a list below, but there are many comprehensive lists on the internet. You’ll find that as you become a chronic label reader, most of the drug store brands are absolute trash. I’ve also included a link to EWG’s database where you can look up the toxicity of individual ingredients and products.\n   * Comedogenic Ingredients: [https://acnetreatmentcenterwa.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/pore-cloggin-ingredients.pdf](https://acnetreatmentcenterwa.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/pore-cloggin-ingredients.pdf)\n   * Skin Deep database: [https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Use mild topical peels like glycolic acid or salicylic acid**. These are great for scarring, PIE and PIH as they encourage cell turnover and collagen synthesis. Vinegar is a good low-cost grocery store alternative (5% acetic acid or lower). The key is to not overdo it. If you’re considering a TCA peel or acidic solutions above 10%, please consult a professional as these can be extremely dangerous if not done properly.\n   * Studies/abstracts regarding glycolic acid and acne: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=glycolic+acid+acne](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=glycolic+acid+acne)\n   * Studies/abstracts regarding salicylic acid and acne: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=salicylic+acid+acne](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=salicylic+acid+acne)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Xylitol as a replacement for soap/shampoo/mouthwash**. As I’ve come to learn more about comedogenic ingredients and the fact that my skin is highly sensitive, xylitol so far might be the smoking gun. I keep a bag of pure xylitol by the shower and use it to clean my skin and hair (it has the texture of a sugar granule, so it acts as an exfoliant); I also take a small pinch and swish it around in my mouth for a few minutes as it’s great for teeth/mouth bacteria. Studies on rats have also shown that it can increase collagen production.\n   * Studies/abstracts regarding skin: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=xylitol+skin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=xylitol+skin)\n   * Studies/abstracts regarding teeth: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=xylitol+teeth](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=xylitol+teeth)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Buy a pair of exfoliating gloves**. The xylitol is good, but nothing works better for my keratosis pilaris than a pair of exfoliating gloves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Drink water with limes/lemons throughout the day**. Increasing your water intake is important, but combining it with limes/lemons is an incredible healing tonic, not only internally but externally as well. I use a filtered water bottle (travel size). Just buy some organic limes or lemons, cut them into quarters with the rind on and drop into the bottle. Add some liquid stevia for some sweetness. Re-fill the bottle with water throughout the day as needed and only replace the limes/lemons after a full day. If you want, you can also add fresh ginger as a powerful anti-inflammatory gut healing tonic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Increase sleep quality and control stress with magnesium salt baths and cannabidiol (CBD oil).** I would consider this optional, but if you have issues with insomnia or the actual quality of your sleep, trying to get that under control will increase your body’s ability to heal, which is of course important when we are dealing with scarring and pigmentation. Magnesium salt baths (epsom, dead sea salt, etc.) are great for relaxation. Cannabidiol in oil form is also amazing for winding down and is non-psychoactive (unlike THC).\n   * Studies/abstracts regarding magnesium and sleep: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=magnesium+sleep](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=magnesium+sleep)\n   * Studies/abstracts regarding cannabidiol and sleep: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=cannabidiol+sleep](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=cannabidiol+sleep)",

Main side effect was massive bloating, but if I pushed it too far and didn’t take pre/post meal enzymes it would get worse.\n\nI had been taking Bacillus Coagulans for three months and didn’t see any improvements. I stopped for about a week and then I decided to try the Blueprint supplement stack (only the vitamins, not the other meal stuff) and have been able to eat all of these foods without any side effects for three weeks now.\n\nI honestly still can’t believe it, but I have been testing this more aggressively lately (had honey salad dressing yesterday) and still no massive bloating post consumption.

Your thyroid controls the metabolism of your entire body, so proper vitamin D levels will ensure that your thyroid's hormones are actually penetrating cells and being effective.\n\nhttp://thyroid.about.com/b/2010/09/30/vitamin-d-important-thyroid.htm\n\nhttp://www.livestrong.com/article/486899-what-does-iodine-help-to-control/\n\nVitamin D also has a pretty direct role in phosphorous metabolism I believe, but I don't have any sources for that, this is just going from memory. Mostly because calcium and phosphorous work together, much like sodium and potassium ions (Na+ and K+, respectively) work together to form ion channels.\n\nFWIW, I take 3,000 - 4,000IUs daily in the winter months, but I suffer pretty badly from SAD. Once spring hits I do not take any, since I'm outdoors so much.\n\n5) The body can create upwards of 40,000IUs of vitamin D naturally from sunlight in a few hours. There is a chemical in your skin that is a derivative of cholesterol that is sensitive to ultraviolet light. Hence, when the sun hits it, it drives a reaction which creates the bioactive form of vitamin D. If you are fair skinned, this is a more potent reaction than if you are darker skinned. On average, if you sit outside in full sun for a couple hours, you're looking at 20,000 - 30,000IUs of vitamin D. So.. if you're worried about trouble from popping a couple thousand IUs in pill form, don't. The other thing to keep in mind is that, since vitamin D is fat soluble, even if you eat 4,000IUs of it, the body will probably only absorb around 30-40% of that in an absolutely ideal scenario.",

Similarly, Vitamin D3 supplements contain Cholecalciferol - which, after oral consumption, is also delivered to the blood circulation - so the supplements should be biologically equivalent to sun exposure with regards to Vitamin D3.\n\nIf the chemical introduced to the bloodstream is the same in both cases (sun exposure vs. a pill), why are the reactions different? Is it possible Vitamin D3 from a pill has different effects because it has different absorption routes/mechanisms, as compared to endogenous synthesis in the skin?",

It also found that magnesium lowered D3 when it was too high, compared to supplemental D3 which always raised serum D3.\n\nSo magnesium may be more important to regulate D3 in its active/inactive forms than taking supplemental D3. Maybe taking both together is better than just the supplemental D3.",

Take D3 for a few weeks or months, have a blood test done, then adjust dosage accordingly.\nhttps://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-d-whats-right-level-2016121910893    \n    \nHowever, even a lower value of 25-35ng/ml can result in improved QoL for COPD patients https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29881436     \nFurther reading:    \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=copd+d3    \nhttps://thorax.bmj.com/content/74/4/337    \nhttps://copdnewstoday.com/2018/02/06/vitamin-d-levels-associated-with-respiratory-function-may-be-linked-copd/?amp\nD3 is one of several supplements affecting calcium metabolization. So the others, \nvitamin K2, vitamin A, magnesium and calcium itself, should also be supplemented.     \nIn COPD, medication with glucocorticoids (prednison and so on) is common - these typically reduce conversion of D3, natural or supplemental, to its active metabolites (calcitriol). Increased osteoporosis risk is a common side effect. So in these cases proper D3 intake is especially recommended.    \nhttps://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/486078    \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3840173    \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28915968    \n    \nDosage:     \nVitamin D3 up to 4000 IU, or rather: according to blood test. 5000 IU is fine too, the 4k value includes a safety margin and the other supps listed here protect against possible side effects in higher doses, especially K2.    \nVitamin K2 Mk7 (Menaquinon) ~ 100 mcg - often paired with D3.     You can mix Mk7 and Mk4 (3x 15 mg) if you want, just Mk7 is most likely sufficient for our direct purpose.    \nMagnesium 200-400 mg    \nVitamin A (Retinyl palmitate oder -acetate) 5000-10000 IU    \nCalcium 2x 400 mg - take with magnesium; lower the dose if you consume lots of dairy     \nhttps://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h8    \nhttps://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#h8    \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18785521    \nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20180719124501/http://blog.cholesterol-and-health.com/2009/04/    \nD3/K2/A are lipophilic = fat soluble, if you take the dry form (pills, powder; they're cheaper than softgels), always chew them with some oil (olive oil is good) or a piece of high fat cheese. Else they'll barely get absorbed by your body.    \n    \nCoenzyme Q10:    \nCoQ10 is one of several supplements improving mitochondrial health, if you know anything about mitochondria you can probably guess that it improves general energy levels and prevents exhaustion during exercise, to a degree. The ubiquinol form is supposed to be more bioavailable, it's also more expensive.    \nDosage: 90-200mg    \nhttps://examine.com/supplements/coenzyme-q10/    \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8241703    \n    \nQuercetin:    \nA polyphenol, very promising in terms of limiting or stopping emphysema progression (!). Anti-inflammatory, more importantly inhibits the damaging enzyme elastase. Not terribly expensive either.    \nDosage: 250mg x2    \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2954923/    \n    \nResveratrol:    \nThat stuff from red wine, made quite a fuss some years ago. Not as effective as everyone expected back then, and optimal dosage is still somewhat nebulous, but it does seem to work synergistically with quercetin. Might be worth a try for some.    \nDosage: 25-50 mg (or higher. it's complicated)     \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5811233/    \n    \n    \nMethylene blue:    \nYeah I know, it's a dye. But it's also used against malaria, alzheimers and dementia, as well as a nootropic for its memory effects, so oral use for humans is not exactly unheard of.    \nMB affects mitochondria, like coenzyme Q10, except it's more potent, more bioavailable and a lot cheaper - provided you can find it in the necessary purity grade. That is, pharmaceutical quality or better, since normal, technical or general lab use MB contains  many impurities, i.e. heavy metals. Some people take Kordon brand methylene blue, a fish tank cleaner. I'm not sure I should recommend that, but if you can't find any other source...    \n    \nDon't mix MB and Q10. It's an alternative, if you can't afford Q10 or if it doesn't work for you.    \n    \nHowever, MB is also a MAO inhibitor in doses ranging from 2-100mg (effect starts weakly at 2mg, full effect reached at 100mg). That means you can't pair it SSRIs or you'll risk very serious side effects (serotonin symptome). If you're interested in MB, check all your medication, especially antidepressants for SSRI effects first. Theoretically the effect should be limited to non-existant below 2 mg, but better safe than sorry.     \nA rise in blood pressure from cheese or red wine is also a possible risk of MAO inhibitors in general, but again, not likely with lower dosage here.     \nDosage: 1 to 5 mg, divided into 2 or 3 smaller doses. MB has a short half life.     \n2.5mg works well for me, though I don't have COPD. Improves energy, focus and memory function. Also helps against acid reflux, somehow.    \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25304127    \nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0046585    \n\nedit: lowered recommended calcium dose due to some recent studies.",

For the hormone side of things I take a combination of CistaMAX, Tribugen, Horny Goat Weed (50% icariin), Tongkat Ali (10% eurycomanone), and Beta-ecdysterone. If I had to make any suggestions it would be to consider beta-ecdysterone. As an activator of estrogen receptor beta, it can promote bone and joint health.\n\nWhen you take steps to promote testosterone levels, it can sometimes come at the cost of the low estrogen levels our bodies do need to maintain. Specifically, echinacosides in Cistanche increase the release of FSH and increase the expression of enzymes in the pathway that converts cholesterol into progestogens and then converts those into androgens. Protodioscin in Tribugen promotes testosterone's metabolism into DHT. Eurycomanone in Tongkat Ali prevents testosterone's conversion into estradiol. Taken together, this can lead to an androgen-heavy hormone load, which is what you're aiming for, but not at the cost of estrogen receptor activity. The estrogens help to reduce blood pressure, and promote joint and bone health. Icariin, in addition to increasing the release of luteinizing hormone, activates estrogen receptor alpha. Beta-ecdysterone activates estrogen receptor beta. Together they can help to offset the lower estrogen levels of the other compounds.",

        "body": "Also boron 18 mg a day is critical to make your bones as almost strong as steel. Boron also if the experience in Israel and parts of France is correct reduces osteoarthritis to near zero if not zero. Also the above but not supplemental calcium(typically sufficient in one’s diet) in those who do not have osteoporosis/osteopenia to prevent them from developing. Typically the first indication that one needs to take calcium when taking higher doses of vitamin D3 is cramping in one’s fingers and toes. Which can be seen in those with osteoporosis/osteopenia. If this happens it is a good idea to check vitamin related labs  and take supplemental calcium until the cramping resolves and one’s calcium labs return to normal.\n\nConcerning vitamin K2. The type as I see it is vitamin K2 the MK4 at 45 mg(not mcg)a day . Amount you need to take and only take if you have severe vitamin K2 responsive diseases. Vitamin K2 responsive diseases are osteoporosis, atherosclerosis or gum/dental diseases. As at optimal BPLs of vitamin D3 your gut micro biome should provide all the vitamin K2 the MK4 type your body needs. Now vitamin K2 is safe so no reason I am aware of not to take if you want to. As many who have never treated a patient or only with vitamin K2 write how vitamin K2 is necessary to supplement. It definitely is necessary not just not so if taking physiological doses to reach physiological BPLs of vitamin D3.\n\nAlso important to watch your diet and avoid high fructose corn syrup, seed oils and processed foods. My friend developed The LGS Protocol and that is the title of his book. For those who optimal doses of vitamin D3, magnesium and the dietary changes do not help.\n\nIf you do maximal doses of vitamin D3 you need to restrict calcium consumption, drink at least 2.5 liters of water and check your labs more frequently as well as your 24 hour urine calcium levels. Your urine calcium levels should be below 250 mg/l. If you are considering Dr. Coimbras protocol(maximal vitamin D3 dosing) best to work with a medical doctor trained by him or well versed in his approach. Or Dr. Eduardo Patrick or trained by him.\n\nConcerning testing your vitamin D3 labs best to do so initially before supplementing vitamin D3 and vitamin B12. As both of which are frequently both deficient especially in people who are not taking vitamins and whose diet has issues. Testing the following initially before starting then after starting at 6-8 weeks, then every 6-12 months. Or if after any major illnesses. Checking the following-ionized and total calcium, vitamin D panel and parathyroid hormone. Also test the following before supplementing vitamin B12 supplements and especially if vegetarian test for vitamin B12, homocysteine and methyl malonic acid. Then after 6-8 weeks. If your vitamin B12 BPLs are in the 600-800 pg/ml. If your homocysteine and/or methyl malonic acid BPLs are elevated you need to look into this(I can only go down so many rabbit holes). If not then check your vitamin B12 related tests and yearly or sooner if you have major diet changes. As often people who are magnesium and vitamin D3 deficient are also vitamin B12 deficient.\n\nSometimes upon starting higher doses of vitamin D3/magnesium they feel worse. This could be due to a Herxheimer reaction. Other possible reasons are a gut micro biome being out of balance, discomfort from the repair process of potentially decades of damage caused by vitamin D3/magnesium and potentially vitamin B12. Also a diet high in processed foods, high fructose corn syrup and seed oils as well as eating inflammatory foods, abusing alcohol/drugs and high stress. The list could continue but I think it get the point.\n\nConcerning depression I was for close to two decades of not the largest one of top three largest prescribers of antidepressants in the five state region(Texas and surrounding states). Then the combination of 30,000 IU of vitamin D3(a blood plasma level (BPL) of 100-140 ng/ml), as much magnesium as they could tolerate and four grams of omega 3(krill) oil I wrote maybe two prescriptions over next six next six years. The vitamin D3 is best in capsules with the vitamin D3 suspended in olive oil, coconut oil or avocado oil. Again no seed oils.\n\nOne last point about 7% of general population and 30-40% of Hispanics have a MTHFR Gene mutation. Thus resulting in these individuals having twice the vitamin D3 BPL of those who do not. Thus only requiring only requiring half the vitamin D3 dose as those who do not have this genetic mutation to reach a given vitamin D3 BPL. That said my practice was 98% Hispanics and I never had a single patient with this? Strange.\n\nI am not giving medical advice just my personal opinion. Also remember you know your body best. Many doctors will try to scare you away from higher vitamin D3 doses and BPLs! As long as calcium labs are ok and your 24 hour urine calcium levels are below 250 ng/ml in my personal opinion they do not know what they are talking about if they are trying to scare you away from higher doses/BPLs of vitamin D3. Also so much more and up to you to educate yourself! If you want to regain or maintain your health you will dedicate the time it requires. On my website www.vitamindblog.com I explain my research and theories. These books are important to read-The Social Transformation of America Medicine, The Clot Thickens and How Not to Die on True-High Doses Vitamin D3 Therapy, and The Optimal Dose: Restore Your Health With The Power of Vitamin D3. As time goes on I am sure I will update this. Should give you a decent foundation?\n\n1.for all four BPLs of vitamin D3 the person requires as much magnesium as one can tolerate. With half in the am and half in the pm. Too much resulting in diarrhea.\n\n2. The physiological effects aré those that adequate vitamin D3/magnesium result in. Those are balanced immune system, improved metabolism, healthy gut micro biome and deep restorative sleep to mane the major ones.\n\n3. of course our understanding is constantly changing and something new I was unaware of when I wrote this on 07/21/2024 may become known I was not aware of when I wrote this.",

        "body": "Part 1/2\n\n\nThis is a vitamin D 3 cheat sheet I have developed. First as Edward Hutchinson wrote vitamin D3 vitamin D3 deficiency can cause diabetes and peripheral neuropathy. So much to learn and after taking 30,000 IU of vitamin D3 and magnesium for 14+ years I have seen how much it has done to improve my health. However even limits. The more you educate yourself on it the better you can help yourself! I hope this helps? This cheat sheet is a work in progress: \n\nI am writing out essentially part or all of what follows for almost every question concerning vitamin D3 and magnesium. So I put together the following cheat sheet. I am not giving medical advice just my personal opinions. Ideally you work with a medical professional who really understands vitamin D3.\n\nOk there are five levels of vitamin D3 effects as I see it.\n\n1. First Inadequate vitamin D3 which is typically blood plasma(BPL) that are  less than approximately 50 ng/ml and daily doses of 10,000 IU a day of vitamin D3 a day.  BPLs that are less than 50 ng/ml and daily doses of 50 ng/ml. *\n\n2: low physiological BPLs -which are vitamin D3 BPLs of 50-100 ng/ml requiring a daily dose of 10-25,000 IU a day. 1,2\n\n3. Optimal BPLs-requiring a BPL of 100-140 ng/ml requiring 30,000 IU a day of vitamin D3. 1,2\n\n4. maximal vitamin D3 dosing-which is based on a a parathyroid hormone level in the very low normal range. Parathyroid hormone(PtH) BPLs are the best though indirect indication of maximum vitamin D3 function. The BPL that Dr. Coimbra uses to treat autoimmune diseases.1,2\n\n5. Potentially toxic BPLs-perhaps almost impossible to develop. Requiring vitamin D3 BPLs of approaching 400 ng/ml. Even then this occurs at those BPLs in less than one percent of people. Frankly extremely rare one might go this high or above 200 ng/ml.except in those who are extremely ill. If so you should be under the care of a medical doctor well versed in vitamin D3.\n\nIf pregnant and or going to be best to speak with a Dr. Coimbra trained doctor or one who follows the LGS Protocol by Dr. Eduardo Patrick MD if going to take higher doses. As one concern is adequate vitamin A but prenatal vitamins\n\nThe first three levels are based on vitamin D3 BPLs and the last one on (PTH) BPLs. Often optimal BPLs also have a PtH BPL in the very low normal range consistent with the PtH levels found in maximal vitamin D3 dosing. Of note as long as vitamin D3 BPLs are less than 200 ng/ml you do not need to check 24 hour urine calcium levels.\n\nThe maximal dosing may and typically is required in those with vitamin D receptor gene mutation(s). As they more likely to develop autoimmune diseases,  diseases like Chron’s disease and multiple sclerosis. These individuals may require daily doses of up to 1,000 IU/kg/day of vitamin D3. This would be in what is considered a “standard adult male” who weighs 172 lbs or 78.2 kg a daily vitamin D3 dose of up to 78,000 IU a day. In medical school they taught us that this is the medical definition of the average weight of an average adult male. In those with BPLs of vitamin D3 above 200 ng/ml it is wise to check a 24 hour urine calcium after being at this BPL after 6-8 weeks and say every three months\n\nA colleague mixes his daily dose in a liter of water. Sipping it over the course of the day. That way resulting in a more gentle ingestion of magnesium over the course of the day.\n\nMost people are magnesium deficient or borderline deficiente. So typically people start out magnesium deficient. That is body stores of magnesium. The typical magnesium  “blood”  one that is checked in your typical blood work is not accurate. As the serum, the fluid from which this is done and surrounding your cells,,only has less than one percent of one’s total body’s magnesium. The majority is in one’s cells and bones.\n\nI once had a patient who was so anxious he was going to ER two to three times a week. I tried every prescription medication to treat it. Nothing helped. I then out of desperation put him on magnesium as I described above. He never had another anxiety attack. As endorphins and enkephalins are to pain what magnesium is to anxiety! It is the body’s anxiolytic!\n\nThe reason when vitamin D3 deficient as a adult requires so much magnesium. As besides being most people have low magnesium levels or magnesium deficient is taking supplemental vitamin D3 requires lots of magnesium for absorption, conversion to different forms and its enzymatic reactions.  Also when taking at least low physiological doses to reach at least low physiological BPLs or greater BPLs or maximal vitamin D3 dosing requires magnesium. If one suffers osteoporosis they may also require lots of calcium, but probably also phosphorus and protein to rebuild one’s bones.",

To summarize briefly: It wasn't for me. \n\nMy first day of trying it, I tried a single pill, not both pills for the full dose. It felt \"okay\", maybe slightly \"off\" as my body got used to the change. Then I upped it to the full dose the next day. I felt slightly nauseous that day. I decided to go for several days of just taking 1 pill instead, so as to let my body adjust. \n\nIt felt okay, but I didn't feel as good as when I take my D3 Cholecalciferol pills. I eventually decided I did want to move into the \"full\" dose of 2 pills. This is where it took a turn. The slight nausea returned, and it only got worse each day. The final day, I just kinda felt sick to my stomach. \n\nAt the end of the day, I decided that at no point in taking D.Velop did I feel better than when I take regular D3 pills, so I'm just going to stick with those. \n\nAlso, a word of warning: D.Velop is also known as Calcifediol, a 20mcg form of Vitamin D that is supposedly easier for your body to use than regular D. However, Calcifediol is also sold under a prescription medicine form called Rayaldee, which is still just Calcifediol (at least that's my understanding) in a 30mcg form, but that medicine does have possible side effects. So to anyone taking D.Velop, it might be wise to look at the sides list just in case you notice anything while taking D.Velop. ",

Natural is always best!!   \n\nSupplements are poorly absorbed (if any) into the body reducing their effectiveness. \nWhats healthier, eating an orange or taking a vitamin C supplement? (the orange obviously)\nYour body absorbs natural nutrients much better than supplements. \nA deficiency may not show itself for a number of years.\n\nThere are endless health risks associated with nutrient deficiency from veganism \n(symptoms include low energy, eventually causing permanent nerve damage,\n depression, numbness, hair loss,nervousness, paranoia, \nhyperactive reflexes, impaired memory and behavioral changes,Heart disease,cancer etc etc \nwhich can develop slowly over the years) \n\nanother argument often used by vegans is that your body produces some of the vital nutrients on its own... \nFACT: these are NOT produced at the RIGHT AMOUNTS and eventually need replenishing. \n\nif youre not eating animal foods you need to make sure you're at least taking the right supplements.\nSupplements are not great. You may still slowly become ill over the years\nbut what little nutrients are absorbed from supplements are better than fuck all and a slow death: \n\nvitamin B12, creatine, carnosine, \ntaurine, vitamin D3, heme-iron, the omega-3 fat DHA, and sulfur. \n\nB12: \n\nMost B12 multi-vitamins sold today are a complete waste of money when it comes to\ntheir B12 quality and absorption potential. Only a small amount, if any is properly absorbed.\nThe only reliable way of getting the right amount of this vitamin is via animal foods,\na high-quality under the tounge spray mist supplement or injection ( bangermashanatortron get some tounge spray!) \n\nPart of the reason vitamin B12 is so difficult to absorb is it requires an additional \nprotein called \"intrinsic factor\" that binds to vitamin B12 and allows your body to absorb it into your bloodstream.\nEven natural B12 is difficult to absorb nevermind poor supplements! \nThere are 2 types of B12. cyanocobalamin and methylcobalamin\nThe most active form of vitamin B12, and the form found in meat/fish/egg/dairy,is hydroxocobalamin. \nHowever, you will never find hydroxocobalamin in a nutrition supplement made by an honest company.\nThe reason is that hydroxocobalamin is completely unstable when put in a tablet or capsule, \nand can only be taken by injection. \nHydroxocobalamin is only effective if it is given by injection. (or spray)\n\nAdditional supplementation for vegans with sea vegetables or probiotic formulas is not\nSufficient for protection against B-12 deficiency as it is not properly absorbed.\nIt was thought that spirulina and sea vegetables had enough active B-12 to avoid a B-12 deficiency but\nthe problem is they also have a significant amount of \"ANALOG B-12\" that competes with the human active B-12 \nand actually reduced the B-12 status and can worsen a B-12 deficiency. (The few plant foods that are sources of \nB12 are actually B12 analogs. An analog is a substance that blocks the uptake \nof true B12, so your body's need for the nutrient actually increases. \nVitamin B12 is found almost exclusively in animal tissues.\n\nThe other argument often used by vegans is that your body produces vitamin B12 from bacteria in the large intestine,\nso additional sources are not necessary.\nWhile it's true that your body does produce B12 in this way, \nyour body will not be able to absorb it.we do produce B-12 from bacteria in our large intestine, \nbut since this B-12 is produced in the area below where B-12 is reabsorbed, it is really not available for absorption.\n\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency is extremely common in strict vegetarians and vegans,\nbut many are unaware there's a problem until it's too late. Even though vitamin B12 is \nwater-soluble, it doesn't exit your body quickly in your urine like other water-soluble vitamins.\nInstead, B12 is stored in your liver, kidneys and other body tissues, and as a result, \na deficiency may not show itself for a number of years.\nThis is a serious concern, because after about seven years of B12 deficiency, \nirreversible brain damage and other problems can result. \n\nIf your diet doesn't include animal products and you're breastfeeding, \nyour baby could also develop brain abnormalities due to a vitamin B12 deficiency.\nEarlier this year you may have seen the tragic story of 11-month-old Louise Le Moaligou,\nwho died from complications associated with vitamin deficiencies, including B12,\ncaused by her mom's vegan diet. \nStudys show early signs of vitamin B12 deficiency in 26 of the 54 people tested, after\nfollowing a vegan diet for as little as two to four years.\n\n\n\nSulfur\n\nSulfur is derived almost exclusively from dietary protein, such as fish and high-quality \n(organic and/or grass-fed and pastured) beef and poultry. \nMeat and fish are considered \"complete\" as they contain all the sulfur-containing \namino acids you need to produce new protein. \nWhen you abstain from animal protein you significantly increase your risk of sulfur \ndeficiency and related health problems.If you're a vegan who relies on grain-heavy processed foods \nin lieu of animal protein, you're likely not getting the sulfur you need because sulfur is lost during the processing.\n\nSulfur plays a vital role in the structure and biological activity of both proteins and enzymes. \nIf you don't have sufficient amounts of sulfur in your body, this deficiency can cascade into a \nnumber of health problems, as it can affect bones, joints, connective tissues, metabolic processes, and more.\nThe low intake of sulfur by vegans explains the origin of hyperhomocysteinemia\n (high blood levels of homocysteine, which may lead to blood clots in your arteries -- i.e. heart attack and stroke)\n and the increased vulnerability of vegans to cardiovascular diseases.\n If you don't eat meat you can get small amounts of sulfur from coconut oil and olive oil.\nOther plant-based sources that contain small amounts of sulfur — \nprovided the food was grown in soil that contains adequate amounts of sulfur — \ninclude wheat germ, legumes, garlic, onions, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, and kale. \n\n\nCreatine:\nCreatine is a bioactive compound that is lacking in vegan diets. \nIt plays an IMPORTANT role in brain and muscle function.\nMost of it is stored in muscles, but significant amounts are also concentrated in the brain.\nStudies have shown that creatine supplementation increase both muscle mass and strength. \nCreatine can be produced by the liver. However, vegans have \nlower amounts of creatine in their muscles.\nPlacing people on a vegan diet for 26 days causes a significant decrease in muscle creatine. \nvegans who consume creatine experience \nsignificant improvements in brain function while regular meat\neaters see no difference.\n\n\n\nCarnosine\nCarnosine is an antioxidant that is concentrated in the muscles and brain\nIt is very important for muscle function, and high levels of carnosine in muscles are linked with \nreduced muscle fatigue and improved performance.\nCarnosine is only found in animal foods. it is formed in the body in very small amounts\nfrom amino acids.\nVegans have less carnosine in their muscles than meat eaters.\ncan be supplemented but naturally sourced is better and absorbed more readily.\n\nVitamin D3\n\nCholecalciferol is a type of vitamin D found in animal foods, especially fatty fish. It is\nmuch more effective than the plant form of vitamin D, ergocalciferol.\nVitamin D is an essential nutrient that has many important functions.\nOsteoporosis (weak bones) and rickets (bone malformation) are the best known effects of vitamin D deficiency.\n\nAlso called the sunshine vitamin, \n\nIt can be produced by our own skin when it is exposed to sunlight. \nHowever, when sunlight exposure is limited, we have to get it from food,or badly absorbed suppliments.\n\nThere are two types of vitamin D in the diet, ergocalciferol (D2) found in plants, and cholecalciferol\n(D3) found in animal foods.\n\nOf the two types of vitamin D, cholecalciferol (from animals) is much more potent than ergocalciferol. \nIn other words, it increases blood levels of bioactive vitamin D much more efficiently.\n\nThe best sources of cholecalciferol are fatty fish and egg yolks, cod liver oil.\n\nDocosahexaenoic Acid (DHA)\n\nDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an essential omega-3 fatty acid found in fatty fish and fish oil. It is \nalso found in small amounts in microalgae.\nvegans are lower in DHA than meat eaters.\nIn the body, DHA can also be made in small amounts from the omega-3 fatty acid ALA, \nwhich is found in flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts BUT the conversion of ALA to DHA is inefficient.\n\nHeme-iron\n\nHeme-iron is a type of iron only found in meat, especially red meat. \nIt is much better absorbed than non-heme iron found in plant foods \n\nNot only is heme-iron well absorbed, \nit also improves the absorption of non-heme iron from plant foods. \nThis phenomenon is not entirely understood and is called the “meat factor.”\n\nUnlike non-heme iron, heme-iron is not affected by antinutrients, such as phytic acid, \noften found in plant foods.\n\nFor this reason, vegetarians and vegans are more prone to anemia than meat eaters,\n especially women and people on macrobiotic diets.\n\nTaurine\n\nplays an important role in muscle function, bile salt formation, and the body’s antioxidant defenses.\n\nTaurine has various benefits for heart health such as lowering cholesterol and blood pressure.\n\nTaurine is only found in animal foods such as fish, seafood, meat, poultry and dairy products.\n\nSmall amounts are produced by the body. However,consuming extra taurine plays a \nmajor role in the maintenance of the body.\n\nLevels of taurine are significantly lower in vegans than in meat eaters.\n\n\nsome animal products when obtained from humane sources such\nas organic farms where the animals are free to roam and eat their natural diet, do not need to be avoided for \nanimal-rights or other moral reasons, as the animals are not harmed by providing milk and eggs. \nMeanwhile, they provide many important nutrients also found in meat thus eliminating the need for more poorly absorbed suppliments****\n\nLovingly cobbled together by Ursula and Sebastian \n\nps.\n\nplease dont die of a deficiency in 4 years!\n\n\n\npps.\n\nim gonna buy a chicken and love it and send you eggs and pictures of the chicken having a great life .\n",

I sometimes also get agitated/jittery. These reactions from Vitamin D3 is independent of Magnesium / Vitamin K2 status, since supplementation of neither alleviates it.\n\nHowever, even prolonged sunbathing, for over 30 minutes, does not cause me any insomnia, agitation, or jitteriness. I feel no difference at all in my mental/neurological state.\n\nThis confuses me. To my understanding, exposure to UV-B rays from the sun creates Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) in the skin, which is then delivered to the blood circulation. Similarly, Vitamin D3 supplements contain Cholecalciferol - which, after oral consumption, is also delivered to the blood circulation - so the supplements should be biologically equivalent to sun exposure with regards to Vitamin D3.\n\nIf the chemical introduced to the bloodstream is the same in both cases (sun exposure vs. a pill), why are the reactions different? Is it possible Vitamin D3 from a pill has different effects because it has different absorption routes/mechanisms, as compared to endogenous synthesis in the skin?",

Just about 2 years ago, I decided that I was going to do something about it, I've done extensive research, and have tried diet and exercise, eventhough those have helped, it wasn't enough.  I've come upon vitamins and I have tried many and will go ahead list them.  What I've noticed about a couple of months ago is that my brain zaps have been almost completely wiped out.  Before it was probably about 65-70% gone but now it's more like 90-95% gone, my ultimate goal is to wipe them out completely in the next 2 years or so.  Not only brainzaps but also improve my cognitive thinking, memory, focus, sex drive etc, basically everything before antidepressants.\n\n**How do I know these vitamins are working for me?**\n\nOne sure fire way for me was, when I turn my head left/right, I use to get zaps all the time but now when I turn my head left/right, it's nearly completely gone.  It's like night and day.  I couldn't believe it, it's almost like these vitamins filled a hole in my brain or patched it up, fixed the damage that antidepressants caused.\n\n**Vitamin List:**\n\n**Spirulina 500 mg, for a few months**\n\n**Vitamin B-100 Complex, taking ongoing**\n\n**Triple Strength Omega-3 Fish Oil 1360 mg, almost a year, now taking different brand/lower dosage**\n\n**Huperzine A 100 mcg, a few months**\n\n**Acetyl L-Carnitine HCl -- 500 mg, on going**\n\n**Magnesium L-Threonate -- 2010 mg per serving, a few months, mulitple times**\n\n**Vitamin D3 (as Cholecalciferol) -- 50 mcg (2000 IU), on going**\n\n**GABA Gamma - Aminobutyric Acid -- 500 mg, a few months, a couple of times**\n\n**Avena Sativa  400 mg, on going**\n\n**Allergy Relief 25mg  (Benadryl), situational**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Help with Sex Drive:**\n\n**Maca 500 mg, took for several months**\n\n**Yohimbe Extract 1000 mg, on going**\n\n**Horny Goat Weed with Maca, 750mg, on going**\n\nThere are more that I didn't add to the list but these the main ones that I felt directly worked for my brian zaps.  Some of those I would take for several months than moved on to the next vitamin.  As you know antidepressants also destroyed my sex drive, so now I'm doing everything in my power to bring that back.  Most of it came back after stopping antidepressants but it still felt like I was missing something so I'm hoping that these vitamins will help with that and so far, it seems like it's working, only time will tell.\n\nI'm planning on taking more vitamins and it will be an ongoing thing.  If I felt any vitamins weren't working than I would stop taking immediately and possibly throw them away.\n\nI feel there's hope for me, I might be able to come back from the horrors that these antidepressants and psychiatry has done to me.\n\n**\\*To the mods, this is not medical advice but I'm just sharing my experiences and what worked for me.**",

No side effects or whatsoever, but also no effect at all. Nothing, nada… no tingling, no numbness nothing. \n\nI bought another Cat’s claw alcohol based solution, same story.\n\nThis whole experiment costed about 70 bucks, should have bought AH instead I guess…\n\nBefore you guys asking me about why I didn’t try PYT… good question... I am planing on ordering one right now. \n\nI wanted to share my small experiment with you guys and wanted to ask if I can expect the same effect from PYT as I did from AH?\n\nI love this community, stay strong brothers ",

    "body": "I want to share my limited experience with Calcifediol (hoping to attract to this discussion other folks who take this supplement and maybe get some insights).\n\nI am frustrated by regular D3 products as even if I take 3000 -4000IU I barely move from 22 ng/ml (my level without supplementation) to 31-32 ng/dl. I don't want to take more D3 for reasons I won't get into right now (not sure if my body handles well dosages above 2000 IU)\n\nbut I would like to have and maintain a prudent  level of 45-55 ng/ml for immunity and just to see how i feel as I was mildly deficient all my life probably until 3 years ago when I first checked it.\n\nWhen I say \"prudent\" I mean I want to avoid at all costs the risks of hypercalcemia and other potential problems.\n\nSo I took a month ago Calcifediol (from a brand called D.Velop). The serving size is two pills 20 mcg which they list as 2400 IU. NOte that 25 mcg of  regular D3 (cholecalciferol) is listed as 1000 IU so they take into account the fact that calcifediol is absorbed faster and more efficiently. But the problem is there is no clear cut research on the equivalent dosage between cholecalciferol and calcifediol.\n\nAnyway, I started slowly and for about two weeks I took only one pill every other day. That is 10 mcg every two days (or 5 mcg a day average). After two weeks I measured my level with a take home test from CVS and the level was 47 ng/dl which is pretty good but I was surprised it increased that quickly with such a low dose. I decided to stop for a while, took again regular D3 and after a month I retested and it was back to 31 ng/ml which is barely in the normal range\n\nSo calcifediol  increases levels rather quickly but also wears off faster. This makes me think that this supplement is actually tricky and potentially dangerous long term if you take their suggested dosage of two pills a day (they do recommend testing often in the beginning).\n\nIn any case, I still want to give it a chance and see if I find a way to maintain 45-55 level. I don't want to go over 60 for now. So  I now take half a pill every other day (basically 2.5 mcg a day) which I think should be safe and re-test in a month or so. To summarize, this supplement is very attractive to me as it increases the level quickly but it seems tricky to figure out the long term ongoing dosage to maintain a stable level.\n\nI am actually surprised this is legal to sell as a supplement (D.Velop and there is another brand in UK, I forgot the name) as it seems very easy to go over the upper recommended limit\n\nI wish I could talk to a doctor about this but most of the doctors I come in contact with are just agnostic on supplements to say the least. Last doctor gave me a prescription of 50,000 IU of D2 weekly which did very little only to find, later on my own, that D2 is far less efficient than D3.\n\n",

One pill (10 mcg) every 4 days for a month compared to one pill every 3 days for a while and the D level was practically unchanged at around 36 ng/ml. So a pill every other day or one a day might be sufficient to bring me to the level I want\n\nHowever, I am still a little reluctant to commit to calcifediol. Because  the D level did not change even after a small increase in dosage, it seems to me that it is harder to maintain a steady level due to shorter half-life. I don't know if it is wise to have fluctuating D levels and I am not gonna test myself monthly . \n\nI think I will try again D3 with a 4000-5000 IU dosage in combination with K2. I already take magnesium and I will try to have some regular sun exposure. I'll still hold onto the calcifediol bottle and probably use it if I need a quick boost under certain situations (such as covid). Hopefully I can find a doctor later who can advise me on this. \n\nI just feel uneasy with what is basically a prescription medication as a supplement",

I was taking cholecalciferol and I'm wondering if I don't utilize it properly?  \n\nI was reading about a gene mutation on the VDR gene that can cause problems with vitamin d conversion. I can't get my doctor's to test for this though. They just want me to bump my dose up by 600 iu's. It's been frustrating to say the least.  \n\nI know you don't want to keep adding more supplements but if you're truly worried about high calcium in blood, vitamin k2 should be added to your supplements or diet. I think the standard I've seen recommend is 90-100 micrograms for every 10k iu's of vitamin d. Maybe supplements come as a vitamin d plus vitamin k for this reason. \nIncreasing your leafy greens consumption will provide vitamin k as well as the magnesium you mentioned earlier.\n\nI was prescribed the 50k IU orthomolecular product you're taking about. Fwiw, I don't think you need an Rx, at least not in the US. But it made me very very sick! I *think* but can't confirm, it was high calcium in blood. I had all the symptoms!! This was before I knew you were supposed to take it with a fat and vitamin k. Vitamin d is a fat soluble \"vitamin\" do it needs to be taken with fat. \n\nBut all that said.... I'm curious how it's working out.",

After surgery my calcium levels dropped to 9 and then slowly trickled down to 8.4 by the time I was discharged. I was prescribed OSCAL. I was told to take about 1000mg three times a day and an extra 1000 if I feel tingles in fingertips, toes or mouth. I couldn’t find OSCAL in three stores so I settled on naturmade brand calcium. It is 600mgs of calcium carbonate and D3 (cholecalciferol) 400IU per pill. It seemed equivalent to the OSCAL. I also have tums I can take. \n\nI haven’t felt any pins and needles in hands or feet or mouth. But sometimes I feel like a tingling feeling in feet which is not new since I have thyroid issues. And sometimes I feel like tingling around my body. That’s new. I also have has some light anxiety where I feel almost a little shaky. It comes and goes. I’m not actually shaking but I get a feeling like I could. Is that low calcium?  \n\nAlso how long does it take for calcium pills to kick in when I do feel something? Does it stop within minutes….an hour?  Do I need to be worried about taking too much calcium?  The doctor said that would be almost impossible for me. But all I heard was almost lol. Did you all find yourself taking a lot of extra calcium?  And how soon after your discharge were you tested again by your doctor? I wish so badly there was an otc calcium test I could take at home. I’m a numbers person I hate trying to figure this all out based on how I feel. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated. 😊",

(Tums)That tapered down to 2 daily and then 1 daily, each dosage for a week. \n\nYou are only 3 days post-op and my surgery was 5+ weeks ago. In those first few weeks, those feelings will come and go but I rarely had to take an extra calcium pill. At about the 2-week mark, I had what I could only describe as bone pain, especially in my arms and legs. When I described it to someone, they said it reminded them of their teenager having growing pains. I think the body just is going through adjustment after surgery, after having an adenoma on the parathyroid for who knows how long and also, the other parathyroids are waking up and doing their jobs.\n\nI saw my endocrinologist about 3 and 1/2 weeks post surgery and my calcium numbers were good. He did, however,  put me on Caltrate 600+D3, twice daily. I asked him why since my calcium levels were normal and he said it's just a good idea for a post menopausal woman who has a little osteoporosis from the parathyroid issue, to be taking that. He said I'll be on it forever.\n\nThat sounds like what you are taking now so did your doctor want you to take that in particular? When I would take 1,000 mg Tums tablet, those odd feelings would go away within 20 minutes. \n\nBottom line. Give it time. My surgery was on November 17 and I honestly don't even think about it anymore. If it wasn't for the scar, it would be like it never happened. Good luck!",

    "body": "Hello all, I have a diagnosed vitamin D deficiency and am considering treating it with calcifediol as I can not tolerate other forms of vitamin D due to side effects, calcifediol was recommended as a possible way around these side effects (magnesium is not an option for me).  I found the following [product](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0977NKG98/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on Amazon which recommends a daily intake of 20 mcg (2400 iu), however this product makes no mention on the package pictures as to how long the supplement should be taken, just 2 gel caps a day.\n\nMy questions I would appreciate any help with are;\n\n1) How soon after starting it should I get my levels tested again?  \n\n2) Is there more of a risk of overdose with long term use of this dosage of calcifediol as compared to a comparable dosage of cholecalciferol D3?  \n\n3) For about how long is it safe to take calcifediol daily at this dosage?  \n\nFor reference, my current levels are 13 ng/ml.",

My dr gave me 50000iu dose of cholecalciferol, I took the first dose, felt really good for the first day and then started to feel extremely short of breath, very dry, stretched/tight chest, fast heartbeat, hot etc, fatigued, barely manage to function, it took 5+ days to start feeling better. It felt like severe electrolyte disturbance or something similar. \n\nI tried a 4000 ui dose next, with k2, I felt almost as bad but the symptoms wore off quicker. I’ve read this forum and others, I’ve researched. I tried calcifediol but I’ve had a severe reaction to that too. \n\nI’ve been unable to tolerate any magnesium in any form for several years. I tested high for magnesium rbc, some time ago. Recent test results show low ferritin (28), low/ok b12 (385), low folate (3.5). My level of calcium in the blood was slightly low. \n\nWhat could be going on? There are some knowledgable people here and I’d love to get any help or advice?  I have some thoughts but interested to hear what you think is going on and what I can do. Please help! ",

        "body": "**Background** Deficiency in vitamin D is widely prevalent around the world. Oral vitamin D supplementation is suggested for older adults to sustain appropriate 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels throughout the year. \r  \nAt present, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) are the most commonly used compounds. Supplementation with calcifediol (25OHD3) rather than vitamin D itself should also be considered for the treatment. \r  \nWe performed a systematic review of the literature with a meta-analysis to assess the effects of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) compared to calcifediol (25OHD3) on increasing serum 25(OH)D levels.\r  \n**Methods** A search of online databases was performed electronically for all relevant observational published population-based studies until November 2023, without geographical restrictions. \r  \nWe included studies that directly compared the effects of cholecalciferol and calcifediol on increasing concentrations of serum 25(OH)D. Only papers in English or French languages were considered. Records were screened and data were retrieved through a standardized extraction process.\r  \n**Results** Seventeen studies including 1575 participants were reviewed. \r  \nTwelve intervention trials showed that, in spite of the dosage or the frequency of administration, calcifediol supplementation was more efficacious in raising serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared with cholecalciferol. \r  \nTwo studies showed that calcifediol and cholecalciferol were identically potent. According to three studies, cholecalciferol was more effective than calcifediol in raising 25(OH)D concentrations. \r  \nA meta-analysis including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized trials revealed that calcifediol supplementation had a better impact on elevating serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared with the effect of cholecalciferol.\r  \n**Conclusion** This meta-analysis suggests that calcifediol is more effective in increasing serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared to cholecalciferol. Consequently, calcifediol may emerge as the preferred option for supplementation.",

Snow,  3pp\n\nWe studied the effect of long-term weighted vest plus jumping exercise on hip BMD in postmenopausal women as a strategy for reducing hip fracture risk   80% of women would rather die than be institutionalized\n as a result of hip fracture.   In an earlier study (4), we reported that 9 months of weighted vest exercise reduced fall risk in post menopausal\nwomen by improving neuromuscular measures of muscle strength and power and dynamic balance.\n\nEighteen postmenopausal women (age 64.1 1.6 years at baseline, 69.9 1.6 years at post-testing) who had participated in a 9-month exercise intervention volunteered for the long-term trial. Nine of the original group engaged in weighted vest plus jumping exercise three times per week for 32 weeks of the year over a period of 5 years. Nine of the original controls were active but not enrolled in the exercise program. BMD of the proximal femur was assessed \nby dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 5 years.\n\nAt follow-up, differences in BMD at all regions of the hip were higher in exercisers than controls. For exercisers, changes in BMD were\n11.54% 2.37%,\n20.24% 1.02%, and\n 20.82% 1.04% (means 1 SE) at the femoral neck, trochanter, and total hip, respectively; controls decreased at all sites (\n24.43% 0.93%, 23.43% 1.09%, and\n 3.80% 1.03%, respectively).   When plotted individually for femoral neck, only three of the exercisers \nlost BMD, whereas all nine of the control women had decreased BMD at this site.   Our data support participation in long-term exercise using weighted vests as a strategy for reducing hip fracture risk, a finding that should be confirmed in additional long-term pro\nspective\ntrials. Furthermore, this program is safe and practical and promotes both adherence and compliance in older women.\n\n200000 Daidzein  osteoporosis  Picheritetal.2000\n\n>Daidzein Is More Efficient than Genistein in Preventing Ovariectomy- Induced Bone Loss in Rats Christel Picherit, 8pp\n\nWe investigated the ability of genistein and daidzein, two soybean isoflavones, compared with that of 17a-ethinylestradiol, in rats, to prevent bone loss in ovariectomized rats, a model for postmenopausal osteoporosis.  daidzein was more efficient than genistein in preventing ovariectomy induced\n bone loss in rats.\n\n200008  bone-loading-response-varies-with-strain-magnitude-and-cycle-number\n\n>Bone-loading response varies with strain magnitude and cycle number D. M. CULLEN, 6pp\n\nAs applied load or strain magnitude decreased, the number of cyc required for activation of formation increased.   When load and number of Cycles/day (cyc) are constant, bone formation \nincreases as frequency increases from 0 to 2 Hz (30), and, when frequency increases from 1 to 30 Hz, the strain threshold for bone maintenance decreases from 1,200 to 100 (18). Strain rate, which reflect me strain magnitude and cycle frequency, has been suggested \nto be one of the most important variables that determines bone response (16, 30).   \n\nWhen cycle number is extremely high and intense loads are applied several hundred times a day for several weeks, as occurs in military training, an almost pathological response has been measured with up to 11% bone gain in 14 wk (14).   More traditional responses \nto exercise have been reported as a 2.2% increase \nin tibial BMD after 15 wk of basic training (7) or, in gymnasts, as a 2.8% increase in BMD at the spine and a 1.6% increase at the femoral neck after 8 mo of training (26) or, in men, as a 2% increase in BMD at the spine (not significant) and a 3.8% increase at the femoral neck after 16 wk of strength training (15).\n\nMost adults are not willing or able to commit to repetitive \nhigh-intensity exercise, and forceful activities may not be safe for individuals at risk of osteoporotic fracture.   \n\nThis study has shown that bone adaptation to loading\n is dependent on strain magnitude (rate) and the number of cyc at low frequency.\n\n200100  Effects of Tower Climbing Exercise on Bone Mass Strength and Turnover in\n\n>Effects of Tower Climbing Exercise on Bone Mass, Strength, and Turnover in Growing Rats TAKUYA NOTOMI,  9pp\n\nRats voluntarily climbed the 200-cm tower to drink water from the bottle set at the top of it. In 4 weeks, the trabecular bone formation rate (BFR/bone surface [BS]), bone volume (BV/TV), and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) of both the lumbar vertebra and tibia and the bone mineral density (BMD) of the tibia increased, while the osteoclast surface (Oc.S) decreased. The parameter values in the midfemur, such as the total cross-sectional area, the moment of inertia, the periosteal mineralizing surface (MS/BS), mineral apposition rate (MAR), BFR/BS, and bending load increased, while the endosteal MAR decreased. In 8 weeks, the increases in the bone mineral content (BMC), BMD of the femur and tibia, and the bending load values of the femur were significant, but the climbing exercise did not increase BMC, BMD, or the compression \nload of the lumbar vertebra.  \n\nThe cortical bone formation induced by the climbing exercise seemed to strengthen the structure of the midfemur. The increase in trabecular bone mass of the lumbar vertebrae and tibia was caused by both increased bone formation and reduced bone resorption. \n\n200100  Resistance training and BMD in women\n\n>Resistance training and bone mineral density in women: a metaanalysis of controlled trials  GA Kelley,  6pp\n\nThe length of the intervention ranged from 18 to 208 weeks and the frequency ranged from twice per week to daily   Lumbar spine (23 studies).

Small but statistically-significant changes in BMD were observed at the radius. These were equivalent to a 1.22% increase in BMD for the exercise groups and a 0.95% decrease in the control groups. \n\na change in the percentage of body fat was a significant predictor for ES changes in BMD at the femur. In addition, the initial lean-body mass was a significant predictor for ES changes in BMD at the radius.   There was a statistically-significant decrease observed in the percentage of body fat (-2% plus or minus 2; 95% BCI: -3, -1), whereas there was a statistically-significant increase in lean-body mass (2 plus or minus 1 kg; 95% BCI: 1, 2).    \n\nKelley G A, Kelley K S, Tran Z V.

In repeated measures ANCOVA of secondary outcomes (BMD and BA), BMD at the lumbar spine was significantly greater in jumpers than in controls (2.0%) and approached statistical significance at the femoral neck (1.4%; p = 0.085). For BA, jumpers had significantly greater increases at the femoral neck area than controls (2.9%) but were not different at the spine. Our data indicate that jumping at ground reaction forces of eight times body weight is a safe, effective, and simple method of improving bone mass at the hip and spine in children \n\n200103  home exercise programme to prevent falls  701\n\n>Effectiveness and economic evaluation of a nurse delivered home exercise programme to prevent falls. 2: Controlled trial in multiple centres M Clare Robertson,  5pp\n\nFalls were reduced by 30% in the exercise centres   there was no difference in the number who had serious injuries and no difference in hospital costs resulting from falls in exercise centres compared with control centres.\n\n200107  Recovery periods restore mechanosensitivity to dynamically loaded bone 3389\n\n>Recovery periods restore mechanosensitivity to dynamically loaded bone Alexander G. Robling  11pp\n\nmore than 100 % higher relative bone formation rates in the 8 h recovery group than in the 0 and 0.5 h recovery groups. Approximately 8 h of recovery was sufficient to restore full mechanosensitivity to the cells. In the rats allowed time to recover between load cycles, 14 s of recovery resulted in significantly higher (66–190 %) relative bone formation rates compared to any of the three shorter recovery periods.   Those experiments highlight two key points about bone mechanosensitivity: (i) that mechanical loading sessions need not be long to maximize bone formation, and (ii) that extending the loading session beyond a few minutes does not contribute any additional osteogenic effect.\n\nrest periods lasting 10 s, introduced between individual loading cycles, enhanced the amount of surface actively forming new bone compared to bones that had been loaded for the same number of cycles but lacked a recovery period between cycles (back to-\nback cycles).   Longer recovery periods resulted in higher relative bone formation rates. In tibias allowed 8 h of recovery between each of the four daily loading bouts, relative bone formation rates were 125 % greater than the rates found in animals that had received the four bouts with no recovery time between bouts (0 h group) and 102 % greater than the rates found in animals that had received the four bouts with a 0.5 h recovery time between bouts.   a recovery period of approximately 8 h between bouts is sufficient to restore full mechanosensitivity to the cells.\n\nrelative mineralizing surface and relative bone formation rate were significantly (66–190 %) higher in the 14 s group than in any of the three remaining bending groups (Fig. 6A,C). No significant differences were found among the 0.5, 3.5 and 7 s groups. Thus, the results suggest the existence of a short-term recovery threshold somewhere between 7 and 14 s, beyond which bone formation is enhanced over more closely spaced cycles.   we show that only 8 h of recovery is necessary to restore mechanosensitivity to adapted bone cells.   load cycles spaced 14 s apart result in a greater amount of bone formed per cycle than occurs when cycles are spaced by 7 s or less.\n\n200200  Low-Magnitude Mechanical Loading Becomes Osteogenic When Rest Is Inserted\n\n>Low-Magnitude Mechanical Loading Becomes Osteogenic When Rest Is Inserted Between Each Load Cycle SUNDAR SRINIVASAN,  8pp\n\nwe found that insertion of a 10-s rest interval between each load cycle transformed a locomotion-like loading regime that minimally influenced osteoblast activity into a potent anabolic stimulus.   10 s of rest between each load cycle of a low-magnitude loading protocol greatly enhances the osteogenic potential of the regimen.   suggesting that load induced\n fluid flows near osteocytes were reduced substantially\n(\u000545%) beyond the first few load cycles of repetitive (\u0005 loading.( locomotion-like mechanical   insertion of a 10-s rest interval between each load cycle transformed a low-magnitude minimally osteogenic \nloading regimen into a potent osteogenic stimulus in two distinct in vivo models of bone adaptation \n\n200211  Walking and leisure-time activity and risk of hip fracture in postmenopausal women\n\n>Walking and leisure-time activity and risk of hip fracture in postmenopausal women Diane Feskanich,  2pp\n\nWalking is the most common activity among older adults, and evidence suggests that it can increase femoral bone density and reduce fracture risk.   risk of hip fracture was lowered by % (% condence interval [CI], %-%; P<.) for each increase of metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours per week of activity (equivalent to h/wk of walking at an average pace). Active women with at least MET-h/wk had a % lower risk of hip fracture (relative risk [RR], .; % CI, .-.) compared with sedentary women with less than  MET-h/wk. Even women with a lower risk of hip fracture due to higher body weight experienced a further reduction in risk with higher levels of activity.   \n\n200300  designing_exercise_regimens_to_increase_bone.9\n\n>  Designing Exercise Regimens to Increase Bone Strength Charles H. Turner1  6pp\n\nbone mass (or areal BMD (aBMD)) is merely a surrogate measure for bone strength   The load induced\nincrease in aBMD and BMC were modest, reaching 5.4% and 6.9%, respectively. Despite these small gains in bone mineral, mechanical testing revealed a 64% increase in ultimate force (the maximum amount of force the bone could support before failing) and a 94% increase in energy to failure (the amount of energy absorbed by the bone before failure).   The reason that a small amount of new bone resulted in such dramatic changes in bone strength is because the new bone formation was localized to the medial and lateral periosteal\n surfaces where mechanical strains (stresses) were greatest.   only modest increases \nin total new bone formation produced a large increase in bone strength by placing bone where the biomechanical demands were greatest.   assessment should include some measure of bone shape and size.   \n\nHigh impact \nexercises that produce large rates of deformation of the bone matrix best drive fluid through the lacunar canalicular \nnetwork system. In addition, loading applied at higher frequency (cycles per second) more effectively stimulates osteogenesis. The required mechanical load necessary to initiate new bone formation decreases as the loading frequency increases.   exercise is most effective if delivered in short bouts separated by several hours.   ASSESSING EXERCISE: THE OSTEOGENIC INDEX   \n\nthe weekly OI generated by 20 min of walking 5 1 d·w k\u0001 is 36.8. This is calculated under the assumption that a 20-min walk generates approximately 800 loading cycles to each leg and that the peak load is 1.1 times body weight, or OI (week) 1.1 \u0003times body weight) \u0002 \u0003 * ln[800 cycles 1\u0005 * 5\u0003d\u0001wk\u00011) 36.8 [3] \u0001 \u0003 1\u0005  d \u0002 . The OI for multiple bouts of loading depends upon the recovery time allowed between sessions. Therefore, three parameters are required to assess OI: intensity, N, and time between sessions. For mild-impact exercise, such as jumping, 1, 5 times·w k\u0001 the OI varies from 50 when jumping 150 1 \u00011. times·w k\u0001 to 70 for 600 jumps·wk  \n\nThe osteogenic potential \nof exercise can be increased further when the daily exercise is divided into two shorter sessions separated by 8 h. 1 For example, consider 120 jumps· d\u0001 done in one session or broken into either two sessions of 60 jumps separated by 8 h or three sessions of 40 jumps separated by 4 h: OI (1 session\u0001d\u00011) 3 (times body weight) \u0002 * ln[120 cycles 1] 14.4 , [4] \u0003 \u0002 OI (2 sessions\u0001d\u00011) 3 * ln[60 1] 3 * ln[60 1]   \u00031 e 8h /6h) 21.4 , [5] \u0001 \u00031 \u0004 \u0002 OI (3 sessions\u0001d\u00011) 3 * ln[40 1] 3 * ln[40 1] * (1\u0001e 4h /6h) 3 * ln[40 1] \u0001 \u00031 e 4h /6h) * (1  4h/ 6h) 19.2 [6] \u0001e \u00031 \u0004 \u0004\u0002 \n\nConsequently, breaking 120 jumps into two sessions improves \nthe OI by almost 50%,   the osteogenic \u00011 effectiveness of 600 jumps·wk is more than doubled if the exercise is delivered in 5 daily sessions, rather than 2 1. times·w k\u0001 \n\nJump training improved BMC in the hip and spine when \u00011 performed 3 times·wk  (1). However, when the number of 1, sessions was reduced to 2 times·wk \u0001 jumping did not significantly \naffect BMC (2).  engaging in exercise during skeletal growth is unequivocally \nmore osteogenic than exercise during skeletal maturity   those who started playing at an early age (several years before menarche) had more than two times as much differential (playing arm vs nonplaying arm) in mineral accrual than those who started playing during their adult years.   \n\n200300  Walking and Reduction of Hip Fracture Risk in Older Women AAFP\n\n>Walking and Reduction of Hip Fracture Risk in Older Women CAROLINE WELLBERY,  3pp\n\nWalking was subdivided according to pace: easy (less than 2 miles per hour [mph]), average, brisk, and very brisk (4 mph or faster); “unable to walk” was also a category. Each activity was assigned a metabolic equivalent (MET) score, with 1 MET being the energy expended during quiet sitting.   The median total activity for the study participants was seven MET-hours per week, which is equivalent to the energy expended while walking at an average pace for 2.3 hours per week.   Activity and body mass index (BMI) inversely and independently correlated with hip fracture risk. Women with 24 MET-hours per week had a 55 percent lower occurrence of hip fracture than those reporting three MET-hours per week. The risk of hip fracture declined by 6 percent for each MET-hour per week (dose-dependent reduction). Heavier women had a lower fracture risk in every activity category.   Hormone replacement therapy conferred the greatest risk reduction in women with the lowest level of activity (less than three MET-hours per week).Very active women (24 MET-hours per week or more) received no added benefit from hormone therapy.   Walking for four hours a week or more was associated with a risk reduction of 41 percent. Furthermore, the brisker the pace, the greater the risk reduction.   \n\nstanding for 10 hours a week or more also was associated with a signicantly lower risk of hip fracture.\n\n200400  physical_activity_and_bone_health.24\n\n>Physical Activity and Bone Health  by Wendy M. Kohrt,  12 pp\n\nMode:  weight-bearing endurance activities (tennis; stair climbing; jogging, at least intermittently during walking), activities that involve jumping (volleyball, basketball), and resistance exercise (weight lifting) Intensity: moderate to high, in terms of bone-loading forces Frequency: weight-bearing endurance activities 3–5 times per week; resistance exercise 2–3 times per week \u00021 Duration: 30–60 min\u0001 d of a combination of weight-bearing endurance \nactivities, activities that involve jumping, and resistance \nexercise that targets all major muscle groups \n\nBecause it takes 3–4 months for one remodeling cycle to complete the sequence \nof bone resorption, formation, and mineralization (85), a minimum of 6–8 months is required to achieve a new steady-state bone mass that is measurable.   Activities that simulate resistance training in humans, including \njumping up to a platform, voluntary tower climbing, and simulated “squat” exercises, have been found to have positive effects on both cortical and trabecular bone regions of the tibia and femur   Peak bone mineral accrual rate has been reported to occur at puberty (2), with 26% of adult total body bone mineral accrued within a 2-yr period of this time  bone appears to be most responsive to mechanical \nstress during Tanner stages II through IV   In a 5-yr study of a small group of postmenopausal women, exercisers who wore weighted vests averaging 5 kg during jumping activity preserved hip BMD to a greater extent than control subjects (110).   \nmen who reported participation in vigorous physical activity had a 62% lower relative risk of hip fracture than men who indicated \nthey did not participate in vigorous physical activity\n\n200401  Risk of Mortality  kwh274\n\n>The “Weekend Warrior” and Risk of Mortality I-Min Lee1,  6pp\n\nThe multivariate relative risks for mortality among the sedentary, insufficiently active, weekend warriors, and regularly active men were 1.00 (referent), 0.75 (95% confidence interval CI): 0.62, 0.91), 0.85 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.11), and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.73), respectively.\n\n200505  impact exercise on bone mineral density in elderly women with low BMD 30-month intervention\n\n>Effect of impact exercise on bone mineral density in elderly women with low BMD: a population-based randomized controlled 30-month intervention. Korpelainen R  1pp\n\nParticipants (n=160) were randomly assigned to 30 months either of supervised and home-based impact exercise training or of no intervention.   Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 12 months and 30 months using blinded operators. The analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat analysis. Mean femoral neck and trochanter BMD decreased in the control group [-1.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.1% to -2.1% and -1.6%, 95% CI -0.4% to -2.7%], while no change occurred in the exercise group. Mean trochanter BMC decreased more in the control group (-7.7%, 95% CI -9.7% to -5.6% vs. -2.9%, 95% CI -5.3 to -0.9). There were six falls that resulted in fractures in the exercise group and 16 in the control group during the 30-month intervention (P=0.019). A significant bone loss occurred in both groups at the radius and calcaneum. In multivariate analysis, weight gain was associated with increased BMD and BMC at all femur sites both in the exercise group and in the pooled groups. In conclusion, impact exercise had no \neffect on BMD, while there was a positive effect on BMC at the trochanter. Exercise may prevent fall-related fractures in elderly women with low bone mass.\n\n200506  low-repetition-jump-training-on-bone-mineral-density-in-young-women\n\n>Effect of low-repetition jump training on bone mineral density in young women Takeru Kato,  5pp\n\n—The hypothesis of the present study was that low-repetition and high-impact training of 10 maximum vertical jumps/day, 3 times/wk would be effective for improving bone mineral density (BMD) in ordinary young women.   low-repetition and high-impact jumps enhanced BMD at the specific bone sites in young women who had almost reached the age of peak bone mass   Jo hannsen\n and coworkers (11) have found greater increases in total and leg bone mineral content (BMC) by relatively fewer jumps from a 45-cm-high box, 25 jumps/day, 5 times/wk, total of 125 jumps/wk in a randomized, controlled trial conducted with children (3–18 yr). Also, Snow et al. (24) reported, after 5 yr of resistance training with weighted vest and an average 51.7 jumps/day, 3 times/wk, for a total of 155 jumps/wk from a 20.3-cm-high step, improved femoral neck BMD compared with a control group in postmenopausal woman (64.1– 69.9 yr).   \n\nto bring intakes over 650 mg/day of elemental calcium, which exceeds the requirements for the recommended \ncalcium allowances in Japanese adult women of this age   At both visits for measuring jump height, subjects jumped vertically at least twice with maximum voluntary effort, and the best performance was recorded. The subjects stood at the center of the circular thin rubber mat (38 cm in diameter). The jumper attached the height measuring\n device to her waist. The jump height measuring device and the circular mat were attached by a rope so that the traveling distance from the standing position to the maximum height reached at waist level could be measured.   \n\nHeinonen et al. (7) reported that high-impact jump training from a height of 10–25 cm, at which the estimated GRF is 2.1–5.6 times BW, produced significant improvement in femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD in premenopausal women aged 35–45 yr.   In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that 10 maximum vertical jumps/day, 3 days/wk \nenhanced BMD at the femoral neck in young women who had almost reached the age of peak bone mass. For practical applications, low-repetition \nhigh-impact jumps are suggested to be one of the ideal training methods for enhancing and maintaining peak bone mass in young adult women.\n\n200509  Bounce_at_the_Bell_A_novel_program_of_short_bouts_\n\n>Bounce at the Bell’’: a novel program of short bouts of exercise improves proximal femur bone mass in early pubertal children H A McKay,  7pp\n\n,3  10 counter-movement jumps 36 per day (total min/day).   bone mineral content (BMC)   Intervention children gained significantly more BMC at the total proximal femur (2%) and the intertrochanteric region (27%).   took only a few minutes each day and enhanced bone mass at the weight bearing proximal femur in early pubertal children.   \n\nUpwards of 90% of adult bone mass is acquired by the end of adolescence,   \n\nTeachers instructed the children to perform 10 counter movement jumps (two foot take off, clutch knees, two foot landing), three times each school day (once at morning bell, once at noon bell, and once at home time bell). Ground reaction forces for a counter movement jump were five times body weight (BW) and maximum rate of force was .400 BW/s \n\n200606  Leisure Physical Activity and the Risk of Fracture in Men  pmed.0040199\n\n>Leisure Physical Activity and the Risk of Fracture in Men Karl Michaelsson  8pp\n\nMen with a sedentarylifestyle (HR 2.56, 95% confidence interval 1.55–4.24) or men who walked or bicycled only for pleasure (HR 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.10–2.36) had an increased adjusted risk of hip fracture compared with men who participated in regular sports activities for at least 3 h/wk. At the end of follow-up, 8.4% of the men with a high physical activity, 13.3% of the men with a medium physical activity, and 20.5% of the men with a low physical activity had suffered a hip fracture.\n\n200608  Exercise maintains bone density at spine and hip. early postmenopausal women\n\n>Exercise maintains bone density at spine and hip EFOPS: a 3-year longitudinal study in early postmenopausal women K.

Group training session   supplemented with calcium and cholecalciferol to ensure a total daily intake of 1,500 mg calcium and 500 IE vitamin D.  There was a long (6– 7 months) phasing-in period to adapt the participants to the more strenuous exercises.   \n\nThe exercise regimen should affect bone along multiple pathways. During the initial warm-up sequence (running and games), exercise intensity \nwas moderate [39, 40], but cycle number (>1,000 cycles) and strain frequency (2–4 Hz) were high. According to Cullen et al. [41], high cycle numbers compensate for strain magnitudes that are slightly below the adaptive threshold of bone. Furthermore, within the range of deliberate motion (<4 Hz.), Turner et al. [42] demonstrated significantly higher bone formation rates after higher strain frequencies (2 Hz) compared with lower frequencies (<0.5 Hz).\n\nIn a 12-month study. Jones et al. [30] demonstrated significant BUA increases relative \nto sedentary controls in their brisk walking group.   Turner et al. [47] reported higher increments\n\nof bone strength exercising 2·5 weeks with an intermittent \n5-week rest period than with 15 weeks of continuous \nexercise.\n\n200702  osteoporosis risk factors  1471-2474-9-28\n\n>The assessment of osteoporosis risk factors in Iranian women compared with Indian women Afsaneh Keramat*  10pp\n\nPure vegetarianism: (2.2) and Red meat consumption more than 4 times per week (1.4) was shown as a risk factor in Indian and Iranian subjects respectively.   Regular consumption of Soya (0.3), almond (0.5), fish (0.5), fruits (0.4) and milk tea 4 cups per day and more (0.4) appeared to be significant protective factors in India. Regular consumption of cheese (0.5), milk (0.5), chicken (0.4), egg (0.6), fruit (0.4), tea 7 cups per day and more (0.3) were found to be significant protective factors in Iran. Exercises were shown as protective factor in Iran (0.4) and India (0.4).   Mean of weight and BMI were significantly lower in osteoporotic group in both countries   BMI less than 26 have been shown as risk factors of osteoporosis in both countries.   \n\nRegular consumption of Soya, almond fish, fruits and milk tea 4 cups per day and more appeared to be significant protective factors in India. Regular consumption of cheese, milk, chicken, egg, fruit, tea 7 cups per day and more were found to be significant protective factors in Iran.   The percentage of women who were directly in sunshine exposure at least for 15 minutes per day was significantly higher among controls compared to osteoporotic groups in Iranian subjects (P < 0.01). and sunshine exposure was shown as a protective factor in Iran Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval include 0.45 (0.28–0.72) and it remained significant after age, weight and height adjustment.   the consumption of almond, Soya products, were shown as protective factors in India   The isoflavones in soybeans, which function both as phytoestrogens and antioxidants, may result in the inhibition of bone resorption   Also important is total protein in the diet.\n\nLow levels of serum albumin negatively affect transport of serum calcium.   In this study black tea consumption more than 6 cups per day in Iran and Milk tea consumption 4 cups per day or more in India have been shown as protective factors for osteoporosis.   Nutrients found in tea, such as flavonoids,\nmay influence BMD \n\n200706  Activity Reduces Risk of Fragility Fracture\n\n>Physical Activity Reduces the Risk of Fragility Fracture Harri Sievänen,  2pp\n\nA 2002 study of postmenopausal women by Feskanich et al. [13] found a dose response\n relationship: the risk of hip fracture was lowered by 6% for each increase of three metabolic equivalent hours of activity per week (equivalent to one hour per week of walking at an average speed).   At the end of the follow-up, 8.4% of the men in the high physical activity group, 13.3% of the men in the medium physical activity group, and 20.5% of the men in the low physical activity group had suffered a hip fracture.   the effective “dose” of exercise for reducing the risk of hip fracture was readily attained by recreational sports, heavy gardening, or other activities with similar intensity performed for at least three hours per week.   \n\n200803  exercise-induced increases in bone density  FNR-52-1872\n\n>Sustainability of exercise-induced increases in bone density and skeletal structure Magnus K. Karlsson, 6pp\n\nRecreational exercise seems to at least partially maintain exercise-induced skeletal benefits achieved during growth.   Exercise during growth may be followed by long-term beneficial skeletal effects, which could possibly reduce the incidence of fractures.  The duration of exercise is of less importance, as a short duration of load or a small number of repetitions are enough to achieve the maximal anabolic effect.   Exercise-induced skeletal benefits in BMD achieved during growth seem to be lost with cessation of exercise, whereas exercise-induced structural benefits in the skeleton \nmay be retained even with reduced activity level.  \n\n200805  mobility tests for predicting falls  Tiedemannetal2008\n\n> The comparative ability of eight functional mobility tests for predicting falls in community-dwelling older people ANNE TIEDEMANN1,  7pp\n\nmeasurements—the sit-to-stand test with one and five repetitions, the pick-up-weight test, the half-turn test, the alternate-step test (AST), the six-metre-walk test (SMWT) and stair ascent and descent tasks.  Poor performances in two mobility tests, = however, increased the risk of multiple falls more than poor performance in one test alone (ORs 3.66,    \n\nFunctional mobility tests   Alternate-step test The alternate-step test (AST) is a modified version of the Berg stool-stepping task [17]. It involves weight shifting and provides ameasure of lateral stability. This test involved alternatively \nplacing the entire left and right feet (shoes removed) as fast as possible onto a step that was 18 cm high and 40 cm deep. The time taken to complete eight steps, alternating between the left and right feet comprised the test measure. \n\nAn AST cut-off point of 10 s was associated with a 130% increased risk,\n\n200810  fitness of older adults in senior activity centres after 24-week silver yoga exercises\n\n>Physical fitness of older adults in senior activity centres after 24-week silver yoga exercises Kuei-Min Chen  1p\n\nThe physical fitness of older adults in both the 70-minute complete silver yoga group and the 55-minute shortened silver yoga group had significantly improved after the interventions.\n\n200900  impact exercise on postmenopausal bone loss\n\n>  A meta-analysis of impact exercise on postmenopausal bone loss: the case for mixed loading exercise programmes by  M Martyn-St James  4pp\n\nThere was a statistically significant improvement in bone mineral density in g per cm at the lumbar spine (WMD 0.015, 95% CI 0.005 to 0.025; 11 trials; 16 comparisons) and femoral neck (WMD 0.008, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.013; 13 trials; 19 comparisons) using impact exercise interventions compared with control. There was evidence of statistical heterogeneity for both outcomes (I =84% for lumbar spine and I =61% for femoral neck). There was also a significant improvement in hip bone mineral density using impact exercise compared with controls (WMD 0.013, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.024; four trials), but again with statistical heterogeneity (I =91%).  Subgroup analyses showed that combined-impact interventions significantly improved bone mineral density at the lumbar spine (WMD 0.016, 95% CI 0.005 to 0.027; three comparisons) and femoral neck (WMD 0.005, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.010; five comparisons). \n\nThere was evidence of statistical heterogeneity for lumbar spine (I =73%), but not for femoral neck (I =0%). Low-impact interventions, which included jogging, walking, and/or stair climbing, also showed significant improvements in bone mineral density at the femoral neck (WMD 0.022, 95% CI 0.014 to 0.030, six comparisons) and lumbar spine (WMD 0.025, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.046; six comparisons).   High-impact and odd-impact interventions showed no significant improvements in bone density at either site.\n\n200906  Fall Risk Assessment Tool  Tiedemannetal2010\n\n>The Development and Validation of a Brief Performance-Based Fall Risk Assessment Tool for Use in Primary Care\nA\nnne Tiedemann,  9pp\n\nEach of the performance items; low contrast visual acuity, tactile sensitivity, sit to stand, alternate step, and near tandem stand ability; and measures of previous falls and medications could discriminate between prospectively categorized multiple fallers and non–multiple fallers with relative risk values ranging from 1.4 to 2.4 in the development study. The probability of future multiple falls increased from 7% with the identification of zero or one risk factor up to a probability of 49% with the identification of six or more risk factors.  Clinicians who have used the assessment report that it is a practical assessment, which can be incorporated into clinical practice.\n\n200912  Maintenance of High-Impact Activity-Induced Bone Gain by Voluntary, Unsupervised Exercises\n\n>Good Maintenance of High-Impact Activity-Induced Bone Gain by Voluntary, Unsupervised Exercises: An 8-Month Follow-up of a Randomized Controlled Trial  2p\n\nthe signicant BMD increases that were obtained by supervised 18-month high-impact training were eectively maintained with subsequent unsupervised regular aerobic and step classes (twice per week).

Crane  11pp\n\nintramyocellular lipid (IMCL)   older adults have larger IMCL droplets,\nfewer mitochondria, and a lower proportion of IMCL in contact with mitochondria. These factors likely contribute to age-related reductions in mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism.   Aerobic exercise training produces the opposite \neffect, whereby mitochondria and IMCL become closely associated and are therefore more optimally situated for oxidation ( 18 ).\n\n201000  Exercise and Bone Macro-architecture  GoingFarr2010IJBCR\n\nReliance on dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and aBMD has been a problem. DXA estimates of aBMD are confounded by changes in bone size with growth and only partially reflect bone strength. Structural adaptations, such as increases in bone width, may confer lasting increases in bone strength.   exercise \nmight significantly enhance the fracture resistance\n of bone, but the effects may go undetected because a single slice measurement may not coincide with regions where bone is localized (the most mechanically appropriate sites). Furthermore, the dif-ficulties in interpreting metaphyseal pQCT BMD from a single slice [90] and the potential poor long-term reproducibility of pQCT measurements as a result of the inability to find the same exact location along the length of the bone over time [80] may limit the ability \nof pQCT to detect exercise-induced bone adaptations.\n\n201007  The driving force in osteoporosis query  lencel2011\n\n>Inflammaging: The driving force in osteoporosis? P. Lencel,  5pp\n\nwith regard to emerging epidemiologic studies, the hypothes is \nsuggesting that age-related changes such as inflammatory modifications importantly account for age-related bone loss is gaining increasing interest.  circulating levels of TNF -a may be the best predictor of mortality in frail, elderly populations with a high mortality rate, whereas IL-6 may be the strongest risk marker in healthy, elderly populations   It is today acknowledged that adipose tissue behaves as an endocrine tissue that secretes several inflammatory mediators.   In the Geelong Osteoporosis study, the fracture risk was increased 24–32% for each SD increase in CRP levels in elderly women [34]. Finally, in healthy individuals over age 70, Cauley and collaborators have shown that in addition to CRP levels, high serum levels of inflammatory markers IL-6, TNF- a, and TNF receptors, also predict a higher incidence of non-traumatic fractures [35].",

    "body": "**Background and Aim:** Recently, optimal immune function has become a primary focus of worldwide attention not only in the prevention of chronic disease but also as one strategy to reduce the severity of acute illness. Inflammation, a process largely controlled by the immune system, has long been studied and recognized for its role in chronic disease. Optimizing immune function or managing inflammation using individual nutrients and phytonutrients is not well understood by the average person. Thus, this narrative literature review summarizes many of the more recent findings about how certain nutrients and phytonutrients affect immune function and inflammation, and how they may best be utilized considering the growing worldwide interest in this topic.\n\n**Methods:** A comprehensive literature search of PubMed was performed to find clinical trials in humans that assessed the effect of nutrients and phytonutrients on immune function and inflammation, in individuals with acute and chronic health conditions, published in English between 2000 and 2020. Two independent reviewers evaluated the articles for their inclusion. \n\n**Results:** Eighty-seven articles were summarized in this narrative review. In total 24 nutrients and phytonutrients were included in the study, that is, acetyl-L-carnitine, Aloe vera polysaccharides, betaglucans, bilberry, black seed oil, coenzyme Q10, curcumin (turmeric), frankincense, garlic, ginger, hydrolyzed rice bran, isoflavones, lipoic acid, mistletoe, N-acetyl cysteine, omega-3 fatty acids, resveratrol, selenium, shiitake mushroom and its derivatives, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), Vitamin E (d-alpha- and gamma-tocopherol), and zinc. Some of the noteworthy immune function and anti-inflammatory responses to these interventions included modulation of nuclear factor-Kappa B, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, interleukin-6, and CD4+ T cells, among others. These findings are not completely consistent or ubiquitous across all patient populations or health status. \n\n**Conclusions:** Based on this review, many nutrients and phytonutrients are capable of significantly modulating immune function and reducing inflammation, according to multiple biomarkers in clinical trials in different populations of adults with varying health statuses. Thus, dietary supplementation may serve as an adjunct to conventional pharmaceutical or medical therapies, but evaluation of risks and benefits for each person and health status is necessary. Additional larger studies are also needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of nutritional compounds in various health conditions, with emphases on potential drug-supplement interactions and clinical endpoints. Relevance for Patients: As demonstrated in the reviewed clinical trials, patients of various health challenges with a wide range of severity may benefit from select nutrients and phytonutrients to improve their immune function and reduce inflammation.\n\n**Full paper can be found** [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8259612/pdf/jclintranslres-2021-7-3-333.pdf).",

I eliminated wheat/grains, and have gone (mostly) plant-based for diet, but wanted to see what vitamins/minerals I could be lacking that might be aggravating the problems. \n\nThere seems to be some consensus that supplementing Vitamin D is one of the most important things you can do for your health – for everyone, though I am looking at it specifically through the lens of a middle-aged woman.\n\nThere are [studies](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170501102258.htm) in circulation claiming that a billion people (or up to 80% of the population, depending on which study you believe) have a Vitamin D deficiency. I sense that this is true on some level, because as we age, our ability to produce the vitamin through sun [exposure decreases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2997282). \n\nI understand that Vitamin D is an important precursor to testosterone production in our system as well as playing a part in a whole host of other functions, like cardiovascular health, anti-inflammatory responses, autoimmune conditions, bone health, and even depression, but it turns out that it is especially crucial for the health of your gut.  And gut health, as we are just starting to understand, is the foundation for virtually every aspect of a long and healthy life. Here’s how it works: Vitamin D3 activates the stem cells in your gut, which keep the lining healthy and thick – which in turn ensures that your body can absorb all the nutrients it needs to function properly. When the gut lining is degraded by lack of Vitamin D3 (and various other culprits working in concert) it shrinks, and this in effect causes malnutrition: when the lining is too small or damaged, you cannot absorb enough of the nutrients you need, no matter how much you eat. Put another way, without appropriate levels of Vitamin D, our gut basically “leaks” critical nutrients through the intestinal lining. This kicks off a number of concerning health issues: \n\n· Higher C-reactive protein levels in the blood, which is a key marker for inflammation \n\n· Greater resistance to insulin and higher blood sugar overall, both conditions that lead to diabetes\n\no [Read more about insulin resistance here](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2012/634195/)\n\n· Weight gain\n\no [This 2012 study showed a strong correlation to abdominal fat and Vitamin D deficiency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22170363)\n\n· Increased risks of certain cancers, especially breast, prostate, colon, ovarian, and melanoma\n\n· [Increased risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and heart failure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446902)\n\n· Certain autoimmune conditions\n\n· Depression\n\n· Osteoporosis and bone fractures\n\nThis is interesting to think about, in that we spend so much time and money trying to flood our bodies with the food and supplements it needs to thrive, but if we lack appropriate levels of just this one seemingly simple vitamin, we could be setting ourselves up for a lifetime of hospital visits and prescription drugs despite all our efforts.\n\nLuckily, the fix, it seems, is easy. I’m a big fan of Dr. William Davis, of “Wheat Belly” fame – he considers correcting Vitamin D deficiency to be one of the most powerful strategies to restoring health out there - it’s easy, inexpensive, and extremely difficult to overdo, as toxicity is rare. But not impossible! [One study](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-11/imc-nsl111311.php) does show a possible link between too much Vitamin D and atrial fibrillation. \n\nThe general consensus seems to be that most people can take (and may need) 4,000 – 8,000 I.U. of Vitamin D per day to heal the intestinal lining; it’s worth monitoring your blood level with your doctor. The best way to supplement is with D3 or cholecalciferol, the form that naturally occurs in the human body and is widely available, not D2 or ergocalciferol. I take just 2,000 I.U. per day and my levels have been steadily increasing since I began supplementing. \n\nI can’t say that I’ve noticed a huge change in the way I feel since I’ve gotten my Vitamin D closer to an optimum level, but my blood panels indicate that the higher Vitamin D levels seem to correspond to lower CRP and blood sugar, and my TSH has risen a little bit as well.  So my body is definitely functioning better. And if guarding against so many of the conditions that plague us as we age is as easy as supplementing Vitamin D3, I’m in!\n\nCurious as to others’ experiences with supplements specifically in middle age and beyond?\n\n\\*\\*this is from a post on my personal blog, where I aggregate lots of the information I find about supplements as well as my experiences with them. \n\n[https://www.menopausetotalhealth.com/home/vitamin-d-the-keystone-of-good-health](https://www.menopausetotalhealth.com/home/vitamin-d-the-keystone-of-good-health)",

Therefore, daily supplementation is likely superior to once-weekly/once-monthly supplementation.\n\n****\n\nSome institutions consider weekly/monthly high dose Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) dosing as equivalent to low daily doses of Vitamin D3 due to similar efficacy in raising serum 25(OH)D - for instance, 60,000 IU once a month will increase serum 25(OH)D (Calcifediol) almost the same as 2,000 IU per day.\n\nHowever, what this doesn't account for is the fact that Cholecalciferol itself has unique effects that may not be shared by 25(OH)D and its metabolite, 1,25(OH)D (Calcitriol).\n\nCholecalciferol is the form synthesized in the skin when we're exposed to UV-B rays from sunlight, and also is the form in Vitamin D3 supplements. This form has a short half-life in the blood; every 24 hours, the levels of Cholecalciferol are halved, as the body transforms it slowly in the more \"active\" forms: 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)D. While these two latter forms are enough to prevent rickets, they don't share all the beneficial effects of Cholecalciferol itself. The 25(OH)D form has a long half-life of around 15 days (its blood levels are halved every 15 days), and when vitamin D levels are measured in blood tests, it's almost always only 25(OH)D. The 25(OH)D form is slowly broken down to 1,25(OH)D (Calcitriol), considered the most active form of Vitamin D.\n\nCholecalciferol - once considered inactive by itself, and merely a prodrug/precursor to the \"active\" forms - was found to directly activate the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) and, by doing this, preventing muscle wasting. This was first demonstrated in vitro (cell culture), where vitamin D prevented inflammation-induced muscle atrophy ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7950266/)). But cell cultures do not necessarily reflect what happens in whole organisms, let alone humans. \n\nA paper published in 2022 has reproduced similar findings in humans: Supplementation with 3200 IU Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) per day had beneficial effects on muscle function of the subjects. Another group given 25(OH)D, the long-lived metabolite of Cholecalciferol that's measured in the blood as \"vitamin D\", did not show any improvement in muscle function at all ([Source](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00774-022-01374-y)). In other words, this is direct evidence **Cholecalciferol has beneficial effects, which the \"active\" forms of Vitamin D lack, making Cholecalciferol itself active**.\n\nMonthly megadoses of Cholecalciferol - while they durably increase 25(OH)D levels - only transiently increase Cholecalciferol levels, for up to a week after each monthly megadose ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4266550/)). This means that for the remaining 3 weeks of the month, the serum levels of Cholecalciferol will be too low to be beneficial. This is in stark contrast to daily Cholecalciferol supplementation, which increases both Cholecalciferol and 25(OH)D levels - the best of both worlds.\n\nSo, as an example, while 2000 IU of Vitamin D3 daily or 60,000 IU monthly increase 25(OH)D levels to a similar extent, 2000 IU daily is more beneficial to health because it increases serum Cholecalciferol long-term too - not just 25(OH)D.",
