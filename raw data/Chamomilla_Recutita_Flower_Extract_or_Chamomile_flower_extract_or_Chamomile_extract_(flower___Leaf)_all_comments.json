It took much longer than other lists because of all the info I had to gather. That and me rage quitting for a while after computer decided to delete all the ingredient lists I typed out.  :I***\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**General Info (That I got questions about):**\n\n*The reason I typed out some of the ingredient lists is bc I can't find the list in English online that I can easily copy and paste, or the ingredients aren't up to date.*\n\n*I bolded some ingredients that are helpful for skin/skin-identical for healthy skin barrier.*\n\n*The dollar cost is the converted retail price of what it would cost in Korea, without sale/promo.*\n\n*I also looked up all the common plant names from their scientific names because it annoys me when I look at ingredients and I have no idea what that plant is..*\n\n***PEG -*** *something* *means something has been altered or made to be water soluble. It is useful for that but some people avoid it due to microplastics (I don't know a whole lot about it, but have heard people say this).*\n\n[***You don't need to be SUPER DUPER concerned about visible light/blue light protection***](https://labmuffin.com/blue-light-computers-phones-damage-skin/) ***and whatnot, even though some of these products claim to protect against them.***\n\n***TINTED sunscreens are lightly tinted usually in beige or peach color. Peachy shades cancel dark/brown-ish tones (like dark spots, dark undereyes), making skin appear brighter/more awake than normal.***\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**FOR SENSITIVE SKINNED FOLKS ONLY:**\n\n*There is* ***fragrance*** *in the form of natural* ***essential oils*** *and synthetic oils in some of these products. Contrary to popular belief,* **synthetic** ***fragrance*** *isn't worse than essential oils as they can be modified to have less skin-sensitizing components.*\n\n*While fragrance can be* ***perfectly fine*** *for some if you have* ***healthy skin*** *and don't mind the actual smell,* **VERY** ***sensitive*** *skin types may want to* ***avoid it*** *as we don't know exactly what it's made up of. There's another camp that says* ***long term exposure*** *fragrance/essential oils on healthy skin can make it more likely for your skin to* ***develop*** *problems/sensitivity later on. As always,* ***YMMV.***\n\n*Many of these companies* ***claim*** *that their product is the* ***gentlest*** *for the most sensitive skin because of EWG (Environmental Working Group) rating of 1, but* ***EWG is NOT a reliable source, especially for sensitive skinned folks***\\*\\*, *as they can be very biased and promote skin-sensitizing things just because an ingredient sounds more \"natural\".\\** ***Natural*** *things usually contain much more possible* ***skin triggers*** *than lab-isolated,* ***single*** *ingredients.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Potentially Irritating Filters (From Lab Muffin Beauty Science Blog)***\n\n>**Avobenzone** is a common irritant and allergen, so it tends to be unsuitable for sensitive skin, and you’re left with inorganic sunscreens only.  \n>  \n>If you’re elsewhere in the world, the newer UVA1 filters aren’t particularly irritating or allergenic.  \n>  \n>A few other organic sunscreens also tend to cause allergic and irritant reactions: **octocrylene, oxybenzone, avobenzone, PABA, Padimate O and enzacamene.**\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SUNSCREEN**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.\\[A24\\] Premium Sun Protection Cream -

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "Hello! So beplain initially caught my attention as I’ve heard the brand was made based on customer feedback in Korea. The ingredients list for these products are relatively simple so there was little worry for breakouts. It definitely did not disappoint!\n\nA little background: I live in a humid country with dehydrated, combination, acne-prone skin. My main concerns with my skin right now is CCs, calming and hydrating.\n\n-\n**Greenful pH-Balanced Cleansing Foam** ***4.5/5 MRP***\n\n*Glycerin, Mung Bean Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Lauryl Betaine, Betaine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Powder, Dextrin, Allantoin, Water, Ceramide NP, Green Tea Powder, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nCompared to all cleansers I’ve used so far, this was probably one of the best. It’s a pretty light green with a thick paste texture, and has small bits of what seems to be mung bean. In my opinion, you can smell mung bean, just slightly, but I didn’t mind it at all as it reminds me of those asian dessert places haha. The cleanser itself foams, but for me it wasn’t stripping at all. The cleanser contains lots of extracts which could be good for the skin, but honestly since it’s a wash-off product, I couldnt feel any of the benefits :”) The downside would be the price. In my country, it is sold for $12 for 80ml, which is more expensive than any other cleansers I’ve ever used :(\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Toner** ***3.5/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract (80.65%), Propanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Trehalose, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Allantoin, Cellulose Gum, Disodium EDTA, Ceramide-NP, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nOkay so this was a 3.5 for me, just because of my skin type and the weather in my country. For oily-combo skin in humid weather, this toner felt slightly too moisturizing, so it felt kind of heavy for me. This would definitely be amazing for dry skin in the summer or oily skin in the winter. It’s a runny toner with a slight slip if you rub it against your hands. I could smell a bit of the chamomile as I apply it to my face but it wasn’t overpowering at all. It was soothing, but the main thing it did for my skin was honestly the moisturizing/hydrating component. If that was what you’re looking for in a runny toner, I’d definitely recommend this!\n\n-\n**Cicaful ampoule** ***4.5/5 WRP***\n\n*Centella Asiatica Extract (81.44%), Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylate/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Hydroxyacetophenone*\n\nI understand you probably are sick with all the cica products dominating the market, but this ampoule was *really good* for me. This ampoule is clear and very viscous, almost like a gel but still relatively runny. As you rub it on your skin it becomes like water, and sinks in reaaally quick. I’ve heard people say this was hydrating for them, but it wasn’t *that* hydrating for me. The calming effect was *amazing* though—redness in my face can minimize as soon as a few hours after application. It felt cooling and very soothing to the skin. Though I would say I run out of the bottle relatively quicker than other serums haha. If you need a calming, no fuss ampoule with minimal ingredients and low breakout risk, this is definitely one to try out!\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Lotion** ***3/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Kelp Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Acmella Oleracea Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Purified Water, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Squalane (Plant-derived), Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Beta-Glucan, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide-NP, Sodium hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Pentylene Glycol*\n\nCompared to other lotions/emulsions I’ve tried, I don’t think I prefer this one. This lotion was a bit thick and holds it’s shape better when you try making it run down. It has the chamomile smell similar to the toner, but far more minimal that you really can’t smell it unless you’re trying to. It’s very moisturizing, probably enough if you use this as a moisturizer in the summer. It spreads well and you don’t need a lot to cover your entire face, but it sinks in less quick, so after using it, it feels like you’ve put a legit cream moisturizer on your face. This was *not* a bad product, but it’s probably better geared towards those with dry skin.\n\n-\n**Hyaluronic Aqua Moisturizer** ***4/5 WRP***\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Methyl Trimethicone, Methylpropanediol, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP, Copolymer, Raffinose, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate (100ppm), Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid (100ppm), Allantoin, Madecassoide, Beta-glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ethylcellulose, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Polyquaternium-51*\n\nRight off the bat, the texture surprised me. This came out as a translucent balm-like gel with no scent, like a less strong vaseline, so for those with dehydrated skin, this one is for you! I was kinda scared using it thinking it was going to be heavy, but I have been using it at night and it’s done wonders for my skin the next morning. Perhaps because my skin is dehydrated, but with this product, my skin texture really improved. As this also was not like a very emollient moisturizer, it felt like it was a layer sealing in all the serum and toner I used before and did not feel clogging at all. Honestly, this product turned out faaaaaar better than I expected!\n\n-\n\nOverall I am really impressed with the brand. None of their products broke me out, which is incredible! All in all I’d say I recommend the cleanser and the cica ampoule for all skin types, the chamomile line for dry skin types (or combo/oily in the winter) and the aqua moisturizer for dehydrated skin. I hope this review was helpful for you and have a great day!",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

Since then I’ve found some products that work really well for me and which haven’t been mentioned on this sub before, so I decided to share my shelfie and write some reviews.\n\nI'm happy to hear your opinion about the products or my routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin type**\n\nDry and sensitive, some general redness, not acne-prone.\n\nMy skin reacts to most artificial fragrances and some essential oils. \n\nI also prefer to use products with “natural” ingredients and try to avoid parabens, PEGs, micro plastic and mineral oil as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Products (from left to right):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch** \n\nINCI: AQUA, CENTAUREA CYANUS FLOWER WATER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, CETEARYL WHEAT STRAW GLYCOSIDES, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, STEARIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, TOCOPHEROL, LACTIC ACID\n\nPrice 11 € for 200ml, available at Müller drugstore in Germany\n\nThis gentle cleansing milk is one of my holy grail products. All other cleansers that I’ve tried before where either super drying and/or made me break out. This one isn’t drying at all and yet leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Only on days when I wear a lot of makeup I need to do an additional oil cleanse. I like that the formulation is not too watery, so it’s easy to spread on my face. It doesn’t have a noticeable smell. The bottle lasts a long time for me, usually over 6 months even with daily use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme**\n\nINCI: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, CERA ALBA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, KAOLIN, ZINC OXIDE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice 2 € for 50ml, available at Rossmann drugstore \n\nThis water free balm with oils and beeswax is a thick and oily formulation, similar to a cold cream. I sometimes use it on cold and dry winter days as a thin layer between my daytime moisturizer and sunscreen. I’m not sure if it truly qualifies as an occlusive cream, but in my experience it does help with preventing moisture loss in dry weather. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and when you apply too much your face is going to shine like crazy. I noticed that when I use this cream several days in a row my skin texture starts to feel a bit smoother than usual. The beeswax smell is nice too. It works well under makeup as long as you give it enough time to dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaveel  (OTC pharmacy cream, made by HEEL)**\n\nINCI: ECTOIN\\*, AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, SQUALANE, TOCOPHEROL, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, VANILLA PLANIFOLIA FRUIT EXTRACT, ALCOHOL DENAT., CARBOMER, SODIUM CARBOMER, RHIZOBIAN GUM, CORYLUS AVELLANA BARK EXTRACT, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, C12-16 ALCOHOLS, PALMITIC ACID, CERAMIDE 3\n\n\\*Since this cream is a medical product, its active ingredient (Ectoin) is listed first, even though it’s not the main ingredient.\n\nPrice about 10 € for 30ml in online pharmacies \n\nSo this is a medical product for people with neurodermatitis that was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has a thick, slightly oily consistency but doesn’t take too long to get absorbed into skin. The smell is slightly chemical. Its active ingredient, Ectoin, is supposed to protect skin cells from environmental stress factors and help with skin barrier restoration. It is also used in other products such as eye drops and nasal sprays.\n\nNow I don’t know enough about skincare to judge how solid the research behind this patented molecule is. When my skin was a bit over exfoliated a few months ago, my experience was that Dermaveel was in fact better at repairing my damaged skin barrier than other moisturizers that I tried.\n\nI only use this cream during the winter months; it’s too heavy for warm summer days, even for my dry skin. I use it as a daytime moisturizer a few times per week; I find it a bit too pricey for everyday use. Unfortunately it does sometimes pill up under my makeup foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manuka Repair Creme/Miel de Manuka Crème Réparatrice (OTC pharmacy cream, made by French brand Comptoirs & Compagnies)**\n\nINCI: MEL, AQUA, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA SEED OIL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SQUALANE,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, LEVULINIC ACID, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LEVULINATE, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice about 10 € for 40ml in online pharmacies\n\nThe reason why I bought this was simply that I really wanted to try a Manuka product. It contains 40% GMO 300 Manuka Honey. This isn’t exactly the highest GMO rating, but it’s the best price-performance ratio I could find. Despite its 40% honey content it has an average moisturizer consistency, not sticky, dries fast. The smell is amazing! Very sweet, smells of honey and beeswax.\n\nWith my dry skin I found it not hydrating enough as standalone moisturizer, though it might work for normal to oily skin. I apply this in the evening (few times a week) in combination with my usual moisturizer (TO NMF). On the next morning my skin is smooth and soft; feels slightly exfoliated and overall texture seems to be improved. Manuka honey, or honey in general, is said to have exfoliating properties. Manuka also has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects though I can’t really comment on that since I luckily don’t have any breakouts at the moment.\n\nOnce or twice I made the mistake to use the Manuka repair cream on the same evening as my AHA exfoliator- which resulted in slightly flakey skin on the next morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dado Sens Sun - Sonnencreme SPF 30**\n\nINCI: AQUA \\[WATER\\], DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE (UVINUL A PLUS) , ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE (UVINUL T 150), BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (TINOSORB S), GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE (OCTISALATE), SUCROSE PALMITATE, DISTARCH PHOSPHATE, PANTHENOL, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NON-NANO), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CANDELILLA/JOJOBA/RICE BRAN POLYGLYCERYL-3 ESTERS, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM STEAROYL LACTYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, BENZYLIDENE DIMETHOXYDIMETHYLINDANONE, ALLANTOIN, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, SODIUM ALGINATE, CALCIUM ALGINATE, GLYCINE SOJA OIL \\[SOYBEAN\\], ALUMINA, STEARIC ACID, ECTOIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE\n\nPrice 20 € for 125ml, available at Müller, Douglas\n\nThis is my favourite sunscreen ever! Definitely a holy grail candidate. Sunscreens have always been a bit problematic for me, for two reasons: 1: I need to use a product without acrylates, which unfortunately are an ingredient in nearly every sunscreen formulation ever.  2: I’m a bit picky about sunscreen filters; I’d rather not use problematic filters like Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone and Homosalate. And now I finally found something that works for me!\n\nDado Sens Sonnencreme SPF 30 has a thick, creamy consistency, perfect for my dry skin but it is probably too much for oily skin. There is no noticeable white cast, however I’m pale as ghost anyway, so results might be different for darker skin tones. It leaves a small amount of shine but I’m not too bothered by this. Smell is slightly chemical (different from usual sunscreen smell) but not very strong.\n\nThe downsides are that it has only SPF 30 and contains alcohol. I don’t find it drying though. What I like best about it is that it has great filters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ARGININE, ASPARTIC ACID, GLYCINE, ALANINE, SERINE, VALINE, ISOLEUCINE, PROLINE, THREONINE, HISTIDINE, PHENYLALANINE, GLUCOSE, MALTOSE, FRUCTOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, UREA, ALLANTOIN, LINOLEIC ACID, OLEIC ACID, PHYTOSTERYL CANOLA GLYCERIDES, PALMITIC ACID, STEARIC ACID, LECITHIN, TRIOLEIN, TOCOPHEROL, CARBOMER, ISOCETETH-20, POLYSORBATE 60, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIETHANOLAMINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN\n\nPrice 10 € for 100ml, available at Douglas\n\nI actually don’t want to write too much about this one, there are already tons of reviews on this sub. It has fairly good INCIs, doesn’t dry or break me out and is cheap – that’s all that I want in a moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), LACTIC ACID, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, TASMANNIA LANCEOLATA FRUIT/LEAF EXTRACT, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, XANTHAN GUM, ISOCETETH-20, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPrice 7 € for 30ml, available at Douglas\n\nThis is the first acid exfoliator I ever bought, so I can’t really compare it to other products. After a short purging period it got rid of the tiny closed comedones I had all over my face within about 6 weeks.  I like it a lot and use it about twice per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeless Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum**\n\nINCI: WATER, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS, GLYCERIN, HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL 3000™, BENZYLALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nThis is usually not available in Europe. I found it at my local TK Maxx store for 10 €. Bought it because I wanted to try Vitamin C. The lightweight, watery formulation is nice. It doesn’t have any noticeable smell.\n\nI’ve been using this for 8 weeks now and don’t really see any difference. When it’s empty I’m probably going to replace it with a more potent Vitamin C product from The Ordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Salthouse Totes Meer Therapie - Beruhigende Maske Akut** (Picture only shows lower half of sachet)\n\nINCI: AQUA, CELLULOSE GUM, GLYCERIN, PANTHENOL, PROPANEDIOL, MARIS SAL (DEAD SEA SALT), PROPYLENE GLYCOL, MAYTENUS MACROCARPA (CHUCHUHUASI) BARK EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL ALCOHOL\n\nPrice 1.25€ for 2x7ml, available at DM drugstore\n\nThis is a gel mask with Dead Sea salt and other calming ingredients. It calms down irritated skin and reduces redness. Most of the time it doesn’t completely get rid of the redness, but there is a visible difference. A hydrating, oil free formulation which I think is suitable for all skin types. The smell is slightly sweet but otherwise neutral. As usual, one of those “single-use” sachets is enough for at least three applications. It’s currently not a permanent part of my routine, but I use it whenever my skin gets irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schaebens Augen & Lippen Maske**\n\nINCI: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, DIISOSTEAROYL POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIMER DILINOLEATE, GLYCERIN, CERA ALBA, ZINC STEARATE, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCINE SOJA OIL, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA WATER, PANTHENOL, RETINYL PALMITATE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, UBIQUINONE, ALCOHOL, BENZOIC ACID, CITRAL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LACTIC ACID, LIMONENE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBIC ACID\n\nPrice 0.60€ for 4x1.5ml, available at DM, Rossmann\n\nThis is the only product with essential oils that I put on my face. It works surprisingly well for my sensitive skin. Even though it is advertised as an eye-and–lip mask and the instructions say to take it off after 10 mins., I use it as an overnight leave on mask for my whole face.\n\nIn the morning my skin feels plump and well hydrated. The mask reduces very fine lines overnight. Not permanently of course, but the effect does last at least a day for me.\n\nWhen I use this mask everyday my pores start to clog up after a while, so I make sure to not use it too frequently. 2 or 3 times a week is completely fine though. It’s also super cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n**AM**\n\n\\-wash face with water\n\n\\- moisturizer: either TO NMF or Dermaveel\n\n\\- on cold days:  Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme\n\n\\- sunscreen: Dado Sens  Sun Sonnencreme SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n\\- Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch\n\n\\- one of the following:\n\n* TO NMF\n* TO LA 5% + TO NMF\n* Timeless HAC Serum + TO NMF\n* Manuka Repair Creme + TO NMF\n* Schaebens Augen und Lippen Maske as leave on overnight mask on whole face",

Obviously, I was eager to try this out, especially since I was unfamiliar with Ultru as a K-beauty brand.\n\nFor some background, I have combination, sensitive, acne-prone skin. I tend to get a little oily in the summer and VERY dry in the winter. I have a lot of hyperpigmentation on my chin from moderate cystic acne, and my acne gets VERY painful and red.\n\nI used this mask as my sheet mask step after an AHA/BHA chemical peel I usually use weekly. I rarely sheet mask (I feel bad about the waste and have found very few that actually deliver results), but was pleasantly surprised by this one. The \"jelly\" is a great consistency and really soaks the mask without any drip (a huge bonus). Just wearing this felt like cooling heaven on my skin, especially after a chemical exfoliant. There is a TON of jelly left over in the packet after masking, so I will use this as a serum for the next few days. The back of the package also says it can be used on the rest of your body, if you like.\n\nI find that I prefer to rinse my face lightly after using masks like this, so I followed that protocol in this case. After removing this mask, my skin felt so dewy and moisturized. The morning after my skin looked like it was glowing, especially on my cheeks and cheekbones! I rarely see immediate results from a sheet mask, but this one really surprised me. Love it!\n\nAs for the ingredients list, it looks pretty typically like many Korean jelly masks you might find on the market. The notable ingredients were centella asiatica extract, chamomilla recutita flower extract, brassica oleracea italica (broccoli) sprout extract, and bambusa vulgaris leaf extract. There are fragrance and limonene listed as the last two ingredients, but I noticed the smell to be mild. Just something to keep in mind for those who don't do well with fragrance.\n\nIf you're looking for a new sheet mask, I'd recommend this one for helping with inflammation and reintroducing moisture after exfoliating. From some quick research online, it looks like these retail for about $4 a mask, which is on the pricier side.\n\nLet me know if you've tried the soothing mask or any of the other I'm Sorry for My Skin masks, and what you thought about it!",

I had mentioned this in a Rant/Raves thread a few weeks back and I'm now at a point where i can give a full review of the **Clinique Even Better Brightening Moisture Mask.**\n\nMy skin is normal and tends to lean a bit on the dry side according to the weather. This is the first \"moisturizing mask\" that I've ever used. It retails for $36 and has 3.4 fl oz (100 ml) of product.\n\nIt has an exhaustive ingredient list. From nourishing, moisturizing ingredients like Sweet almond oil, squalene, capric tryglycerides, Glyceryl Stearate and cetearyl alcohol to antioxidants and anti-irritants like Chamomile flower extract,  Birch bark, chinese skullcap, cucumber, apple, barley and turmeric  extracts to name a few. I confess that this list is what attracted my attention and made me buy this product. *However, that also increases the allergic potential for sensitive skins so patch-testing is must!*\n\nIngredients: http://imgur.com/90bSA4K\n\n**How i use it:**\n\nI have been using this thrice a week since almost two months, roughly about a big pea-size for my face. It is pretty thick coming out of the tube and a bit difficult to apply. I spread a thin layer all over my face,  let it rest for about 20 seconds and then massage lightly all over my face. The body heat helps to spread it easily and evenly. Clinique advises to keep it on for 10 mins but I'm quite happy to break this rule :D I keep it on for about 45 mins to an hour and wash my face gently after the time is up.\n\nNow onto the **Performance:**\n\nIt is an excellent mask if you have dry, dehydrated or even normal skin. It gets absorbed completely and makes my skin supple. It gives my face that well-rested look.\n\nThe thing that I'm most excited to share with you all though is the effect this mask had on inflammation due to acne. I had a  hormonal breakout some time back and used this mask everyday for four days and the inflammation subsided much quicker than it normally does. Raised cysts flattened out quickly and it took care of redness like nobody's business. Needless to say, it did not aggravate my acne, nor did it give rise to any new ones.\n\nMakeup goes on exceedingly well after i use this; no dry patches, no redness at all. And did i mention how little is required every time? I reckon it's gonna last me ages, making it pretty cost-effective.\n\n\n**Tl;dr:** I love this mask. It goes above and beyond what it claims to do. It nourishes, moisturizes, plumps, calms and gives me that lit-from-within glow. It has become my HG mask and with the winter approaching, I'm sure I'm gonna love it even more.\n\n Let me know if I've missed something! :)",

I need some basic 101 explanation on tret vs adapalene vs tazarotene since I’m being super confused. Always thought tret is the holy grail but now I’m seeing that adapalene and tazarotene are more potent with less side effects? Plus I don’t understand how in my country 🇵🇱tret and adapalene are prescription only but somehow you can get tazarotene 0.1% in a regular drugstore chain. It says it’s a spot treatment only. Can please someone verify if I can use it as an anti aging treatment and on my quite acne prone skin (not big acne but lots of small closed comedones) ?\n\nIs this product an actual anti aging treatment you’ve all been talking about? If so, then how to use it as an anti aging and anti breakout treatment? \n\nPrice of this particular product on the pic is 110 PLN ~ 26 EUR\n\nthank you all for your help, energy and time! \n\nOnce again, I wanna send hugs of appreciation cause I’ve learned a lot from you on this sub!

        "body": "I have no idea why tazarotene is OTC in PL. It's probably more to do with Boderm product than tazarotene itself. It's prescription only in the US, which is where they also did the majority of its clinical studies. The reason why tret is considered the HG is because it has been clinically studied the most, i.e. its efficacy has been demonstrated for decades. Plus, it's widely available and its formulation has come a looong way. Now, when it comes to effectiveness, you have to consider both the drug's effectiveness and irritation. If a drug is effective, but it irritates the hell out of your skin, the overall effect will not be as good and you will be less likely to continue with the treatment consistently (they take at elast 3 months of consistent use to see the result). The example is tazarotene, which is apparently very irritating to use (at least as observed in the clinical studies), so people are less likely to stick to it, and thus it seems less effective than, say, tretinoin, on paper, even though it should be more effective theoretically. In short, you need to take your skin into account. Is your skin dry? sensitive? have you used other active (bezoyl peroxide, salycilic acid, etc) before? What is your skin concerns? Do you have a solid skin routine? This is why for young people with mild acne, adapalene is often recommended. It's less irritating. The formulation is usually more moisturising. And 0.1% is apparently as effective as tret 0.025%.\n\nHAVING SAID ALL THAT, you really have to experiment to find the best combo for you, I'm afraid. Again, it depends on your skin's sensitivity, your exisiting skin routine, your access to what's available. Don't just go for the trend or people's anecdote, your skin is different. Also, formulation makes a massive difference. People's experiences vary. Some prefer a moisturising, cream formulation. Some prefer a gel. I have done both and have gone through A LOT of different forumation and strength and even though my skin liked 0.1% tretinoin gel a couple of years back, now I stick with the Boderm tazarotene. I'm pretty sure that the Boderm formulation makes the tazarotene tolerable and less irritating, though this is purely my experience and at this point I'm using it for skin overall texture rather than acne.\n\nSo, I'd recommend adapalene or tret for a beginner any day over tazarotene, unless you cannot get to adapalene or tret. If your major concern is acne or hyperpigmentation, go for adapalene or tret (which are backed up by more clinical studies.)",

    "body": "**Rovectin Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion**\n\nAnother Eunice favorite! I’m so sorry if this is getting too repetitive…all I can say is that the majority of my routine from the last month or so has been inspired by her. So, get ready for a few more reviews of products I selected after watching her videos.\n\nI ended up incorporating the Rovectin Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion into my routine a few days after the Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser from the same line. I didn’t think there would be any issue with them clashing in my routine…but I wanted to give the cleanser a bit of time to do its thing (and check for any bad reactions) before adding the Treatment Lotion.\n\nThis is a product that can be used as a toner, essence, or even lightweight serum/ampoule depending on how you want to work it into your routine. The consistency of this product is quite thick…so some people may find it more comfortable to use later on than others. Personally, I started using this product as a toner…but ended up swapping it with the I’m From Mugwort Essence as that product is lighter and more comfortable to put on underneath (for me).\n\nFeatured ingredients here include 7 different forms of Hyaluronic Acid, Niacimamide, Caffeine, Panthenol, Licorice Root Extract, Chamomile Flower Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, and Papaya Fruit Extract. This viscous toner/essence/whatever you want it to be (LOL) is free from alcohol, synthetic fragrance, and essential oils. \n\nRight out of the gate I knew this product would be something unique. The slightly heavy/thick consistency is really interesting…shaking the bottle to catch air bubbles in the formula is kind of fun LOL! Just from the looks of it I was reminded of the Klairs Supple Preparation Toner. And the similarities don’t stop there (we’ll get to it).\n\nApplication is what you would expect…just a few drops of this product into the palm of the hand to be patted in. Then, continue to layer as you see fit. I ended up only being able to handle two layers of this super hydrating product before my skin was totally drenched. A little really does go a long way with this product. \n\nWith the seven forms of Hyaluronic Acid I expected this product to be thoroughly hydrating and hold on to moisture really well. And, it totally lived up to that expectation. After each use my skin was left feeling deeply hydrated…but the larger forms of Hyaluronic Acid that stayed closer to the surface seemed to hold onto hydration from serums. After a layer of moisturizer on top…my skin just felt so thoroughly hydrated and plump. Not a small feat while on Tretinoin. \n\nIn addition to the heavy dose of hydration…I was honestly shocked to see a reduction of redness/irritation as well as some mild brightening from this product. The addition on Caffeine, Niacinamide, and calming extracts really did work here and wasn’t a gimmick (in my opinion). True to their roots/mission…Rovectin seems to have created a product that delivers for people suffering from intense redness, dryness, and irritation. \n\nOne of the reasons I decided to work this product into my routine when I did was because I started Curology/Tretinoin not too lang afterwards. I wanted my skin to be in as hydrated/prepped of a state as possible. I think the Rovectin Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion really helped to bring me there and keep my skin relatively happy considering all that I have been hitting it with LOL!\n\nThe only knock I have against this product is the slight sticky/tacky feeling that I noticed after application. Even though the Klairs Supple Preperation Toner only has one form of Hyaluronic Acid…the consistencies of the products are similar and I found Klairs’ offering to absorb and just feel nicer on the skin after application. It’s not a deal breaker (I found the stickiness to totally go away after applying serum/moisturizer)…but those trying to compare the two may want to take note. \n\nI love the Rovectin Skin Essentials Activating treatment Lotion. It was such a key player in keeping my skin happy and hydrated over the last month or so. I prefer the finish of the Klairs Supple Preparation Toner…but I have to pick the Rovectin Lotion as the ultimate winner for its more robust/hydration focused formula and the addition of redness reducing ingredients. I’ve tried both the original and unscented versions of the Klairs SP Toner but still find Rovectin to be a step above. \n\nJust like the Rovectin Conditioning Cleanser…I think all skin types will play well with this product. But, those who are battling frequent redness, irritation, or dryness will really be impressed with the abilities/results here. I’ll be keeping one of these on hand as I continue to use Curology…but I’m looking forward to switching to a more watery toner. I love my “7-skins method” and have missed layering and layering a nice/cooling toner.\n\nFull Ingredients List: WATER, GLYCERIN, METHYL GLUCETH-20, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, NIACINAMIDE, SORBITOL, ADENOSINE, CAFFEINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ALLANTOIN, PANTHENOL, ARGININE, HYALURONIC ACID, GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA (LICORICE) ROOT EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA (MATRICARIA) FLOWER EXTRACT, CENTELLA ASIATICA EXTRACT, GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) SPROUT EXTRACT, CARICA PAPAYA (PAPAYA) FRUIT EXTRACT, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, SODIUM PCA, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM POLYGLUTAMATE, HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYALURONATE, HYDROLYZED HYALURONIC ACID, SODIUM ACETYLATED HYALURONATE, POTASSIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, DISODIUM EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $29.00.

    "body": "So... I have pretty persistent rosacea/facial redness. My face can be like 4-5 shades darker/redder than my neck. I have tons of errythmea in like every part of my face too. Most of the time, I look super sunburnt, even with regular sunscreen/AHA/essence use.\n\nI already use niacinamide (Deciem 10% Niacinamide, plus the niacinamide in the Elta MD UV Clear sunscreen) as well as some brightening products (CosRX Galactomyces Essence, Benton Snail Bee Essence). None of them seem to really do anything for redness at all.\n\nThe ONLY 2 products that have ever made a difference are Mizon Snail Recovery Gel (which, of course, breaks me out so I can't use it) and the Leaders Insolution AC Dressing Mask.\n\nBut holy hell, *nothing* works like Leaders. I have no idea what it does to my face. Yesterday, I was having a particularly bad bout of redness. I applied the mask and woke up with a significantly lighter skin tone, like almost matching my skin. And it has done this consistently every single time I've used it. And nothing about it breaks me out. It's by far the best mask I have ever used, and is pretty much permanent HG status for me. Unfortunately, since it's just a mask, the nice effects wear off in about a day.\n\nSo, what could be the secret HG foundation lurking in this mask? I want to find ingredients similar to this in an essence/ampoule for daily use. The ingredients list from CosDNA is below. \n\nI guess the first inclination would be the snail secretion filtrate, but then why wouldn't the Benton essence carry the same relief? I've also used the Benton Snail Bee Cream and the CoxRX 96 Snail Mucin Essence, both of which broke me out and didn't really seem to provide redness relief.\n\n> Water\n\n>Butylene Glycol\n\n>Glycerin\n\n>Acer Saccharum Extract\n\n>Betaine\n\n>Portulaca Oleracea Extract\n\n>Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract\n\n>Arnica Montana Flower Extract\n\n>Artemisia Absinthium Extract\n\n>Achillea Millefolium Extract *(NOTE: CosDNA has this as an anti-inflammatory, so maybe that's it?)*\n\n>Gentiana Lutea Root Extract\n\n>Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/\nSodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer\n\n>Snail Secretion Filtrate\n\n>Terminalia Chebula Fruit Extract\n\n>Caesalpinia sappan\t\t \t\n\n>Xanthan Gum\n\n>Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n>Ledum Palustre Extract\n\t\t \t\n>Ecklonia Cava Extract\t\n\t \t\n>Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract\n\n>Houttuynia Cordata Extract\n\n>Saururus Chinensis Extract\t\t \t\n\n>Caprylyl Glycol\n\n>Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n>Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n>Fragrance",

        "body": ">Acer Saccharum Extract\n\nThis is sugar maple, which is a natural source of AHA\n\n>Betaine\n\nThis is an anti-irritant + humectant. \n\n>Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract\n\nChamomilla recutita is German chamomile. It contains a compound called guaiazulene (or just azulene, depending on where you're looking), which is an extremely soothing, anti-irritant compound. It's actually an important component of salves used to heal bad burns. German chamomile is supposed to be incredibly useful for people that deal with redness and super sensitive skin. FYI, all chamomile is not created equal! Anthemis nobilis is *Roman* chamomile, and it's quite different! From what I know of it, it's generally used for fragrance and aromatherapy products. \n\n>Arnica Montana Flower Extract\n\nThis is leopard's bane and has antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, both of which could help calm flares.\n\n>Achillea Millefolium Extract\n\nThis is yarrow. It's somewhat anti-inflammatory and is supposed to help heal wounds more quickly, so I would assume it has some repairing properties. I don't know much about it!\n\n>Gentiana Lutea Root Extract\n\nThis is gentian, which is supposed to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n>Caesalpinia sappan\n\nI *believe* this is Indian redwood...it has compounds that inhibit melanin production and also promote wound healing. \n\n>Ecklonia Cava Extract\n\nThis is a type of Korean brown seaweed. It's antioxidant and supposed to be useful in evening out your skintone. \n\n>Houttuynia Cordata Extract\n\nAnother hefty anti-inflammatory/anti-irritant. I don't remember what its \"regular\" name is but I see it in a lot of AB products. \n\nIt may be the cocktail of ingredients as a whole that works the magic for your skin, but finding products that have any/all of these ingredients might be a good way to start your investigation! I know the Klairs line has a few products that contain guaiazulene, and I know Evercos has a mask with houttuynia cordata as its main ingredient. \n\nYou can also perform a search on CosDNA for products with an ingredient (or multiple ingredients) that you're looking for. c:",

In truth, this gift was the inspiration behind the entire cream series. Please give him a follow and check out Nivea’s expansive line of skincare products. This cream comes in a 65g polymer tube and retails for R$ 7,99. \n\nAs with most mass produced products, things like scent notes are rarely provided. The Nivea Men Sensitive Creme De Barbear smells very clean and fresh with a touch of zest to it. The scent is light to mid in strength and washes away quickly after the shave making it multi occasion approved and also multi seasonal. It is great to use and then apply your desire post shave product and/or frag without fear of interference from a lingering scent.\n\nNivea Men Sensitive Creme De Barbear is made from: Aqua, Glycerin, Myristic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-8, Alba Wax, Parfum, Maris Sal, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Oleic Acid, Maltodextrin, Acrylates Copolymer, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Arachidic Acid, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Trisodium EDTA. Using about an almond size amount will yield enough lather for a three pass shave. Using a damp but not soaking wet brush and the slow addition of water will make plenty of lather which will look like sour cream. The primary slickness of this cream is very good and the residual slickness is good. I took care to not overbuff without visible lather present. Post shave is below average as compared to the huge artisan soap market bases. A post shave product feels like a must when using this cream. Given my experience with this cream, the ShaveScore for is a 75. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Nivea Men Sensitive Creme De Barbear (gift)\n* Brush - Mocek \"Green Tea\" (purchased)\n* Razor - Blackland Razors Vector (gift) \n* Post - Aqua Velva (purchased)  \n ",

Then, I massage the lather into my Skin for 1-2 minutes…making sure to do a gentle yet thorough job of cleansing. Then, I rinse with warm water.\n\nWhy I Use It: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After having such a positive experience with the Facial Mist and slowly becoming more interested in “Clean” Skincare/Sustainable Packaging…I began collecting the rest of the Youth To The People Line. This Cleanser was particularly interesting as the version I have was for Pride Month. All of the proceeds for these Limited Edition Cleansers went to the support of GLSEN…an organization dedicated to safe and inclusive education for LGBTQ students (up to $50,000 USD). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aside from that, Youth To The People in particular has some really long Product Names…but they totally draw me in. Seeing Ingredients like Kale and Spinach was intriguing to me.\n\nOverall Review:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* When I first used this Cleanser I immediately thought “Okay, I can just go ahead and give away/sell all of the other Cleansers in my Stash…shut it all down…we have a winner.” LOL! I wish I could say that I wasn’t totally impressed by this Product immediately so as not to seem biased…but here we are. Let’s dig in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Some of the initial things that I liked were the packaging and size of this Cleanser. The glass bottle will be SUPER easy to re-use for another Product like Hand Wash or something. And, even though this Cleanser is a bit pricey at first glance…the amount you pay per OZ is actually much less than some of my other favorite Cleansers (the Peach & Lily Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser and Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Cleanser come to mind). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The consistency and feel of this Cleanser isn’t necessarily “mind blowing” by any means. It looks and feels a lot like a basic Gel Cleanser. But, although this is a gentle/low pH Product…it lathers up quite nicely and holds that lather throughout the cleansing process. Many gentle Cleansers like this offer little to no lather or one that dissipates really quickly. I’ve learned to love the no lather way of life…but its nice to find a Product that is gentle and gives me that foamy satisfaction LOL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As for the Formula…thats where things get extra interesting. Panthenol makes it pretty high on the Ingredients List followed by Vitamin E, Ascorbic Acid, Kale Leaf Extract, Spinach Leaf Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Chamomile Flower Extract, Alfalfa Extract, and Aloe Leaf Extract. There are of course various texturizes and preservatives…but the concentration of them seems pretty low with a bigger focus on the Featured Ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What really surprised me about this Cleanser is the focus on hydration/nourishment…which is almost as key as the cleansing when you look at the Ingredients List. And I totally found this to be the case as I used it. This Cleanser is honestly one of the most hydrating and gentle ones I have tried. I have to say it is at least on par with the Peach & Lily Power Calm Gel Cleanser…but maybe just slightly more intense. After each cleanse my Skin feels soft and almost dewy…like I’ve just used a hydrating Serum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aside from that...the “Superfood” Extracts in this Formula are also surprise winners. I typically don’t put too much stock into soothing, anti-oxidant, or brightening Ingredients when they are included in Cleansers. This is a Product that is washed off of the face rather quickly…so those Ingredients don’t have a ton of time to do their magic. However, over time I did notice an overall brightening effect from using this Cleanser (along with the other Youth To The People Products). I cant say specifically that this Cleanser alone made it happen…but I have to think it didn’t hurt. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* By the second or third week of using this Superfood Cleanser…I was hooked. The incredibly refreshing scent of “cut greenery” is probably one of the best around…all without Synthetic Fragrance. This in addition to the results I was seeing and I was really happy I decided to give this Product (and Brand) a try.\n\nSo thats it, I love it, love it, love it. It comes in a bottle I want, its a relatively decent value compared to other Cleansers/Brands in this category, and its probably the most gentle and hydrating Cleanser I have used second to the Peach & Lily Power Calm Gel Cleanser. But, I have to give this Superfood Cleanser a couple of bonus points for all of the antioxidant rich, brightening, and soothing Ingredients. Peach & Lily’s Cleanser is also quite calming…but I think I just saw more “in your face” improvement to my Skin with the Superfood Cleanser supporting the rest of my Routine.\n\nThis is a Product that I would absolutely recommend to all Skin Types as it was super gentle yet offered enough of a cleanse that I think those with Combination/Oily Skin will get along with it just fine. That plus the addition of hydration and antioxidants makes this a real winner to me. I know I said I’m ready to say goodbye to the rest of my Water based Cleanser Stash…but you know I cant do that LOL! I’ll continue to try/Review but I’m keeping a back-up bottle of this Youth To The People Cleanser on hand at all times!\n\nThings To Note:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I just wanted to give you all a quick Per OZ price breakdown of my top three Water Based Cleansers to give a better idea of the “value” I saw in this Youth To The People Product:\n\nYouth To The People Superfood Cleanser: $4.50 USD Per OZ (as priced on their website)\n\nSulwhasoo Snowise Brightening Cleanser: $7.72 USD Per OZ (as priced on YesStyle)\n\nPeach & Lily Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser: $8.28 Per OZ (as priced on their website)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater (Aqua), Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Butylene Glycol, Brassica Oleracea (Kale) Leaf Extract, Spinacia Oleracea (Spinach) Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Natural Fragrance, Lecithin, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Chlorophyll\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3r7jttoe39p41.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc83beec429adbdf289f87ad9a3facccf90897ad",

Even with that, L-AA will start oxidizing fairly quickly, so it wouldn't be a bad idea to just make it weekly. \n\nBe careful with using citrus oils in skincare. They contain compounds that are phototoxic and you will get sunburned so much faster. They're also highly concentrated, so you'd have to make like an ounce of product per 1 drop of oil. I used to add Frankincense EO to my face cream and even at 2 drops/oz, it destroyed my moisture barrier. \n\nI make my own every day, but I just mix ascorbic acid powder with Hada Labo Gokujyun.

There seems to be no Minox in there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: \"Skrzypovita Serum Pro\", because of all the downvotes here you have it holy xd\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story is below the Ingredients. It's the same Ingredient order as on the package.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Propylene Glycol, Propanediol, Arginine, Lactic Acid, Glycine Soja Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycerin, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Lamium Album Extract, Salvia Officinalis Leaf Extract, Pinus Sylvestris Bud Extract, Nasturtium Officinale Extract, Arctium Majus Root Extract, Citrus Limon Peel Extract, Hedera Helix Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tropaeolum Majus Flower Extract, Urtica Dioica Leaf Extract, Betula Alba Leaf Extract, Equisetum Arvense Extract, Actinidia Chinensis Fruit Extract, Cucumis Sativus Fruit Extract, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Biotin, Glycoproteins, Ethoxydiglycol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Pyridoxine HCI, Panthenol, Zinc Chloride, Acetyl Cysteine, Glutamine, Methionine, Saccharomyces Lysate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylalycerin. Tetrasodium EDTA, Sodium Lactate\n\nSo my Dad is 90% bald on the top with little small hair in the crownarea and some on the front between the temples. Huge donorarea tho. He has been like this for the last 20 years. But somehow he just noticed like a year ago that he went bald lol when I complained about my own hair. Even his ID 10 years ago shows him being in the same state as he is now.So he bought some random shampoo's and gave up on them. But he keeps using a \"serum\" which is just advertised in my land. And two weeks ago he said, \"my hair is getting back\" and my Mom agreed that he is really growing some hairs.I ignored it knowing how hard it actually is to get it back after spending thousand of hours reading about hairloss.But I remember checking his scalp from time to time, just cuz fkit I'm balding and wanted to see what I will end up with ok xd. And he is getting more hairs, his crownarea is of course thin af, but there are more hairs then some months ago.The package of the product says the same thing that we know from Minox. \"Takes 2-4months of use to see any difference and that it puts hairs into the anagen phase and keeps them there for longer period of time. Reduces hairloss up to 60%\"But there is no minox in here so what could be the reason it's doing any work?\n\nI buzzed my hair yesterday, thinking to try it out cuz I've lost the fight anyway. But I don't want to put something up there when I've no idea what it is for the rest of my days.",

So far everything’s thriving and I’ve never gotten sick in 6 years of this. I also never store my water for any amount of time, even in winter I make sure the hoses stay clear and shunt everything onto the land. My philosophy is that the pathogens that the greywater contains, if it’s not allowed to sit for any amount of time and reproduce, are going into hostile territory when they reach the soil and will get promptly eliminated by either the sun or other microbes. I also wash produce thoroughly (with the water going back into the yard) and prefer cooking or fermenting vegetables, so that probably helps too.

    "body": "[Here](http://imgur.com/a/e6QUI) is my B&A right off the bat. \n\nSkin type: VERY oily, VERY sensitive and acne-prone, VERY prone to scarring and redness.\n\nMy skincare journey thanks to SCA has been completely life-changing mind-boggling. Just 4 months ago my routine was Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser and 1% Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Lotion in the morning, and Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser and Epiduo at night. No sunscreen, no moisturizer... I've always had a multitude of issues, but since I wasn't getting cystic breakouts anymore thanks to Epiduo, that was good enough for me at the time. \n\nIN A NUTSHELL: Back in April I used Dr. Bronner's Tea Tree Castile Liquid soap to wash my face at my sister's recommendation. I thought hey, it's supposedly all-natural, seemed like there wouldn't be a huge chance of it breaking me out if I just used it once. \n\nMy face IMMEDIATELY dried out so badly, I couldn't crack a smile. And here I am with NO MOISTURIZER. I slapped on some Clindamycin lotion and hoped for the best.\n\nI woke up the next morning with the beginnings of 3 cystic pimples alongside my nose (my first in a year and a half!), closed comedones all over my nose and forehead, open comedones all over my chin, and suddenly my prescriptions seriously BURNED to put on when they hadn't before. \n\nAaaaaaaaand that's when I decided to start frequenting SCA! \n\nOn to Paula's Choice Pore-Reducing Toner:\n\nI seriously owe you guys one--I never would have ever tried out, or probably ever heard of PC if I hadn't seen her recommended all over this sub. I went on a bit of a sample-size frenzy on her website one day and started patch-testing them one by one. One sample in particular gave me results in the 1 spot of my chin I tested it on in just 4 days: the SKIN BALANCING PORE-REDUCING TONER.\n\nDoes it actually reduce pores?? Not really. But here are just a few of the ingredients: Niacinamide!!!, Glycerin, Burdock Root Extract, Chamomile Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed jojoba esters, and CERAMIDES, woo.\n\nSince using it regularly all over my face, starting only two weeks ago:    \n*The closed comedones on my chin and nose have all gone away.  \n*The redness leftover from the cysts by my nose and the breakouts on my chin are so faded it is SCARY  \n*My skin no longer burns when I apply Epiduo or my sunscreen that I'm now using every day  \n*My face in general is less red and doesn't look shiny after just 2 hours anymore??? Like I can sleep a full 8 hours, look in the mirror the next morning and I DON'T look like a stoplight. That is huge for me.  \n\nSo ummmmmmmmm TL;DR: Try out this toner if you have skin that sounds like mine was. Seriously. Or if you just want niacinamide and ceramides without any fatty alcohols.\n\nThe rest of my 100% SCA-inspired routine for anyone interested:\n\nAM:  \n*I put on a mask of raw honey and grapeseed oil and let it sit for 5 minutes while I eat breakfast/drink coffee. This keeps my skin moisturized and calm the WHOLE DAY.  \n*Wash off the mask with water + charcoal konjac sponge  \n*PC Pore-Reducing Toner  \n*Neutrogena Clear Face SPF 55 (This is just OK. It doesn't break me out and dries matte. I'm trying out physical sunscreens but haven't found one I like yet!)  \n*Makeup, usually just bareMinerals foundation and mineral veil.  \n\nPM:   \n*Paula's Choice Earthsourced Perfectly Natural Gel Cleanser, my only other purchase based on the sample-frenzy I went on and ANOTHER REALLY REALLY GREAT PRODUCT.  \n*PC Pore-Reducing Toner again.  \n*Epiduo  \n*Cetaphil moisturizer in the tub.  \n\nTHE END!",

I just started Epiduo last week, and all my moisturizers burn now. How long have you been using Epiduo? And does the Cetaphil burn or irritate your face now? I've read that Epiduo will irritate your skin for the first few weeks, and my face is indeed very red and dry right now. I want to slather lotion all over my face but it burns! How long was it before you could use the Cetaphil and not have it burn like crazy?",

I know, it is wasn't the best routine, but weirdly enough, it worked great. \n\nFast forward about two years and I made a full switch to Cruelty Free products in both makeup and skincare. \n\nAnd my skin is a trainwreck. \n\nI used this subreddit for help and took some advice I found. \n\nI switched to a toner and not an astringent. \nI used squeeze bottle style gentle morning face washes and a moisturizer.\nAt night I used the toner and a moisturizer. \n\nI tried different brands and stayed on each for about 6-8 weeks. \n\nNone worked. \n\nMy face is an oily, acne-ridden, mess. On good days, it's just my T-zone that is oily. On bad days, my entire face is just an oil spill. \n\nI use to only get small blackheads around my nose and an occasional big guy on my chin or forehead around when I was PMSing. \n\nNow...I have one to three painful nodules pr papules on my chin at a time. Lots of closed comedones and a handful of small blackheads. \n\nThe rest of my face has small blackheads, closed comedones, and a few papules as well. \n\nI wash my face after I workout. I stay hydrated. I wash my sheets regularly. I sleep with my hair pulled back. I've tried everything. \n\nI have no idea what to do. I'm at my wits end. I don't want to go back to Non-Cruelty Free products, but this isn't even about vanity, my face is painful some days from the acne. \n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for products or a routine to save my skin?\n\nInfo on products and skin:\nI currently use a micellar water in the mornings and after workouts and moisturizer.\nIn the evenings I use Thayers Astringent Witch Hazel pads and moisturizer.

My Skin has started to look slightly congested…and thats probably due to me forgetting/not having time for my Peach & Lily Super Reboot Resurfacing Mask this past week. Both of these Sheet Masks are geared towards clearing/purifying the Skin…but are of two totally different consistencies. They have been in my Stash since Summer 2018 and I’m really excited to give them a try. Here we go!\n\nTony Moly Earth Beauty Bubble Mask Sheet - Bubble Peeling:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Ah Bubble Masks...such an odd bird (for me lol!). I have used a few different Bubble Masks and have one found one (from Celderma (check out the Review if you haven’t) that I actually liked. All of the others have left my Skin feeling super dry and tight. Also, some of them only cover the bottom half of the Face…which I don’t really get. Some Featured Ingredients for this Mask include a Charcoal Infused Mask Sheet, Anise Fruit Extract, Lavender Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Papaya Fruit Extract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* This Tony Moly Bubble Mask falls into the “I don’t get it.” Category for me unfortunately. The Mask only covers the Cheek, Chin, and Nose Areas but left my Forehead to fend for itself lol! Also, the Cotton Type Mask Material was super silky and thin. This would be great for any other Mask but with the addition on the slippery/gel-like Bubble Essence…it made it very difficult to get this Sheet Mask on and situated. I barely had time to line the Mask up with my Mouth and Nose before it began bubbling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After about 3 min with this Bubble Peeling Mask on I felt me Skin start to tingle/itch and generally become a bit irritated. Luckily, this Mask only needed to be kept on for 5-10 min…so I opted for 7. After removal, I massaged the Excess Bubble Essence into my Skin with warm water to create a typical Cleansing Lather. After that, I rinsed fully with more water. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Although I didn’t notice any redness or irritation (which was great considering how this Tony Moly Mask felt while it was on)…the typical dryness/tightness that I have experienced with other Bubble Masks was immediately apparent. I mean honestly for me, Bubble Masks seem to just be Sheet Masks coated in harsh Cleansing Products…I haven’t really found one that blew me away or seemed worth the time/effort. \n\nTony Moly Earth Beauty Mud Mask Sheet - Mud Peeling:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* This type of Sheet Mask is totally new to me and the one I was most excited to try! Based on the Instructions I was super curious about the application process and removal. This is a Two Piece Sheet Masks that is coated in Mud. Other Ingredients in the Mud Formula include Niacinamide, Betula Alba Juice, Chamomile Flower Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, Purslane Extract, Aloe Leaf Extract, Volcanic Ash, and Hydrolyzed Collagen. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Applying this Mask was actually much easier than I anticipated. The “Mud Essence” lol…is not super thick or sticky at all, and I found that I could handle the Mask without too much getting on my Hands. But, once this Mask it on…IT IS ON! The Mud really helps the Mask adhere to the Skin…making re-adjusting after application an issue. The Mud Essence actually has a slight Floral Scent that I likes. An good thing I liked it, because the Instructions say that this Only Moly Mud Peeling Mask needs to be left on for 40 min!!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As this Mud Mask began to dry…it hardened like any other Wash Off Style Mud Mask. But, the addition of the Mask Material added an interesting rigidness. I didn’t mind it necessarily…it just made things like talking and sipping water extra difficult. I ended up having to find a Straw lol! One the Mask fully dried it felt a lot like a Nose Pre Strip…except across my Entire Face. I was concerned that removing this Sheet Mask was going to be painful process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* It ended up not being that bad…but peeling the Mask off of my Forehead was a little intense. After rinsing the bit of Excess Mud…wow! My Skin felt SUPER SOFT and didn’t seem as dry as I expected. Also, the redness from a blemish on my Cheek was almost completely gone!\n\nUsing these two Tony Moly Peeling Masks was actually kind of fun! Other than my issues with Bubble Masks…the whole experience was different and interesting. But, I doubt I’ll be purchasing either of these Sheet Masks again. I just haven’t found the value of Bubble Masks. And, although I liked the results from the Mud Peeling Mask…I just don’t know if I would be willing to wait the 40+ min to allow the Mask to dry. Most other traditional Wash Off Clay Masks I have used take around half the time to do their thing…and a few of them offer much better results.\n\nI’ll keep an Eye out for other Mud Based Sheet Masks to try…but I think this Tony Moly Bubble Mask will be the last of its kind in my Stash. I picked these up at my local Ulta Store for $6.00 USD each…but it looks like they are no longer available from their Site. They can be found elsewhere…Amazon has them listed for around $6.50 USD. I’ll happily welcome/try any Bubble Masks that come in future Facetory Boxes, but outside of that I think its time for me to part ways with this style of Sheet Mask lol!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1wbt86dcv4m41.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36dfe02bab9db912a8b6a5df94957338bfd59d19",

I use a good water resistant 50+ SPF (WB) under my makeup but want to step it up during the day as summer approaches. I want something which will sit well over my makeup for retouching during the day and have found this product although cannot find a lot of information on it.

    "body": "**Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water**\n\nCleansing waters are kind of a new category for me. I used the Neogen Real Cica Micellar Cleansing Water back in May which was my first ever. So, I don’t have a ton to go off of when it comes to comparisons. And for the most part...that product from Neogen and the Essenherb Cleansing Water were pretty similar in application and cleansing.\n\nThe Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water features coconut based surfactants that help to remove impurities like makeup and sunscreen. I tend to use cleansing waters in the AM in place of an oil cleanser or even water/foaming cleanser if I’m feeling particularly lazy lol. I also found them to be helpful in the PM when removing sunscreen from the eye area when an oil cleanser might cause stinging/blurring if put too close to the eyes.\n\nFeatured ingredients include Tea Tree Leaf Extract, Anise Fruit Extract, Tea Tree Leaf Oil, Centella Asiatica Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Chamomile Flower Extract, Peppermint and Aloe Extract also make the list.\n\nYou could probably guess...the scent here is of tea tree lol! It’s something that I find refreshing but does remind me of the acne focused skincare I used in my teens. I could see some people not liking it too much.\n\nAs a cleansing water...this product performed just fine for me. I found it to do a decent job of removing excess oil/sebum from the night before and I never really noticed any residue left behind. It just...did its job lol! \n\nBut, one ingredient that makes it fairly high on the list that I didn’t mention is Witch Hazel. Even though I don’t have a ton of personal experience with this ingredient...I know there are people that avoid it due to its potential drying/astringent effect.\n\nI can say that over time I found the Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water to be a bit drying after use. Not much...but there was a definite difference in the feel of my skin as compared to the Neogen Cleansing Water I used earlier this year. It honestly wasn’t anything that my hydrating toner couldn’t pick up the slack for. But, those with particularly dry skin may want to proceed with caution.\n\nOverall, I didn’t hate this cleansing water. It just seems like something that is really geared towards oily/acne prone skin with its tea tree/Witch Hazel formula. While I do tend to fall into that category more often than not...I didn’t love the slightly drying effect and would much rather use something more “neutral” for this step.\n\nI look forward to continuing my “journey” into cleansing waters. I have two more in my stash that seem to be more focused on hydration/calming alongside cleansing rather than oil reduction or acne fighting. We shall see…\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\n\nWhere To Buy (Facetory $25.00 USD): https://www.facetory.com/products/essenherb-tea-tree-cleansing-water\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xypq1scchd51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff62380bf82fb4b8781bfefbabc9d865e7e84d48",

    "body": "**Rovectin Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion**\n\nAnother Eunice favorite! I’m so sorry if this is getting too repetitive…all I can say is that the majority of my routine from the last month or so has been inspired by her. So, get ready for a few more reviews of products I selected after watching her videos.\n\nI ended up incorporating the Rovectin Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion into my routine a few days after the Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser from the same line. I didn’t think there would be any issue with them clashing in my routine…but I wanted to give the cleanser a bit of time to do its thing (and check for any bad reactions) before adding the Treatment Lotion.\n\nThis is a product that can be used as a toner, essence, or even lightweight serum/ampoule depending on how you want to work it into your routine. The consistency of this product is quite thick…so some people may find it more comfortable to use later on than others. Personally, I started using this product as a toner…but ended up swapping it with the I’m From Mugwort Essence as that product is lighter and more comfortable to put on underneath (for me).\n\nFeatured ingredients here include 7 different forms of Hyaluronic Acid, Niacimamide, Caffeine, Panthenol, Licorice Root Extract, Chamomile Flower Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, and Papaya Fruit Extract. This viscous toner/essence/whatever you want it to be (LOL) is free from alcohol, synthetic fragrance, and essential oils. \n\nRight out of the gate I knew this product would be something unique. The slightly heavy/thick consistency is really interesting…shaking the bottle to catch air bubbles in the formula is kind of fun LOL! Just from the looks of it I was reminded of the Klairs Supple Preparation Toner. And the similarities don’t stop there (we’ll get to it).\n\nApplication is what you would expect…just a few drops of this product into the palm of the hand to be patted in. Then, continue to layer as you see fit. I ended up only being able to handle two layers of this super hydrating product before my skin was totally drenched. A little really does go a long way with this product. \n\nWith the seven forms of Hyaluronic Acid I expected this product to be thoroughly hydrating and hold on to moisture really well. And, it totally lived up to that expectation. After each use my skin was left feeling deeply hydrated…but the larger forms of Hyaluronic Acid that stayed closer to the surface seemed to hold onto hydration from serums. After a layer of moisturizer on top…my skin just felt so thoroughly hydrated and plump. Not a small feat while on Tretinoin. \n\nIn addition to the heavy dose of hydration…I was honestly shocked to see a reduction of redness/irritation as well as some mild brightening from this product. The addition on Caffeine, Niacinamide, and calming extracts really did work here and wasn’t a gimmick (in my opinion). True to their roots/mission…Rovectin seems to have created a product that delivers for people suffering from intense redness, dryness, and irritation. \n\nOne of the reasons I decided to work this product into my routine when I did was because I started Curology/Tretinoin not too lang afterwards. I wanted my skin to be in as hydrated/prepped of a state as possible. I think the Rovectin Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion really helped to bring me there and keep my skin relatively happy considering all that I have been hitting it with LOL!\n\nThe only knock I have against this product is the slight sticky/tacky feeling that I noticed after application. Even though the Klairs Supple Preperation Toner only has one form of Hyaluronic Acid…the consistencies of the products are similar and I found Klairs’ offering to absorb and just feel nicer on the skin after application. It’s not a deal breaker (I found the stickiness to totally go away after applying serum/moisturizer)…but those trying to compare the two may want to take note. \n\nI love the Rovectin Skin Essentials Activating treatment Lotion. It was such a key player in keeping my skin happy and hydrated over the last month or so. I prefer the finish of the Klairs Supple Preparation Toner…but I have to pick the Rovectin Lotion as the ultimate winner for its more robust/hydration focused formula and the addition of redness reducing ingredients. I’ve tried both the original and unscented versions of the Klairs SP Toner but still find Rovectin to be a step above. \n\nJust like the Rovectin Conditioning Cleanser…I think all skin types will play well with this product. But, those who are battling frequent redness, irritation, or dryness will really be impressed with the abilities/results here. I’ll be keeping one of these on hand as I continue to use Curology…but I’m looking forward to switching to a more watery toner. I love my “7-skins method” and have missed layering and layering a nice/cooling toner.\n\nFull Ingredients List: WATER, GLYCERIN, METHYL GLUCETH-20, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, NIACINAMIDE, SORBITOL, ADENOSINE, CAFFEINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ALLANTOIN, PANTHENOL, ARGININE, HYALURONIC ACID, GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA (LICORICE) ROOT EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA (MATRICARIA) FLOWER EXTRACT, CENTELLA ASIATICA EXTRACT, GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) SPROUT EXTRACT, CARICA PAPAYA (PAPAYA) FRUIT EXTRACT, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, SODIUM PCA, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM POLYGLUTAMATE, HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYALURONATE, HYDROLYZED HYALURONIC ACID, SODIUM ACETYLATED HYALURONATE, POTASSIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, DISODIUM EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $29.00.

I came across it about a week ago when several local skincare Instagram accounts received a PR packaged from them and I got curious. \n\nRight now they just released 2 products, a moisturiser and a gel cleanser, and honestly looking from the ingredient list I’m quite impressed. PLUS both seemed to quite affordable I think? \n\nGENTLE CLEANSER\nIngredients: \nAqua, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Propanediol, Ahnfeltiopsis Concinna Extract, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Hydroxy-ethyl Cellulose, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Phenoxyethanol.\n\nBARRIER DEFENDER \nIngredients:\nAqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Capric/Caprylic Triglyceride, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Ceramide IIIB, Hydrolysed Silk, D-Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol.\n\nHonestly I’m pretty tempted on trying the cleanser because of how simple it is. I’ve always wanted to try a local brand too so for fellow Singaporeans, maybe you guys can give it a try too and share your thoughts on it? \n\nThey’re available on Shopee and their website I think? Do check out their Instagram account if you are interested in them @5to5skin. \n\nMan I guess it’s time for me to quickly use up my current cleanser XD. What are your thoughts on their current products and maybe even their brand as a whole?",

I've not heard of the brand but looking at the price and ingredients, the price looks reasonable based on singapore standards, but really depends on your budget. \n\nThe cleanser based on the ingredients should cleanse relatively fine but can be slightly moisturizing. 1% mark should be at Propanediol. Personally i'd prefer the Glutamate to be the main surfactant but it's probably lower in percentage due to the cost. It's short of an amphoteric surfactant to bring down the potential harshness. \n\nThe moisturizer based on the ingredients should slightly rich due to the number of emollients in the formula. 1% mark should be at Stearic Acid. It should take some time to \"absorb\" due to the Jojoba slightly higher on the list.",

We would normally only need 0.1-0.2% protein to achieve this, because that's the practical limit of how much we can put into the bottle, but also anymore just goes down the drain.\n\nAnalogy: your hair is like a piece of fuzzy rope covered in armor plating.  There are holes in that armor and the fuzz pokes through almost like Velcro.  The protein binds to the rope that isn't covered by armor.  When it dries that protein turns into new armor.  Your hair strand is now coated in a tough film that is resistant to oil.\n\nIt doesn't work for every type of hair.  It works best for fine, limp hair.  It doesn't work as well for kinky or stiff hair.\n\nThe fixatives such as formaldehyde do different chemistry on hair.  The purpose of those is to react with disulfide bonds in hair.  You don't want a fixative in a product with protein.  It's going to react in the bottle and you will destroy the benefits of either.\n\nAnalogy: take my fuzzy rope covered in armor.

These treatments are generally preceded by a reduction step (R-S-S-R') reduction, 'relaxing' the hair fiber. This is followed by the X-linker, in this case HCHO released by the X-linked protein in the product.\n\nI was involved in the assessment and banning of the original formaldehyde-containing product from this company where I live.

    "body": "This watery style Toner comes in a 4.4 OZ Gloss Bottle (totally reusable!) and has a slightly yellow/green tint. Claimed benefits include Anti-Aging and Brightening (interesting for a Tea Tree Product). Aside from the 80.9% Tea Tree Leaf Water…Aloe Leaf Extract, Niacinamide, Chamomile Extract, and Rosemary Extract all make the List. Essential Oils are also here for what I am assuming is Fragrance. The scent is very much of Tea Tree but there is a citrus note to it as well. I could see some people finding this one to be too intense…but I found it refreshing.\n\nI ended up decanting this Toner into a spray bottle to mist on in my Toner Step…as well as occasionally between Steps to prep for Night Cream or Oil. I love watery Toners like this as they just feel so cooling and hydrating. Just from the first use I knew I was going to coat my face in this relaxing and comforting scent/Formula. Each time I used it…my Skin seemed much more calm and soothed (which makes sense from the Tea Tree). But over time, I also noticed a slight brightening effect as well. \n\nAs for the Anti-Aging claim…I’m not so sold. There wasn’t really a firming/plumping result for me (other than the initial effect of layering watery hydration on) which honestly didn’t surprise me. This Tea Tree Balancing Toner is much more geared towards calming, soothing, and healing in my opinion.\n\nHaving said that and generally liking this Toner, I don’t think I’ll be coming back to it. My ideal Toner is one that is focused on watery hydration and really allows you to apply layer after layer…something that isn’t as “specialized” but rather is more general (if that makes any sense LOL!). This Tea Tree Balancing Toner almost felt like a Treatment Toner as though it should be used during breakouts or irritated Skin days.\n\nTo me the size and price of this Toner reflected that “limited use” feeling. I would much rather save some money and go for my 2019 Dream Routine Pick…also from Aromatica. The Rosemary Refresh Toner is nearly three times the size (at a cheaper price in most cases). I found that Toner to be equally as hydrating and more suited for what I use a Toner for. Those with a more consistent need for a Toner that really soothes/calms might find this Product to be a more reasonable option though.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nMELALEUCA ALTERNIFOLIA LEAF EXTRACT, \\*\\*ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF EXTRACT, \\*BUTYLENE GLYCOL, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCERIN, \\*PROPANEDIOL, POLYGLYCERYL-10 LAURATE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 MYRISTATE, VERBENA OFFICINALIS EXTRACT, ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, \\*BETAINE, CITRUS AURANTIUM BERGAMIA FRUIT OIL, ADENOSINE, STYRAX BENZOIN GUM\n\nWhere To Buy:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Peach & Lily ($23.00 USD): [https://www.peachandlily.com/products/tea-tree-balancing-toner](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/tea-tree-balancing-toner) \n\nThings To Note:\n\nOn the Peach. & Lily Site…they list this Product to contain 93% Aloe Vera Extract. But, on the bottle Aromatica lists a 80.9% Tea Tree Leaf Water concentration. So…umm…which one is it LOL!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l82hz7j9roo41.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=730ec560047d98349b6f6eb077e92b8ec93243cd",

There’s nothing in the ingredient list that served a formaldehyde-producing function.\n\nYou can absolutely thermally reshape keratinaceous materials like hair with just heat and moisture. It’s just that the effects are usually not as durable without formaldehyde. \n\nMany of the ingredients are surfactants, emulsifiers, and oils that likely help the reshaped hair resist ambient humidity.",

    "body": "**Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water**\n\nCleansing waters are kind of a new category for me. I used the Neogen Real Cica Micellar Cleansing Water back in May which was my first ever. So, I don’t have a ton to go off of when it comes to comparisons. And for the most part...that product from Neogen and the Essenherb Cleansing Water were pretty similar in application and cleansing.\n\nThe Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water features coconut based surfactants that help to remove impurities like makeup and sunscreen. I tend to use cleansing waters in the AM in place of an oil cleanser or even water/foaming cleanser if I’m feeling particularly lazy lol. I also found them to be helpful in the PM when removing sunscreen from the eye area when an oil cleanser might cause stinging/blurring if put too close to the eyes.\n\nFeatured ingredients include Tea Tree Leaf Extract, Anise Fruit Extract, Tea Tree Leaf Oil, Centella Asiatica Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Chamomile Flower Extract, Peppermint and Aloe Extract also make the list.\n\nYou could probably guess...the scent here is of tea tree lol! It’s something that I find refreshing but does remind me of the acne focused skincare I used in my teens. I could see some people not liking it too much.\n\nAs a cleansing water...this product performed just fine for me. I found it to do a decent job of removing excess oil/sebum from the night before and I never really noticed any residue left behind. It just...did its job lol! \n\nBut, one ingredient that makes it fairly high on the list that I didn’t mention is Witch Hazel. Even though I don’t have a ton of personal experience with this ingredient...I know there are people that avoid it due to its potential drying/astringent effect.\n\nI can say that over time I found the Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water to be a bit drying after use. Not much...but there was a definite difference in the feel of my skin as compared to the Neogen Cleansing Water I used earlier this year. It honestly wasn’t anything that my hydrating toner couldn’t pick up the slack for. But, those with particularly dry skin may want to proceed with caution.\n\nOverall, I didn’t hate this cleansing water. It just seems like something that is really geared towards oily/acne prone skin with its tea tree/Witch Hazel formula. While I do tend to fall into that category more often than not...I didn’t love the slightly drying effect and would much rather use something more “neutral” for this step.\n\nI look forward to continuing my “journey” into cleansing waters. I have two more in my stash that seem to be more focused on hydration/calming alongside cleansing rather than oil reduction or acne fighting. We shall see…\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\n\nWhere To Buy (Facetory $25.00 USD): https://www.facetory.com/products/essenherb-tea-tree-cleansing-water\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akgtnwh7chd51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad4471a97891d425aaf7390f120cf0d095fb6cd4",

    "body": "I decided to double down tonight and use two Tony Moly Masks. My Skin has started to look slightly congested…and thats probably due to me forgetting/not having time for my Peach & Lily Super Reboot Resurfacing Mask this past week. Both of these Sheet Masks are geared towards clearing/purifying the Skin…but are of two totally different consistencies. They have been in my Stash since Summer 2018 and I’m really excited to give them a try. Here we go!\n\nTony Moly Earth Beauty Bubble Mask Sheet - Bubble Peeling:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Ah Bubble Masks...such an odd bird (for me lol!). I have used a few different Bubble Masks and have one found one (from Celderma (check out the Review if you haven’t) that I actually liked. All of the others have left my Skin feeling super dry and tight. Also, some of them only cover the bottom half of the Face…which I don’t really get. Some Featured Ingredients for this Mask include a Charcoal Infused Mask Sheet, Anise Fruit Extract, Lavender Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Papaya Fruit Extract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* This Tony Moly Bubble Mask falls into the “I don’t get it.” Category for me unfortunately. The Mask only covers the Cheek, Chin, and Nose Areas but left my Forehead to fend for itself lol! Also, the Cotton Type Mask Material was super silky and thin. This would be great for any other Mask but with the addition on the slippery/gel-like Bubble Essence…it made it very difficult to get this Sheet Mask on and situated. I barely had time to line the Mask up with my Mouth and Nose before it began bubbling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After about 3 min with this Bubble Peeling Mask on I felt me Skin start to tingle/itch and generally become a bit irritated. Luckily, this Mask only needed to be kept on for 5-10 min…so I opted for 7. After removal, I massaged the Excess Bubble Essence into my Skin with warm water to create a typical Cleansing Lather. After that, I rinsed fully with more water. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Although I didn’t notice any redness or irritation (which was great considering how this Tony Moly Mask felt while it was on)…the typical dryness/tightness that I have experienced with other Bubble Masks was immediately apparent. I mean honestly for me, Bubble Masks seem to just be Sheet Masks coated in harsh Cleansing Products…I haven’t really found one that blew me away or seemed worth the time/effort. \n\nTony Moly Earth Beauty Mud Mask Sheet - Mud Peeling:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* This type of Sheet Mask is totally new to me and the one I was most excited to try! Based on the Instructions I was super curious about the application process and removal. This is a Two Piece Sheet Masks that is coated in Mud. Other Ingredients in the Mud Formula include Niacinamide, Betula Alba Juice, Chamomile Flower Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, Purslane Extract, Aloe Leaf Extract, Volcanic Ash, and Hydrolyzed Collagen. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Applying this Mask was actually much easier than I anticipated. The “Mud Essence” lol…is not super thick or sticky at all, and I found that I could handle the Mask without too much getting on my Hands. But, once this Mask it on…IT IS ON! The Mud really helps the Mask adhere to the Skin…making re-adjusting after application an issue. The Mud Essence actually has a slight Floral Scent that I likes. An good thing I liked it, because the Instructions say that this Only Moly Mud Peeling Mask needs to be left on for 40 min!!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As this Mud Mask began to dry…it hardened like any other Wash Off Style Mud Mask. But, the addition of the Mask Material added an interesting rigidness. I didn’t mind it necessarily…it just made things like talking and sipping water extra difficult. I ended up having to find a Straw lol! One the Mask fully dried it felt a lot like a Nose Pre Strip…except across my Entire Face. I was concerned that removing this Sheet Mask was going to be painful process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* It ended up not being that bad…but peeling the Mask off of my Forehead was a little intense. After rinsing the bit of Excess Mud…wow! My Skin felt SUPER SOFT and didn’t seem as dry as I expected. Also, the redness from a blemish on my Cheek was almost completely gone!\n\nUsing these two Tony Moly Peeling Masks was actually kind of fun! Other than my issues with Bubble Masks…the whole experience was different and interesting. But, I doubt I’ll be purchasing either of these Sheet Masks again. I just haven’t found the value of Bubble Masks. And, although I liked the results from the Mud Peeling Mask…I just don’t know if I would be willing to wait the 40+ min to allow the Mask to dry. Most other traditional Wash Off Clay Masks I have used take around half the time to do their thing…and a few of them offer much better results.\n\nI’ll keep an Eye out for other Mud Based Sheet Masks to try…but I think this Tony Moly Bubble Mask will be the last of its kind in my Stash. I picked these up at my local Ulta Store for $6.00 USD each…but it looks like they are no longer available from their Site. They can be found elsewhere…Amazon has them listed for around $6.50 USD. I’ll happily welcome/try any Bubble Masks that come in future Facetory Boxes, but outside of that I think its time for me to part ways with this style of Sheet Mask lol!",

I think my skin is fairly normal all over, but dehydrated. I try to use cruelty free wherever possible, so preferably stuff that isn't sold in China either (no Clinique or anything). What I'm using...\n\nMornings Liz Earle Cleanse and Polish - I like this, easy to use and cleans my face well, doesn't give me spots of anything BUT my skin always feels a little too tight after using it. (Aqua (water), Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl esters, Cera alba (beeswax), Glycerin, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan stearate, Eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, Humulus lupulus (hops) extract, Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, Anthemis nobilis (chamomile) flower extract, Phenoxyethanol, Panthenol, Benzoic acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic acid, Sodium hydroxide, Limonene, Citric acid.)\n\nHydraluron - not feeling a huge difference with using this but I'm trying to finish the tube. My skin does feel softer after using it, not sure about hydration. (Water/Aqua/Eau, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ahnfeltia Concinna Extract, Carbomer, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, PhenoxyethanoL)\n\nTrilogy Vital Moisturising Cream - loving this, my skin feels so much better. (Aqua (Water), Glycerin (Vegetable), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Wheat Straw Glycosides (and) Cetearyl Alcohol, Rosa Canina (Rosehip) Seed Oil, Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Parfum, Citral, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool.)\n\nEvenings Liz Earle C+P - as above. takes my makeup off nicely\n\nEmma Hardie cleansing balm - not the biggest fan of the smell and I think it's given me a couple of spots (could just be stress/travelling though)? Love the texture, possibly too high in essential oils? Also ridiculously expensive I feel. (Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-8 Beeswax, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Sorbitan Stearate, Palmitic/Stearic Triglycerides, Limonene, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Silica, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Aqua (Water), Lecithin, Linalool, Butylene Glycol, Octyldodecyl PCA, Menthyl PCA, Tocopherol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Crithmum Maritimum Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Disodium Phosphate, Citronellol, Citric Acid, Geraniol, Citral.)\n\nFirst Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - skin does feel a lot clearer and spots seem to disappear quicker when I use these. (Water/Eau, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Water, Lactic Acid, Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Camellia Sinensis (White Tea) Leaf Extract, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Fruit Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Phyllanthus Emblica (Indian Gooseberry) Fruit Extract, Polysorbate 20.)\n\nAntipodes Divine Oil - 3 or 4 drops depending on how my skin's feeling, I do notice a difference in my skin when I don't use it. (Persea gratissima (avocado oil), Macadamia ternifolia (macadamia oil), Buxus chinensis (jojoba oil), Rosa canina (rosehip oil), Canaga odorata (ylang ylang oil), Amyris balsamifera (torchwood), Santalum album (sandalwood oil), Jasminum officinale (jasmine oil), Citrus sinensis (orange oil), Tocopherol acetate (vitamin e), Benzyl benzoate+, Benzyl salicylate+, Citronellol+, D-limonene+, Farnesol+, Geraniol+, Isoeugenol+, Linalool+. * Ingredients certified organic by AgriQuality. + Components of essential oils.)\n\nTrilogy Vital Moisturising cream - as above\n\nI want to try The Trilogy night cream (Aqua (water), Sweet almond oil, Cetearyl alcohol, Certified Organic Rosehip Oil , Cetearyl olivate (and) sorbitan olivate, Coco-caprylate, Goji Berry, Rosapene™, Oat extract, Acai oil, Honey (mel), Aloe vera leaf extract, Evening primrose oil, Marula oil, Avocado oil, Chamomile flower extract, Calendula officinalis flower extract (and) glycine soja (soybean) oil, Cocoa seed butter, Vitamin E, Parfum, Rosemary leaf extract, Citric acid, Dehydroacetic acid (and) benzyl alcohol, Citral, Geraniol, Citronellol, Limonene, Linalool.)\n\nand the MOA green balm (Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cera Alba (Beeswax), Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow) Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, CI 75810 (Chlorophyll), Limonene (occurs naturally in tea tree oil)). Thoughts?\n\nAnything wrong with this routine or anything you'd recommend? I want one that's just easy to use, but still does good and smells good too - I just know if something doesn't smell good I won't use it. My skin isn't a fan of Shea butter or anything rose/geranium related (except for rose hip, that seems to make it happy). I also need a new spot treatment, I've got the Clinique one at the moment but obviously don't want to repurchase. Otherwise I just put extra divine oil on which seems to help or witch hazel gel.

    "body": "Hello,\n\nI've been following a simple routine consistently for about a month, just cleanser and toner w/salicylic acid, added a moisturiser for about a week, then switched that and added a spot-on acne gel. Just wondering if some products of the ones I have are better than others, if some might be a bad idea and need switching, and what to be looking to add in. Maybe some from The Ordinary? I understand I need to go slowly, so if you tell me 'wait a few weeks, then add [product]', I can do that. I am, Ok, tempted to try some kind of drastic acid peel-all-the-skin-dramatically-off treatment in the vague hope of getting to start with a cleaner slate, but I guess that's probably not wise?\n\nIf there's anything I should do with spacing/timing and order to use things in, please suggest that too, I'm just layering products. Should I still be using everything first if I'm going to put make-up on in the morning too?\n\nAge: 33\n\nSkin type: Combination I think, but so oily on face it might as well just be oily\n\nConcerns: Acne, probs. hormonal, suspect seb derm which may be related issue (have salicylic acid shampoo). Noticeable sebaceous filaments. Visible oiliness. Some redness. One very fine line, may be vertical frown line, may be a scar.\n\nMake-up: Only recently got any again, have rarely used it.\n\nSuitability requirements: Vegan\n\nOther notes: I quit using products before as a teen because it wasn't working. The only thing that has ever made a significant ongoing difference, as a happy and unexpected side-effect, was switching to a dairy-free diet. I really don't like that one fine line due to the placement. I get that 'pores are normal', but the visibility makes me want to do something drastic involving strong acid. I have nerve damage so anything I use is prone to feel tingly/burny, making it hard to use that as a gauge, but my skin doesn't actually seem very sensitive in terms of real reactions to products. Not sure it absorbs products well. I'm not using SPF at present because I'm most often housebound currently, but feel free to advise on how to add this in for times that's not the case.\n\nCurrent products:\n\n**Cleansers**\n\nPrevise Dermapothecary Purify Botanic Wash\n\nI've liked this. Noticeable improvement just from using it and the toner dabbed on the worst problem areas, it seems to have fixed the flaky itchy skin under my eyebrows, skin is softer. Possibly pretty much anything would've had the same result, admittedly.

Have you tried simpler “dermatology” brands like Avene, La Roche Posay, Cerave, Cetaphil or at a cheaper high street level Simple? It may be worth reading up about some of these, they’re a staple on subs like this and obviously not everything works for every person but a lot of people see results when using their targeted but quite sensitively formulated products. For example the Sukin moisturiser says it’s oil free, which sounds great if you have oily skin, but there are a lot of plant extracts which can be quite reactive on some skin so could be less than ideal. Also I know it sounds strange but being oily is often to do with being dehydrated and your skin overcompensating, so you don’t always have to shy away from rich moisturising products - I didn’t use moisturiser at all for years because I thought it would make oily ness worse, but the moment I started to use a plain moisturiser my skin (including spots) was so much happier!\n\nI am waffling now, basically I don’t have very wise or specific words for you but you are definitely taking the right approach but maybe products from different brands or with simpler formulas might help? It’s such a pain figuring this stuff out, I wish you luck!",

I used it as a shampoo/conditioner all-in-one. However - I am now in Canada and this product is too difficult to source, and I wanted to find something thats readily available in north america.\n\nSo - I shifted to Redken All Soft shampoo and conditioner. I'm not certain if its the shampoo or conditioner thats causing this - but my scalp feels irritated and itchy. I'm guessing I'm allergic to something, or it could be sulphates. I do not believe in the 'science' behind curly girl method, but I did suffer from canker sores for 20+ years, and cankersores were eliminated once I switched to a non-sulphate toothpaste.\n\nSo i'm wondering if it is the sulphates that are causing my scalpt to itch. Is there a way to test (i.e. put product on the skin?)\n\ninterestingly - the product from Japan Notto by Rezo does appear to be curly girl approved when i copy paste the ingredieents into here: [https://www.curlsbot.com/](https://www.curlsbot.com/) \\- so maybe my scalp likes the sulphate free option, not sure!\n\nmy hair needs a lot of moisture and its very course. its caucasion hair, but apparently quite unusually thick and dense and dry. i'm looking to add moisture to my dry hair, and experiementing wiht the Kevin Murphy clay, Paul Mitchelle Mousse, and Hanz de Fuco Scheme Cream to apply to damp hair \n\nmy hairdresser mentienod the Olaplex line, but I dont have any other ideas on what to try next. I am also trying different hair products (i.e. Kevin Murphy, etc) for styling - so I wanted a product that can get my hair clean.

I get wanting to find something suitable though, I just gave up on it because I don't have the money to keep trying stuff out. Olaplex is great, I use their n.3 once a month and leave it in for a few hours. \n\nBut in all seriousness, if you think you're allergic, I think it would be wise to get it checked out and maybe switch to an antiallergic shampoo for now? I'm not an expert or anything, just my two cents. \n\nThe Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety has a list of ingredients which are established contact allergens; [https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific\\_committees/opinions\\_layman/perfume-allergies/en/figtableboxes/table-13-1.htm](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/opinions_layman/perfume-allergies/en/figtableboxes/table-13-1.htm)\n\nSo maybe you can check all your hair products to find a pattern? That's how I found out my scalp will itch like crazy if I use anything with CITRONELLOL or CINNAMAL, so when I shop for styling products I just check for those and I'll be good 9 out of 10 times.",

Be interesting to see if it makes me flush (rosacea).\n\nCould be almost anything if it is an allergy, did you [patch test] (https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/14sd25/i_just_learned_how_to_do_a_test_patch_properly/)? 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1, 3-diol is a formaldehyde releasing preservative, some have issues with those. Whole leaf aloe can be an allergen it is the inner leaf gel that is safer, propylene glycol os another potentail allergen but you will likely have encounted that in other products recently.\n\nI have a feeling either potassium sorbate or sorbic acid can cause flushing for some people. Long before I had rosacea a Boots Botanics lotion cleanser made me turn scarlet whilst massaging it in and I narrowed it down to one of those I think. I will Google and edit this post if I can work it out.\n\n**ETA** *\"Sorbic acid/potassium sorbate - effective at a very acidic pH (eg 5) – good against mould and fungus and somewhat effective against bacteria. Sensitive to oxidation resulting in discoloration and unstable at temperatures above 38c.  Some people notice a petroleum odour and experience flushing and reddening of face when sorbates are used in leave on products probably due to peripheral vasodilation effect of sorbates.\"*\nhttp://www.makingskincare.com/preservatives/\n\n[Also see here:] (https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dQBAzfyCeQ8C&pg=PA283&lpg=PA283&dq=sorbic+acid+potassium+sorbate+erythema&source=bl&ots=tZ3ugGzniW&sig=enHWIWMdMZdn-vw4kddW0IzgMCY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMI1anbppWYyAIVyfJyCh0gdwiX#v=onepage&q=sorbic%20acid%20potassium%20sorbate%20erythema&f=false) erythema = redness.\n\nGarnier Simply Essentials Soothing Vitamin-Enriched Toner is one option for you since it has a totally different preservative system.

You put it on your teeth immediately after whitening.\n\nI personally use 35% Carbamide Peroxide whitening gel, and it's very effective if you use It right. I did 30 mins a day for 14 days then once a week as maintanance. My teeth are 5 shades lighter. I reccomend the \"WhiteBrite Pro\" whitening kit, it comes with a mouth tray and LED light, 35% CP gel, and remineralizer. It's also under 45 bucks. The refills are cheap too.\n\nHowever, it does burn your gums quite a bit, so not everyone can tolerate it. You may need to find a lower strength like 15% if that's the case.\n\nMake sure you are also brushing 3x per day with flouride toothpaste and mouthwash. For people getting whitenings, ClinPro 5000 or PreviDent 5000 are excellent toothpaste products. The ClinPro is better, though.\n\nAlso, the first few days when you whiten you'll notice a dramatic effect - this is actually because your teeth are getting \"dehydrated\" from the peroxide, and appears white but the tooth isn't actually bleached.",

The preservative system with Caprylhydroxamic Acid and Glyceryl Caprylate is gentle and less likely to cause reactions. Xanthan Gum is a safe thickening agent but might cause issues if your baby is allergic. Always do a patch test before using it extensively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:**  Water, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Glycerin, Emulsifying Wax, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Avena Sativa Kernel Flour, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Nasturtium Officinale Flower/Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Spiraea Ulmaria Flower Extract, Xanthan Gum, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Emulsifying Wax\n   * Emulsifying Wax is a common ingredient in many types of creams and lotions, including baby lotion. It's used to help mix oil and water, creating a smooth, creamy texture. This allows the product to evenly spread and absorb into the skin. Generally, emulsifying wax is considered to be safe for topical use and is not associated with severe side effects. However, like any ingredient, it may cause problems for certain individuals.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: In some rare cases, emulsifying wax can cause skin irritation. This can result in redness, itchiness, or a slight burning sensation. This is more common in people with sensitive skin.\n      * Allergic Reaction: Though very rare, some individuals might have an allergic reaction to emulsifying wax. This could lead to more severe skin redness, swelling, itchiness, hives, and in the most severe cases, difficulty breathing.\n      * Clogged Pores: Depending on the type of emulsifying wax used and the individual's skin type, there may be a risk of clogged pores, which can lead to breakouts. However, this is less likely with baby lotions, which are typically formulated to be gentle and non-comedogenic.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tocopheryl Acetate\n   * Tocopheryl Acetate, also known as Vitamin E Acetate, is a form of Vitamin E that is often used in skincare products and cosmetics, including baby lotion. It acts as an antioxidant and skin-conditioning agent. While Tocopheryl Acetate is generally considered safe for use in skincare products, some people may experience side effects, particularly if they have sensitive skin or a specific allergy to the ingredient.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some people may experience minor skin irritation when using products containing Tocopheryl Acetate. This can manifest as redness, itching, or dryness.\n      * Allergic Reaction: Though it's rare, some individuals may have an allergic reaction to Tocopheryl Acetate. Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include severe skin redness, swelling, hives, and in severe cases, difficulty breathing.\n      * Eye Irritation: If a product containing Tocopheryl Acetate comes into direct contact with the eyes, it may cause eye irritation.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

It has a nice thick consistency and the white cast it leaves once it soaks in is actually nice. It brightens my skin tone and slightly hides my acne scars. I love reading ingredients and knowing what is inside my skincare products, but this product has proven more difficult since its Korean and not as popular in the US as some asian skin care lines. I looked it up online and I haven't been able to find any reviews, let alone the ingredients in English. I found the ingredient list in Korean on the [IPKN website](http://ipkn.co.kr/ipkn/product/goods/product_view.asp?GoIdx=100388)\nand plugged it into google translate. Below is what google plopped out, and I was hoping you wonderful people with more skin care knowledge than I could take a look at this list for any alarming or harmful ingredients. \n\n\n>Water, penta siloxane cycles, methoxy cinnamate in the chilhek silme, glycerin, whack on the chilhek silsal rate, zinc oxide, dimethicone PEG -10, cycle menu dimethicone, titanium dioxide, di propylene glycol, Discover Te Des uranium hectorite , apple extract, daisy flower extract, Western Songak extract, line thyme oil, cactus extract, Citric acid, peppermint leaf extract, bilberry fruit extract, sugar cane extract, rosemary leaf extract, ginger extract, sage leaf extract, avocado fruit extract, Chamomile flower extract, grape seed extract, lemon extract, orange extract, sugar maple extract, magnesium sulfate, taelkeu, diphenyl dimethicone / Vinyl diphenyl dimethicone / silsesquioxane cross-polymer, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum stearate, dimethicone dimethicone / vinyl dimethicone cross-polymer, methyl dimethicone, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, butyl paraben, chromium oxide green\n\n\nThanks y'all!",

    "body": "This watery style Toner comes in a 4.4 OZ Gloss Bottle (totally reusable!) and has a slightly yellow/green tint. Claimed benefits include Anti-Aging and Brightening (interesting for a Tea Tree Product). Aside from the 80.9% Tea Tree Leaf Water…Aloe Leaf Extract, Niacinamide, Chamomile Extract, and Rosemary Extract all make the List. Essential Oils are also here for what I am assuming is Fragrance. The scent is very much of Tea Tree but there is a citrus note to it as well. I could see some people finding this one to be too intense…but I found it refreshing.\n\nI ended up decanting this Toner into a spray bottle to mist on in my Toner Step…as well as occasionally between Steps to prep for Night Cream or Oil. I love watery Toners like this as they just feel so cooling and hydrating. Just from the first use I knew I was going to coat my face in this relaxing and comforting scent/Formula. Each time I used it…my Skin seemed much more calm and soothed (which makes sense from the Tea Tree). But over time, I also noticed a slight brightening effect as well. \n\nAs for the Anti-Aging claim…I’m not so sold. There wasn’t really a firming/plumping result for me (other than the initial effect of layering watery hydration on) which honestly didn’t surprise me. This Tea Tree Balancing Toner is much more geared towards calming, soothing, and healing in my opinion.\n\nHaving said that and generally liking this Toner, I don’t think I’ll be coming back to it. My ideal Toner is one that is focused on watery hydration and really allows you to apply layer after layer…something that isn’t as “specialized” but rather is more general (if that makes any sense LOL!). This Tea Tree Balancing Toner almost felt like a Treatment Toner as though it should be used during breakouts or irritated Skin days.\n\nTo me the size and price of this Toner reflected that “limited use” feeling. I would much rather save some money and go for my 2019 Dream Routine Pick…also from Aromatica. The Rosemary Refresh Toner is nearly three times the size (at a cheaper price in most cases). I found that Toner to be equally as hydrating and more suited for what I use a Toner for. Those with a more consistent need for a Toner that really soothes/calms might find this Product to be a more reasonable option though.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nMELALEUCA ALTERNIFOLIA LEAF EXTRACT, \\*\\*ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF EXTRACT, \\*BUTYLENE GLYCOL, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCERIN, \\*PROPANEDIOL, POLYGLYCERYL-10 LAURATE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 MYRISTATE, VERBENA OFFICINALIS EXTRACT, ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, \\*BETAINE, CITRUS AURANTIUM BERGAMIA FRUIT OIL, ADENOSINE, STYRAX BENZOIN GUM\n\nWhere To Buy:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Peach & Lily ($23.00 USD): [https://www.peachandlily.com/products/tea-tree-balancing-toner](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/tea-tree-balancing-toner) \n\nThings To Note:\n\nOn the Peach. & Lily Site…they list this Product to contain 93% Aloe Vera Extract. But, on the bottle Aromatica lists a 80.9% Tea Tree Leaf Water concentration. So…umm…which one is it LOL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bjgbgbhxqoo41.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eeb33ae73b20bdf9e40c99c51cc688659919c854",

    "body": "# Starting tretinoin and need suggestions for a routine...\n\n📷\n\nHi all!\n\nI have mild hormonal and digestive (I think?) acne on my forehead and cheeks/jawline; at least, my medical esthetician seems to think so. I was recently prescribed tretinoin by my MD. I never struggled with acne for my whole life until about 1.5 years ago (when I started graduate school).\n\nMy medical esthetician seems to think I don't need it, because she's bigger on eating healthy (avoiding dairy/sugar/starches) and a simple but effective regimen. My skin gets a bit better when I'm really strict with my diet and when I see her regularly (every 2 weeks), but it requires a lot of self-discipline and $$$ to do those things, respectively. Also, it never really goes away, just reduces it a bit. Of course, I'm still going to eat healthy and drink lots of water and follow a good regime, but I'm frustrated and I think I need something stronger at this point.\n\nPer my medical esthetician, I am currently using:\n\n**Ayur-Medic Antibacterial Wash with Exfoliating Beads for Blemish-Prone Skin**\n\nActive ingredients; *Benzoyl Peroxid*e 2.5%\n\nInactive ingredients: (INCI) Water (Aqua), Cocoamidopropyl Hydroxsultaine, Polyethylene beads, Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene Glycol, Aloe barbedensis Leaf Extract, Triethanolamine, Mentha viridis (Spearmint) leaf oil, Melaleuca alternifolia leaf oil, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Chamomilla recutita flower extract, Rosemarinus officinalis leaf extract, Eucalyptus globulus leaf oil.\n\nand\n\n**Cosmedix Clarity Skin-Clarifying Serum:**\n\nHamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Alcohol Denat., Aqua, Alcohol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Salicylic Acid \\[Exfoliant\\], Acetylsalicylic Acid, *Retinol, Retinyl Acetate,* Galactoarabinan, Hydroxyproline (L), Saccharide Isomerate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Epilobium Angustifolium (Willowherb) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Collinsonia Canadensis (Stone Root) Extract, Serenoa Serrulata Fruit (Saw Palmetto) Extract, Ruscus Aculeatus (Butcher's Broom) Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate\n\n**and NO moisturizers** since she said that, if the serum feels moisturizing enough (and, surprisingly, it does), it's fine. It sucks, because I love how these products feel on my skin, and it's definitely improved since she's helped me develop a better regimen, but my skin is nowhere near where I want it to be.\n\nI realize that the ingredients in these may not be compatible with using retinoin. I'm considering investing in Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Face Cleanser, La Roche Posay cicaplast baume B5, Cerave healing ointment, and maybe some sort of serum/oil, or an occlusive, and, of course, sunscreen. I've perused through a lot of the threads here, and there seem to be so many options, I'm not even sure where to start. I wish I could just integrate it into my skincare routine, but I'm also hoping that maybe I can still use the two products I'm currently using occasionally.\n\nI plan to ease my way into it (I plan to use it 1-2 a week for a while, buffering it with a moisturizer).\n\nCliffs:\n\n\\-Have been seeing medical esthetician for months to treat forehead/cheek/jaw acne (pustules) that I've struggled with for 1.5 year\n\n\\-Esthetician doesn't want me to start tretinoin, and though my skin has improved a little over the past several months, it's back and forth a lot and nowhere near where I need it to be\n\n\\-Currently using a cleanser and serum with active ingredients not compatible with tretinoin (benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, respectively) \n\n\\-Struggling to establish a regimen that is good for me (need recommendations!)\n\n\\-Is there a way I can switch off with the above products and and a new tretinoin? I.e., use those on the days I don't use tret, and then use a tret-friendly cleanser/moisturizer on the days I do?\n\nThank you for reading! :) Open to any and all suggestions...I'm desperate!",

The Cicaful Ampoule was featured in one of Director Pi’s videos as one of the best ampoules for oily dehydrated skin. Also, ranked nr. 1 on Hwahae for several weeks straight, I was immediately convinced that I had to try it.\n\nThe Be Plain Cicaful Ampule is composed of 84.28% Centella Asiatica extract which helps with calming, healing and moisturizing the skin. We already know that centella is a great ingredient especially for sensitive and troubled skin. Other notable ingredients in the formula include: Hyaluronic acid, Chamomile flower extract, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate and Rice Ferment.\n\nCheck out my full review and details on this ampoule on my blog: [Be Plain Cicaful Ampoule Review](https://kbeautynotes.com/review-be-plain-cicaful-ampoule/)\n\n Have you tried anything from this brand before? What was your experience?",

Cetearyl Alcohol in this product is being used as a delivery agent to get the ingredients into the skin but if there’s so much of it you can find that it will actually hurt the skin also by irritating it, drying it, or stripping it of natural oils.  You can use it if you want, but that jumped out to me as being a no-no on the ingredient list.  When looking for a moisturizer, try to find one that is listed as “alcohol-free” if you can.\n\n\nAlso, I noticed it has Phenoxyethanol which can be considered an irritating ingredient if you find you have sensitive skin.  Some have reported having reactions to it but it is pretty hard to find products without it in them, just a heads up.\n\n\nAlso also, as a final word, if you look for another moisturizer I would recommend looking for one that is “fragrance-free”.  Fragrances are unnecessary and irritating to the skin, parfum is pretty high up on the list and it is just so unnecessary in a lotion that it’s not worth it honestly for the irritation it can cause.",

    "body": "\\[F32\\] I am new to dying my hair (tried something with a friend 15 years ago but that's it) and I'm looking for a hair coloring that will last longer than 1-3 washes but isn't permanent as going to the hairsalon. To me 1-3 washes will be a waste of money and permanent is not an option because I don't want the color growing out from the roots since I won't be continuously retouching. I found at the drugstore in NL Guhl Pearlance (55). According to the package it's good up to 30 washes but also says underneath permanent coloring result. Can anyone tell me by the ingredients if this is the right package for me? The lady at the store said she knew some things but then gave me answers that did not make me trust her in her knowledge 😅\n\nMy hair is equal to ''middenbruin'' (the bottom color of the 3 on the package) so I believe I'll see somewhat of a difference but I'm not expecting miracles here. I want to go darker and have a red hint in my hair. If anyone has tips, they are more than welcome!\n\nBtw my hair reaches to my lower back so I will be sure to get 2 packs either way.\n\n**INGREDIENTS**  \nKleurcrème: Aqua, Laureth-2, Oleic Acid, Glycol Distearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Hydroxide, Guanidine Carbonate, Ethanolamine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Sulfite, Ammonium Chloride, Dimethicone, PEG/PPG-20/23 Dimethicone, Steartrimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Ascorbic Acid, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Tetrasodium EDTA, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Glucose, Isopropyl Alcohol, Persea Gratissima Oil, Propylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Bisabolol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Sorbitol, Lawsonia Inermis Leaf Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Propylparaben, Parfum, 2-Amino-3-Hydroxypyridine, 2-Methyl-5-Hydroxyethylaminophenol, 4-Amino-m-Cresol, Resorcinol, Toluene-2,5-Diamine Sulfate.

        "body": "As they mention 30 washes I assume this would be like demi-permanent dye. Generally there’s dyes that are oxidising (used with developer) and ones that are applied directly (used without developer). \n\nOxidising dyes tend to be a bit more long lasting (compared to those direct dyes that have more temporary type pigments) and depending on formulation and strength of developer they can be permanent (dyes used with stronger developer and able to lift natural hair somewhat) or demi-permanent (dyes used with lower strength developer and mainly for depositing colour). \n\nDepending on each product, previous colour, condition of hair, hairtype etc. results will vary a bit and e.g. even more temporary type dyes can sometimes stain light (especially bleached) hair. Oxidising dyes can alter natural colour, permanent dyes generally more than demi-permanents as higher strength developer lifts that natural hair more.",

    "body": "Baby wipes are an essential item that keeps our newborns and toddlers clean between diaper changes. And since diapers  changes are frequent, all parents want to make sure that the wipes  they're using are safe and even, in some cases, preventative for their  precious little ones. Transparency matters, and that's why it's time for  an honest ingredient breakdown in our natural baby wipes.  \n\nThough  changes to harmful ingredients in baby wipes have been made in recent  years, certain brands still don't quite fit the safety bill. And that's  why it's important to know what ingredients to look for when searching  for safety. A good rule of thumb in choosing a safe, sensitive baby  wipe will always be natural ingredients. The more natural (especially on  the skin), the better! \n\n**What's In A Wipe?**  \n\nGenerally  speaking, wipes are needed to clean and, in some cases, moisturize the  skin. So, you'll often find these ingredients listed below in your  everyday run-of-the-mill wet wipe.  \n\n* **Humectants, also known as moisturizing agents,** typically consist of ingredients like glycerin and propylene glycol to leave the skin feeling moisturized and soft. \n* **Detergents, commonly known as surfactants:** As we all know, the main reason for a wipe is to clean the skin, so surfactants or detergents act as a dirt remover.  \n* **Water and Aloe vera:** These ingredients help the surfactants and humectants activate.  \n* **Preservatives:** Preservatives are used to help prevent contamination.  \n* **Fragrances or Perfumes:** Fragrances and perfumes help give a good scent.\n\n**Ingredients You Should Avoid When Choosing A Baby Wipe** \n\nAlthough  some ingredients in baby wipes aren't harmful, there are elements you  want to avoid altogether. And since it can be tough to sift through the  amount of elements that frequent most packaging, we’ve provided a list  of things to avoid when you're in the market for a safe baby wipe.   \n\n\n*     Parabens\n*     Phthalates\n*     DMDM Hydantoin\n*     Peg's (Polyethylene Glycols)\n*     Triclosan\n*     Sodium Lauryl/Laureth Sulfate (SLS)\n*     Fragrance/Perfume\n*     Methylisothiazolinone\n*     Bronopol\n*     Propylene Glycol\n*     Alcohol \n\n**What's In Our Coconut Nourish Wipes?** \n\nNow  that you've looked at some red-flag ingredients, it's time to discover  what to search for to nourish your baby's skin and keep them safe from  harmful components. We've already stated that your best choice by way of  safety and sensitivity is natural ingredients, like BabyCozy's [**Coconut Nourish Wipes**](https://babycozy.com/products/babycozy-coconut-nourish-wipes). So let's look at the elements, present in our wipes that will keep your baby's skin clean and well-nourished.\n\n**Aqua**\n\nAqua  is a much better, more fashionable way to say water. And as everyone  knows, water is the source of life. And when used in sensitive baby  wipes, it helps all of the good ingredients work together. \n\n**Glyceryl Stearate & PEG-100 Stearate** \n\nThis  element is called an emulsifier. It is used in tandem with cetyl  alcohol as a thickener to make it more pliable for use in natural wipes.  Simply put, it assists the other ingredients in staying well blended. \n\n**Parffinum Liquidum**\n\nParffinum  Liquidum is mineral oil, and contrary to what many believe, this oil is  incredibly inert and pure. As a result, allergies to this ingredient  are infrequent, and it can treat various skin conditions due to its  ability to be a non-irritant. \n\n**Cetyl Alcohol**\n\nCetyl Alcohol is one of the emulsifying agents derived from olives,  palms, and corn. It is not a skin irritant like isopropyl alcohol, an  ingredient often used in standard baby wipes. So, it keeps your baby’s  skin safe from any dryness that can occur from regular alcohol.\n\n**Glycerin**\n\nGlycerin is one of the elements we mentioned earlier. It's a  humectant whose main job is to seal in moisture. It's incredibly gentle  on the skin and is non-toxic, especially in sensitive baby wipes. \n\n**Phenoxyethanol**\n\nPhenoxyethanol is a sticky and quite oily substance that helps  prevent bacteria, fungi, and yeast from growing on products. In other  words, this ingredient provides safety and prolongs the shelf-life.  Without it, the skin could be subjected to harmful bacteria.\n\n**Capryl/Capylyl Glucoside**\n\nA surfactant, capryl/capylyl glucoside is an extremely gentle,  natural cleanser. In addition to being a cleanser, it's commonly used in  cosmetic formulations for people with skin sensitivities. This  ingredient is derived from plants and is biodegradable. \n\n**Vitamin E**\n\nThis vitamin is all-natural, fat-soluble, and acts as an antioxidant.  It has countless benefits for the skin and immune system and protects  cells from damage. The main pros are that it softens the skin and helps  retain moisture. Formulated in a natural baby wipe helps keep your  baby's skin soft and smooth.\n\n**Coconut Oil**\n\nThere has been an influx of the use of coconut oil in recent years,  and there are many reasons why. This natural, highly saturated oil can  kill damaging microorganisms. And especially in skin care, it can fight  various skin infections. In addition, it can also have anti-inflammatory  effects. Out of all the ingredients to have in a sensitive baby wipe,  this is one of the most important. \n\n**Hamamelis Viginiana Extract**\n\nCommonly known as Witch Hazel, Hamamelis Virginiana is a miracle  extract with its fair share of benefits. And apart from the natural,  fresh smell, it is a gentle skin cleanser that also assists in  inflammation and skin irritations. In addition, when present in a  natural baby wipe, it cleans and protects.\n\n**Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract**\n\nExtracted from the Chamomile plant's flowers and German chamomile,  this flower extract has natural, soothing qualities. As you probably  already know, chamomile is incredibly powerful and has been used  medicinally for centuries. It has many benefits for skin and hair, but  mainly, it can help calm and nourish. \n\n**Citric Acid**\n\nCitric acid is all about PH levels. It's an organic, mild citrus acid  that helps level the wipe's PH and keeps your baby's skin PH balanced.  Additionally, it can help stop diaper rash in its tracks. \n\nSince [**Soft Baby Wipes**](https://babycozy.com/products/babycozy-coconut-nourish-wipes) are frequently used and essential, it's vital to  have some knowledge about their contents. Although it can seem  overwhelming, it's equally important to be able to recognize the harmful  elements so that you can keep your baby's skin safe and  well-nourished.",

    "body": "Hi All, \n\nI have facial eczema and very, very sensitive skin. My one lotion without ingredients in it that irritate my skin is very thick (Dermasil Eczema Relief with Natural Chamomile Flower Extract and Colloidal Oatmeal) and leaves a thick clear residue on my face (even when using only a tiny bit) that traps heat and I believe may be keeping my skin barrier from repairing. Even if I wait 24h later and put a bit of water on my face, it will turn white with old lotion that's still there. It's the only thing that's soothing to put on my skin and my face flakes if I put nothing on it, so I'm stuck in a bit of a Catch-22 here. If I have a flare, I can calm down the flare and then put less and less of the thick lotion as I do better with less due to the residue build-up, but I can't do just nothing as then my face will flare again from the dryness. I tried zero therapy and--unfortunately--that just made me worse.\n\nI don't do well with straight glycerin or straight mineral oil. And I can't tolerate any type of acid such as HA as an active or ascorbic acid as a preservative. \n\nI do well with Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion with prebiotic oats on my body as I have dry skin but not eczema there. However, it hurts on my face. I do like that this lotion does not leave such significant residue like the Dermasil. However, this lotion irritates my skin on my face, and I believe it is due to the benzyl alcohol which is one ingredient that the Dermasil does not have.\n\nThe Aveeno ingredients are: Water, glycerin, distearlydimonium chloride, petrolatum, isopropyl palmitate, cetyl alcohol, avena sativa (oat) kernel flour, dimethicone, benzyl alcohol, and sodium chloride.\n\nWhat I'm looking for now is something as simple as this Aveeno lotion as it has ingredients I can tolerate and doesn't leave such a thick residue but WITHOUT benzyl alcohol as that is one ingredient that is not in Dermasil and is common in many thinner facial lotions I've tried that burned for me.\n\nDoes anyone know of any lotion similar to the Aveeno but without benzyl alcohol?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

However, for the third time my face has broken out into hives lasting days immediately after using it.  I've narrowed it down to an interaction between that and either 1.

Glycolic acid toner.   \nThe mist seems to have fairly simple ingredients (Rose Water, Aloe Leaf, Glycerin, Chamomile Flower Extract, Witch Hazel, EcoCert Organic Certified Preservative (Benzyl Alcohol/Salicylic Acid/Sorbic acid)), so I wouldn't think it's that. When I looked into the Glycolic interactions, I noticed that peptides are an interaction.  I went to look at Amino acids and they're not listed as a peptide, but if I lookup what a peptide is, it's a \"string of 2 or more amino acids\".  On the Amino acids + b5 ingredients, there are multiple different Amino Acids. \nI'm obviously going to avoid using the Aminos and Glycolic together, since I'm assuming it's them that caused the interaction. But, My question is if there are multiple amino acids in the serum and multiple amino acids are a peptide, why wouldn't they be considered peptides?  Is it the way they are combined that make them a peptide?",

When it comes to skin, we want it to feel and look healthy, radiant and clear. Finding the products that will give us the best results can be tricky and that’s why it’s important to do a thorough research in order to get information on what would be effective for our skin.\n\nThe Right Ingredients\n\nSkin is skin but not all products are necessarily good or effective on everyone. You need to look for certain ingredients and avoid others, depending on your skin type and any sensitivities you have. If you have dry skin, you need hydrating and soothing ingredients such as Hyaluronic Acid, Shea Butter and Jojoba Oil. Oily and blemish-prone skin types will benefit from using products that contain Salicylic Acid, Niacinamide and Vitamin A. If you have sensitive skin, calming ingredients like Provitamin B5 (also known as Panthenol) and Chamomile Flower Extract will maintain the strength of the barrier function and soothe the skin.\n\nExfoliation is for Everyone\n\nExfoliation is one of the main steps for achieving youthful glow and healthy skin. The products used to exfoliate the skin remove the outer layer of dead skin cells to reveal healthier skin and to also promote the production of new skin cells. There are right ingredients, formulations and concentration for every skin type and even people with sensitive and prone to redness skin can use mild exfoliating products.\n\nAgeing Prevention\n\nLoss of elasticity, wrinkles, sun damage and uneven skin tone can be signs of premature ageing. There are key ingredients that can improve the appearance of the skin and prevent premature ageing. Retinoids are Vitamin A compounds used topically to reduce fine lines and wrinkles and to repair sun damage. Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant that protects the skin from free radicals and stimulates collagen production. Other ingredients that repair and protect the skin include Coenzyme Q10, Peptides, Alpha Hydroxy Acids and Niacinamide.\n\nSun Protection\n\nExperts agree that sunscreen is one of the most important steps in your skincare routine. Using sun protection daily helps to prevent the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, imperfections and some types of skin cancer. A lot of people are concerned about heavy texture and clogged pores but the skincare world now offers cosmetically elegant formulations that would suit even sensitive and acne-prone skin types.\n\nChoose ethically\n\nEffective products are fantastic but it’s also important what’s behind the process of creating them. More and more brands acknowledge this, as well and enact positive change. Such initiatives in the skincare industry vary greatly but a major part of them feature investing in sustainable packaging, education programmes and ethical supply chains. Socially responsible companies usually have cruelty-free and vegan products; recyclable packaging; certified organic and naturally sourced ingredients and they also support local producers.",

    "body": "Currently, my usual stack is as follows:\n\n**Daily**\n\n* 200-400 mg l-theanine\n\n* 250 mg.  ashwagandha extract (KSM-66)\n\n* 4,000 IU vitamin D3\n\n* 150 mg alpha-GPC (except on days I eat a diet particularly rich in choline)\n\n* 200-400 mg magnesium glycinate\n\n**Every other day**\n\n* [Life Extension's \"Super K\"](http://www.lifeextension.com/vitamins-supplements/item01834/super-k-with-advanced-k2-complex)\n\n*I take this one every other day because it is an expensive supplement, and correct me if I'm wrong, but K-vitamins have fairly long half-lives which makes taking such high doses every day a waste.*\n\n**Occasionally**\n\n*I recognize that these are not necessarily serving any particular purpose, but I feel that taking such supplements on occasion can only be beneficial to my health in the long run.*\n\n* 125 mg yerba mate extract (4:1 concentrate); for antioxidant properties\n\n* 250 mg rhodiola rosea root extract; for antioxidant properties and to boost effectiveness of stimulants\n\n* 250 mg bacopa monnieri extract (BaCognize); for support of neurological health\n\n* 250 mg milk thistle, standardized to 80% silymarin; to support liver health (because my recreational drug use can't necessarily be good for my liver all the time)\n\n**The important part: supplements I am considering adding to my regimen**\n\n* 100 mg luteolin complex; I've only recently learned about this flavonoid, and it seems like the preponderance of the evidence suggests that luteolin is hugely beneficial to brain health.\n* 500 mg Chamomile flower extract, standardized to 1% apigenin; I love chamomile tea, and have read extensively about the potential benefits of consuming chamomile. I don't always have the time or the energy to brew a cup at night, but would like to reap chamomile's benefits daily.\n* 50 mg apigenin (derived from grapefruit); based on the cursory research I've done via Examine.com and reading through a handful of studies found on Google Scholar, apigenin has potential to be hugely beneficial to overall health and is quite likely to be the main relaxing/anti-anxiety flavonoid within chamomile. If you didn't notice from my current daily stack, I aim to reduce the generalized anxiety that I experience day-to-day, and am willing to give damn near anything a try. Even though the above-mentioned chamomile extract is standardized to 1% apigenin, that is still only 5 mg per dose; I would like to experiment with doses in the 200-300 mg range to see if it could effectively relieve my anxiety without being overly-sedating.\n* 820 mg of [Planetary Herbal's \"Stone Free.\"](https://www.swansonvitamins.com/planetary-herbals-stone-free-820-mg-180-tabs?otherSize=PF081) I have never had a kidney stone and have no reason to believe that I am at any particular risk for it, but kidney stones are one of my worst bodily fears, and it can't hurt to support the health of my kidneys and gall bladder anyway (in the same vein of logic as to why I take milk thistle).\n\n**The Real Question**\n\nIs there any reason that I should not be combining any of these supplements, or taking any of them daily? My current daily stack is fairly common, I believe, and I haven't had a single problem taking that for months. In fact, I would never want to go back to *not* taking my daily stack, as it has noticeably improved my quality of life. Mostly, what I'm curious about is adding the 4 supplements at the bottom of the list. These 4 supplements are not often mentioned on here or /r/Nootropics, so I have almost nothing to go off of in terms of potential interactions or side effects from daily and/or long-term use.\n\nEdit: if it matters, I'm a smoker (about a pack every day or two, depending on stress & recreational drug use), I sometimes take half of a men's multivitamin on days when I know my diet is nutritionally lacking, and I'm getting ready to start a daily 10 mg dose of noopept to see how that affects me. My recreational drug use includes amphetamine and xanax (unprescribed) both recreationally and  for their intended purposes, oxycodone on very rare & special occasions, infrequent social alcohol use (I pretty much left my binge drinking days behind when I graduated college), and up until recently, daily cannabis use. Currently I'm taking a break from cannabis because I've realized that I need to give my brain a break after 5 years of near-daily use, plus it most definitely sucks out all of my motivation (and dries up my wallet). I also try to have at least one cup of tea a day, which is usually either some variety of chamomile or green tea. I know that adding apigenin and chamomile extract to my list of supps may seem redundant if I often drink chamomile tea, but due to its laundry list of potential benefits, I see no harm in adding a little bit more every day or two.

        "body": "While Ashwaghanda and L-Theanine are great supplements, I would caution against using them daily. Both build up a tolerance over the long term, and as ashwagandha works with similar efficacy and through the same mechanism of action as Valium (a benzodiazepine), withdrawals can be rough and leave you with a hypofunctioning GABAergic system, leaving you with worse anxiety that you started with. I used Ashwaghanda daily for several months and have experienced this effect. Glycine, taurine, L lysine, holy basil and Sarcosine are all alternative anxiolytics that do not build up a similar tolerance. Holy basil would even replicate the testosterone boosting effects of Ashwaghanda.",

That's why I'm most skeptical about this product, even though it's the cheapest and has the most ingredients – though that doesn't necessarily mean anything. But since all the other products in the shop, like dermarollers, etc., are outrageously overpriced, I would be surprised if this particular product was actually worth its price. On the other hand, the other manufacturers are probably making huge margins on their products as well, that's for sure.",

I would start with tretinoin 3 times/week to acclimate your skin since tretinoin is strong and has the tendency to dry people out.",

I'm a big fan of Alpha Hydrox and never shut up about it. Their oil free 10% gel is the simplest they have and would apply well amongst other products.  You are using a full line up pretty daily so I would recommend something a bit lower strength at first. Nip+Fab has Glycolic Fix pads that I think are around 5%. Starting with that would be safer. \n\nI prefer a routine with a really limited amount of products so I really don't know where to put an AHA into yours. Not saying you have too much going on, I'm just not going to risk giving bad advice on something that's beyond my experience.",

Mostly because I haven't bought my own products before. My mom is a bit of a shopaholic and whenever she finds she has an excess of products/doesn't get the results she wants she shoves the leftovers onto me. I don't know what some of the ingredients are or if I even have a \"good\" routine. Here is a list of all of the products I have from her. \n\nAnd a bit of background on my skin. I have combination skin with dry patches along my cheeks and upper forehead and oily in my t zone(like I have to blot my nose area where my glasses sit oily). I wear light makeup usually the BB cream, concealer and bronzer(I have freckles so I find it's easier to wipe away the bronzer and reapply) I recently started getting closed comedones on my forehead(shows up whenever I use dry shampoo). I also have large black heads along the bridge of my nose. \n\n•Queen Helene mint julep masque- kaolin, bentonite, glycerin, zinc oxide, propylene glycol, sulfur chromium oxide greens, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben \n\n•Aveeno clear complexion foaming cleanser .5% salicylic acid, bottleneck glycol, citric acid, cocamidopropyl betaine, disodium EDTA, disodium lauroamphodiacetate, fragrance, glycerin, glycine soja protein, PEG-16 soy sterol, sodium benzoate \n\n•ceraVe eye repair cream-?\n\n•Aveeno positively radiant daily moisturizer spf 30- avobenzone 3% \nHonosalate 12%\nOctisalate 5%\nOctocrylene 1.7%\nOxybenzone 3\n\n•Maybelline Dream Fresh BB cream spf 30-?\n\n•L'Oreal Paris youth code serum corrector and day/night recharger cream-?\n\n•Sonic wave with exfoliating and cleansing pads-?\n\n•Garnier dark spot corrector glycol peel-?\n\n•yesto cucumbers soothing eye makeup remover pads-?\n\n•simple soothing facial toner sorbitol, absorbic acid, panthenol, decyl glucoside, sodium PCA, DMDM, hydantoin, allantoin, witch hazel, water, iodopropnyl butylcarbamate, glycerin, pantolactone, chamomilla recutita flower extract. \n\n\nMy daily routine looks like this:\n\n•Wash face with warm water/hot water I shower\n\n•Use the aveeno foaming cleanser wash with hands\n\n•Aveeno daily moisturizer\n\n• ceraVe eye cream\n\n•BB cream\n\n•makeup\n\nAfter the day is over I do this.\n\n•yesto cucumber eye makeup remover. \n\n•wash face with Aveeno cleanser\n\n• sonic wave cleansing pad\n\n• simple sensitive toner\n\n• L'Oreal Paris recharger day/night cream\n\n•ceraVe eye cream\n\nOnce a week I use the mint julep masque. Every other day I use the exfoliation pad instead of the cleansing pad on the sonic wave. I just got the glycol peel from her and the youth code dark spot corrector. \n\nAm I doing this right? I've been doing this for three weeks at this point. I used to just wash my face with water and put on the sun screen moisturizer and call it a day. I'm trying to take care of my skin and turn around my unhealthy lifestyle but I am worried after reading many posts here that I'm not doing it correctly. Do I have an AHA? A BHA? \n\n\n\n",

        "body": "1. The salicylic acid in your cleanser is a BHA. However, BHAs in cleanser aren't very effective, because they don't have time to sit on your skin. \n\n2. The sonic wave every day is probably too much exfoliation for your skin. This could be causing the dry patches you are experiencing. At most, you would probably want to use it twice a week. This sub doesn't really recommend much manual exfoliation other than with konjac sponges, which are pretty magical! \n\n3. The Youth Code is kind of just a fancy product that doesn't do a whole lot. \n\nIn general, it sounds like you are cleansing your skin way too much. From what I've gathered, you are washing morning and night, and you are washing with both your Aveeno wash and the sonic wave pads. You only really need to cleanse once a day! Your skin will be much healthier without all of that. :)\n\nIf you want to use a BHA, I would reduce all of your cleansing and exfoliation for a period of time to let your skin heal. Then, you can get some Stridex in the red box, which is a BHA, or some 2% BHA from Paula's Choice online. For AHAs, there is a brand sold at Ulta called Alphy Hydrox that sells them. I really like their 10% stuff!\n\nGood luck!!",

But my skin doesn't turned red but i felt the sting on my skin. I did a patch test and applied it on the back of my ear(no negative reaction-is my way true, first time read about patch test) . So does this mean my skin was not used to the toner or it is not good and stop using the toner. I read that some people felt the sting if they haven't try toner before.The toner had no paraben, alcohol, fragrance and any weird thing which i think would not cause irritation.\n\nToner ingredients: Aqua, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Allantoin, Cetylpyridinium Chloride, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Citric Acid, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hamamelis Virginiana Leaf Water, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Pantolactone, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium PCA.\n\nAnd i used sebamed moisturize gel + squalane oil after that. the climate is hot and humid, asia.

    "body": "I want to try using melatonin for my dog when we go on a long trip so she will relax and sleep. I know melatonin is safe for dogs, but I am wondering about the other ingredients of the chew. I have \"ZZZQUIL PURE ZZZS melatonin gummies\" - https://vicks.com/en-us/shop-products/zzzquil-sleep-aid/pure-zzzs-melatonin-gummies\n\nThe active ingredient is **1mg melatonin** per gummy. My dog is about 20 lbs.\n\nThey also have some plant extracts: Chamomile flower extract, lemon balm leaf extract, valerian root extract, lavender ariel part extract - 50mg of plant extracts per gummy\n\n**The inactive ingredients are as follows**: Sucrose, corn syrup; less than 2% of: hydrogenated coconut oil, pectin, natural flavors, maltodextrin, sodium potassium tartrate, citric acid, soy lecithin, sodium citrate, malic acid, sodium polyphosphate, red 40, blue 1\n\nThe bottle says it's \"wild berry vanilla\" flavor. I was concerned about the possibility of grape anything as an ingredient since that is poisonous to dogs but I don't see anything listed that could be from grapes other than \"natural flavors\" which isn't specific. The chews taste like flowers and lemon. (I took them to test them out) I'm not really sure why they even called it wild berry vanilla other than to maybe trick people into thinking that's the flavor. Maybe if you imagine really hard...\n\nThese chews are made for humans but they are way cheaper than the special ones marketed for dogs, and I already own them. If the ingredients are safe I wanted to try giving my dog one at home to see how she reacts and if its ok with her stomach. (some dog treats make her puke or give her diarrhea and I have to buy her expensive/fancy dog food because she is allergic to some ingredient in the cheap stuff, which gives her skin rashes) If she does ok with them at home then I would give her one for a trip.",
