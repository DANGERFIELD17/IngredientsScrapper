    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

Xane doesn't  specifically refer to any chemical group, it's a mishmash of -ane with an x placed on it. In other words, totally made up.\n\n -siloxane on the other hand is a functional group. For reference, -ane refers to saturated bonds (completely full of hydrogen) \n\n-cone is an abbreviated \"-methicone\" so that still works.\n\nYour rules should therefore list -siloxane and -cone/-methicone as the silicone identifiers instead of -xane.\n\n\n\nExample:\nHexane - not a silicone containing chemical, it's just C6 H14.

And yes, I'm using emojis as a sort of key, don't hate me pls\n\n\nHUGE credits to the Ratzilla Cosme blog who has both ingredients lists up on their site already (she translates it herself from the Japanese bottles). \n\n//\n\nKEY: \n\n❤️ = Star ingredients\n\n⚠️ = New ingredient\n\n⬆️⬇️ = movement of top ingredients up or down the list, i.e. possibly higher or lower concentrations \n\n//\n\nObservations at end of post & a TLDR ... \n\n// \n\n\n [ORIGINAL PREMIUM LOTION INGREDIENTS](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/skin/hada-labo-gokujyun-premium-hyaluronic-acid-lotion/)\n\nwater\n\nbutylene glycol \n\n❤️glycerin \n\nPPG 10 methyl glucose ether \n\n❤️hydroxyethel urea \n\n❤️1. sodium acetyl hyaluronate \n\n❤️2. sodium hyaluronate \n\n❤️3. hydrolized hyaluronic acid \n\n❤️4. hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate \n\n❤️5. sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer \n\n❤️sacran \n\nhydrogenated starch hydrolysate \n\nglycosyl trehalose \n\n❤️diglycerin \n\nsorbitol \n\npentylene glycol \n\ntriethyl citrate \n\ncarbomer \n\npolyquaternium 51 \n\nPEG 32 \n\nPEG 75 \n\nammonium acrylates copolymer \n\ndisodium EDTA \n\npotassium hydroxide\n\ndythoxyethel succinate \n\ndisodium succinate \n\nsuccinic acid \n\nphenoxyethanol \n\nmethylparaben (removed in new formula) \n\n\n///\n\n\n[NEW PREMIUM LOTION INGREDIENTS ](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/skin/hada-labo-gokujyun-premium-hydrating-lotion-2020/)\n\nwater\n\nbutylene glycol \n\n❤️hydroxyethel urea ⬆️\n\npentylene glycol ⬆️\n\nPPG50 methyl glucose ether ⬇️\n\ndipropylene glycol ⚠️\n \n❤️diglycerin ⬆️\n\n❤️2. sodium hyaluronate\n\n❤️3. hydrolized hyaluronic acid \n\n❤️1. sodium acetyl hyaluronate  \n\n❤️4. hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate \n\n❤️5. sodium hyaluronate cross polymer \n\n❤️hyaluronic acid ferment filtrate ⚠️\n\n❤️hydrolized sodium hyaluronate ⚠️\n\n❤️Sacran \n\nhydrogenated starch hydrolysate \n\nglycosyl trehalose \n\nsorbitol \n\ntriethyl citrate \n\nPEG32 \n\ncarbomer \n\nPEG75 \n\ndisodium succinate \n\npropanediol ⚠️\n\ndythoxyethel succinate \n\npotassium hydroxide \n\nsuccinic acid \n\ndisodium EDTA \n\npolyquaternium 51 \n\ncaprylhydroxamic acid ⚠️\n\nhydroxyethelcellulose⚠️\n\nxanthan gum ⚠️\n\nphenoxyethanol \n\n\n//\n\n\nSo, let's look at the 7 new additions: \n\nDIPROPYLENE GLYCOL \n\nVery commonly used solvent, humectant and binder. Has \"great skin moisturising properties\" according to [Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dipropylene-glycol). Safety rating of 1-2 (very safe) on [Cosdna](https://www.cosdna.com/eng/b05d771602.html). This is likely nothing to worry about unless you already know you have a sensitivity, as it is mostly there to keep the formula feeling elegant and seems to be mildly hydrating. \n\n//\n\nHYALURONIC ACID FERMENT FILTRATE \n\nNew kind of hyaluronic acid that Hada Labo claims will \"help fortify the skins moisture barrier to help skin looking plump and supple\". This is the most controversial addition as many people are sensitive to ferments and this product will unfortunately now be unsuitable for them, which is a real shame. However, if you are someone who enjoys ferments, this might sound rather exciting. I couldn't find much info when I searched \"fermented hyaluronic acid\", but Ratzilla's list seems to suggest that the HA has been fermented with Lactococcus bacteria, which is proposed to \"positively influence both the speed and quality of epidermal growth, resulting in better barrier function and overall skin quality\" ([Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactococcus-ferment-lysate)). I'm not convinced a difference in effect will be extremely noticeable alongside the 6 other kinds of HA but I expect it will work well for plumping and improving the health and appearance of the skin regardless. \n\n//\n\nHYDROLIZED SODIUM HYALURONATE \n\nThis is a super, super tiny (low molecular weight) version of hyaluronic acid, which is intended to penetrate even deeper into the skin and moisturise deeper than standard HA. If your skin wasn't bothered by the Hydrolized hyaluronic acid (another smaller molecule form) in the original formula (still in this one too!) then you might well not be bothered by this version too. Source: [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-sodium-hyaluronate)\n\n//\n\nPROPANEDIOL \n\nCommonly used solvent, humectant and emollient. In short, makes formulas more cosmetically elegant and also helps to pull moisture into the skin and keep it there. Considered very safe and a non-irritant. Further reading: [byrdie article](https://www.byrdie.com/propanediol-for-skin-4773491) [paula's choice ](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/uncategorized/propanediol.html)\n\n//\n\nCAPRYLHYDROXAMIC ACID \n\nAn anti-fungal amino acid derived from coconut oil that acts as a preservative. Limited data regarding safety, but Honest Beauty claims it is safer and less harsh than other commonly used preservatives (take this with a grain of salt as Honest Beauty has an agenda to push and so will be biased). Sources: [truth in ageing ](https://www.truthinaging.com/ingredients/caprylhydroxamic-acid)\n[honest beauty ](https://www.honest.com/blog/wellness/ingredients/what-is-caprylhydroxamic-acid/13775.html)\n\n//\n\nHYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE \n\nUsed as a thickener in cosmetics, gives a nice slippy, gel-like feeling. Water soluble, regarded as safe. \n\n//\n\nXANTHAN GUM \n\nExtremely commonly used thickener and stabiliser. Unlikely to be an issue unless you have a specific sensitivity to it. \n\n\n//\n\nAnd now, let's look at the changes in the top few ingredients: \n\n• The top ingredients, which I usually regard as the most important, have changed in that normal Glycerin has been removed and replaced with Diglycerin, and it's now the 7th ingredient as opposed to the 3rd. Diglycerin is not much different as both are powerful hydrators, but Diglycerin supposedly \"penetrates slower into the skin but gives longer lasting moisture and less sticky, better skin-feel.\" Source: [incidecoder ](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/diglycerin) This might be good for people who have tried the original Premium and found it to be too sticky on the skin! However, due to it being moved lower down, the impact might not be too obvious here. \n\n• Pentylene Glycol has been bumped way up the list from 16th to 4th! This is another thickening ingredient that is key to the sensory feeling of the product, and according to incidecoder its also a moisturiser and helps to hydrate and smooth the skin. However, [the derm review ](https://thedermreview.com/pentylene-glycol/) actually claims it doesn't have any specific skin benefits, but is at least safe and non-irritating. I personally would rather have kept a higher concentration of glycerin or diglycerin in the product as opposed to this as I think they're more intensely moisturising/hydrating to the skin. \n\n• On the other hand, urea has been moved from the 5th ingredient to the 3rd, where glycerin was previously. From [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea): \"A derivative of Urea, that works as a strong moisturizer and humectant meaning that it helps the skin to cling onto water and thus to make it hydrated and elastic.\n\nAccording to manufacturer's data,  Hydroxyethyl Urea has a similar moisturizing ability to glycerin (measured at 5%), but it feels nicer on the skin as it is non-sticky and non-tacky and gives a lubricous and moist feeling to the skin.\" \n\nSo, perhaps this formulation could actually remain equally as hydrating, if not more so, but less sticky due to the removal of glycerin? \n\n//\n\nTLDR: \n\nSo, apart from the ferment all the new additions are commonly used ingredients - nothing toxic, irritating or comodegenic! In theory (best case scenario) it should be even more hydrating due to the extra two forms of hyaluronic acid, and potentially less sticky due to the removal of glycerin and higher concentrations of urea and Diglycerin! Worst case scenario is that the concentrations of HA have been lowered and it won't have the same deeply plumping effect, only time will tell. \n\nThis is getting very long and my thumbs are tired so I'm going to end this post here even though I could potentially go on, hopefully this helps some people make an informed decision on whether they'd like to try the new formulation. I personally have already ordered a bottle as I'm not concerned by the addition of ferments and in general it doesn't look bad at all. Fingers crossed it's somehow even better than the original!!",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%.

It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

Even though I haven't gone to the dermatologist, I don't think I have rosacea but just really dehydrated skin + sensitivity. I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use. I'm also using HA (unrelated to this post) but I think due to my dehydrated skin, it's becoming even more dehydrated. I will try TO's Mandelic and maybe alternate it with Pixi day to day.  I have just read a blog entry about TO Mandelic vs Stratia Mandelic and found it very informative.

Couple questions though: \n\n1) The PH is usually around 3. Most cleansers leave you around a 5 or so. Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time? Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6. I wouldn't want to wash again, what do I do to repeatedly drag down my Ph??",

    "body": "I know CeraVe in the tub is quite popular here, but I just wanted to provide a quick overview of other CeraVe moisturizers for those who aren't familiar.\n\n**NOTE**: All CeraVe moisturizers contain cetearyl alcohol/cetyl alcohol, which may cause breakouts to those who have a sensitivity to fatty alcohols.\n\n**Cerave Moisturizer Overview**\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream) (also known as Cerave \"in the tub\") is a thick, creamy moisturizer with ceramides, hyaluronic acid and petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-lotion) comes in a bottle and is a thinner consistency. It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin’s outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin’s water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin’s barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates—aspirin’s technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics. Shea butter is a rich source of antioxidants.\n\n**Ingredient Lists**\n\n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n>\n> **CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Active Ingredients: Homosalate (12%), Octinoxate (7.5%), Octocrylene (2%), Zinc Oxide (3.5%). \n> Inactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate and Boron Nitride, Dimethicone, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n> \n> **CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Mineral Oil, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Trolamine, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Dimethicone 360, Methylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Triethanolamine, Cetyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Methylparaben, Edetate Disodium, Propylparaben, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Glyceryl stearate SE, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Saccharide Isomerate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 1, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic  Acid, Caprooyl Tetrapeptide-3, Tripeptide-1, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Phytosphingosine, Dextran, Xanthan Gum\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n>\n>Purified Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Emulsifying Wax, Niacinamide, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lauric Acid, Zinc Citrate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Arginine PCA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, EDTA, Sodium PCA, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**\n>\n>Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Petrolatum, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nHopefully this information will be useful to people interested in trying Cerave.",

The AM just left me greasy and shiny immediately and I could never get it to matte. So many blotting papers over the course of the day. On days where i didn't wear makeup and just the moisturizer i had a similar slime feeling on washing, but not quite as pronounced.\nIt was frustrating. =\\ Has anyone else experienced this?

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

Anyway, Biore claims that these products stay on evenly in severely hot and humid weather. This gets me very excited as I live in a very hot and humid area (75% - 85% and 30°C to 37°C during day time) so I would like to test this ~~or these~~ as soon as I get my hands on them. Will be sold from 9th February 2019 in-store with limited availability on Japanese online stores at an earlier date priced at [1944 JPY RRP](https://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?__mk_ja_JP=カタカナ&url=search-alias%3Dbeauty&field-keywords=ビオレ+UV+アスリズム+スキンプロテクト). ~~internal cries and gasp~~ but to be fair it has more grammes. \n\n**Ingredients**:\n\n~~Again, hasn't been released but mentioned:~~\n\n* ~~Hyaluronic Acid, Royal Jelly extract, and Butelyne Glycol (moisturising ingredients).~~\n* ~~White floral scent (made from natural fragrances), Citrus, Musky Wood.~~\n\nEssence: \n\nWater, ethanol, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, ethylhexyl triazone, isopropyl palmitate, (lauryl methacrylate / sodium methacrylate) cross-polymer, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (Uvinul A Plus), hydrogenated polyisobutene, sodium acrylates copolymer, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), dextrin palmitate, BG, (acrylates / C10-30 alkyl acrylate) crosspolymer, alkyl benzoate (C12-15), glycerin, propanediol, potassium hydroxide, glyceryl behenate, hydroxyethylcellulose, (vinyl dimethicone / methicone silsesquioxane) crosspolymer,  pullulan,  cetyl alcohol , sorbitan distearate, stearoyl glutamic acid, arginine, EDTA-2Na,BHT, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronic acid, phenoxyethanol, fragrance.\n\nMilk: \n\nCyclopentasiloxane, zinc oxide, ethanol, water, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, (lauryl methacrylate / sodium methacrylate) cross-polymer, dimethicone, hydrogenated polyisobutene, isopropyl palmitate, talc, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (Uvinul A Plus), titanium oxide, alkyl (C30-45) dimethylsilyl polypropylsilsesquioxane, polymethylsilsesquioxane, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), Butelyne Glycol, PEG-12 dimethicone, triethoxycaprilsilane, PEG-3 dimethicone, Aluminium hydroxide, stearic acid, methicone, BHT, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronate, phenoxyethanol, fragrance.\n\n**So, what are their claims?**\n\n* **Unique durable \"Tough Boost\" technology:**\n   * Supposedly stays on skin even during hot and humid conditions of 40°C and 75% humidity even when skin perspires or sweats.\n   * Super waterproof which lasts 80 minutes through water resistance tests but easily cleansed.\n   * Usable as a makeup base (so...white cast? primer?)\n* **Two versions**:\n   * Water-based essence (70 g): fresh and moist feeling that leaves the skin with a smooth sensation.\n   * Oil-based milk (65 ml): silky touch that glides on the skin with a light-weight sensation, no stickiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ii2mnvhve8621.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3215d1e3ed7e8e9b5eabc5a3b78bcdbe9f3553f6\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that Biore UV SaraSara Line (so, Perfect Milk, Bright Milk, Face Milk and Spray) is repackaged but no reformulation. Only the cardboard packagings seem to change to my eyes.\n\n[Here if you want to see the complete list of Biore UV lines (in Japanese).](https://www.kao.co.jp/bioreuv/itemcheck/) On the table there are star ratings. The first one is its suitability for children and the second is how well it interacts with makeup (whether makeup slip or not).",

In both cases I was sufficiently protected; no burns or tans, no deepening of PIH (and I tan/get PIH very easily -- most US and Asian formulations aren't protective enough for me). For me this works just as well as the old formulation, if not better.\n\n\\--\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised by this reformulation. Not only is it more cosmetically elegant in terms of both shine and white cast, but it has a slightly higher PPD and doesn't contain octocrylene, which was one of the ingredients I didn't quite like in the old formula. \n\nI will continue to purchase this sunscreen and look forward to seeing how it holds up in higher (summer) UV indices.",

    "body": "We see a lot of questions about what people need to do to optimize their odds for each cycle, and, fortunately, there's actually a reasonable amount of evidence-based advice out there.  \n\nThis information is primarily coming from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s committee opinion [Optimizing Natural Fertility](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2016.09.029), though I am also drawing from the physician reference UpToDate’s article [Optimizing Natural Fertility in Couples Planning Pregnancy](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy). These are consensus recommendations that come from a review of the literature broadly, not from any single study.\n\n## Lifestyle factors\n\n**Alcohol intake**\n\nModerate alcohol consumption (less than about 10-14 drinks per week) does not affect time to pregnancy in most studies, and is generally assumed to be fine while TTC. Heavier drinking can increase time to pregnancy, the measure most often used to decide if something is harmful to your prospects while TTC.\n\nMost medical sources will recommend against any drinking during pregnancy. This essentially leaves a gray area of about a week to 10 days during the cycle — prior to ovulation, you are most emphatically not pregnant, and after implantation/a positive test, you are most emphatically pregnant. During the early TWW, you’re not pregnant, but there is potentially an embryo finding its way to the uterus. It is unlikely that moderate drinking does damage at this point (otherwise the time-to-pregnancy statistics would presumably reflect this), but there is no way to say definitively that alcohol does or does not affect the probability of implantation.\n\nUpToDate says:\n>Moderate alcohol consumption <2 drinks/day (1 drink = 10 g of ethanol) probably has no or minimal adverse effects on fertility, but higher levels of alcohol consumption should probably be avoided when attempting pregnancy... most observational studies have reported moderate and heavy female drinkers tend to take longer to achieve a pregnancy and are at higher risk of undergoing an infertility evaluation. Heavy alcohol intake is typically defined as ≥14 drinks per week and moderate intake is usually defined as 3 to 13 drinks per week, but these definitions are arbitrary and vary in different studies… heavy alcohol use by the male partner is related to abnormalities in gonadal function, including reduced testosterone production, impotence, and decreased spermatogenesis\n\n**Caffeine intake**\n\nCaffeine consumption is fine in moderation. Studies do not find increased time to pregnancy/miscarriage rates in people who consume less than about 200-300mg per day on average, the same amount as is recommended during pregnancy. You can usually look up the amount of caffeine in your favorite source, but this is in the ballpark of 1 cup of brewed coffee, 3 shots of espresso, or 4 caffeinated sodas. \n\nUpToDate says:\n>Female fertility does not appear to be affected by caffeine intake less than 200 mg per day, even for women undergoing IVF therapy... therefore, women contemplating pregnancy probably can have one or two 6 to 8 ounce cups of coffee per day without impairing their ability to conceive. \n\nThe ASRM says: \n>Overall, moderate caffeine consumption (1 to 2 cups of coffee per day or its equivalent) before or during pregnancy has no apparent adverse effects on fertility or pregnancy outcomes. In men caffeine consumption has no effect on semen parameters.\n\n**Exercise**\n\nModerate exercise of any kind is generally safe (and recommended!) while TTC. Exercising too much, and keeping yourself at a severe enough energy deficit, puts you at risk for hypothalamic amenorrhea, a condition where you don’t ovulate, or you ovulate with a short luteal phase.\n\nSome studies have suggested it’s best to stay under something like 300-450 minutes of vigorous exercise per week, so less than about an hour per day. It’s reasonable to stay under that approximate average every week, and to keep an eye on your cycles to see if exercise seems to be making them more irregular. Otherwise, exercise is actually generally helpful to the odds of pregnancy, and you can maintain almost all exercise programs during pregnancy as well. Advice to avoid specific motions, like ab work, impact to the abdomen, lifting, or twisting yoga poses, is primarily relevant in later pregnancy, not in the TWW or early first trimester.\n\nUpToDate says:\n>The intensity and duration of exercise can affect female fertility, but the specific type of exercise does not appear to be a factor. In some epidemiological studies, vigorous/intense physical activity was associated with ovulatory infertility, while others have not observed a significant association… however, from a population perspective, inadequate levels of exercise associated with obesity may be a more common cause of anovulation and subsequent infertility than exercise-associated anovulation.\n\n**Weight**\n\nThe best TTC outcomes are for people who are within the normal BMI range. BMI is an imperfect tool, and definitely discuss your weight with your doctor if you have a concern. There is benefit in eating a healthful diet, but the best diet is one that works for you — there’s not evidence that specific diets are beneficial more than others.\n\nUpToDate says:\n\n>Obese and underweight women are at risk of subfertility as well as other adverse effects on health… a BMI of 18.5 to 25 kg/m^2  is associated with little or no increased health risks and, for this reason, is desirable for both women and men irrespective of fertility issues.\n\nThe ASRM says:\n\n>Fertility rates are decreased in women who are either very thin or obese, but data regarding the effects of normal variations in diet on fertility in ovulatory women are few. Whereas a healthy lifestyle may help to improve fertility for women with ovulatory dysfunction, there is little evidence that dietary variations such as vegetarian diets, lowfat diets, vitamin-enriched diets, antioxidants, or herbal remedies improve fertility or affect infant gender.\n\n\n## Sex practices\n\n**When is the fertile period?**\n\nThe fertile period is approximately six days long, and ends on the day of ovulation. The LH surge occurs toward the end of this period; in the textbook cycle, the LH surge occurs on the day prior to ovulation. The best odds of pregnancy come from sex in the three days prior to ovulation, especially if fertile cervical mucus (watery or eggwhite-type) is observed. Day-specific probabilities of pregnancy can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/comments/bo2ruo/bbt_and_opks_are_conflicting_should_i_wait_to/enf5c6q/). Sex outside the fertile window has effectively zero chance of pregnancy. \n\nImportantly, because each cycle is an independent event and can vary, there is no way to predict when the six-day fertile window will fall in advance. Monitoring your own fertility signs each cycle will be more useful for timing sex, and for knowing when to expect your period/a positive test, than using [the predictions of an app](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03007995.2018.1475348). You can find an overview of tracking methods [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/comments/8pogxy/choosing_your_own_ttc_adventure/).\n\n**Sexual frequency**\n\nIt’s not necessary to have sex every day to get pregnant, but it’s not necessary to abstain if you would prefer not to, either. Having sex in any of the three days prior to ovulation day will pretty much do ya. It’s fair to find a sexual frequency somewhere between “sex death march” and “chastity play” that works well for you and your partner.\n\nThe ASRM says:\n>A widely held misperception is that frequent ejaculations decrease male fertility. A retrospective study that analyzed almost 10,000 semen specimens observed that, in men with normal semen quality, sperm concentrations and motility remain normal, even with daily ejaculation. Surprisingly, in men with oligozoospermia, sperm concentration and motility may be highest with daily ejaculation… couples should be informed that reproductive efficiency increases with the frequency of intercourse and is highest when intercourse occurs every 1 to 2 days, but be advised that the optimal frequency of intercourse is best defined by their own preference within that context.\n\n**Lubricants**\n\nIf you need lube, it’s advisable to use one that’s “fertility-friendly”. Regular lubes impair sperm parameters in laboratory tests, making it possible that they have similar effects during TTC sex. Although fertility-friendly lubes have marketing materials that heavily imply they are actively good for sperm, they are not — they’re useful insofar as they don’t harm sperm in lab tests, but they don’t actively help.\n\nThe ASRM says:\n>Whereas commercially available water-based lubricants (e.g., Astroglide, K-Y Jelly, and K-Y Touch) inhibit sperm motility in vitro by 60% to 100% within 60 minutes of incubation, canola oil [and mineral oil have] no similar detrimental effect… hydroxyethylcellulose-based lubricants such as Pre-Seed and ConceivEase also have no demonstrable adverse impact on semen parameters. Although some lubricants adversely affect sperm parameters in vitro, the use of lubricants in couples attempting conception was shown not to affect the cycle fecundability.\n\n**Position and post-sex behaviors**\n\nDo whatever you want to do — it won’t affect odds of pregnancy. Please pee after sex so you don’t get a UTI.\n\nThe ASRM says:\n>Postcoital routines may become ritualized for couples trying to conceive. Although many women think that remaining supine for an interval after intercourse facilitates sperm transport and prevents leakage of semen from the vagina, the belief has no scientific foundation… there is no evidence that coital position affects fecundability. Sperm can be found in the cervical canal seconds after ejaculation, regardless of coital position. Although female orgasm may promote sperm transport, there is no known relationship between orgasm and fertility.",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "Part 2 based on u/winwinnwinnie’s comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/Hair/comments/t82slz/mending_split_ends_part_2_with_castor_oilsebacic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nYou can temporarily mend split ends together with the ingredients polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer. Most products that claim to mend split ends don’t have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here’s the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That’s fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there’s a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don’t let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don’t let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there’s some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can’t tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

What I have found to work the most for me  has been a monthly Glycolic peel (20%) coupled with regular (2-3 times a week) exfoliating and of course niacinamide and Alpha arbutin and sunscreen that blocks against HEV and IR  to stop new pigmentation from forming. It's a nightmare to maintain  but it was the only thing that works. I did try tret, the 0.5 one but it was really really drying on my skin and darkened my pigmentation unless I exfoliated which made it more dry. Such a pita.",

I have issues with my makeup separating/flakes becoming more visible as well :( and I have yet to find a satisfying solution for it. \n\nI'm normal, but lean dry and I feel like I've never seen my moisture barrier fully restored, which is probably leading to the separation of my makeup.. Do you think the hydrating toner made the difference for your makeup as well? Have you been using the same face makeup throughout the usage of these products?",

Minimalist had used same formulation and just changed active. Basically 3 formulas --> 10 products. I had shared this is my stories \\[@avaale\\_\\]. Purely because I found it interesting. [Reproducing those stories here](https://imgur.com/a/rBAGL2Q), if you'd like to take a look.\n\nToday I decided to take a deeper look at the products, since I was getting comments like 'are you trying to say these products are useless?'.  And I had too cursory an examination to be comfortable saying it's good or bad. The Minimalist had outdone themselves with transparency and even mentioned supplier details, for every main active. (Not being sarcastic, I'm genuinely in awe, that they did this, while have the Indian skincare world refuses to declare full list of ingredients).\n\nStarted with\n\n# Vitamin C 20% (SAP) + Ferulic Acid\n\nThey had sourced the SAP from [BASF.](https://www.basf.com/in/en.html) Searching for details on their SAP, I found [this.](http://www.dr-baumann-international.co.uk/science/BASF%20Vitamin%20C.pdf) The technical information sheet for SAP from BASF itself.\n\nA few things stand out.\n\n* The technical info sheet says SAP is **most stable at pH values above 6.5.** [Pubchem compound summary](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Sodium-ascorbate) agrees.  **However the Minimalist site claims that the product is at a pH of 3.5**\n* Now according to the same BASF technical sheet, at pH 3 (details on 3.5 was not provided) , stability falls from 100 to 10 in 60 days. Where as from PH 5 to 7 stability wavers at 90 to 100 till 120 days. Stability at various pHs were tested at 40C\n* Next the ferulic acid. LAA which is a highly unstable form of Vitamin C is usually formulated with ferulic acid to increase stability. All studies I found tested LAA & ferulic acid  [\\[1\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16185284/), [\\[2\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4536008/), [\\[3\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18603326/).  But Ferulic acid as an ingredient does have anti-oxidant properties and is a effective scavenger of free radicals, which could be a reason it was added. Just looking at ferulic acid, [this article](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/491755) states that it penetrates the stratum corneum in at both pH 3 as well 7.2. So it should still work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Salicylic Acid 2%\n\nFrom the site *\"Formulated with* [Curcylic 40](https://www.vantagegrp.com/en-US/Product/Page/ea60363a-7c2a-4907-b245-a763f0475c50/Curcylic-40) *(SA) based on advanced pre-solubilized technology from* [Vantage](https://www.vantagegrp.com/webforward/home)*, US, a global natural chemistry company\"*\n\nNow the INCI name for [Curcylic 40](https://www.cosmeticingredients.co.uk/ingredient/curcylic%C2%AE-40) is Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine & Salicylic acid. As u/Aayu07 pointed out in her Insta stories \"Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine\" part is not mentioned [in the Minimalist website](https://beminimalist.co/products/salicylic-acid-2) at all. I assume they're writing the whole thing SA.\n\nIf you check out [Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-dimethylamine) in Incidecoder.  It not only talks about [Curcylic 40](http://www.lipochemicals.com/products/curcylic-40), but also rather helpfully shows us other products with this ingredient, one of which happens to be [The Ordinary Salicylic 2%](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-salicylic-acid-2-solution) & [The Ordinary Aha 30% + Bha 2% Peeling Solution](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-aha-30-bha-2-peeling-solution-2).  The ordinary does mention [Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-dimethylamine) in [their ingredients list](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-salicylic-acid-2pct-solution-30ml?_ga=2.87650074.34031488.1600610763-39495863.1600610763) by the way. So for[2%, they basically have 5%](https://www.theformulary.co.uk/product/curcylic-40-water-soluble-salicylic-acid/) Curcylic 40 and pH is supposed to be between 3 and 8.  But pH of this product is not mentioned on the minimalist site.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Retinol 2%\n\nFrom the site *\"Contains top quality Granactive Retinoid sourced from* [Grant Industries](https://www.grantinc.com/)*, USA, A leading global supplier in skincare\"*\n\nThe granactive retinoid, they're sourcing from Grant has the [iNCI name Dimethyl Isosorbide (and) Hydroxyp­inacolone Retinoate](https://cdn.thomasnet.com/ccp/00654679/98240.pdf). Which they've split up, maybe due to percentages of concentration. The ordinary did this too.\n\nI found this [list of actives and briefs about them](https://cdn.thomasnet.com/ccp/00654679/98240.pdf) from Grant Industries. Where they mention [these results.](https://imgur.com/Pf6meSk.jpg)\n\n[INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxypinacolone-retinoate) also provides a summary of the ingredient itself and results from manufacturer's tests and results from Estee Lauder comparitive in-vitro study between Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, [tretinoin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tretinoin), good old [retinol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/retinol) and [retinyl palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/retinyl-palmitate) in collagen boosting effectiveness.\n\nTheir bottomline \"*We are really happy to see some innovation happening with retinoids, and we think* ***Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate is a super promising rising star, but it’s not fully proven yet.*** *If you are someone who likes to experiment and try out the newest things, grab your running shoes and try some HPR containing serum now (see product list below :)). If you like the tried and true, however, stick to* [*retinol*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/retinol) *and* [*tretinoin*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tretinoin) *for now and re-examine the question in a couple of years when (hopefully) more research will be available. \"*\n\nManufacturer recommends [upper limit use of 1%](https://imgur.com/Pf6meSk.jpg). This is where retinol comes in I'm guessing. For the other 1% or more. This is the same combination The ordinary uses in their [Granactive retinoid 2% emulsion](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-advanced-retinoid-2pct-30ml).\n\nAlso the other products using this ingredient in Incidecoder is a who's who of brands.\n\n* Sunday Riley A+ High Dose Retinoid Serum\n* Peter Thomas RothProfessional Strength 3% Retinoid Plus\n* Dr. Sam Bunting SkincareFlawless Nightly Serum\n* The Inkey List  Retinol Serum\n* And even surprisingly [Revolution Skincare](https://incidecoder.com/brands/revolution-skincare)Skin Tone Correcting Serum – Granactive Retinoid 2%\n* and much much more.\n\nThe [science behind this product](https://beminimalist.co/products/retinol-2) on the Minimalist website, speaks pretty much only about the granactive retinoid, even though the product is called Retinol 2%. Retinol and Retinoic acid esters are not the same and don't work exactly the same way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Niacinamide 10% + Zinc\n\nFrom the site *\"Formulated with Niacinamide USP Grade (US Pharmacopeia approved) by* [Lonza, Switzerland](https://www.lonza.com/)*, a leading global supplier of Vitamin B3 for over 40 years\"*\n\n[Lonza is definitely big into Niacinamide](https://www.efeedlink.com/search/?q=lonza&q=lonza), and a well known legit supplier.\n\nBut onto more relevant information, I did find this [data sheet from Lonza](https://dermagist.com/shop/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/niacinamide-sheet.pdf) with briefs on a few efficacy studies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Hyaluronic Acid 2% + Vitamin B5\n\nFrom the site *\"The key ingredient is sourced from* [Royal DSM, Netherlands](https://www.dsm.com/corporate/home.html)*; a global science-based company ranked in Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations 2020\"*\n\nBare bones [Data Sheet of Hyaluronic Acid](https://www.essence-plus.com/essence-plus689/program_download/good/201611081542182368.pdf) from manufacturer.\n\nBare bones [Data sheet of Panthenol,](http://technicaldocuments.dsm.com/product_finder/technical_documents/DNP/level10/DNP_DNPNA_000000000000413852_PDS_en.pdf?&&ACSew=ApplicationDataSheet) from Royal DSM. But I'm not sure if they're sourcing this from them too. One thing though, if they're sourcing ingredient from here pH of 5% solution in water is 9 to 10.5. Now the panthenol is probably lesser than 2% since hyaluronic acid is listed first (this is an assumption since Indian companies don't really care about listing in order of %).\n\nI'm not sure how relevant this is but pH of hyaluronic acid is 6 to 7 according to the data sheet. Panthenol is 9 to 10.5. This is a serum that I originally assumed for pH balanced. But the [incidecoder](https://imgur.com/VgOAZJ1.jpg) lists no [buffering](https://incidecoder.com/ingredient-functions/buffering) agent. [Skincarisma](http://www.skincarisma.com/products/analyze?utf8=%E2%9C%93&product%5Bingredient%5D=Aloe+Vera+Juice%2C+Dimethyl+Isosorbide%2C+Sodium+Hyaluronate%2C+Propanediol%2C+Ethoxydiglycol%2C+Panthenol%2C+Phenoxyethanol%2C+Pullulan%2C+Ethylhexylglycerin%2C+Hydroxyethylcellulose%2C+Xanthan+Gum%2C+Sclerotium+Gum%2C+Trisodium+Ethylenediamine+Disuccinate%2C+Lecithin) doesn't mention a pH adjuster either. So I'm very curious to see what the actual pH of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: I'm not a cosmetic formulator and while I roughly know ingredient purposes, I've no idea how all the ingredients would interact with each other and affect the pH. Which why I started this with 'I'm not sure, how relevant this is'.**\n\nI did ask a friend who purchased this product to check pH and if or when she gets back to me, I'll update this accordingly.\n\nAlso while the science behind the products had this to say *'Not all topical Hyaluronic acid serums are equally effective as the molecular size of HA determines the depth of its delivery in the skin. The smaller the molecule size, the deeper it penetrates the dermis. Larger-molecule size HA stays at the epidermis and provides surface hydration only.'*  The data sheet attached above mentions a molecular mass of 1.6 MDa. This is [middle molecular weight](https://www.nayaglow.com/2019/04/30/hyaluronic-acid-explained/).\n\nSo is this inherently bad? Not necessarily, as ecowell explains in detail in [this post.](https://www.theecowell.com/blog/hyaluronicacid) All sources are cited. Also [this](https://madridge.org/journal-of-chemistry-and-research/ijcr-1000103.pdf).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Lactic Acid 10% + Hyaluronic Acid 2%\n\nFrom the site \"*Formulated with natural and pure ingredients sourced from leading global suppliers such as* [Corbion](http://www.corbion.com/) *and Royal DSM, Netherlands\"*\n\nI think we can safely assume that HA in this product is sourced from Royal DSM. And I've already gone in-depth into it above. So directly onto, lactic acid. And we have the data sheet [here](https://www.corbion.com/static/downloads/datasheets/56pdf/pds-purac%20hs%2088%20(0406).pdf). Nothing that alarms me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kojic Acid 2% + Alpha Arbutin 1%\n\nFrom the site *\"Formulated with the most stable form of kojic acid, Kojic Dipalmitate, sourced from* [Alpha Environmental](https://www.alpha-environmental.com/)*, USA, a leading global supplier\"*\n\nI found nothing. Zilch. Not even a info page on their own site. Just a [listing](https://www.alpha-environmental.com/products.html) that shows they sell both Kojic Acid Dipalmitate as well as Alpha arbutin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# AHA 30% + BHA 2%\n\nFrom the site \" *All ingredients are sourced from leading global suppliers such as Fortune 500 Chemours Company, USA, and Vantage, US\"*\n\nSince we already BHA is [Curcylic 40](https://www.cosmeticingredients.co.uk/ingredient/curcylic%C2%AE-40) ie Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine & Salicylic acid, and it's been analysed above, I'm moving on the AHAs.\n\nChemours offers a variety of [Glycolic Acid products](https://www.chemours.com/en/brands-and-products/glycolic-acid) for different purposes. Their [Glypure TM](https://www.chemours.com/en/-/media/files/glycolic-acid/glypure-cosmetic-grade-glycolic-acid-brochure.pdf) range which comes in 3 variants are our best bet and Glypure GL which is glycolide, the cyclic diester of glycolic acid. I found a lot of information\n\n* [Technical Spec](https://www.chemours.com/en/-/media/files/glycolic-acid/glypure-70-spec-sheet.pdf) and [Material Safety Data Sheet](https://www.3eonline.com/ImageServer/ImageViewer.aspx?id=3Q%2FfAR8ne%2FvPh6syVnSymkS%2BBDo8OjmbVocxRCMEgeH9DOXp3rOno2bBstgZQVl6ddB5zxzJXIW7nbmF5mKrdg%3D%3D) for Glypure 70\n* [Technical Spec](https://cms.chempoint.com/ChemPoint/media/ChemPointSiteMedia/PDF%20Docs/C-10269_Glypure_99_specsheet_1.pdf) and a [2017 MSDS](https://cms.chempoint.com/ChemPoint/media/ChemPointSiteMedia/PDF%20Docs/Glypure-99-SDS-_1.pdf) for Glypure 99\n* [Product Information](https://www.in-cosmetics.com/__novadocuments/670288?v=637172315377900000) of Glypure GL\n* [Brochure](https://www.chemours.com/en/-/media/files/glycolic-acid/glypure-glycolic-acid-sell-sheet.pdf) with manufacturer studies and much more that I'm not adding here.\n\nHowever very little on Glypure™ Preneutralized which I feel is the actual product used. All we know about this is \"• Pre-neutralized Glypure™ is an aqueous solution neutralized with ammonium hydroxide. It is available in a variety of pH levels—2.25, 3.25, 3.8, 4.0, 4.4—as well as custom pH.\"\n\nIncase I'm mistaken I'm leaving other info attached above.\n\nLogically lactic is probably from [Corbion](http://www.corbion.com/) (which is not mentioned) and BHA from [Vantage](https://www.vantagegrp.com/webforward/home), which is mentioned.\n\nI found no mention of mandelic acid in both Chemours and Vantage's sites. I've no clue where it's sourced from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Apple Cider Vinegar 2% + Glycolic Acid 10%\n\nFrom the site \"*It is formulated with high-grade ingredients sourced from a Fortune 500 company, Chemours, USA\"*\n\nThis obviously refers to Glycolic Acid as discussed above. No idea about source of ACV.\n\nBut Neemli and Minimalist, 2 brands recently picked this combo to formulate products with. So I had a cursory glance at studies and found [this one study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31328306/) where \"*A total of 22 subjects (11 AD and 11 healthy controls) were enrolled. Subjects soaked both of their forearms for 14 days, with one arm in dilute ACV (0.5% acetic acid) and the other in water 10 minutes daily. Transepidermal water loss and pH were measured pre- and post-treatment*.\" Conclusion: Dilute ACV soaks have no significant effect on skin barrier integrity but caused skin irritation in a majority of subjects.\n\nNeemli's site did mention this *\"A natural astringent, Apple Cider Vinegar helps increase the blood flow to the skin, minimizing the appearance of pores. It also helps balance the skin’s pH to keep it functioning optimally and fighting acne-causing bacteria.\"* as the reason it was added.\n\nI'll have to look into this deeper later, but for now, this combination baffles me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Benzoyl Peroxide 2% + Glycolic Acid 5%\n\nFrom the site *\"Contains top quality ingredients sourced from Vantage Specialty, USA, ranked in the top 30% of the most sustainable companies in the world by EcoVadis\"*\n\nAnd we're back to Vantage. Glycolic Acid has to be from Chemours. so the BP is from Vantage.\n\nVantage markets BP as [Curoxyl 42](https://www.vantagegrp.com/en-US/Product/Page/65ea0c11-a095-463f-a102-a19ccd2ae9bb/Curoxyl-42). The INCI name is Aqua & Benzoyl peroxide. Found the [brochure](https://pdfhost.io/v/lWMc.doh5_PowerPoint_Presentation.pdf) and I find this product quite intriguing since they claim that it's a *\"aqueous based, micronized benzoyl peroxide dispersion (40%) in the form of a gel that can replace traditional BPO due to its low irritation profile\"* while normally I find BP quite irritating.\n\nNo mention of pH on the site, while Bp is supposedly 4.8 to 6.6. And glycolic acid traditionally potent at much a lower pH. This study on glycolic acid's  antibacterial activity against *C. acnes* found it [most potent at 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64545-9), while it did kill C.acnes upto 4.5. Less efficient killing was found at pH 5.\n\nSo I'm curious about the pH of this product too.\n\n# \n\n# My thoughts\n\n* I didn't find anything supporting or refuting Consumer testing results that's stated on the website.\n* I'm most excited for Retinol 2%, since The granactive retinoid emulsion was my love before I was prescribed Adapalene and Tret.\n* All in all, while the company has indulged in lesser than savoury practices regarding packaging and I'm not certain about the research they did into ingredients / formulation themselves or their passion for skincare, I do believe that they maybe better than a lot of indie brands out there.\n* A insta video by a popular beauty editor who was talking about the minimalist had been shared with me. They had said some sourcing seems legit and others shady. While sources for ACV and mandelic acid was not revealed, all others seem to be legit. I found no shadiness, let me know if you've found any.\n* Products that don't quite convince me / I still have doubts about are\n\n1. Vitamin C 20% (SAP) + Ferulic Acid  (pH reasons)\n2. Benzoyl Peroxide 2% + Glycolic Acid 5%  (pH reasons)\n3. Apple Cider Vinegar 2% + Glycolic Acid 10%  (combination)\n4. Hyaluronic Acid 2% + Vitamin B5  (pH reasons)\n5. Kojic Acid 2% + Alpha Arbutin 1% (no details, no idea what to think)\n\n* The actual results and efficacy is yet to be seen, and I'll personally primarily judge them on that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso speaking about popular bloggers / influencers, a lot of info about minimalist that's been going around in social media is clearly from this sub.\n\nAs you guys know this is a completely non-profit platform that we're using to educate ourselves and others, the other contributors and I gain nothing from doing all this research and sharing it, And while I have no problems with people sharing and using this information, I do wish credit is given where credit is due. And if you're asking \"how do we credit? you're anonmyous\", u/Aayu07 and I both started Instagram handles. Well she has had hers for years. I started it because she wanted to credit me for sharing some glycolic acid stuff. And I'd appreciate it if you credit me if you use this information anywhere. Just DM me or u/Aayu07 or any other user here to find out whether they wanted to be credited. Basic courtesy guys. For instance u/kparwal and u/e-lusion were also credited when u/Aayu07 used their findings.\n\nJust to be clear, ***\"I*** ***do not*** ***consent to this post or any part of it being reposted on any social media (including but not limited to YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat).

After all, there's not really much TO these formulations, and as long as they keep their prices low, they're entering a HUGE market, and they're bound to succeed... Even more so that the Ordinary! Because the Ordinary entered a market that was pretty saturated, and the Indian market is STARVED of basic formulations. \n\nI DO wish they'd use INCI names for their ingredients, because the Derma Essentia moisturizer used a proprietary name for their emulsifier, and I was so excited, I only found out later that Polysorbate 20 was in there... Not fungal safe 😐. But I'm glad these products ARE minimal! \n\n... That being said, chemist products are still cheaper, and Be Minimalist's products are too pricey for me 😂 Talk to me when I make my own money, maybe I'll have all their products, who knows! ... Except for that ACV one. I do NOT understand why they couldn't just use good old citric or malic acid for the pH 😂",

Glycolic acid is pretty strong in itself, what's the need to pair itwith ACV? which isn't shown to be much beneficial for skin.\n\nHaving said that I'm waiting anxiously for product reviews.",

    "body": "Garmi aaa gayi haiiii\\~ dhoop badh hui hai aur heatwaves pardhaar chuke hai 🥵🥵 obviously we need sunscreens! I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise!

I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

Pictured above.\n\n**Fragrance:**  ~~Yes. An extremely artificial flowery scent. Dissipates, but I find it slightly annoying while applying.~~. None. \n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:** Got this when my previous gel moisturiser got over. I had already used the other 3 and I started using this with fairly high expectations. And I was / am disappointed. **It's not bad. It moisturises**. But I was expecting a jelly like moisturiser that sinks in easily while still packing a moisture -filled punch. And this is not that. It takes way longer than I'd like to sink in.  I either have to compromise on the quantity I use and the moisturised feeling or go around feeling oiler than I would like. It's the kind of product that does everything to some level, but none of them spectacularly or to an above average level.\n\nAs far as healing for barrier damage is concerned, I get way faster results from the other three Bioderma moisturisers and I pretty much never touch this for that purpose after the initial trial period.\n\nThis does have a few de-pigmenting ingredients, but so far I've not been able to see anything results that I can directly attribute to this product.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**  Moisturised feeling. I've used this with actives that are known to cause dryness and faced no issues. It can handle drying actives. No glow noticed. No standout effects.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:**  Can't think of anything. If you start using this with low / zero expectations, you'll probably like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status:**  Jury's still out, haven't decided. But as of now it's a **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n\n***Additional Notes on whether the product is fake****\n\n**Tl;dr: Old tube is genuine, NOT FAKE.  Confirmed by brand too. Review still stands**\n \n\nOn 24th October 2023\n\n1. Some people's experiences does not coincide with mine in important ways such as fragrance and I'm now wondering if mine was a fake, I contacted Bioderma but haven't received any info yet. But I'll update and or delete the review when I do get it. \n\n2 Of 5 people, 4 can't smell anything from their product and 1 can (but doesn't sound similar to my description. & Bioderma still hasn't replied :(\n\nOn 1st November 2023\n\n1. Bioderma replied on Instagram that my moisturiser is genuine, By the time they replied, I had already repurchased another tube from Tira, to check for myself. The new tube has already arrived and they are identical in all ways. Including from the same batch 😅. \n\n2. New tube arrived with bioderma samples, which jogged my memory. Old tube had also arrived with samples. Two of which I still have unopened. So chances of old tube being fake is 0.\n\n2. But the smell was still different. My old tube smells like a flower. My new one doesn't smell of anything, unless I put copious amounts on my arm and put my nose in it and even then it smells like a teeny bit chemically, Thats all. I can understand why most people say it smells like nothing, because that's what I would have said too, if I wasn't looking that closely. \n\n3. Anyway, I was breaking my head trying to figure out why my old tube is has that smell, And then it struck me. I had a perfume leak incident in my travel kit many months ago. Most of the stuff is replaced and I don't still have that perfume, so I'd kind of forgotten. The tube was new then and I didn't use it enough to note the frag or lack thereof. I think the gel or top of the packaging still smells of the perfume and that's why I was mistaken. \n\nSo that was much ado about nothing, apologies. \n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Atoderm Intensive baume\n\n**MRP:** 786 for 75 ml.

It doesn't smell exactly like grease but it reminds me of grease. It's a dusty, chemically smell that I associate with Bioderma moisturisers. Like if you've smelled any of the Bioderma moisturisers, all except the gel-creme have the same DNA, though they are not exactly the same. It's not repulsive, but it's there. Does dissipate after a minute or so.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  I bought this on a whim after a few friends raved about it. They were so so so right. This was the second bioderma cream moisturiser I used, so I knew it would help with barrier issues but it does so much more. When I first used this, I had oily to combination skin and I never ever used cream moisturisers by choice. I had a misconception that since I was an acne / clog prone, oily skinned person, that I need to stay as far away from cream moisturisers as possible. This is the moisturiser than changed my mind.\n\nIf I want a one and done PM product when I'm too tired or too lazy or too whatever, I reach for it.\n\nIf I want a one and done travel moisturiser, this is the only one I pack.\n\nSuper dry climate, this is it.\n\nAirplane dryness, this is it.\n\nSlight tingling, or signs of barrier damage incoming, this is it.\n\nBarrier damage, this is it.\n\nDerm procedures, this is it.\n\nBut in even other scenarios such as humid climate or AM routine, where this is NOT my ideal or go-to product, it still does a decent job. It holds its own. It can be greasy but hey it can be worked with. It does an amazing job moisturising without clogging pores for me.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**\n\nMoisturised feeling.  Super soft skin. Heals Barrier overnight depending on damaged your skin is. It's my tried and tested barrier recovery product.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Have repurchased 3 or 4 times. Will continue to repurchase till it's discontinued. Love it. **Holy Grail.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Bioderma Sensibio Forte Rapid soothing cream\n\nMRP: 1499 for 40 ml.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above. Heavy feeling on the skin.\n\n**Ingredient List :**  [Aqua/​Water/​Eau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Beeswax (Cera Alba)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Glycyrrhetinic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycyrrhetinic-acid), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [Palmitic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/palmitic-acid), [Stearic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/stearic-acid), [Sorbitan Sesquioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-sesquioleate),[Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Mannitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol), [Xylitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract), 🌟[**Allantoin**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)**, 🌟** [**Sodium Pca**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-pca), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol),[1,2-Hexanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/1-2-hexanediol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Triethanolamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/triethanolamine)\n\n**Fragrance:**  Yes. A different version of that greasy smell.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  This was first prescribed by my then dermatologist for application after a MNRF session. And since then till Atoderm intensive baume came into my life, this was a re-buy. **Slightest irritation, and I used to apply it**. I have urticaria, this helped with many of my allergic reaction episodes. **Skin will feel greasy, but it was soothing at the same time.** As soon as the greasiness disappeared, I used to reapply. **This was never a daily use moisturiser for me.** I kind of used it like medicine. As and when needed, at the quantity, I needed. However the soothing it provides does overlap with the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume and I've not repurchased this in more than a year. I simply use that, wherever I previously reached for this. I have a feeling this is a gold standard product for certain sub set of people who need a rich, soothing moisturiser, but for most of us, this can be a pass.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Moisturised feeling. Very soothing on irritated skin.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use. And the price. Damn expensive for 40 ml.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** As of now, I don't miss it in my routine, so **WNRP.** Considering the price and the benefit from the others, unless you have sensitive skin or are advised by your derm to try this out, I'd skip it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Cicabio Crème\n\n**MRP:** 1399 for 40 ml\n\n**Texture:** Green tinged Lotion.  Pictured above. Feels heavy for a lotion.\n\n**Ingredient List :**[Aqua/​Water/​Eau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), 🌟[**Zinc Oxide**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-oxide)**,** [Sorbitan Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-stearate), [PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-30-dipolyhydroxystearate), [Butylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butylene-glycol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Copper Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/copper-sulfate), 🌟 [**Mannitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol)**,** [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), 🌟 [**Xylitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol)**,** [Zinc Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-sulfate), [Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Vine Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/vitis-vinifera-vine-extract), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose),[Laureth-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-3), 🌟[**Asiaticoside**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiaticoside)**, 🌟**[**Madecassic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/madecassic-acid)**, 🌟** [**Asiatic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiatic-acid), [Hydroxyethylcellulose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethylcellulose), [Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract)\n\n**Fragrance:** A subtler version of that greasy smell, a teeny bit herbal, to be this dissipates the quickest of all the bioderma moisturisers.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  😍 I love it. I love it only slightly lesser than Atoderm Intensive Baume and mostly because it's comparatively way more expensive. 😅.  I wouldn't use this daily, there's no need, but definitely a barrier saviour product. I wake up with such soft glowy skin even when it's damaged, like the healthy part of my skin feel look glowy even if skin damage texture is still there to an extent.\n\n***Comparing with baume, since I use them both for similar reasons :*** I originally had the impression this was heavier than Atoderm Intensive Baume and that it forms a suffocating seal on the skin. This isn't true under normal circumstances. It does feel suffocating when barrier is SEVERELY damaged but not otherwise. I applied this on half and the baume of half my face to check if there's any major difference and no. **No functional difference noticed.**\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Soothing, Healing, Moisturising, it does it all.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The price. And for a lotion consistency product it's quite heavy.\n\n**Repurchase Status**: When I started writing this review, this was going to be a WNRP, because between all of them, I'd only repurchase Atoderm Intensive Baume, but ngl, the more I thought about it, I find myself wavering. **This is a WRP.** I don't know when, but I'll probably come back to this at some point.\n\n# \n\n# Comparision\n\n***Ranking based on Use Case***\n\n||1st Choice|2nd Choice|3rd Choice|4th Choice|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|As an AM Moisturiser|None of them|Intensive Gel-creme|Intensive Baume|Sensibio Forte|\n|As an PM Moisturiser|Intensive Baume, Cicabio, Intensive Gel-creme, Sensibio Forte||||\n|Time taken for Healing|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte, Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme||\n|Versatility (Can work for any of the above use cases in a pinch)|Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte|\n\nI've ranked them after considering the following factors (these are the most important deciding factors for me personally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As  AM Moisturiser:***\n\n**I would use absolutely none of them as an AM moisturiser.** That doesn't mean they can't be used as such. it's just that none of them absorb in minutes or 'set' when you use a normal amount or slather it on. They're all occlusive but not the matte kind. Intensive Gel-creme is the easiest one of them to use as an AM moisturiser.\n\nThis gif will show you how long it took for them to sink into my arm, which is way dryer than my skin. But caveat is that I don't always use a AM moisturizer (infact I very very rarely do), but i when I do, I slather it on like below. If you use a teeny teeny weeny bit, you might not face this issue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/isq9941kddwb1.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As PM Moisturiser:***\n\nI can't actually decide I love them all. Atleast I love Intensive Baume, Sensibio Forte and Cicabio, but there's nothing to complain about the gel creme either. ✨ **Skin just looks so nourished with all the Bioderma moisturisers.** ✨  If you use only a tiny amount, all of them will sink in by morning. I like to slather them all on. And how much is absorbed by morning completely depends on how damaged my skin is. If I catch signs of barrier damage early and use them, they'll sink in. If I've completely wrecked my skin, there will be residue when I wake up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***On healing***\n\nTime taken for healing: shortest to longest, ranked above. But honestly, most people don't need a moisturiser stronger than Intensive Baume even for barrier damage.\n\n**Note on the likeliness of clogging pores and causing acne: I've personally not had breakouts from any of them. None of them caused acne for me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\n👉🏾 All 4 moisturisers are good.\n\n👉🏾 For most people Sensibio Forte & Cicabio is not necessary. Unless you have facial wounds, surgery on your face, intensive derm procedures, very bad rosacea and are prescribed or recommended these, I'd say skip them.  People with sensitive skin may like them though.\n\n👉🏾 If you have oily skin, you might like Bioderma Intensive gel creme.\n\n👉🏾 Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume has ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol. Ratio unknown, will link if I can find anything.\n\n👉🏾 I've seen a fair number of people mention that baume is heavy and breaks them out in this sub. Something to be aware of.\n\n👉🏾  If I had to suggest only one product, from the above, hands down it'll be Atoderm Intensive Baume and it's best cost - benefit wise too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Im going to buy the cica +arnica to try out next. The Atoderm Creme Ultra doesn't seem interesting enough to me to want to try. If I can get a mini or sample somewhere just to update this post, I'll do that.\n\nETA2: After writing so much I still like left somethings out , so I'm editing to add them. Apologies 🙏\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs with any other review, YMMV",

Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

    "body": "So I always thought that ferments were a \"Asian skin care\" thing. But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit? What do they do for YOUR skin? Your fav AB fermented products or ones you are wanting to try?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are some of the leave-on skin care from [Sephora's \"Best Selling\" skin

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

I have uploaded a video and images for the comparison but I'll first start with the review.\n\nReview\n\n* *Your skin type-* Sahara desert dry skin\n* *Your current climatic conditions-* Hot af\n* *Your current AM/PM routine-*  \n**AM**\\- Nothing, I only apply sunscreen if have to go out  \n**PM**\\- Ponds cold cream (for my double cleanse), cleanser (Neutrogena hydro boost cleanser), tret (twice a week), ordinary peeling solution (once a month), innisfree jeju volcanic mask (once a month), moisturizer (I have like 4-5 moisturizers that I use)\n* *Your age- 22*\n\n**The Ordinary AHA BHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* More than a year\n* *Ingredient List-* Glycolic Acid, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Daucus Carota Sativa Extract, Propanediol, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Salicylic Acid, Potassium Citrate, Lactic Acid, Tartaric Acid, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Xanthan gum, Polysorbate 20, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n* *Holy Grail but Will Not Repurchase-* I fucking love it, it made my skin so smooth and my complexion brighter. I never had any skin problems before as such, but it just made everything better. I never experienced any sort of purging or irritation with this peel. Although, I will not be repurchasing it because I paid ₹1200 for this even though it lasted more than a year. The availability is an issue too.\n\n**Minimalist AHA BHA PHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* 2 times\n* *Ingredient List-* Aloe Vera Juice, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Gluconolactone, Mandelic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lecithin\n* *Holy Grail but Will Repurchase-* I loved it in the very first go, I saw immediate results much like the ordinary. I did not experience any sort of irritation or purging with this either. I honestly don't have much to say because the results are pretty much identical for both.\n\nComparison\n\n**Texture**\n\nAs you can see in the video below, apart from the colour difference the minimalist one a bit flowier than the ordinary. Also, I like the shape of the dropper of the minimalist one, it's pointy rather than the round tip and it looks classier ( at least to my eyes). That is really it when it comes to the texture and the feel of the products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/mobbuo/video/dxwg1bxpdes61/player\n\n**Application**\n\n*note- i forgot to take my before pics, pls forgive a newbie 😔😔😔*\n\nI did a half-n-half application of the peels. The immediate thing I noticed was the way they applied, ordinary being thicker is slightly easier to spread because it doesn't drip as much as the minimalist.\n\nAlso, idk what it is about minimalist peel but I had to apply it a tad bit more than its counterpart.\n\nThird, minimalist did not burn AT ALL while the ordinary always burns a little, even after a year of consistent use.\n\nIn the images below you can see my skin right after the application of the peels, the results are very much the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2kdr544sdes61.jpg?width=3464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8425c82498afb958897ee5482979129fdc1c07d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In Conclusion-** I like both, I don't have a preference for one over the other when it comes to the results. The only thing is that minimalist is cheaper and easily available, so I will go for that one instead of the ordinary.",

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOP CREAMS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. \\[Dr. G\\] Red Blemish Clear Soothing Cream - 4.22/5 (9,894 Reviews)**\n\n70ml/36,000 KRW - $31.29\n\nWater (Aqua/Eau), **Glycerin**, Butylene Glycol, C 13-16 Isoparaffin, **Niacinamide**, C 12-14 Isoparaffin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Pentylene Glycol, Vinyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Panthenol**, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tromethamine, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, **Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside,** Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, **Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid.**\n\n*This line from this brand is extremely well-known and popular in Korea.

The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing.

This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things.

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

Ferments have been all the rage recently, with *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (living yeast) extract and *Saccharomyces ferment* being the two I see the most. While I could not find any clinical dermatology studies done on sake as a ferment in skin, we may be able to glean some understanding into the benefits of sake by examining both ferments and koji (kojic acid) itself.\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of yeast used for brewing beer. In one study, saccharomyces cerevisiae extract (SCE) was studied in several formulations. One contained SCE, and/or vitamins A, C, and E, and was patch-tested on the back of volunteers. The subjects were then tested for transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin moisture (SM), skin microrelief (SMR), and free radical protection in 3 hour, 15 days, and 30 day intervals.\n\n>*\"Our results suggest that vitamins and SCE showed effects in \\[skin moisture\\] SM and \\[skin microrelief\\] SMR. Only formulations containing SC had long term effects in the improvement of SMR. Thus, these kinds of evaluations are very important in cosmetics development to evaluate the best risk and benefit correlation.\"¹*\n\nAnother fungi ferment, saccharomyces ferment, has similar benefits. It is obtained through the fermentation of saccharomyces - a genus of fungi that is known as the baker's yeast - in the presence of metal ions. The yeast is credited with promoting good skin condition and is frequently found in products that reduce redness.\n\nThe other half of sake worth discussing, koji (kojic acid) is a skin-lightening agent and antioxidant. It is a tyrosinase (an enzyme that controls the production of melanin) inhibitor, but not as effective as other tyrosinase inhibitors like licorice extract. \"In combination with allantoin and other proper ingredients in sunscreen preparations, the mixture can inhibit UV-caused erythema and accelerate wound healing.\"² Unfortunately, it can also be sensitizing to some skin and create irritation.\n\nFrom this break down, we can assume that sake contains some sort of very mild exfoliating, humectant, and whitening properties, though it is important to keep in mind that there are no studies that I could find into the benefits of sake when applied topically, so this is all assumptions based on the chemical makeup.\n\nThe next ingredients on the list are ceramides 3 and 6. If you've been following my writings, you already know that ceramides are naturally found in the skin and help maintain the skin barrier. In fact, our skin's natural lipids are 35-40&#37; ceramides.\n\nSlightly more exciting is placental protein. Derived from animal placenta ([in this case, horse](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5fgonk/psa_kikumasamune_does_not_use_ingredient_derived/)), it is considered to be a safe ingredient that does not deliver any metabolic or endocrine activity. Again though, there was not much precedent that I could find on the benefits of including this ingredient specifically, however egg whites have been used for centuries on skin to make skin temporarily feel tighter and appear smoother.\n\n*Fun fact: Umbilical extract has precedent for unrestricted use in Japan, except for certain products.³*\n\nFinally, we arrive at the stars of this product: arbutin and licorice root extract. Arbutin, an ingredient primarily used for it's antioxidant properties as well as skin bleaching. It is a natural hydroquinone, derived synthetically or from bearberry plants. Once on the skin, it converts into hydroquinone and acts as a tyrosinase inhibitor. While not as effective as hydroquinone, it lacks the concerns of hydroquinone thus has become more popular in recent years.\n\nLicorice root extract is similarly a tyrosinase inhibitor as well as an anti-irritant - with some studies signalling that it may be able to absorb UVA and UVB rays. It is more effective than kojic acid and some studies put it at 75x more effective than ascorbic acid ([though Dr Dray raises some interesting points regarding the efficacy of L-AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JxO6sVMJzM)). \"The chief constituent of licorice root is glycyrrhizin, present in concentrations that range from 5 to 24 percent depending on the variety of licorice used.\"²\n\n# My Experience\n\n**My skin type:** Rosacean, acne-prone and extremely irritation-prone\n\nFirstly, the pump on my bottle broke off rather spectacularly when my bottle took a tumble from my tiny bathroom counter top. I'm not sure why this product comes with a pump applicator in the first place, as it frequently would dispense more product than I needed, which I suppose is fine as I was able to spread it down my neck and chest, but it was still was a bit of a shock to get a whole handful of it on the first pump. This experience doesn't seem limited to me, so I really recommend decanting this product into a better dispenser if you can, like a spritz top bottle.\n\nPackaging aside, the first time I used the High Moist lotion, I was pretty nervous. It's a very runny product, sharing a consistency with water, and if you've read my blog at all you know that I am a fairly dry-skinned lady. To my surprise and delight though, it was *uber* moisturizing. I applied it fresh out of the shower, in place of my HadaLabo Premium, and instantly my skin just felt soft and supple. I imagine much of this is due to the placenta protein filling in the gaps of the skin cells and creating a \"smooth\" texture as well as the ceramides, which tend to plump up my skin and make it feel softer.\n\nThe fragrance was also so mild that frankly, the smell of sake overpowered it. Thankfully this smell seemed to dissipate after a few minutes of application, and my rosacea did not flare up from the inclusion of fragrance. Over the next few days, I used the High Moist in place of my HadaLabo, and then began to combine it at night with the HadaLabo Premium on top. It worked well with oils and other moisturizing products on top - no pilling or strange film to report.\n\nIn two weeks, my skin looked brighter and felt smoother, though none of my dark spots had faded. Unfortunately, like most products with ferments, it began to break me out after this time. The good news though is that it doesn't appear to break me out immediately, unlike every other ferment, and the smoothness lasted for a few days after I discontinued use, which means I may try to use it sparingly once my skin heals.\n\n# Sources\n\n1.

The subjects were then tested for transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin moisture (SM), skin microrelief (SMR), and free radical protection in 3 hour, 15 days, and 30 day intervals.\n\n>*\"Our results suggest that vitamins and SCE showed effects in \\[skin moisture\\] SM and \\[skin microrelief\\] SMR. Only formulations containing SC had long term effects in the improvement of SMR. Thus, these kinds of evaluations are very important in cosmetics development to evaluate the best risk and benefit correlation.\"¹*\n\nAnother fungi ferment, saccharomyces ferment, has similar benefits. It is obtained through the fermentation of saccharomyces - a genus of fungi that is known as the baker's yeast - in the presence of metal ions. The yeast is credited with promoting good skin condition and is frequently found in products that reduce redness.\n\nThe other half of sake worth discussing, koji (kojic acid) is a skin-lightening agent and antioxidant. It is a tyrosinase (an enzyme that controls the production of melanin) inhibitor, but not as effective as other tyrosinase inhibitors like licorice extract. \"In combination with allantoin and other proper ingredients in sunscreen preparations, the mixture can inhibit UV-caused erythema and accelerate wound healing.\"² Unfortunately, it can also be sensitizing to some skin and create irritation.\n\nFrom all of this, we can assume that sake contains some sort of very mild exfoliating, humectant, anti-aging, and whitening properties, but the studies are fairly minimal thus far. To add, it is important to remember that not all skin ingredients penetrate deeper than the first few layers of the stratum corneum (the upper-most layer of the epidermis, what we see with our eyes), so long-term studies in vivo over many years tend to be the most reliable (hence why your doctor may be more apt to prescribe you tretinoin \\[Retin-A\\] than a newer drug).\n\nThe next ingredients on the list are ceramides 3 and 6. If you've been following my writings, you already know that ceramides are naturally found in the skin and help maintain the skin barrier. In fact, our skin's natural lipids are 35-40&#37; ceramides.\n\nSlightly more exciting is placental protein. Derived from animal placenta ([in this case, horse](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5fgonk/psa_kikumasamune_does_not_use_ingredient_derived/)), it is considered to be a safe ingredient that does not deliver any metabolic or endocrine activity. Again though, there was not much precedent that I could find on the benefits of including this ingredient specifically, however egg whites have been used for centuries on skin to make skin temporarily feel tighter and appear smoother.\n\n*Fun fact: Umbilical extract has precedent for unrestricted use in Japan, except for certain products.³*\n\nFinally, we arrive at the stars of this product: arbutin and licorice root extract. Arbutin, an ingredient primarily used for it's antioxidant properties as well as skin bleaching. It is a natural hydroquinone, derived synthetically or from bearberry plants. Once on the skin, it converts into hydroquinone and acts as a tyrosinase inhibitor. While not as effective as hydroquinone, it lacks the concerns of hydroquinone thus has become more popular in recent years.\n\nLicorice root extract is similarly a tyrosinase inhibitor as well as an anti-irritant - with some studies signalling that it may be able to absorb UVA and UVB rays. It is more effective than kojic acid and some studies put it at 75x more effective than ascorbic acid ([though Dr Dray raises some interesting points regarding the efficacy of L-AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JxO6sVMJzM)). \"The chief constituent of licorice root is glycyrrhizin, present in concentrations that range from 5 to 24 percent depending on the variety of licorice used.\"²\n\n# My Experience\n\n**My skin type:** Rosacean, acne-prone and extremely irritation-prone\n\nFirstly, the pump on my bottle broke off rather spectacularly when my bottle took a tumble from my tiny bathroom counter top. I'm not sure why this product comes with a pump applicator in the first place, as it frequently would dispense more product than I needed, which I suppose is fine as I was able to spread it down my neck and chest, but it was still was a bit of a shock to get a whole handful of it on the first pump. This experience doesn't seem limited to me, so I really recommend decanting this product into a better dispenser if you can, like a spritz top bottle.\n\nPackaging aside, the first time I used the High Moist lotion, I was pretty nervous. It's a very runny product, sharing a consistency with water, and if you've read my blog at all you know that I am a fairly dry-skinned lady. To my surprise and delight though, it was *uber* moisturizing. I applied it fresh out of the shower, in place of my HadaLabo Premium, and instantly my skin just felt soft and supple. I imagine much of this is due to the placenta protein filling in the gaps of the skin cells and creating a \"smooth\" texture as well as the ceramides, which tend to plump up my skin and make it feel softer.\n\nThe fragrance was also so mild that frankly, the smell of sake overpowered it. Thankfully this smell seemed to dissipate after a few minutes of application, and my rosacea did not flare up from the inclusion of fragrance. Over the next few days, I used the High Moist in place of my HadaLabo, and then began to combine it at night with the HadaLabo Premium on top. It worked well with oils and other moisturizing products on top - no pilling or strange film to report.\n\nIn two weeks, my skin looked brighter and felt smoother, though none of my dark spots had faded. Unfortunately, like most products with ferments, it began to break me out after this time. The good news though is that it doesn't appear to break me out immediately, unlike every other ferment, and the smoothness lasted for a few days after I discontinued use, which means I may try to use it sparingly once my skin heals.\n\n# Sources\n\n1.

Not the $8 Korean retail price, but still, it seems really worth it to me considering the amazing ingredients.\n\nPanthenol is especially really underrated but it seriously kicks ass for dry & sensitive skin/tret face like mine (make sure it's at least 5% tho to be most effective). I love the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream bc it's so moisturizing & healing, but it PILLS LIKE CRAZY. Grrrrrrr. And it's a litttle sticky. Otherwise, it would be perfect.\n\n(Also, if you have super tret face/super dry skin, urea is very much worth looking into. It's super underrated as well. It's probably one of the most scientifically proven to be effective dry skin ingredients, but it's not marketed in the US for whatever reason. Maybe bc people think it's from \"urine\"? That's obviously not where they get it in skin care products lol, which is why education is so important. \n\nThe Eucerin 5% Urea face cream is the most accessible one I have found, but there's also Balea? Sebamed, Numis, Medisei Panthenol Extra (also 5% panthenol, but may be clogging) from Greece, Bioturm - all 5% urea creams, for those outside the US. I don't suggest going above 5%, as it can be exfoliating and I personally have those to be really heavy/greasy.",

    "body": "[Shelfie](https://imgur.com/a/oLge8Bq.jpg)\n\nHairType: 1A/1B leaning towards 1A. Fine hair, High Porosity, Waist length. Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml.

Normal shampoo consistency\n\nUsage:  I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

Anecdotal evidence seems to be way more of a thing than with skincare. \n\nThe tips are super interesting as well, and your hair looks to be in great condition from this routine! Thanks for sharing. I hope easier times come, and you can peacefully resume your hair oiling ✨️✨️✨️",

        "body": "i'd bet MONEY that the glycerin is the biggest factor, followed by the fact that there are so many more \"sealing\" type ingredients in the second one - the first one is probably doing a lot to reduce combing/brushing friction and static, using silicones to add in some shine, and adding a small amount of hold to help with manageability and frizz, while the second seems like it's more trying to hold onto actual water than create the properties that we as consumers think of as \"moisturized\" (softness, smoothness, manageability, etc). the glycerin is a humectant, meaning it attracts water and holds onto it, and all those oils could initially form a thin barrier to keep that water inside the hairs. that being said, the actual water stuff seems to be genuinely important for some types of hair, particularly very curly natural hair, even if it has little to do with how we imagine \"moisturized\" hair feeling. use whichever product gives you hair that feels and looks the way you like it; neither one is objectively better or worse. i much prefer creams closer to the first one, because my hair dries super slowly already and i'm sort of instinctively resistant to any marketing that pushes \"natural ingredients\" as a selling point, but whatever you prefer is what's best for you!",

    "body": "***My skin type***: Oily\n\n***Climatic conditions while using the product:*** I live in Mumbai and have been using it for the past 5 weeks, so its been mostly humid\n\n***Routine at the time of using the product:*** I use a cleanser (Minimalist’s 2% SA Cleanser) + Toner (TonyMoly Ceramide Toner) + the Plum 5% Niacinamide Serum + Moisturiser (Isntree Acid Aqua Gel) with UV Doux sunscreen, both AM and PM.\n\n***Age***: mid-20’s\n\n***Usage timeline***: past 5 weeks\n\n***Ingredient list***: Aqua, Glycerin, Niacinamide (5%), Propanediol, Lysine, Histidine, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Threonine, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Proline, Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Methionine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Cysteine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water, Ethoxydiglycol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract, Sodium PCA, Diglycerin, Urea, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Sorbitol, PCA, Allantoin, Lactic Acid, Methyl Gluceth-20, Benzyl Alcohol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Caprylyl Glycol, Cyclodextrin, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Gluconate\n\n***Texture/Consistency***: The serum has a *slightly* slimy consistency which ensures that you need to use less product. I use 2 drops each for each cheek and 1 for my forehead and thats more than enough. The serum absorbs fairly quickly so there’s no sticky feeling afterwards.\n\n***Fragrance***: no fragrance\n\n***Experience and thoughts in detail***: This is my first review on this sub and the only reason I was motivated to write it is because this is genuinely the first product I’ve used after years of skin care that *actually* feels like a Holy Grail product. I was slightly suspicious of Plum as a brand, thinking that its another Mamaearth type company which relies too heavily on marketing. But after reading some reviews in the comments here I decided to give it a shot after getting a good deal for it on Foxy.\n\nI bought the product to mainly combat 3 issues: large pores, dull skin, and closed comedones. Within just 2 uses, there was a noticeable difference in all three aspects. My pores were much less visible, my skin was brighter, and closed comedones also became less prominent (although the effect on them was more muted as compared to brightness and pores).\n\nSeeing these results, I started using the serum every single day in the AM, and it genuinely feels like the serum has been repairing my face because a lot of minor issues that plagued me felt like they were being slowly and gradually fixed. Razor bumps, CCs, fine lines, all were less visible, my skin felt smoother, it really felt like an all-round improvement.\n\nOne thing I specifically wanted to test about the product was how my skin looks on days that I DON’T use the product. I don’t want to use things that are only effective so long as you keep using them. I feel like a genuinely good product should be improving your skin organically and that those effects should not be dependent on you constantly using the product to maintain the look. So I took small breaks where I wouldn’t use the serum for 1 or 2 days. This may be too short of a break, but in those 1-2 days I didn’t find myself looking in the mirror and thinking “I wish I’d worn the serum today”. My skin looked just fine even without it, which made me even happier with the product.\n\nAfter using it almost every day for the past 5 weeks (the first week I went slightly slow), I’m still left with a little more than half of the bottle, so it should comfortably last me for another 5-7 weeks. I was lucky to get the whole bottle for 390, which seems like a great price in hindsight for a serum that has helped so drastically improve my skin.\n\n***Holy Grail/Will Re-Purchase/Will Not Repurchase/Holy Fail Status***: Any guesses? It’s absolutely an HG product for me, although I’m now considering trying Plum’s 10% Niacinamide serum next",

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*In Korea, toners are called \"skin\" (although more recently \"toner\" has caught on as well, probably from Western influence/to make it easier to sell in the West). Usually, lotions mean light emulsions. Sometimes it can mean something between \"emulsions\" and creams, I think, in terms of texture/thickness. \"Lotion\" in Japanese however, are toners from what I understand. Oops!!

    "body": "In my opinion the only way ascorbic acid may potentially work topically is when it's used fresh, and applied at night in the absence of UV exposure. Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

The reviews on Sephora have been fantastic and it has 20% THD ascorbate (which they call a mega-potent, ultra stable form of vitamin c. They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid. The only negative I read in the reviews is people saying it was not ideal for dry skin types. Do you have any experience with this? \n\nPS- thank you so much for your comprehensive list, it is much appreciated!!

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

I had initially planned to write this review 2 weeks after using the latter, but I’ve had a below average experience in one week itself so I’d like to share my review in hopes of being of help to those who want to purchase it.\n\n*I have dry skin not prone to acne, have very little to no pigmentation and use Vitamin C as a preventive measure against ageing, sun damage and dullness. I live in an area with high UV levels and a very humid climate.*\n\n*My routine: Episoft Cleansing Lotion, Laneige Cream Skin Refiner: Toner & Moisturiser, Minimalist's Vitamin C Serum, Bello Photostable Emulgel SPF 40 (day) and Moskina Cream (night).*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Texture Shot](https://preview.redd.it/35qouoy87q871.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9053ecf1c188f97b487b54a5a2b714b59a0a04cd)\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\nChemist At Play:\n\n>Water, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic acid, Propan-di-ol, Sodium Isomerate, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Ferulic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Oryza Sativa (Rice Phytoceramide), Amorphophallus (Konjac Phytoceramide), Hamamelis Virginiana, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 80.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMinimalist:\n\n>Centella Asiatica Leaf Water, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Ethoxydiglycol, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Glycerin, Sodium Gluconate, Acetyl Glucosamine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pullulan, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lecithin, Lactic Acid\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/q0l52oub7q871.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=452589ce63e896b49a2bb5a08fbc6956ad6b9cf5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChemist At Play has Witch Hazel and Citric Acid; this may not be problematic for all, but if they are for you then keep this serum away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, Minimalist gave me the actual results a Vitamin C serum is supposed to give but Chemist At Play did the reverse. I'm just glad that it didn't give me any CC's or acne. I'm going to go ahead and reverse the dullness through Minimalist's serum. I'm better off using a ceramide infused moisturiser after my serum than have it in my serum in this case, which is a pity because if this serum had worked for me, it would've been an all-rounder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, everyone's skin is different and this is just one, hopefully helpful review.",

One of the main points of mango butter is that it has skin soothing/healing properties, but it's not greasy. Honey is very good for skin because of its sugars and antioxidant value. Also, a few studies show that it can be healing for wounds. Royal Jelly, however, does not have any evidence of helping skin a whole lot.*\n\n*Potentially problematic ingredients: The oils in this are great, but the high % olive oil may be bothersome to acne-prone skin types. YMMV.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I couldn't fit more pictures in this post, but the reviews say this is a light gel cream type that absorbs very fast.](https://preview.redd.it/fnpdk02yzl731.png?width=355&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bd89c8b5ffb3adb0019df2bb8a49bfb8f1209a7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm sorry to keep having to make separate posts and spamming everyone.

    "body": "The r/wetshaving community loves artisan soaps.  Barrister and Mann, Chiseled Face Groomatorium, Declaration Grooming, Noble Otter, Oleo, Siliski, Southern Witchcrafts, Summer Break, Wholly Kaw.  All that.\n\nIn fact, one could make the argument that the biggest differentiator between this specific community and [other online wetshaving communities](https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/threads/your-3-favorite-soaps-2019.579118/page-3#post-10492168) is the brand loyalty that r/wetshaving has for its artisans. This brand loyalty phenomenon has been discussed and analyzed much over the years here and [other forums](https://old.reddit.com/r/curatedshaveforum/comments/ex8jii/users_of_forum_discuss_pricing_on_forum_which_has/fgc4e1v/?context=3) with a range of opinions on the cause and effect: [consumerism run amok, plain and simple](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/f9yqbj/titans_of_wetshaving_history_charles_roberts/fj3b6wk/) OR [a natural consequence of gravitating toward communities where your experiences more closely mirror the other users there](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/e20yu6/do_fanboys_impact_your_purchasing_decisions/f8t14q7/) OR [a blessing, but mostly a curse for the artisans themselves](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/e20yu6/do_fanboys_impact_your_purchasing_decisions/f8uc2aq/) OR [toxic fanboyism and fundamentally unfair to those artisans that aren't considered reddit house brands](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/7p6jn2/dealsnew_products_tuesday_jan_09_2018/dsj9ill/).\n\nWhatever the reasons and consquences for the brand loyalty/fanboyism, one thing's for certain: if you come to r/wetshaving to read product reviews, [you're reading at least 90 percent artisan product reviews.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AReview)\n\nMy opinion is that is a good thing on balance. Fanboyism aside, I think, objectively speaking, soap artisans are doing the most interesting and novel things in wetshaving, and that's notable and *should* be noted by reviews and discussions. In the year 2020, how much more can be said or discovered about TOBS (it's shitty so [stop using it FFS](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/f2hr9y/help_with_creams_soaps_after_shaved/fhcm5sx/)), Proraso (much better than it gets credit for here, much worse than the floor-tarp-and-bukkake parties  r/wicked_edge, Marshalls, and TJMaxx throw for it), Tabac (ghastly and gross, but works great as a soap base so long as you've lost your sense of smell/have a TBI/like to bang octogenarians exclusively), Arko (the urinal puck smell is overstated, and if you must -- but why must you? -- just air it out for a few months and it's perfectly usable), Mitchell's Wool Fat (boring on smell, finicky on lathering, and not worth the trouble even for [people who *claim* to be experts on lathering it](https://youtu.be/mVKu1oZWfww)),  or Williams Mug Soap (no, Gary, your [spreadsheet](https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/threads/eleventh-annual-one-blade-in-february-challenge-2020-edition.581120/page-13#post-10591149) is NOT helpful)?\n\nSo [Santa Maria Novella](https://buy.smnovella.com/index.php/men-s/shaving-cream-tabacco-toscano-7030915.html?___SID=U) sorta falls into that r/wetshaving dead zone of products that gets mostly ignored by reviews and SOTDs (minus a few notable users who have drunk this particular brand of tobacco Toscano-flavored Kool Aid).  It's not artisan, it's not hip, it's old school, it's European, it's pricey, it's more B&B/TSN/TSD/CSF than it is r/wetshaving.\n\nAnd indeed the prevailing thinking in regards to SMN on this sub and its predecessor sub have been largely negative. IMO. IMHO. IME. YMMV.\n\n[Exhibit A: RaggedClaws](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wet_Shavers/comments/2tmzcv/xpec_and_santa_maria_novella_discussion/co0gv7x/)\n\n[Exhibit B: $have$core](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/cvdj6l/review_santa_maria_novella_crema_da_barba/)\n\n[I've been meaning to get around to this review for quite some time.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/cvdj6l/review_santa_maria_novella_crema_da_barba/ey3r401/)  Because this nonsense is a crime.  But, alas, my fabulous and glamorous life just got in the way.\n\nWe'll get more into the Ruds review specifically below, but SMN appears to have a lot going against it on first blush. For one, it's 71 GD American dollars. Over $80 after shipping -- though to be fair, it's 7.4 ounces of product in the tub rather than the typical 4 ounces of American artisan product ($10.81 per ounce shipped compared to, say, Wholly Kaw Siero's tag of $8.75 per ounce, shipped...but still quite a bite out your chips).  Two, the [ingredient list doesn't look all that impressive.](https://www.mensbiz.com.au/santa-maria-novella-shaving-cream.html)\n\n> Aqua, Stearic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Parfum, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butlyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Camphor, Menthol, Allantoin.\n\nNo tallow? No butters? No milks? Is...is this vegan? Eww, gross.  And coconut oil based? Double eww.  And camphor and eucalyptus. Like Proraso? Naw, dawg. I'm out, right?\n\nRight?\n\nRight?\n\nIt doesn't make sense on paper.  Why would this be good?\n\n\nEven the backstory on the company is weird.  \n\n[According to the website](https://buy.smnovella.eu/ENG/about-us): \"Santa Maria Novella was established by Dominican monks shortly after their arrival in Florence in 1221. The friars began cultivating medicinal herbs in their gardens to prepare medications, balms and ointments for\ntheir convent’s small infirmary.\"\n\nThey continue: \"Following the Italian government’s confiscation of the church’s assets, in 1866 the pharmacy became a state owned enterprise; nevertheless it was transferred to Cesare Augusto Stefani, nephew of Officina’s last monastic director.\"\n\nSo setting aside the little bit of minutiae that, no Italianxirs, monks and friars [are NOT the same thing](http://priestvocation.com/difference-between-monks-friars-priests-and-brothers/) and the words aren't interchangeable, the whole thing sounds absurd.  [William of Ockham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham), inventor of Occam's Razor, father of modern epistemology -- not [episiotomy, mind you, common mistake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episiotomy) -- was a friar, lived out with the people, tended the flock.  [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther), famous for fucking up the entirety of Christianity, lived in the monastery with his bros when he was a monk. For fuck's sake, Santa Maria Novella, were they friars or were they monks? Hmmm?\n\nBut at any rate, the monk vs. friar thing notwithstanding, how did a line of shaving products get started? \n\nSo we got Middle Age monks, living a life of poverty and celibacy, scribing ancient manuscripts with quills, cooking up tinctures and herbal remedies for gout and unbalanced blood humors from the bounties of their herb garden and shit, and then one day one monk looked at another monk and said \"I got it, Giuseppe. We'll make shave cream\"? And that's what they did right up to the point that proto-fascists ganked all the their shit and put them out on the streets? And then later the fascists sold their shit back to a monk's nephew?\n\nSo many questions.\n\nWas the Tetra-Di-T-Butlyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate in the original monk recipe? \n\nCan you grow Tetra-Di-T-Butlyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate in a monastic herb garden? \n\nDo Italian monks study chemistry?\n\nAnd if they did, don't you think it'd be fair if the University of Notre Dame would give them a full academic scholarship? \n\nBecause how would that not be fair?\n\nBut then they'd have to uproot their lives and move from the monasteries of Italy all the way to South Bend, Indiana. Talk about culture shock, my god. But on the other hand, you just KNOW Friar Tuck would straight own your ass at beer pong in a fraternity house full of Notre Dame undergrads.  But that still wouldn't work, logistical nightmares and what not. Unless, of course, Notre Dame could offer on-line classes. \n\n*Hey Alexa, do monks use computers?*\n\n[Whoa, they do.](https://www.trappist.net/) Maybe this could work.\n\n\nYeah, so it's weird.  And it doesn't look like it should be worth a damn. One would be forgiven for thinking it was something like overpriced Italian Martin de Candre by monks. \n\nAnd back to the Ruds review. Our faithful r/wetshaving correspondent had this to say about SMN:\n\n> I rate this as mid firm and the soap base is an easy loader. It is not a very thirsty soap and when dialed in, the consistency of the lather will resemble whipped cream. Slickness in terms of both primary and residual slickness are very good. There are many soaps that are noticeably slicker than this offering. Post shave is good, but a proper post shave routine will be a must when using this soap. Overall this soap doesn’t knock my socks off but provides enough for a serviceable shave. As such the Crema da Barba receives a ShaveScore of 84. For similar lather performance I suggest Kepkinh or Wild West Shaving Co.\n\n\nKephkinh or Wild West Shaving Company? Ouch. I don't know what either one of those two things are, but it can't be good.  I'm assuming this is akin to saying to someone \"for a face similar to yours, I suggest taking a look at either Bruce Vilanch or unmasked Kylo Ren or James Brown's domestic violence mugshot.\"\n\nBut ackshully I see the problem.  Emphasis all mine. To wit:\n\n\n> I rate this as mid firm and the soap base is ***an easy loader.*** \n\n\nNo, sir.  \n\n\n> It is ***not*** a very thirsty soap\n\nNo, sir.\n\n\n> when dialed in, the consistency of the lather will resemble ***whipped cream***.\n\nNo, sir.\n\n> There ***are*** many soaps that are noticeably slicker than this offering.\n\nNo, sir.\n\nIn fact, I own very few soaps slicker than SMN. \n\n\nWere I to fix Ruds' review, it would go like this:\n\n> I rate this as mid firm and the soap base ~~is an easy loader~~ requires a fairly heavy load and a little more effort than you're probably expecting.  Load it like you'd load Wholly Kaw Donkey Milk. Don't hate-bang it, but definitely get in there, work those hips, and throw some lather around. Don't be lazy. It is ~~not~~ most definitely a very thirsty soap that you should either Marco Method, [SkidMarko Method](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/87rjn5/welcome_wednesday_and_simple_questions_newbie/dwfopr2/) or [Pajeet Method](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/dwcjs9/why_your_lather_is_terrible_even_though_you_think/), and when dialed in, the consistency of the lather will resemble ~~whipped cream~~ a wet, damn near drippin' mess . Slickness in terms of both primary and residual slickness are ~~very~~ elite-level good but decidedly on this side of Milksteak and Excelsior and Siero, but still slick as Rick. There are ~~many~~ precious few soaps that are noticeably slicker than this offering. Post shave ~~is good~~ doesn't matter one single bit, you waterheads, ~~but~~ and a proper post shave routine ~~will be~~ is a must when using ~~this~~ any soap because soap is soap and not some magic moisturizing substance. It'll dry you out, just like every other soap. Use lotions and shit to combat this. Stop being weird. This isn't hard.   Overall this soap ~~doesn’t~~ knocks ~~my socks off~~ the pussy out like fight night, ~~but~~ and provides enough for a ~~serviceable~~ superb shave. As such the Crema da Barba receives a ~~ShaveScore~~ PooterScore of ~~84~~ of [\"gyeah\".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTN30-YOCQ&feature=youtu.be&t=21) For similar lather performance I suggest ~~Kepkinh or Wild West Shaving Co.~~ you just stop trying to compare every single soap against every other soap with weird metrics in an increasingly unwieldy database of numerical scores, and just live your life, you know. Twist cabbage off instinct. Blunts and broads, tits and bras, menage-a-tois, sex in expensive cars. In other words, enjoy your morning shave for yourself. For your own, personal face. For you own personal neck-meat. For your own, personal man-cans. \n\nAs to the scent, it's not at all like Proraso. Interested in the soap, but don't want to spend $80 and discover you don't like the scent?  It smells exactly like [this.](https://groomatorium.com/products/razorock-santa-maria-del-fiore-lozione-dopo-barba?_pos=1&_sid=b386af327&_ss=r)   This is one of the few times it's okay to lean on RazoRock (though *do* buy it from The Groomatorium, if you're able).  It's spot on. But definitely skip the RazoRock Santa Maria Del Fiore soap. It smells great, but the soap base itself is straight flaming garbage, homie, and despite the claims, it's nowhere close to SMN, the genuine article's, performance.\n\n**Disclosure**: [I paid for SMN with my own money via a 4-way tub split...which is a great way to buy this if you have 3 other close-knit bros or friars or monks you can get with.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wet_shave/comments/84w3ns/santa_maria_novella_split/) You don't need 7.4 ounces of soap at $80, do you? But 1.85 ounces at $20? Now you're talking sense, my friar.",

    "body": "Basically, I've been on the hunt for affordable, daily wear sunscreens. In my dream world these would come in a big bottle, not these ant-sized 40 or 50ml bottles, but we can't have everything :(\n\nControversial I know, but I quite like alcohol in sunscreens for that quick drying effect and easy wear. All of the sunscreens I'm reviewing here are more indoorsy/low-exposure - I wear the Ambre Solaire Super UV Face Fluid for walks and light outdoors seeing as the UV index isn't super high nor is it very sunny at the moment. Neither are waterproof though so not suitable for long outdoors wear.\n\nAlso, because I'm a massive cheapskate I wear an ultra-cheap/failed sunscreen on my neck so these are for face only.\n\n**MY SKIN:** sensitive to fragrance, dry, acne-prone, kinda starting to get a Differin glow after 2 weeks on Differin so idk what's going on there, but it does make the sunscreens look a bit glowier than usual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**GARNIER AMBRE SOLAIRE SUPER UV FACE FLUID**\n\n**Price + purchasing:** I bought this at Boots (drugstore in the UK) so obviously very convenient. It cost £8 for 40ml or £0.2 per use.\n\n**Packaging:** IMO the texture of this is a bit too fluid for the nozzle tip, so it has a tendency to run out too much if you're not careful. Also, why is this so small???\n\n**Ingredients:**  Aqua / Water, Alcohol Denat. Diisopropyl Sebacate, Silica, Isopropyl Myristate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Glycerin, C12-22 Alkyl Acrylate/Hydroxyethylacrylate Copolymer, Propanediol, Drometrizole Trisiloxane, Perlite, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Tocopherol, Hydroxyacetophenone Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Caprylyl Glycol, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate\n\n6 UV filters - octisalate, uvinul T150, tinosorb S, avobenzone, mexoryl XL, mexoryl SX\n\nSome tocopherol as an antixoxidant as well.\n\nThis is a dupe of the LRP Shaka Fluid/Invisible Fluid, which is waterproof and has a PPD of 46.6. If the filter concentrations are the same here, then we have 5% octinoxate, 4.5% uvinul T150, 4% tinosorb S, 3.5% avobenzone, 2% mexoryl XL, 0.495% mexoryl SX, total filter concentration 19.495%.\n\nThis isn't marketed as waterproof but the LRP version is, so idk? Maybe they just cheaped out and didn't want to do waterproof testing.\n\n**Feel + finish:** as you apply this it feels very liquid. Dries down quickly and easily (no surprise thanks to the alcohol), with no sticky residue on the skin. This is shinier than the Anti-Age but definitely still quite natural on my skin, more of a slightly glowy finish. No pilling, clumping or settling around the nose bridge of my glasses.\n\n**Overall thoughts:** this is pretty good I have to admit. I feel pretty secure in the protection of this when I'm out and about for shorter periods of time, but again I'm not sure I would wear this to the beach/outdoorsy holidays because it's not confirmed as water-resistant. The finish is so much better than I expected, but it isn't as good as the one below. **4.5/5**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**GARNIER AMBRE SOLAIRE SUPER UV ANTI-AGE FACE PROTECTION CREAM**\n\n**Price + purchasing:** I bought this at Boots (drugstore in the UK) so obviously very convenient. It cost £10 for 50ml or £0.2 per use.\n\n**Packaging:** a very sleek and convenient tube. Apparently it uses 49% less plastic than a conventional Garnier tube and it's got a very slim cap which is space-saving. Only 50ml though :(\n\n**Ingredients:**  Aqua / Water, C12-15alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Octocrylene, Niacinamide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Silica, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Vinyldimethicone / Methicone Silsesquioxanecrosspolymer, Terephthalate Tricolicilicolylene Triphetylsilicolylene Stearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Tocopherol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Phenylethylresorcinol, Triethanolamine, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Poloxamer 338, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, 2 Caprylic Acid\n\n3 UV filters - octocrylene, avobenzone, uvinul T150. This is a fragrance-free dupe of LRP Age-Correct SPF50, which has a PPD of 20. IMO this is plenty for indoorsy, everyday wear so I'm pretty happy with that.\n\nThis also has niacinamide and tocopherol + phenylethyl resorcinol as antioxidants.\n\n**Feel + finish:** this is a medium-weight cream which is definitely moisturising enough to wear without a moisturiser for me in summer, probably perfect for combo-oily skin all year round as well. No white cast and it absorbs very quickly and easily. It leaves a non-sticky, satin finish on my skin, which is very elegant and reminiscent of Purito (which I hated because that didn't absorb well at all, but even more elegant in terms of appearance - this is less glowy for me). No pilling or clumping around the nose bridge. Honestly such a pleasant experience from a fragrance and alcohol free Euro sunscreen - I was shocked.\n\n**Overall thoughts:** ok I'm in love with this as a daily sunscreen. So easy to wear, so pretty on the skin and non-drying! The only con is the small bottle, although it's accessible and I don't have to spend money on shipping which is a major plus. **4.9/5 (every-day HG)**\n\nIf you got to the end of this thanks for reading - please correct me on anything if I'm wrong!",

    "body": "Hey ScA! I recently lapsed on my skincare routine, so I decided that I should do a review of my main products as I add them back into my routine. This review will be mainly overall experience, with some recent insights. I have more products that I have used in the past, but I decided to only review ones I have a lot of experience with so far. The only product I don't have reviewed from my routine is the Advanced Retinoid - as I just reintroduced that back into my routine in the last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n*AM*\n\n1.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n2.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n3.\tTO Niacinamide over whole face\n4.\tApply TO Caffeine to under eye\n5.\tFormula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free moisturizer over whole face\n6.\tIf using sunscreen, use Etude House Sunprise\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*PM*\n\n1.\tIf wearing makeup, I use baby oil to remove\n2.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n3.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n4.\tPaula’s Choice 2% BHA Gel to whole face – wait ~20 mins to sink in\n5.\tTO Retinoid Advanced Retinoid 2% over whole face\n6.\tMoisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Info about my skin/general experience trying out products:**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products. It’s hard to get the little bits out of the bottom!!\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, have repurchased 2+ times; will be replacing with skinlex’s version to avoid buying more products from Deciem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://imgur.com/a/roT93Vy)\n\n***Product Type:*** Active for reducing appearance of eye contour pigmentation\n\n***Cost:*** **$* - ~$7.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Caffeine, Maltodextrin, Glycerin, Propanediol, Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside, Gallyl Glucoside, Hyaluronic Acid, Oxidized Glutathione, Melanin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Xanthan gum, Lactic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propyl Gallate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Benzyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; Watery-to-thick consistency (from the glycerin, probably); no noticeable smell; yellow-ish in color\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I’ve been using this stuff for a little over a year, and honestly it does absolutely nothing for my eye contour. I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

I have seen considerable improvement in my scalp health cz the shampoo would cleanse without stripping moisture . Also , if you sweat a lot or use lot of products & theres buildup on ur scalp , this won’t be enough. You might have to add a clarifying shampoo once in 2 weeks or a month . I have used their smoothening hair serum but unfortunately that didn’t work . Their hair growth serum seemed promising cz it did reduce my hair fall considerably.

    "body": "[I purchased this item myself.](https://i.imgur.com/ZKt37cP.jpg) \n\n\n# Impressions, Fragrance, Packaging\n\nI'm only going to quickly hit some of these points. I'm going to primarily focus my review around the ingredients and my thoughts on the new formulation. I'm sure many others will focus on the rest.\n\nGeneral impressions of the product are great and typical of what we've come to expect from Barrister and Mann. I always enjoy the little goodies and extras thrown in (this time some fitting espresso hard candies). I see BaM is now using the Parkway 100mm low profile jars that have become ubiquitous in artisan shaving soap. I haven't purchased a new soap for perhaps a year — is this a new change or has this been the case for a while?\n\nI personally love the fragrance of Leviathan, though I can understand it can be polarizing. \"It smells like you just smoked a cigar and tried to cover it up with a fragrance\" — my loving wife. That deep, black coffee and leather combination is intoxicating. Soap is frankly a terrible way to experience fragrance, but [I have a bottle of Leviathan aftershave from perhaps 2016 or 2017](https://i.imgur.com/B2z2qwM.jpg) that allows me to pick up the nuance. There's more sweetness and spice in the liquid form. Again, many other Leviathan reviews around talking about the fragrance. I will yield to those.\n\n\n# Performance\n\nWhat can I say? It's superb. A modern classic and a worthy sibling to BaM's other creations. I was hoping it could hold a candle to Reserve - one of my other favorites - and it does; improves even, on some of Reserve's best qualities.\n\nThe lather is so dense [it becomes almost waxy](https://i.imgur.com/SYRsScz.jpg) (I mean that in a good way). It's so water tolerant that it's almost water resistant (again, a little tongue-in-cheek, but I mean it in a good way). Water really needs to be worked into the lather to get the benefit of the performance. It doesn't behave like a \"foamy\" soap. If foamy soaps pull bubbles out of air, this soap instead pulls texture from water. It's thick and smooth. Not foamy and pillowy. \n\nThe slickness and skin feel when shaving is also best-in-class comfortable. \n\nPost shave feeling rivals Reserve. \n\nI would expect a lot of high praise for Omnibus coming soon. \n\n# Ingredients\n\nOk, for the main event.\n\n*Water, Potassium Stearate, Glycerin, Potassium Tallowate, Potassium Kokum Butterate, Sodium Stearate, Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid, Cocos Nucifera Fruit Juice, Potassium Ricinoleate, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Lactate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Tetrasodium Ethylendiamine Disuccinate, Fragrance, Xanthan Gum, Theobroma Grandiflorum Butter, Sodium Kokum Butterate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Potassium Cocoate, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium Ricinoleate, Goat Milk Powder, Persea Grattisima Oil, Sodium Cocoate, Althaea Officinalis Extract, Ulmus Rubra Extract*\n\nI'll give my best insight on the ingredient list. But I'm not an expert and I can only base my insights on my own experience, which is imperfect in itself. You can only glean so much from an ingredient list before it takes the person formulating it to explain the why's and how's. The \"secret sauce\", as it were, is the combination of the ingredients, the relative amounts of each, why each individual component was chosen over an alternative, how they interact and counteract, and the process by which it all comes together. That's not something that we're going to know and that's not something we should expect or ask any soapmaker - or businessperson at large - to divulge. Basically I'm saying that my ability to interpret this stuff is flawed by the very nature of even doing this. I think it's important to have that humility before any of us try to analyze ingredients - myself included.\n\n**Stearic Acid, Tallow, Kokum Butter, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil**. These are what I would consider the \"base oils\" so to speak. It's sort of the heart of the soap; the unique fatty acid makeup that give the lather a large portion of its performance character once saponified. There is nothing particularly questionable or curious here and I would say we often see high performing soaps with a version of these \"base\" ingredients. \n\n**Water, Coconut Milk, Goat Milk Powder, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Hydroxide**. I'm going to call this collection of ingredients the \"caustic solution\". Both sodium and potassium hydroxide are used as the caustic reagents. Again, nothing particularly unique about that in shaving soap. Both are generally solubilized into water. I'm going to guess that coconut milk and the goat milk powder are added to this solution as well, but it's just a guess. Those things could be added somewhere else. Milks are often substituted for water or in addition to water in an effort to make a lather less pillowy and more creamy. I've never seen any science on that, but that's generally the narrative espoused in the soapmaking community so I'll mention it. Like most things in soapmaking, once you nail down a core formula of ingredients, the other onesy-twosy additives tend to be incremental rather than fundamental, at least in my experience. Enough of those ingredients cleverly combined I think can make for a distinguishable performance difference cumulatively, but it's tough for me to tie one unit of a given ingredient to one unit of performance. So I won't attempt to do that with the milks used here.\n\n**Shea Butter, Cupuacu Butter, Avocado Oil**. This is the superfat. On most ingredient lists, you would not be able to distinguish the superfat from the rest, but Barrister and Mann is one of the few who list ingredients post-saponification, or a little more INCI-compliant. Many ingredients going into the soapmaking process vs coming out of the soapmaking process are compositionally different. Any oils, butters, or triglyceride-containing stuff still in their \"original\" form on this ingredient list means it must be the superfat. I'm of the opinion that the amount and the constituent components of the superfat have a good hand in how the lather behaves and feels. Others might disagree with that, but I'm going to say this unique combination of oils in the superfat probably have a meaningful role in determining how dense, protective, and stable the lather feels on the face. The importance of the superfat I think is particularly unique in shaving soap. \"Stability\" and \"denseness\" of a lather don't really matter in other forms of soap. Body soap, hand soap, even shampoo; most all other surfactant applications are rinse-off almost as quickly as applied. A shaving soap provides critical buffer between an in-motion blade and the skin for minutes at a time, so that kind of thing matters.\n\n**Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Lactate**. We're starting to get into ingredients that can serve more than one purpose, but again, knowing my own interpretations are going to be wrong anyway, I'll go ahead and call these the \"texturizers\". Hydroxyethylcellulose I know to be a thickening ingredient. In fact, when you see any \"cellulose\" on a label, that's generally what those ingredients are for. I've used it a couple times when messing around with making shampoo, but I didn't go much further. I found it to be incredibly finicky. It was stubborn to melt and quickly became tough to work with when cooled. I really don't know what it's used for here. If you've ever made a high stearic soap, you know that it has a tendency to seize up. I wouldn't think you would want to thicken a soap like this - it's the first time I've seen this ingredient in a shaving soap - but I don't know what it behaves like when it's cooking and I don't know the process steps involved to make it. It does make sodium lactate even more curious because I've always used sodium lactate in shaving soap as an ingredient to metaphorically \"even out the high spots\". Things just mix a little easier with it and it cures the soap a little more consistently. Part vanity, part functional. It's also a humectant, so there's a theoretical skin benefit there, too. \n\n**Marshmallow Root Extract, Slippery Root Extract, Xanthan Gum, Saccharide Isomerate**. Let's go with so-called \"skin food\". This far down the ingredient list, I can only more or less guess at some of these. I'm sure Will would raise a skeptical eyebrow or two, but here goes. The extracts are generally what people talk about when you hear the word \"botanicals\". They're extracted components of plants and almost always have a purported anti-irritation or skin-benefitting property. They are very concentrated, and for that reason, you will most always see them at or near the bottom of an ingredient list used in tiny quantities. I haven't used these particular extracts, but I have used others. Xanthan gum could have a few uses. It's in many cosmetics as a thickener and stabilizer, but I included it in this category because I've heard Will talk about it in the context of skin feel. I think I remember he pointed to xanthan gum as a potential cause of poor after-shave feel for those who under-hydrated the previous Excelsior formula. The xanthan gum effectively \"used up all the water\". So maybe the intent with xanthan gum in this formula is to alter the stability of the lather's water-tolerance? Especially seeing how this soap behaves with water; that'd be my guess - used as an ingredient to keep water in the soap and keep the lather from \"breaking\", but who knows. It interacts with water in a big way, though, so I know it must have something to do with that property. Sacharride isometerate is a moisturizer / emollient.\n\nHere's the \"other\" category: **Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate and Glycerin**. Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate is a chelator. It's basically a \"green\" version of Tetrasodium EDTA. Good hard water performance is probably thanks to this ingredient in part. There's nothing special or unique about Glycerin, I just put it in \"other\" because I can't tell if glycerin is an added ingredient or if it's just the glycerin released in the soapmaking process. That's a consequence of how this product is labeled. \n\n**Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid** - I'm putting this one in the \"wtf\" category. No clue what it's used for here. Because of where it appears on the ingredient list, it's not used in negligible amounts, so I have to believe it has some kind of meaningful functional purpose - like a detergent or foaming property or something - but I've never used it or heard of this particular flavor of sulfonic acid. Reading about it doesn't give me any better or more insightful shot at it so I'm just going to leave it at *shrug.*\n\n# My Thoughts\n\nWill has always done a great job pushing the envelope of ingredients in his soaps. In my opinion, he innovates more than probably anyone else in the artisan sphere and doesn't let the sometimes-misinformed or preconceived perspectives of consumers en-masse influence his pursuit. The \"if you can't pronounce it, don't use it\" crowd I think is in stronger force today than it has ever been. \n\nI'm not saying that more ingredients or complicated ingredients = better. But I am saying that there is a vocal group of people with opinions about cosmetics that appear to confuse synthetic for \"dangerous\", and minimal for optimal. And it is great to see that the philosophy at Barrister and Mann is still that the best ingredients must win, not the best-looking-labeled ingredients.\n\nThat is my primary purpose for writing a review up this way. Just wanted to share my perspective on this latest creation and explain how pleased I am to see continual innovation in artisan formulation. I'm probably a little off in my analysis, it's tough to make these kinds of assumptions and generalizations. But that's not really the point. I wanted to make a write-up to bring some attention to this kind of pursuit. \n\nIt takes a ton of work to reformulate a product. I will often see people talk about a new soap fragrance in the same vein as a new soap base. This is understandable. From the perspective of a customer, it's a very similar buying experience and feeling of anticipation. And I'm sure artisans spend enormous amounts of time tinkering with a fragrance. But innovating on a soap formula is a little bit of a different skill and it's a much bigger commitment from the standpoint of the business. There are re-packaging considerations, stability considerations, and most of all, there's a lot of trial and error. In short, it is a risk. Even more so when you're working with ingredients that aren't traditionally used or often used at all in soap.\n\nSo hats off for Omnibus. I'm happy to say it joins the ranks among Reserve and Milksteak as my favorite all-around performers.\n\nCheers!",

        "body": "Okay, full rundown:\n\n>**Stearic Acid, Tallow, Kokum Butter, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil.** These are what I would consider the \"base oils\" so to speak. It's sort of the heart of the soap; the unique fatty acid makeup that give the lather a large portion of its performance character once saponified.\n\nCorrect!\n\n>**Water, Coconut Milk, Goat Milk Powder, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Hydroxide.** I'm going to call this collection of ingredients the \"caustic solution\".\n\nMostly correct, but I'm afraid that the reason why is a trade secret. :)\n\n>**Shea Butter, Cupuacu Butter, Avocado Oil.** This is the superfat. On most ingredient lists, you would not be able to distinguish the superfat from the rest, but Barrister and Mann is one of the few who list ingredients post-saponification, or a little more INCI-compliant.\n\nCorrect!\n\n>**Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Lactate.** We're starting to get into ingredients that can serve more than one purpose, but again, knowing my own interpretations are going to be wrong anyway, I'll go ahead and call these the \"texturizers\".\n\nLess correct, but you're absolutely right that HEC is a pain to work with; it's going to take me until the third production batch to get some of the stuff to stop seizing into little bits. These two materials are not really related to each other in any functional sense, though; the HEC serves as a lubricant and to help tame the drying effects of xanthan gum, while the sodium lactate is used to make the soap both more pliable when it's hot and harder when it's cool. \n\n>**Marshmallow Root Extract, Slippery Root Extract, Xanthan Gum, Saccharide Isomerate.** Let's go with so-called \"skin food\"...The extracts are generally what people talk about when you hear the word \"botanicals\". They're extracted components of plants and almost always have a purported anti-irritation or skin-benefitting property.\n\nAgain, partly correct. Marshmallow and slippery elm are both skin soothers and moisturizers (their internal \"mucilage\" helps keep your skin feeling nice, and they contain various other classes of molecules that serve as anti-irritants. I actually experimented with using a few other botanicals as well, most notably licorice, but found that most of them provide limited benefit and impart weird colors and/or aromas to the base, which, if I'm being honest, smells faintly of graham crackers off the puck.\n\nXanthan gum serves the same function that it did in Excelsior and Soft Heart, which is as a lubricant. However, as noted, it has a tendency to try people's skin unless you dump HUGE amounts of water into it, so I opted to remedy this effect by replacing some of it with hydroxyethylcellulose, which is much easier on the skin, but not perfect on its own.\n\nSaccharide Isomerate is a contact moisturizer that can tolerate alkaline environments, and the level at which we use it can actually increase moisture retention in skin to which it's applied by as much as 10%.\n\n>**Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate and Glycerin.** Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate is a chelator. It's basically a \"green\" version of Tetrasodium EDTA. Good hard water performance is probably thanks to this ingredient in part. There's nothing special or unique about Glycerin, I just put it in \"other\" because I can't tell if glycerin is an added ingredient or if it's just the glycerin released in the soapmaking process. That's a consequence of how this product is labeled. \n\nCorrect about the TED: it's biodegradable, unlike tetrasodium EDTA, and doesn't present the same \"OMG IT'S POISON\" vibe that the green community has applied to EDTA. Both are harmless, for those curious.\n\nAs for glycerin, we use additional glycerin in the soapmaking process, which is why it appears on the ingredient list so prominently.\n\n>**Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid** - I'm putting this one in the \"wtf\" category. No clue what it's used for here.\n\nAh, the magic material. Also known by its equally inscrutable trade name Rheocare HSP-1180, this is a synthetic anionic polymer produced from renewable feedstocks. It improves lubrication dramatically and imparts a luxurious, talc-like post-shave without sealing the skin or exhibiting comedogenic behavior, meaning that it cannot clog pores or cause breakouts. It's fascinating stuff, and one of the most exciting things that I have ever come across in cosmetic chemistry.\n\n>doesn't let the sometimes-misinformed or preconceived perspectives of consumers en-masse influence his pursuit.

And it is great to see that the philosophy at Barrister and Mann is still that the best ingredients must win, not the best-looking-labeled ingredients.\n\nI too really appreciate your saying this. I believe strongly that much of the improvements that we have seen in the past decade of shaving soap development are due to radical technological advancements over the last 70 years, and it seems absurd to me to exclude things like renewable polymers and chelating agents from that conversation simply because they have scary sounding names. My explanation to folks regarding natural materials is generally along the following lines: Arsenic, cyanide, and lily of the valley are all completely natural. All three will kill you. Painfully. Natural does not mean safe or better, and synthetic does not mean dangerous or bad. They're all just tools.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAll in all, you did really well! It's important that people understand what is being used in the products that go on their faces, and, while there's a \"secret sauce\" aspect to this, but I've said nothing here that someone couldn't learn with Google, and the real secrets are in the proportions and methodologies, not the list itself. I have nothing to hide, and everything that we use is quite safe according to every authority that I can find (that isn't, you know, some dimwit screaming about how \"chemicals\" are bad).\n\nEither way, I appreciate your taking the time to break it down for folks; I mean to put up a blog post on the subject by the end of the week, but we'll see if that actually comes to fruition. :D",

For me the one major requirement in a toner it for it to be of a water consistency, and this has a slightly thick syrupy consistency which just did not suit my skin. I kept getting small bumps and breakouts all over my face and this did not soothe my skin or make is feel supple. This also did not layer well with my actives and instead just made my face feel heavy after using it.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**One Thing H.

It does what it says and soothes my skin, reduces redness and helps with any irritation caused due to makeup or acne. The only con is the price point is not at all budget friendly.

Helps in controlling the oiliness of my very oily skin in summers, and the two ingredients centella asiatica and green tea extract helps spreading 2 drops well on my full face and avoid over usage of products. So, I will 100% keep using this for life because I love it.\n\n>Holy Grail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Formularx Lactic Acid Serum** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 4 weeks {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Water, lactic acid, caprylic/capric triglyceride, gluconolactone, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, sodium hydroxide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, phenoxyethanol, agastache mexicana flower/leaf/stem extract, disodium edta, xanthan gum, ethylhexylglycerin. \n\nBrief review: So I used this product twice in a week (in the PM) and this has a cream like consistency and my skin just hated it. I could see red ness and irritation on my skin as soon as I applied it. I even made sure not to use it with any actives but it still did not d anything for my skin and just irritated it. So, it is just lying on my self with no use and my heart hurts because this was so expensive and had god reviews on ig. So this this brand really isn't reliable. I love the moisturiser but this formula just did not work even when my skin is used to strong actives.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Moisturiser*\n\n**Acrofy Acne Lotion** {*derm recommended*}\n\nUsage: 1 year + {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: -/-\n\nBrief review: Good/basic moisturiser for acne prone skin, helped me when I had the worst breakouts of my life. It is creamy consistency and does feel a little heavy and doesn't really mattify the skin. Stopped using it because my dermatologist recommended a different one.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ahaglow Acne Moisturising Gel** {*derm recommended*}\n\nUsage: 2 months {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: -/-\n\nBrief review: This is an ok moisturiser, I don't like fragrance in my moisturiser so I did not really like this but it did not cause any breakouts but did make my face moisturised. So if you hate fragrance, steer clear of this product.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sebamed Clear Gel** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 3 months {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Panthenol\n\nBrief review: Loved the moisturiser especially in Delhi summers. Helped skin feel supple and moisturiser, can call this a substitute for HA serum.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Minimalist Sepicalm Oat Moisturiser** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 2 weeks {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Squalane, Glycerine, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Cocoyl Aminoacids, Sarcosine, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Avena Sativa (Oat Kernel) Flour, Sodium Polyglutamate, Undecane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopherol Acetate, Arginine, Glycine, Alanine, Histidine, Sodium Lactate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tridecane, Aluminium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Trehalose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate \n\nBrief review: My skin hated this, it cause cc all over my skin and was very thick in consistency. I bought this as the the ingredient list matched the one of formularx barrier relief and this was a budget one so went for this. I tried using a normal amount and it was horrible, I also tried using a very small amount since it is thick and even then it just made my skin sweat and break out. So I stopped using and thought that this might help during winters but again just made my skin suffocate. It is probably a good moisturiser but not for my skin type at all. So now just to finish off the product i use it on my hands or as an eye cream.\n\n>WNRP. Holy Fail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Formularx Barrier Relief Moisturizer** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 10 weeks {*currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: Water, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin. \n\nBrief review: I love this, my skin loves this and I really hate that I love it because it is a very problematic brand. But, nevertheless, the product deserves the love, it is lightweight and still moisturises my skin well. In winters I get weird dry patches on my skin and it peels off. This moisturiser prevented it. It layers well with my actives and makeup and it overall soothing and does the work it claims. I am almost one with my first tube and even though it is expensive, it lasts a good time for me so can call it worth the money. I also love how it is in an aluminium tube instead of a plastic one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Sunscreen*\n\n**UV Doux Sunscreen gel**\n\nUsage: currently in use {*only use when I step outside*}\n\nBrief review: I love this, bought this on recommendations from this channel and the texture is oh so lovely. The only con is the smell as it smells like baby powder x old deo lol but still a good purchase.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Miscellaneous*\n\n**Sheet Mask - The Face Shop**\n\nReally loving these face masks these days incase anyone wanted a review, hehe.",

Since then I’ve found some products that work really well for me and which haven’t been mentioned on this sub before, so I decided to share my shelfie and write some reviews.\n\nI'm happy to hear your opinion about the products or my routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin type**\n\nDry and sensitive, some general redness, not acne-prone.\n\nMy skin reacts to most artificial fragrances and some essential oils. \n\nI also prefer to use products with “natural” ingredients and try to avoid parabens, PEGs, micro plastic and mineral oil as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Products (from left to right):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch** \n\nINCI: AQUA, CENTAUREA CYANUS FLOWER WATER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, CETEARYL WHEAT STRAW GLYCOSIDES, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, STEARIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, TOCOPHEROL, LACTIC ACID\n\nPrice 11 € for 200ml, available at Müller drugstore in Germany\n\nThis gentle cleansing milk is one of my holy grail products. All other cleansers that I’ve tried before where either super drying and/or made me break out. This one isn’t drying at all and yet leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Only on days when I wear a lot of makeup I need to do an additional oil cleanse. I like that the formulation is not too watery, so it’s easy to spread on my face. It doesn’t have a noticeable smell. The bottle lasts a long time for me, usually over 6 months even with daily use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme**\n\nINCI: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, CERA ALBA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, KAOLIN, ZINC OXIDE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice 2 € for 50ml, available at Rossmann drugstore \n\nThis water free balm with oils and beeswax is a thick and oily formulation, similar to a cold cream. I sometimes use it on cold and dry winter days as a thin layer between my daytime moisturizer and sunscreen. I’m not sure if it truly qualifies as an occlusive cream, but in my experience it does help with preventing moisture loss in dry weather. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and when you apply too much your face is going to shine like crazy. I noticed that when I use this cream several days in a row my skin texture starts to feel a bit smoother than usual. The beeswax smell is nice too. It works well under makeup as long as you give it enough time to dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaveel  (OTC pharmacy cream, made by HEEL)**\n\nINCI: ECTOIN\\*, AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, SQUALANE, TOCOPHEROL, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, VANILLA PLANIFOLIA FRUIT EXTRACT, ALCOHOL DENAT., CARBOMER, SODIUM CARBOMER, RHIZOBIAN GUM, CORYLUS AVELLANA BARK EXTRACT, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, C12-16 ALCOHOLS, PALMITIC ACID, CERAMIDE 3\n\n\\*Since this cream is a medical product, its active ingredient (Ectoin) is listed first, even though it’s not the main ingredient.\n\nPrice about 10 € for 30ml in online pharmacies \n\nSo this is a medical product for people with neurodermatitis that was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has a thick, slightly oily consistency but doesn’t take too long to get absorbed into skin. The smell is slightly chemical. Its active ingredient, Ectoin, is supposed to protect skin cells from environmental stress factors and help with skin barrier restoration. It is also used in other products such as eye drops and nasal sprays.\n\nNow I don’t know enough about skincare to judge how solid the research behind this patented molecule is. When my skin was a bit over exfoliated a few months ago, my experience was that Dermaveel was in fact better at repairing my damaged skin barrier than other moisturizers that I tried.\n\nI only use this cream during the winter months; it’s too heavy for warm summer days, even for my dry skin. I use it as a daytime moisturizer a few times per week; I find it a bit too pricey for everyday use. Unfortunately it does sometimes pill up under my makeup foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manuka Repair Creme/Miel de Manuka Crème Réparatrice (OTC pharmacy cream, made by French brand Comptoirs & Compagnies)**\n\nINCI: MEL, AQUA, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA SEED OIL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SQUALANE,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, LEVULINIC ACID, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LEVULINATE, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice about 10 € for 40ml in online pharmacies\n\nThe reason why I bought this was simply that I really wanted to try a Manuka product. It contains 40% GMO 300 Manuka Honey. This isn’t exactly the highest GMO rating, but it’s the best price-performance ratio I could find. Despite its 40% honey content it has an average moisturizer consistency, not sticky, dries fast. The smell is amazing! Very sweet, smells of honey and beeswax.\n\nWith my dry skin I found it not hydrating enough as standalone moisturizer, though it might work for normal to oily skin. I apply this in the evening (few times a week) in combination with my usual moisturizer (TO NMF). On the next morning my skin is smooth and soft; feels slightly exfoliated and overall texture seems to be improved. Manuka honey, or honey in general, is said to have exfoliating properties. Manuka also has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects though I can’t really comment on that since I luckily don’t have any breakouts at the moment.\n\nOnce or twice I made the mistake to use the Manuka repair cream on the same evening as my AHA exfoliator- which resulted in slightly flakey skin on the next morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dado Sens Sun - Sonnencreme SPF 30**\n\nINCI: AQUA \\[WATER\\], DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE (UVINUL A PLUS) , ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE (UVINUL T 150), BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (TINOSORB S), GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE (OCTISALATE), SUCROSE PALMITATE, DISTARCH PHOSPHATE, PANTHENOL, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NON-NANO), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CANDELILLA/JOJOBA/RICE BRAN POLYGLYCERYL-3 ESTERS, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM STEAROYL LACTYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, BENZYLIDENE DIMETHOXYDIMETHYLINDANONE, ALLANTOIN, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, SODIUM ALGINATE, CALCIUM ALGINATE, GLYCINE SOJA OIL \\[SOYBEAN\\], ALUMINA, STEARIC ACID, ECTOIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE\n\nPrice 20 € for 125ml, available at Müller, Douglas\n\nThis is my favourite sunscreen ever! Definitely a holy grail candidate. Sunscreens have always been a bit problematic for me, for two reasons: 1: I need to use a product without acrylates, which unfortunately are an ingredient in nearly every sunscreen formulation ever.  2: I’m a bit picky about sunscreen filters; I’d rather not use problematic filters like Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone and Homosalate. And now I finally found something that works for me!\n\nDado Sens Sonnencreme SPF 30 has a thick, creamy consistency, perfect for my dry skin but it is probably too much for oily skin. There is no noticeable white cast, however I’m pale as ghost anyway, so results might be different for darker skin tones. It leaves a small amount of shine but I’m not too bothered by this. Smell is slightly chemical (different from usual sunscreen smell) but not very strong.\n\nThe downsides are that it has only SPF 30 and contains alcohol. I don’t find it drying though. What I like best about it is that it has great filters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ARGININE, ASPARTIC ACID, GLYCINE, ALANINE, SERINE, VALINE, ISOLEUCINE, PROLINE, THREONINE, HISTIDINE, PHENYLALANINE, GLUCOSE, MALTOSE, FRUCTOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, UREA, ALLANTOIN, LINOLEIC ACID, OLEIC ACID, PHYTOSTERYL CANOLA GLYCERIDES, PALMITIC ACID, STEARIC ACID, LECITHIN, TRIOLEIN, TOCOPHEROL, CARBOMER, ISOCETETH-20, POLYSORBATE 60, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIETHANOLAMINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN\n\nPrice 10 € for 100ml, available at Douglas\n\nI actually don’t want to write too much about this one, there are already tons of reviews on this sub. It has fairly good INCIs, doesn’t dry or break me out and is cheap – that’s all that I want in a moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), LACTIC ACID, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, TASMANNIA LANCEOLATA FRUIT/LEAF EXTRACT, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, XANTHAN GUM, ISOCETETH-20, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPrice 7 € for 30ml, available at Douglas\n\nThis is the first acid exfoliator I ever bought, so I can’t really compare it to other products. After a short purging period it got rid of the tiny closed comedones I had all over my face within about 6 weeks.  I like it a lot and use it about twice per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeless Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum**\n\nINCI: WATER, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS, GLYCERIN, HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL 3000™, BENZYLALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nThis is usually not available in Europe. I found it at my local TK Maxx store for 10 €. Bought it because I wanted to try Vitamin C. The lightweight, watery formulation is nice. It doesn’t have any noticeable smell.\n\nI’ve been using this for 8 weeks now and don’t really see any difference. When it’s empty I’m probably going to replace it with a more potent Vitamin C product from The Ordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Salthouse Totes Meer Therapie - Beruhigende Maske Akut** (Picture only shows lower half of sachet)\n\nINCI: AQUA, CELLULOSE GUM, GLYCERIN, PANTHENOL, PROPANEDIOL, MARIS SAL (DEAD SEA SALT), PROPYLENE GLYCOL, MAYTENUS MACROCARPA (CHUCHUHUASI) BARK EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL ALCOHOL\n\nPrice 1.25€ for 2x7ml, available at DM drugstore\n\nThis is a gel mask with Dead Sea salt and other calming ingredients. It calms down irritated skin and reduces redness. Most of the time it doesn’t completely get rid of the redness, but there is a visible difference. A hydrating, oil free formulation which I think is suitable for all skin types. The smell is slightly sweet but otherwise neutral. As usual, one of those “single-use” sachets is enough for at least three applications. It’s currently not a permanent part of my routine, but I use it whenever my skin gets irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schaebens Augen & Lippen Maske**\n\nINCI: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, DIISOSTEAROYL POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIMER DILINOLEATE, GLYCERIN, CERA ALBA, ZINC STEARATE, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCINE SOJA OIL, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA WATER, PANTHENOL, RETINYL PALMITATE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, UBIQUINONE, ALCOHOL, BENZOIC ACID, CITRAL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LACTIC ACID, LIMONENE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBIC ACID\n\nPrice 0.60€ for 4x1.5ml, available at DM, Rossmann\n\nThis is the only product with essential oils that I put on my face. It works surprisingly well for my sensitive skin. Even though it is advertised as an eye-and–lip mask and the instructions say to take it off after 10 mins., I use it as an overnight leave on mask for my whole face.\n\nIn the morning my skin feels plump and well hydrated. The mask reduces very fine lines overnight. Not permanently of course, but the effect does last at least a day for me.\n\nWhen I use this mask everyday my pores start to clog up after a while, so I make sure to not use it too frequently. 2 or 3 times a week is completely fine though. It’s also super cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n**AM**\n\n\\-wash face with water\n\n\\- moisturizer: either TO NMF or Dermaveel\n\n\\- on cold days:  Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme\n\n\\- sunscreen: Dado Sens  Sun Sonnencreme SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n\\- Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch\n\n\\- one of the following:\n\n* TO NMF\n* TO LA 5% + TO NMF\n* Timeless HAC Serum + TO NMF\n* Manuka Repair Creme + TO NMF\n* Schaebens Augen und Lippen Maske as leave on overnight mask on whole face",

But the physical store still has the label claiming all the Goku-jyun Alpha products have retinol.\n\nHowever, the [Hada Labo SG website](https://www.hadalabo.com.sg/antiageing-1) only lists **one** product in the Goku-jyun Alpha range as having retinol. I will have to check again to see if the Anti-aging + 3D Gel Moisturiser actually has retinol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have several questions:\n\n1. Why is a different version of the product being sold in Singapore? (If it's because Singapore has tighter restrictions on retinoids, why are other products containing retinyl palmitate sold normally?)\n2. Why are stores selling the Lifting+Firming Lotion (Rich) as having retinol, when it actually doesn't?\n3. Is this incompetence, or intentionally false/misleading marketing?\n4. Are there other regions selling the non-retinol version of the \"red\" range?",

Because even japanese snacks like pocky and the drink pocari sweat are from those countries. The real legit ones in japan all have a MADE IN JAPAN at the back. For legit products they actually import it from Japan, and for the sake of local people they slap on a sticker over it with the translation. Meaning when you tear of the outer plastic, inside is the untouched japanese packaging with full on japanese.\n\nWhenever I see the entire packaging is changed, and in english, I'm very suspicious of where it came from. Whether it's locally made or what. I don't know if you know the brand but when I checked Singapore's Fancl, it looked different from the one I know. The different color, the english words, I don't know where it's from but it's not the japanese one. I don't care if the ingredients are the same I just don't like it. I think the Melano CC is from Thailand because of the different packaging. And the period pads Laurier, the ones in english are locally made. Only the shiawase suhada ones are real, because it's the original with a translation sticker at the back.",

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Avène Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I could barely open them in broad daylight, and I had to go back home and wash my face to get it off. Do not, under any circumstances apply this close to your eyes.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn’t that bad of a sunscreen, but it’s also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn’t enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me. It might not have worked for my face, but it’s still a good sunscreen for the rest of the body.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Skinnies Sungel SPF30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, broad spectrum, PA++++ (PPD 16+)**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you’re pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick.

This sunscreen was bought in Europe. America/Canada/Australia/Asia might have a different version of this sunscreen, because of the country’s different restrictions on UV filters and sunscreen criteria (especially American sunscreens). These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants.

You note the dry-touch finish - which is great - but does it leave any or much shine?\n\nIt's worth noting that the Face SPF30 version has a 5 star (Boots?) UVA rating so the PPA / PPD factor should be around 27.. which is higher than most SPF50s, I'm sure! This appeals to me from an everyday usage standpoint where I can minimise UVB filter usage but still great 'anti-ageing' protection. Cheers",

I got it for Rs. 575/-.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Carbomer, Arginine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA, Pentylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Tripeptide-1, Hexapeptide-9, Hexapeptide-11, Copper Tripeptide-1\n\n**My Skin Type:** Combination skin with an oily T-zone\n\n**Usage:** Since Past 6 months\n\n**My Experience:** I absolutely enjoyed using this toner for the past few months. Here's why, this has a lightweight texture, thicker than water but thinner than a serum/gel, that gets absorbed on your skin easily. My skin never felt sticky or greasy on application. It used to get absorbed within a few minutes, even when I mistakenly applied it excessively. \n\nIt's a very hydrating. Due to seasonal change, my skin had become very dry. Whenever I applied this toner, I instantly felt a calming effect on my skin, and it helped lessening the dryness for a while. Obviously it ain't enough as you need a hydrating Moisturizer to go along with it. \n\nThis one has fragrance, but it wasn't too overpowering. If you're someone who can tolerate a little fragrance, you'll be okay. \n\nMy favourite part is how easy it's on your pocket. The price might appear a bit high, but the quantity makes up for the price. As listed above, I've been using the toner since last 6 months daily, still 30-40% is left. \n\n**WRP:** Maybe Yes. Why Maybe? Coz I'm a victim of FOMO who wants to keep on trying new skincare items. If I'm able to stick to one product, I can see SNP toner becoming a part of my regular routine.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:** A fantastic but underrated product.",

It's at about mid/upper back in length, and the only color I have is very very grown out highlights that are near the ends. I'm pretty oily at the roots, I wash my hair every 2 days or so, and cannot go longer than that despite my many attempts to try the hair training myth.\n\n**The goals I set with my subscription:** Oil Control, shine, volume, moisture\n\n**The “factors” they included based on my zip code:** UV protection, humidity, water hardness, pollution, wind. (who knows how much of this they actually factor in but whatever lol.)\n\n**Full Ingredients lists:**\n\n*Shampoo:*  Water, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Decyl- Glucoside, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Jasmin Flower Water, Propanediol Dicaprylate, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Tocopherol, PPG-Caprylyl Ether, Pyridoxine, Panthenol, Jujube Bark Extract, Peppermint Leaf Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Polyquaternium-10, Tropolone, Hydrolyzed Quinoa, Kale Leaf Extract, Citric Acid, Spirulina Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Yucca Stem Extract, Arginine, Cannabidiol, Cocamidopropyl PG- dimonium Chloride, Grape Seed Extract\n\n*Conditioner:* Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Fragrance, Cetrimonium Chloride, Birch Juice, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, PEG-7 Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Laureth-7, Polyquaternium-10, Tocopherol, Polysorbate 20, Poppy Seed Oil, Plum Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Cocamidopropyl PG-dimonium Chloride, Potassium Sorbate\n\n**(These lists look pretty basic to me. But I am curious on your thoughts on them.)**\n\n**The story:** I received the first order of Prose a few months ago. I genuinely liked the idea of customized haircare, so I was hopeful. Like many other people, they were *all over* my fucking IG ads, and this annoyed me but I (unfortunately) love trying new products way too much to ignore them 🙄. The set was good. I loved the scent, I loved how my hair looked, and it felt healthy & clean with each wash. It was spring at the time, and there was enough humidity in the air for my hair to have some volume in addition to these other perks. As the weather got cooler, I noticed that the formula seemed almost too conditioning for winter where humidity was much lower. This lead me to believe they did not in fact update it based on the weather in my area. My hair was very flat and limp, and occasionally felt weighed down. There was absolutely no help with the sebum control, but that was to be expected.\n\n**Flash forward to yesterday's post-** I read that the OP had very similar experiences to me *but* experienced more shedding with this product. Andddd I got to thinking. ***I, in fact, was noticing a lot more shedding than I was used to.*** I can't really recall when this increase in shedding started, because my hair was shorter when I first started using it (tiny past shoulder length)- so less hair showed in my shower drain cover. Now, my ponytail just feels a bit less thick. I can't see any bald spots or anything like that, and it is not something very severe- but the combo of seeing a lot of shedding in the shower and this less dense feeling in my ponytail made me feel just a little off. Like something just wasn't quite right. \n\nToday I decided to wash my hair with a different shampoo, a higher end drugstore one from Target called “Odele Volumizing Shampoo” which I used before Prose. And yall… The shedding was much less. Like, MUCH less. I am still shocked.\n\n\\***Let me just say\\*:**\n\n* ***I know that it is not common that a product alone causes more hairfall, and that usually there is a different or underlying reason.***\n* ***I recently had bloods and a physical and all is well with my health***\n* I highly doubt this product is actually harmful, so I am guessing that it simply caused more breakage to happen and that’s what I was seeing in the shower. But I will never really know.\n* ***This product caused no irritation or visible signs of it not agreeing with me, or I would have stopped using it.***\n* I normally would not jump to conclusions, but after seeing such a consistent amount of hairfall each time, it was too different of a result for me to not take into account. I am going to continue to use the regular shampoo and see if anything changes.\n\n**What's my point?:** Prose is ultimately a gimmick. They have very convincing ads that pray on people's fears about cosmetics and their hair health. My hair *looks* great with it, but I shed more for whatever reason and I'm not into that. I'm not sure I trust they are real chemists, either. \n\nThank you for reading!",

    "body": "I've seen a lot of people asking for the review of this product so decided to put up a separate post. \nIngredients: Centella Asiatica Extract(77%), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Tranexamic Acid, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Water, Betaine, Madecassoside, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Panthenol, Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Arginine, Mannitol, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Lactobacillus Ferment, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Pentylene Glycol, Glucose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\nWhat it does: Firstly it is suitable for almost all skin types. It hydrates and soothes the skin while also giving some amount of brightness. My first experience was that it gave me an instant glow for the first few days but then it acted like a hydrating serum. If you're looking for a serum which provides mild to moderate amount of glow with intense hydration then you can go for it. However, if you're looking for something that will effectively fade away your dark spots and Hyperpigmentation then this may not be enough. But remember for any product to work consistency is the key! To notice visible changes in your skin stick to a consistent routine for atleast 2-3 months and you'll definitely see results \n\nOther alternatives: If you've been using this ampoule for a few months now and don't see the desired results Or you want to try a serum for your dark spots then you can try The Anua 10% Niacinamide + 4% TXA Serum or the Numbuzin No.5 Vitamin C Serum",

    "body": "**Product:** Be Minimalist [Alpha Arbutin 02%](https://imgur.com/a/9umeBCM) (Reformulated)\n\n**Age:** 22 yrs\n\n**Period of usage:** 1 week (morning and night) \n\n*[This is just a first impression review, I’ll be posting an in-depth review on 3 months of usage]*\n\n**Ingredients List:** Aqua, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Ethoxydiglycol, Alpha Arbutin, Lactic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, 4-n-Butylresorcinol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Triethanolamine, PEG/PPG-17/6 Copolymer, Isoceteth-20, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n**Texture:** Runny consistency and clear texture. Feels like 5% oily over the skin.\n\n**A lil back story:**\n\n🔅Ever since Minimalist 2.0 launched, I’ve been pretty excited to try their reformulated serums. But sadly I had already purchased their salicylic facewash and Sepicalm moisturiser few months before their change of packaging. I had only two actives (PC’s 2% BHA and Azeclair + Propolis) in my daily routine and I had a 40% off coupon for Minimalist so I went ahead and decided to try the Alpha Arbutin Serum. \n\n🔅I received it last week and have been using it ever since in my morning as well as night routine (I halted the usage of PC’s BHA to check the efficiency of BM’s AA serum). \n\n**First Impression:**\n\n🔅I patch tested the serum and didn’t find signs of irritation so went ahead and applied it over my face. The first night when I used this serum, it foamed up a lil on my face. I was a lil worried for continued usage but since I didn’t face any reactions or negative effects the next morning, I decided to use it again in my morning routine. \n\n🔅During my one week of usage, I’ve seen a healhier skin as well as a glow on my face. Previously I had irritated my skin a lil with continuous use of PC’s BHA and using the AHA BHA PHA Chemical Peel along side. Although with using Alpha Arbutin I didn’t face any irritation or sensitivity on my face. \n\n**Decoding the Ingredients:** The Lactic Acid is pretty high up in the ingredient list although the Brand while advertising this serum has only used names of Alpha Arbutin, Butylresorcinol and ferulic acid. Maybe because the latter two are the new ingredients in the reformulated serum. BUT the earlier serum had lactic acid lower down in the ingredients, this one has it right after Alpha Arbutin. I wanted to try lactic acid in my skincare and I am pretty content this serum has it! \n\n**A few words of Wisdom when it comes to skincare**\n\n**🔸Be patient**\nI’ve been someone with persistent hormonal acne ever since I was 14 and have been to derms before and thats when my skincare journey started. \n\nEarlier I would try something for a month and expect huge results out of it. With time I’ve learned to wait and be patient. \n\n80% of my current skincare routine products are repurchased or ones I’ve been using over last 6 months. \nMy current repurchased skincare routine includes:\n\n- Neutrogena Extra Gentle facewash (been using for last 6 months in the morning)\n\n- PC’s 2% BHA exfoliant (been using since June’21)\n\n- Neutrogena Hydroboost Watergel as my morning moisturiser (been using it since a year) \n\n- Minimalist Sepicalm Moisturiser (been using it since June’2021)\n\nWith time I’ve seen a humongous difference in my skin. \n\n**🔸Hydrate and moisturise**\nThere was a point when I overused the actives thinking it would cleanse my pores or exfoliate my skin and give me the glow I want but unfortunately it left my skin sensitive and something as soothing as the Sepicalm gave me a stinging sensation on application.\n\n▫️This is when Cosrx snail played a HUGE role in calming my skin down. I’ve had Cosrx snail mucin since July’ 21 but I wasn’t consistent with usage as I couldn’t see or make out any use of it. Until I realised its the most important product in my skincare. \n\n▫️A lot of people including me think snail mucin is just a over huped product but its actually the only product that didn’t burn on my skin when my skin barrier was impaired.\n\n▫️Since I have acne prone skin, salicylic acid and AHAs is my only getaway for preventing breakouts and Cosrx Snail Mucin is the only ingredient that helps me use actives and keep my barrier intact. \n* I’ve been incorporating usage of snail mucin atleast once a day now. \n\n**🔸The little things that matter!**\n\n▫️Using a soft napkin to wipe face: This is something I’ve been doing since last 6 months and honestly it has shown a difference in terms of reduced irritation. I’ve been using bamboo fabric napkins which I’ve linked [here](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07CWBZWFJ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_MFSZRM1PFN1X202C6VZC).\n\n▫️Washing hands before washing face: The amount of germs on your hands would surprise you! And thats why I’ve started with this habit of thoroughly washing hands before washing my face. \n\n▫️Changing Pillow Case every night: A year back I would use the same pillow case for a fortnight, not knowing the difference it makes. Glad I came across this valuable knowledge and decided to change my pillow cover every single or every alternate days. \n\n▫️Everything that I’ve mentioned above has helped me improving my breakouts and marks on my face. Here’s a lil [proof](https://imgur.com/a/n3HWeeD) and progress over past one year. Hope y’all find this helpful!",

There is a study that says that PVP does not provide adequate protection against heat, unlike VP / VA.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Monohydric alcohols provide faster drying, better hold, less frizz and more manageable hair, but this is NOT helpful. Fast drying is stressful for the cuticles. Here you have to choose: straighten wet hair or dry. Some damage during styling with hot tools is the result of water boiling out of the inside of the fiber, causing blisters to form in the cuticle, which, when combed, lead to more damage.\r  \n\r  \nThe less water in your hair, the easier it is to style. There is also less chance of earning bubble hair.\r  \nBut even here it is not without drawbacks: the tools during styling remove more water than the hair can absorb from the air (the scientific term for this loss of moisture is syneresis). To recover from syneresis, it is necessary to submerge the hair in water to restore its original moisture level. At low humidity levels, hair becomes more brittle, breaks and splits more easily. For this, moisturizers are desirable in the composition of the products, which will make the hair more elastic and slow down the evaporation of moisture from the hair.\r  \n\r  \nThis is one of the reasons why I do not recommend thermal protection with monohydric alcohols, especially on a regular basis, and especially on bleached or severely damaged hair. You should not evaluate such thermal protection in terms of care - this is a purely \"convenient\" styling tool.\r  \n\r  \n\\- moisturizers are added to give hair elasticity, protect against dryness, and also to protect the product from drying out\"",

    "body": "Not sure if this only applies to Singapore, or if other regions also have this version instead of the version that actually has retinol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE: Japan uses the same version as Singapore.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This is what the SG version looks like, seen on the shelf at Guardian](https://imgur.com/atqrHGB) (note the word RETINOL clearly shown in the price label on the shelf)\n\n[This is what the ingredients list of the SG version looks like](https://imgur.com/iUn227w) (note: NO RETINOL / RETINOIDS WHATSOEVER)\n\nIngredients list, transcribed: *water, butylene glycol, glycerin, diglycerin, PEG-20 sorbitan isostearate, squalane, caprylic / capric triglyceride, methylparaben, limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, PPG-10 methyl glucose ether, phytosteryl / octyldodecyl lauroyl glutamate, carbomer, polyacrylate crosspolymer-11, triethanolamine, pullulan phytosteryl macadamiate, hydroxyethyl acrylate / sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer,xanthan gum, isohexadecane, disodium edta, sodium hyaluronate, lactobacillus / soymilk ferment filtrate, polysorbate 60, polyquaternium-51, hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium acetylated hyaluronate, ammonium acrylates copolymer, tetrapeptide-5, sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer, pentylene glycol, hydrolyzed elastin*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nContrast this with the ingredients list of the [US version](http://hadalabousa.com/products/anti-aging/):  *Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Beta Carotene, BHT, Caprylic/Capric  Triglyceride, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower)  Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein,  Hydroxyethylcellulose, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil,  Methylparaben, PEG-20 Sorbitan Isostearate, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether,*  ***Retinyl Palmitate***\\*, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate,  Thioctic Acid, Tocopherol, Triethanolamine, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis product is still being marketed as having retinol by pharmacy stores such as [Watsons](https://www.watsons.com.sg/retinol-lifting-firming-lotion-170ml/p/BP_32641?text%3DLifting+Firming+Lotion%26page%3D0=), though [Guardian](https://www.guardian.com.sg/hada-labo-lifting-and-firming-lotion-170ml/p/153863) only markets [one](https://www.guardian.com.sg/hada-labo-retiniol-3d-gel-100g/p/170582) product in the range as having \"retiniol\" (sp). But the physical store still has the label claiming all the Goku-jyun Alpha products have retinol.\n\nHowever, the [Hada Labo SG website](https://www.hadalabo.com.sg/antiageing-1) only lists **one** product in the Goku-jyun Alpha range as having retinol. I will have to check again to see if the Anti-aging + 3D Gel Moisturiser actually has retinol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have several questions:\n\n1. Why is a different version of the product being sold in Singapore? (If it's because Singapore has tighter restrictions on retinoids, why are other products containing retinyl palmitate sold normally?)\n2. Why are stores selling the Lifting+Firming Lotion (Rich) as having retinol, when it actually doesn't?\n3. Is this incompetence, or intentionally false/misleading marketing?\n4. Are there other regions selling the non-retinol version of the \"red\" range?",

I could be wrong but I think that they are just releasing in the EU the l’Oreal Paris UV Defender sunscreen that is already available in india and looks pretty nice from what I’ve seen until now. \nPlus, a foaming cleanser with vitamin c too.",

Biore has a strong alcoholic scent (and stings my eyes) while the alcohol content in LRP is not noticeable.\n\nColor\n\n* CeraVe and LRP have a light yellow tint while Biore has more of a cream color.\n\nConsistency:\n\n* Biore has a gel-like texture. LRP feels like a cream moisturiser that is similar to La Mer soft cream. CeraVe is a paste.\n\nSpreadability:\n\n* Biore and LRP are easily spreadable. CeraVe is difficult to spread, forms lumps and cannot be spread evenly.\n\nFinish:\n\n* CeraVe sits on the skin and remains a pile of cream-colored gunk no matter how long I leave it on. It pills upon application of any makeup above it.\n\n* Biore settles into the skin within 3-5 minutes. White cast is present but barely noticeable. It is non-drying and finishes slightly dewy afterwards. Foundation friendly, can replace primer. When I don't put on make-up I find it necessary to apply loose powder over it so that it looks matte.\n\n* LRP takes 5-8 minutes to settle into the skin. A barely noticeable white cast is present and it has a nice even texture. It is non-drying and finishes slightly more dewy than Biore. Foundation-friendly and can replace primer.\n\nRemoval:\n\n* All three sunscreens can be removed by Cetaphil cleanser, but CeraVe requires more rubbing than the other two sunscreens. You should be able to wash off all three with a regular body wash.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\n* I don't know why I still haven't thrown away the CeraVe AM. I should have done so earlier.\n\n* Both LRP and Biore are nice sunscreens. Although there are many Japanese sunscreens that have comparable or better performance, Biore should be one of the best choice within this price range.\n\n* LRP is known to have a wide range of sunscreens with different consistencies and added functions. They are also well known for making high PPD sunscreens (good UVA protection). Uvidea Aqua Fresh Gel is indeed a very good sunscreen. Being a Japanese-based line under La Roche Posay, it is very well balanced between good UVA protection typical of an European sunscreen and user-friendly consistency of a Japanese sunscreen, but I am expecting more from it with its high price.",

Aldi replaced it with Formic Acid for which CosDNA has no irritant/acne score, but did replace Laureth-10 with Laureth-4 which is worse according to CosDNA (but it’s very low on the ingredients list). \n\nAldi foaming wash has added Lactic Acid lower down on the list (Moisturising in low concentrations).\n\nBoth kinds of Aldi wash have added Glycerin.\n\nAt first glance, Aldi improved their face wash while Simple made theirs possibly slightly worse. \n\nAll product images here https://imgur.com/a/Y2qE1LZ",

    "body": "I have short wavy to curly hair that generally gets very frizzy. It is dry, with normal scalp. I have a lot (A LOT) of really thick hair. It is high porosity and takes hours to dry, even when chin lenght as it is now. The texture is very mixed, with some slightly wavy strands all the way up to kinky curly ones. I'd say most of it falls in category 2B.\n\n\nI have been wearing my hair curly and was getting fantastic results with a product by Rene Furterer, the Veloute Perfecteur de Boucles. It was a light, non greasy cream and I could use a fair amount of it without any adverse effects. Something in it really helps with curl formation, and all I had to do was put it into still rather wet hair, and let it dry. Perfect, consistent results every time. The hair was curly, light, perfectly hydrated.\n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Water, ethyhexyl palmitate, cetearyl alcohol, acanthus mollis leaf extract, amodimethicone, BHT, butylparaben, cetearyl glucoside, cetrimonium chloride, disodium EDTA, ethylparaben, fragrance (parfum), inulin lauryl carbamate, isobutylparaben, maltodextrin, methylparaben, persea gratissima (avocado) oil (persea gratissima oil), phenoxyethanol, polyquaternium-37, polyquaternium-68, propylparaben, trideceth-12.*\n\n\nA few months ago, they changed the line. Now the cream feels sticky and heavy, and although it still does promote curl formation (could be the acanthe extract, that is what the brand claims in their marketing), it makes my hair greasy and stringy and really just not nice. So, cue in another product hunt. Lots of money already into it, I'm not getting there... I now need a leave in, a defining curl cream and a gel to get lesser results, and I have to be so careful not to touch my hair under penalty of turning into a frizz ball.\n\n\nHere are the ingredients of the new, totally not improved product:\n\n\n*Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, BHT, Butylphenyl, Methylpropional, Ceteareth-33, Citronellol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lactic Acid, Limonene, Linalool, Maltodextrin, Oenothera Biennis, (Evening Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-68, Salicylic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Dissucinate.*\n\n\n**Is there anyone who is knowledgeable enough to take a look at the differences between old and new and maybe shed some light on how I can find another perfect product? My wallet and I thank you in advance.**",

[It's now finally up on the website](https://www.superdrug.com/search?text=calm+skin), meaning I can post about it without having to type out all the ingredients by hand ;)\n\nThe range has a night mask, a facial oil, a cleanser, a 'rescue gel', a hydrating spray and a 2-in-1 serum/moisturiser. They're all £2.99, and they're all on buy 1 get 1 half price. I bought 4 products - the mask, the rescue gel, the spray and the serum/moisturiser. I skipped on the cleanser, as it has SLS, and I couldn't be bothered with the oil at the time, especially since I wanted even numbers because of the offer. \n\nI also emailed Superdrug's customer support to enquire about the % of niacinamide, as I was worried it would be insufficient. After some back-and-forth, the customer service rep contacted the new product team and got this response:\n\n\"I cannot give out specific information regarding our formulations but I can confirm that the percentage of niacinamide is >5% in all of the below.\"\n\nThe below being the four products I was asking about, I imagine. (The oil doesn't have niacinamide, btw - it's only soluble in water)\n\nAnyway, nice!\n\nAfter a month or so of testing on and off, here's my mini reviews of the ones that I got:\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin De-Stress Refreshing Facial Spritz 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-De-Stress-Refreshing-Facial-Spritz-100ml/p/741142)**\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Glycerin, Niacinamide, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Betaine, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Potassium Sorbate, Bisabolol, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Moisturising spray? It's kind of weird. There's a slight oiliness to it, and a definite stickiness which is probably the large amount of glycerin. \n\n**Scent:** Definitely floral, vaguely chamomile-y\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, this is... a bit weird? I've mostly been using it as a hydrating toner. The difficulty is that it plays nice with some serums/moisturisers, but with others it seems to lead to bobbling. But I am rather bobble-prone, so it might just be me. Anyway, if I can get it to go on okay it definitely makes me feel more hydrated, particularly when I'm in the dry-aired office I keep complaining about. One day I was feeling kinda bored so I tried out the '7 skin' method by spraying it on every few minutes until it wouldn't absorb any more. I think I got to about six? It definitely hydrated my skin! And probably calmed it down as well. Is it a bad idea to put so much niacinamide on your skin? I don't know, but it's unlikely I'm going to be doing this on a regular basis.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Well, it's a very cheap, very hydrating toner, so probably.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Hydrating 2in1 Serum & Moisturiser 50ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Face-Cream/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Hydrating-2in1-Serum-%26-Moisturiser-50ml/p/741125)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Isopropyl Myristate, Niacinamide, ‭Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Polyacrylamide, Butylene Glycol, ‭Phenoxyethanol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethiconol, Parfum, Betaine, Laureth-7, ‭Bisabolol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, ‭Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa ‭Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower ‭Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, ‭Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** So siliconey it's vaguely unnerving\n\n**Scent:** Heady floral, not unpleasant but kinda odd to find in this context. It's not at all chamomile-like? More of a tuberose, kinda luxe-y but definitely not one for people who don't like heavy scent\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, I think the reason it's described as a 2-in-1 is that there's SO MUCH SILICONE you really can't use much else with it or it will turn into a peeling gel, which is what it did to me several times. I think it might be a good thing for me in the summer when I need something very light, but right now I want to use a heavier, more wintery moisturiser and to layer stuff and this isn't meant for that at allll\n\n**Will I repurchase?** I don't know, let me try it out in the summer and see if I can find a sunscreen that'll play nice with it.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Rescue Gel 15ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Rescue-Gel-15ml/p/741146)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Salicylic Acid, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Bisabolol, Potassium Sorbate, Allantoin, Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile)Flower Extract, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gel\n\n**Scent:** Alcohol\n\n**Overall Experience:** Okay, so in the cold light of day I should have looked at that ingredient list and run screaming. Why are they trying to combine salicylic acid (works best at pH <3.5) and niacinamide (becomes irritating at pH<4.5)? Why is the fourth ingredient citric acid? Did putting on an alcohol gel ever help a single spot?\nI did actually try this a couple of times and it did nothing much, which honestly is better than I should have expected, by rights it should have made my face fall off.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Nope\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Overnight Face Mask 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Overnight-Face-Mask-100ml/p/741143)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, ‭Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, Prunus ‭Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, ‭Phenoxyethanol, Polyacrylamide, Parfum, Sodium ‭Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, ‭Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Isohexadecane, C13-14 ‭Isoparaffin, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 80, Bisabolol, ‭Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate ‭(Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sorbitan ‭Oleate, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, ‭Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium ‭Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gloop. Sinks in pretty quickly.\n\n**Scent:** Light floral\n\n**Overall Experience:** Help, I really like this. It goes on nicely even over other stuff (eg Scinic Honey AIO), is nice and occlusive, smells okay and - the kicker - actually leaves my skin looking better in the morning, with red marks noticeably diminished. My only complaint is that it's tiny, considering you'll want to use a hefty glop of the stuff.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Almost certainly",

Niacinamide isn't necessarily irritating in higher pH products, otherwise the vast majority of skincare products with niacinamide would be irritating, since most products aren't formulated at <pH 4.5. Alcohol denat. is a penetration enhancer and many people don't have issues with alcohol in skincare, particularly if their skin is in good condition to begin with and/or if they don't have alcohol in every single product. Citric acid is a pH adjuster. It's almost impossible just by looking at an ingredient list to be able to talk at length about the overall formula, and none of these ingredients in a normal product are 'face falling off' level of concern.

    "body": "Little background: \nI started DIYing as a solution to the lack of hair product I could use due fragrance and other allergies. I have wavy to curly 2c hair that can get very dry but also prone to losing volume. The product I've been trying to perfect the most is a hair gel. I want some thing that helps calm frizz, gives a little volume and enhances my curls. Here is what I've discovered about 3 gelling agents (carbomer, hydroxethycellulose, and xanthan gum) in my formulating and trials:\n\n**Carbomer** \n\n(disclaimer, I've worked with this as a ready made base I bought from Bulk Apothecary but have not used the powder. I've heard its super easy to use but don't want give my opinion as I have not used the powder yet):\n\n**Pros:** Crystal clear gel, gives curls a \"chunky\" look, little to no flaking when dry even without a plasticizer like glycerine, or sorbitol, though it performs better with one.\n\n**Cons:** has to be combined with a holding agent like pvp or vp/va to give the hair hold that will last. Is not compatible with cationic conditioners like BTMS. This is an issue when using a leave-in that has those ingredients under the gel, something most curlies need to do to retain moisture. The reaction can cause the conditioner to not work and even ball up and  cause white chunks in the hair at worst. Needs an emulsifer like polysorbate if you want to add oils. Formulation has to be at a neutral ph around 6-7, hair's ph is closer to 5 and prefers products at around 4-5. This can make the hair feel dry after a day of wear. Also, there some speculation that the agents used to raise the pH to form gel with carbomer like triethonolamine can damage hair but I can't comfirm this.\n\n**Hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC)**\n\nPros: Clear gel, highly compatible with cationic condtioners, you can even mix them in your hand, will gel at lower pH. Gives hair some volume and helps clump curls though not as well as carbomer. Hair has a soft, fluffy look, which I personally like but this could be a con if seeing more definition\n\nCons: Hydration requires using boiling water and mixing intervals. EDIT: Slurry technique (dissolving the powder in glycerin) does work as long as hot water is used, but a 20 min wait time is needed for full hydration.  Needs a lot of plasticizer (I use 5-10% glycerin) or it will flake badly, has very little hold on its own an needs to be combined with something like pvp or xanthan gum for stronger hold. Hair tends to feel a little dry after a day of wear, though not as dry as with carbomer.\n\n**Xanthan Gum**\n\nPros: Super easy to hydrate, especially with the slurry technique and a high speed stick blender. Water does not have to be hot and hydration happens immediately. Has good hold on its own. Does not dry hair out even after days of wear. Doesn't really flake unless excessive amounts are applied. Somewhat compatible with cationic conditioner. No reaction in a layering situation, but will clump up a little if you mix them together, though not nearly as much as carbomer.  Gels at a low pH. Seems to tighten curls and make them really defined similar to flax seed gel. Mixes well with oils without emulsifier. \n\nCons: Cloudy, whitish gel. Curls are super defined and not \"chunky\" (this might not be a con depending on the look you want), hair takes longer to dry. Doesn't seem to give as much volume as HEC or carbomer, but this might be the because of the increased definition. Also, I've noticed lately that after about a day of wear, my hair develops a slight vinegar smell. The gel itself doesn't really have a smell though.\n\nEDIT: So I said my favorite is xanthan gum and its definitely the easiest I've worked with but I think I might like the look I get with HEC more as I like soft fluffy curls more than super defined curls, and I like that is compatible with BTMS-based conditioners as I need to leave quite a bit in as my hair is naturally dry. I've mixed them together and I get a good look with that too but the next thing i want to try is mixing pvp or vp/va  in with the HEC for more hold, or start experimenting with polyquats.\n\n\n",

    "body": "Day 4/7 this brand is underrated but their products work better than other brands I know of. So this brand is cruelty-free and vegan. It focuses more on sensitive skin, clean ingredients, hydration, and improving the skin Barrier in the long term. Any skin type can use the products and the main ingredient is the olive squalene and hyaluronic acid. They also use a blend of three different hyaluronic acid sizes (they have the smallest HA size for skincare in the world). If you've ever been to Sephora and saw that expensive and much-raved brand that uses squalene oil in everything, this is a cheaper alternative. The pH of everything is a 5.5. If you are looking for something for sensitive skin I'd think this is a good brand. \n\nDisclaimer: what worked for me might not work for you. I was gifted 3 of the products last year which got me interested in the entire line.\n\nEdit : some if the products have been reformulated so im not sure how it might impact the product. \n\nDual moist toning lotion 180ml:\n\nTo me, it's not worth it and there are definitely better hydrating toners worth your money. However, if every toner irritates you and you have dehydrated skin or just really sensitive skin you will like this. This is a good hypoallergenic hydrating basic toner. My friend has eczema and acne prone skin and loves this toner but now I got her wanting the pyunkang Yul's acne line. It's more viscous than water and dispensed well also comes sealed. \n\nIngredients - Water, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Arginine, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Octyldodecanol, Dodecane, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Octadecane, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Citric Acid, Tetradecane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Linoleic Acid\n\n❤️Dual moist comfort cream 75ml:\n\nMy favourite daytime moisturiser works well in winter and summer it's perfect if your oil-water balance is out if wack. In the summer is adjust excessive sebum so I sweat less on my face but keeps me hydrated in the winter time. Feels like a gel, absorbs fairly quickly. It's a basic essential. Uses panthenol, madecassoside, and Allantoin to soothe, repair and strengthen skin. \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-10, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Dimethicone, Squalane (Olive Squalane), Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Arginine, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Ceramide NP, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Octyldodecanol, Dodecane, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Sorbitan Isostearate, Polysorbate 60, Octadecane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, PEG-20 Glyceryl Stearate, Potassium Hydroxide, Tetradecane, Disodium EDTA, PEG-100 Stearate, Polyglutamic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Linoleic Acid\n\n❤️Dual moist hyaluronic Essence 100ml:\n\nclaims to rapidly hydrate even dry or sensitive skin without irritation. It does work. One if my favourite essences an alternative to the cosrx snail in terms of the hydrating effects your skin gets. If you are vegan and want the hydrating effects and healing effects of Centella Asiatica and vitamin E from tocopherol this could be great for you. My skin was soothed and cooled down, quickly. Absorbs fairly fast feels and hydrating on the skin. \n\nEdit: I repurchased this and didn't notice any actual change to the product still worked. I tried like putting drops of both on my face and I guess the new formula kept my skin more hydrated. But it still works the same but if you have an allergy to anything in the new formulation I'd pass. \n\nIngredients \n\nWater, Pentylene Glycol, Polyglycerin-3, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Collagen, Madecassoside, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, C14-22 Alcohols, Xanthan Gum, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate\n\nUpdated formula:\nWater, PentyleneGlycol, Squalane, Polyglycerin-3, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Gardenia TahitensisFlower, Tocopherol, CamelliaSinensisLeaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita(Matricaria) FlowerExtract, CentellaAsiatica Extract, AloeBarbadensis LeafExtract, LavandulaAngustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Glycerin,Cetearyl Olivate,Sorbitan Olivate, C14-22 Alcohols, Xanthan Gum, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside,PulsatillaKoreanaExtract, ZanthoxylumPiperitum Fruit Extract,UsneaBarbata(Lichen) Extract, Arginine, Gaultheria Procumbens(Wintergreen) Leaf Extract\n\nFluid oil 30ml:\n\nIf you have TO squalene oil I'll pass on this one they both have 100% organic squalene oil. This one is more cosmetically elegant but save $30 while you can if you are interested in squalene oil by itself. \n\nEmollient extra comfort cream 75ml\n\nContains panthenol too (D-panthenol contains vitamin B5) it feels sticky when applied. If your skin is dry or dehydrated or if you have combination skin but live in a dry climate you will enjoy this. It's a really heavy cream and I dislike the feeling since it takes a while to absorb but my skin doesn't feel hydrated. \n\nIngredients : \n\nWater, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glycerin, Squalane(Olive Squalane), Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Arginine, Ceramide NP, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Carbomer, Octyldodecanol, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Wax, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Dodecane, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Octadecane, Tetradecane, Dimethicone, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Linoleic Acid\n\nNew formulation - Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Squalane, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate,Cetearyl Olivate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Canola Oil, Xanthan Gum, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract\n\nEmollient cleansing bar\n\nDoesn't contain any harsh sulfates or anything but I don't like cleansing bars in general. Good for body and face and it won't dry your skin out if you have oily - combo skin. Honestly, there are so many better cleansing gels/milks/foams that I think work better than this bar. It's cleansing properties are abysmal at best and it struggles to remove even the minimal makeup I wear occasionally. My friend hated this too and pointed out to me that looks like it can easily get bacteria on the product. \n\nIngredients:\n\nTriticum Vulgare Wheat Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Potassium Lauryl Sulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Aqua, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Avocado Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Calophyllum Inophyllum, Olea Europaea, Squalidae, Sodium Hyaluronate, D-Panthenol, Tocopherol Acetate, Glycerin, Spinacia Olearacea Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Sapindus Trifoliatus, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Spinacia Oleracea L., Chorella, Allantoin, Olive Butter\n\nI think they are. Trying to do something cool with their brand but because what they focus on are pretty basic stuff not all people may like it. I think the dual moist comfort cream is a great moisturiser for any skin type and the essence and toner are good items. However, by making products like the cleansing bar or their clay mask (which you can't purchase anywhere anymore)... By only using this brand in my routine my skin looked dull despite being hydrated. My friend who tried some of the products with me saw her skin Barrier become healthier over the next few months and her sensitivity to products decreased slightly. Anybody with a sensitive skin type or dehydrated - dry skin would enjoy trying some of the line. You can get the brand on stylekorean.com, yesstyle, roseroseshop, or ohholly\n\nHope this was helpful i feel like it was kind of a messy review 😅\n\nEdit: It remind me of the ordinary because of the reformulation changes and how they use olive squalene (squalene derived from olives) instead of shark squalene to make it cruelty free.

I also follow a kinda skincycling routine wich includes a non AB Retinal product.\n\nIn **Bold** will be the product name + how long i have been using it\n\nin *italic* will be the ingredients i liked\n\n\n\n**Axis-Y Sunday morning cleanser: (using for a month now)** *green tea extract, centella extract, allatonin*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Coco-Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-67, Xylitylglucoside, Citric Acid, Anhydroxylitol, Propanediol, Xylitol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Glucose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium EDTA, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Agrimonia Eupatoria Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Allantoin, Perilla Frutescens Leaf Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Extract, Sodium Acetate, Pentylene Glycol, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Natto Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\nTexture:\n\na balmy texture, foams up to a dense and soft foam\n\nExpirience:\n\nI picked this up because I wanted to change from my old clenaser to something that felt like it had a bit more cleansing power, yet was not stripping. As far as i can tell it seems to accomplish that. It foams up nicely, cleans well and doesent seem to strip my Skin. After washing it off it feels almost as if there is a slight layer on my Skin, but i dont mind it/ think that it contributes to the non stripping?\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Cosrx Propolis Toner: (about a month 1/2 of use)** *propolis, honey extract, panthenol*\n\nIngredients:\n\nPropolis Extract, Honey Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Panthenol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n\nTexture:\n\na waterlike texture, thats just a bit thicker\n\nExpirience:\n\nTo be honest im not overly impressed... its a nice hydrating toner for sure but i didnt notice anything outstanding that would have me choose it again. But it gets a pluspoint for being reasonably priced so i migth pick it up again to reach free shipping...\n\n(3/5)\n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Waterproof Sungel (3 Months of use)** *Aloe*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Juice, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, T-butyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Ceramide Np, Phytosphingosine, Parfum\n\nTexture:\n\na thin cream Texture, not runny but almost there\n\nExpirience:\n\nIt comes in quite a big size for a Sunscreen, you can find 80 - 100 ml Tubes online for around 15-17 Euros! Wich honestly was the sole reason why i bougth it xD i figured my skin would be fine with the Ingredients and i just hate tiny sunscreens! And well... that was exactly what it is like, its decently moisturizing and doesnt irritate my Skin. But if you have sensitive Skin be careful, it does have Fragrance, smells kinda like very artificial Aloe. You can smell it but only upon first apllication, it doesnt linger. I have been using 1 bottle for 3 months and still have enough for another month at min. so a win!\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Mask: (3 months of use)** *Squalane, Centella Extract, Jojoba oil, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Ceramide*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract(250,000Ppm), Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Panthenol, Ceramide NP(3,000Ppm), Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sodium Carbomer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract\n\nTexture:\n\nA thick Cream, feels quite emmolient\n\nExpirience:\n\nI love, love, loe this! Its the first moisturizer that i found that feels like it actually does its job well on my Skin. As a nigthtime moisturizer it keeps my Skin hydrated all through the Night and has my wake up nicely glowy. I love to use this when my Skin is irritated, it really soothes it quickly. Always have this on my Shelf, you would have to pry it out of my dead cold hands, to seperate me from it. One Bottle last me about 2 months.\n\nHG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Mary & May Blackberry Cream Essence: (4 months of use)** *Jojoba oil, ceramides, lotus water, centella*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Nymphaea Caerulea Flower Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-hexanediol, Methlypropanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Gardenia Florida Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Trilaureth-4 Phoshate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Pvm/Ma Copolymer, Cyanocobalamin, Ceramide Np, Maltodextrin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol\n\nTexture:\n\nthin, watery but creamy? (just realized i suck at describing textures haha)\n\nExpirience:\n\nA really nice hydrating and moisturizing Toner, feels like a great balance of the two. Acts nicely as a layer with other Skincare because it absorbs really well. I like it, a bottle lasts me about 2 months.\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Abib Quick Sunstick Protection Bar: ( 3 months of use)** *Aloe, Centella, Ceramides*\n\nIngredients:\n\nOctyldodecanol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Dibutyl Ethylhexanoyl Glutamide, Dibutyl Lauroyl Glutamide, Diisostearyl Malate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dextrin Palmitate, Octocrylene, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Maltodextrin, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol\n\nTexture:\n\nA translucent stick, glides on smooth, feels a bit occlusive on skin\n\nExpirience:\n\nNicely moisturizing Sunstick, feels good on my Skin and well... does its Job xD I really like the curved shape of it, it relly helps with the application. I just use it for reapplication of my sunscreen, but also sometimes when my Skin gets really dry during the day ( tho its not the best for that)\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Numbuzin No.2 Protein 43% creamy Serum: ( 4 months of use)** *Oat protein, Ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids, ferments, Rice protein*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAvena Sativa Protein Extract, Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Erythritol, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao Extract, Pantolactone, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Oryza Sativa Seed Protein Extract, Stearic Acid, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Lactobacillus Ferment, Glycine Soja Protein, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein, Glucose, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Sweet Almond Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Myristic Acid, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Arachidic Acid, Lauric Acid, Sodium Succinate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance\n\nTexture:\n\nVery thick serum, really is creamy like the name says\n\nExpirience:\n\nSooo repairing and soothing, does wonders for my barrier. It really helps keep my Skin moisturized and helps keep my transepidermal waterloss in check. Love it so much! HG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Purito Aha Bha Refreshing Solution: (1 month of use)** *Glycolic acid, Salcylic Acid*\n\nIngredients:\n\nSalix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid (7%), Tromethamine, Water, Salicylic Acid(2%), 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Citrate, Arginine, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid(0.28%), Hydroxyacetophenone, Pentylene Glycol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA\n\nTexture:\n\nlike water, it put 2-3 drops on a thin cotton pad and swipe over my Face with it\n\nExpirience:\n\nSince it has only been a month i cannot say too much about how it has worked (and i feel its hard to tell what effects on my skin is retinal and whats from this product) but my comedones are reducing in size and developing into breakouts. But the effects of these ingredients are well studied in these concentrations so i would say its save to say it works. Its my first time using glycolic acid and i can say it packs a punch for sure! So be careful, its intense, so far im using it once a week on my exfoliation day and i dont think ill be moving up.... Might also be the fact that its a combo product, but i have been using salcylic acid and mandelic acid in combo before, and that felt less sensitizing. So im attributing that factor to the 7 percent glycolic acid, since it is the smallest molecule size of all Aha\\`s.\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow lets move to quick first impressions of a few products i just started trying, wich i have seperated from the review portion because i just havent been using them long enough to really speak about the effects on my Skin: (these will also be shorter impressions with less info)\n\n\n\n**Neo:labs liquid enhancer Pycogenol:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Propanediol, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, 1.2-Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum Extract, Jojoba Esters, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Salvia Sclarea Oil, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Theobroma Cacao Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, Coprylyl Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-18 Acid Triglyceride, Squalene, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tromethamine, Albatreus Contuena Extract, Paimitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Phytasteryl Macadamiate, Citric Acid, Phytosterol, Dextrin, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, 4-Terpineol, Pentylene Glycol, Octonediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nExpirience:\n\nBougth this because of the tea tree extract, oil and 4- terpineol for the antimicrobial and antiinflammatory benefits , plus it also promised balancing the water-oil contend of the skin. So far i have been using it for a week and it feels nicely moisturizing, but i cannot say if it has helped with my breakouts. Smells strongly like tea tree, wich i dont mind.\n\n**Isntree Spotsaver Mugwort Ampoule:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nArtemisia Princeps Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Erythritol, Betaine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Panthenol, Propanediol, Beta-Glucan, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Allantoin, Carbomer, Tromethamine, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nExpirience:\n\nThis i got because i heard amazing things about mugwort and it was on a 50 % Sale, so i got it for a steal! So far i like the simple ingredient list an it seems soothing and hydrating.\n\n**RNW Der.Ceramide Cream:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Ceramide NP, Panthenol, Caprylyl Methicone, Glycerin, C12-16 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Ceramide NS, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Oligopeptide-1, Ceramide EOP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Betaine, Arginine, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Carbomer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Arachidyl Glucoside, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium EDTA\n\nExpirience:\n\nIm really intriged by this brand an was debating between this and the Ceramide serum, but got this Cream. At first i was intimitaded by the essential oils and the strong smell it has (herbal, but to my nose very pleasant) so i patchtested it on my cheek. The Patchtests went fine and i have been using it on my whole face for 4 days now and i must say im impressed.\n\nIf you have oily skin i feel you could hate it but for my dry skin... the texture is amazing. Its a THIIICK cream, like an ointment, very balmy. Upon apllication it feels nice to spread it and it sinks in so well for the thick texture. The cream surprisingly dries down velvety and leaving a protective shield over the Skin. I also love that it has 3 % Panthenol, 3% ceramides and cholesterol and fatty acids.... so perfect ingrdients for skin barrier repair! Really a potential HG...\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "I don't see this serum mentioned a lot, but it's an excellent, budget friendly option for AHA + BHA leave-on exfoliant. I've been using it for several weeks and I'm very happy with it.\n\nSize/Price: 50mL | $12 (currently on sale for $8)\n\nPackaging: Airless pump bottle. Satisfying spring-loaded pump with no clogging or stalling.\n\nTexture: Thin, syrupy fast-spreading texture. Hydrating + absorbs quickly but slightly tacky. No pilling.\n\npH: \\~3.8 (in a good range for chemical exfoliation)\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Propanediol, Glycolic Acid (5%), Salicylic Acid (2%), Sodium Hydroxide, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Hyaluronic Acid (\\~0.01%)\n\nThoughts: It's a super simple, no-frills formula that gets the job done. A hydrating base of propanediol in water is thickened by hydroxyethylcellulose for that textbook gel-like serum texture.  Hyaluronic acid is present (in its pure form!), but most likely not in significant quantities. A blend of common chelators and preservatives, as well as NaOH for pH balance. No fragrance, essential oils, or even botanical extracts of any sort, save for a radish-based preservative.\n\nCompared to popular BHA options like Paula's Choice 2% Liquid, this serum has a more hydrating texture and the added boost from glycolic acid. It's also classified as a OTC drug treatment for acne, which all but guarantees efficacy.\n\nI definitely notice smoother skin and a reduction in blackheads. Maybe not the best choice for severe acne (perhaps a routine with benzoyl peroxide or adapalene/retinoid would be better suited), but for mild/moderate acne, hyperpigmentation, textural issues, and overall skin maintenance, I find this to be a straightforward, accessible option that works.\n\n(edited: typo and formatting)",

    "body": "**Rovectin Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion**\n\nAnother Eunice favorite! I’m so sorry if this is getting too repetitive…all I can say is that the majority of my routine from the last month or so has been inspired by her. So, get ready for a few more reviews of products I selected after watching her videos.\n\nI ended up incorporating the Rovectin Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion into my routine a few days after the Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser from the same line. I didn’t think there would be any issue with them clashing in my routine…but I wanted to give the cleanser a bit of time to do its thing (and check for any bad reactions) before adding the Treatment Lotion.\n\nThis is a product that can be used as a toner, essence, or even lightweight serum/ampoule depending on how you want to work it into your routine. The consistency of this product is quite thick…so some people may find it more comfortable to use later on than others. Personally, I started using this product as a toner…but ended up swapping it with the I’m From Mugwort Essence as that product is lighter and more comfortable to put on underneath (for me).\n\nFeatured ingredients here include 7 different forms of Hyaluronic Acid, Niacimamide, Caffeine, Panthenol, Licorice Root Extract, Chamomile Flower Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, and Papaya Fruit Extract. This viscous toner/essence/whatever you want it to be (LOL) is free from alcohol, synthetic fragrance, and essential oils. \n\nRight out of the gate I knew this product would be something unique. The slightly heavy/thick consistency is really interesting…shaking the bottle to catch air bubbles in the formula is kind of fun LOL! Just from the looks of it I was reminded of the Klairs Supple Preparation Toner. And the similarities don’t stop there (we’ll get to it).\n\nApplication is what you would expect…just a few drops of this product into the palm of the hand to be patted in. Then, continue to layer as you see fit. I ended up only being able to handle two layers of this super hydrating product before my skin was totally drenched. A little really does go a long way with this product. \n\nWith the seven forms of Hyaluronic Acid I expected this product to be thoroughly hydrating and hold on to moisture really well. And, it totally lived up to that expectation. After each use my skin was left feeling deeply hydrated…but the larger forms of Hyaluronic Acid that stayed closer to the surface seemed to hold onto hydration from serums. After a layer of moisturizer on top…my skin just felt so thoroughly hydrated and plump. Not a small feat while on Tretinoin. \n\nIn addition to the heavy dose of hydration…I was honestly shocked to see a reduction of redness/irritation as well as some mild brightening from this product. The addition on Caffeine, Niacinamide, and calming extracts really did work here and wasn’t a gimmick (in my opinion). True to their roots/mission…Rovectin seems to have created a product that delivers for people suffering from intense redness, dryness, and irritation. \n\nOne of the reasons I decided to work this product into my routine when I did was because I started Curology/Tretinoin not too lang afterwards. I wanted my skin to be in as hydrated/prepped of a state as possible. I think the Rovectin Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion really helped to bring me there and keep my skin relatively happy considering all that I have been hitting it with LOL!\n\nThe only knock I have against this product is the slight sticky/tacky feeling that I noticed after application. Even though the Klairs Supple Preperation Toner only has one form of Hyaluronic Acid…the consistencies of the products are similar and I found Klairs’ offering to absorb and just feel nicer on the skin after application. It’s not a deal breaker (I found the stickiness to totally go away after applying serum/moisturizer)…but those trying to compare the two may want to take note. \n\nI love the Rovectin Skin Essentials Activating treatment Lotion. It was such a key player in keeping my skin happy and hydrated over the last month or so. I prefer the finish of the Klairs Supple Preparation Toner…but I have to pick the Rovectin Lotion as the ultimate winner for its more robust/hydration focused formula and the addition of redness reducing ingredients. I’ve tried both the original and unscented versions of the Klairs SP Toner but still find Rovectin to be a step above. \n\nJust like the Rovectin Conditioning Cleanser…I think all skin types will play well with this product. But, those who are battling frequent redness, irritation, or dryness will really be impressed with the abilities/results here. I’ll be keeping one of these on hand as I continue to use Curology…but I’m looking forward to switching to a more watery toner. I love my “7-skins method” and have missed layering and layering a nice/cooling toner.\n\nFull Ingredients List: WATER, GLYCERIN, METHYL GLUCETH-20, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, NIACINAMIDE, SORBITOL, ADENOSINE, CAFFEINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ALLANTOIN, PANTHENOL, ARGININE, HYALURONIC ACID, GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA (LICORICE) ROOT EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA (MATRICARIA) FLOWER EXTRACT, CENTELLA ASIATICA EXTRACT, GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) SPROUT EXTRACT, CARICA PAPAYA (PAPAYA) FRUIT EXTRACT, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, SODIUM PCA, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM POLYGLUTAMATE, HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYALURONATE, HYDROLYZED HYALURONIC ACID, SODIUM ACETYLATED HYALURONATE, POTASSIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, DISODIUM EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $29.00.

I have recently gathered all the info on Salicylic Acid that I have in my personal knowledge base and decided to publish it as a guidelines that can be referenced in the future.\n\nI decided to do this because question about Salicylic Acid appear from time to time in the sub and I also see some wrong information from YouTube videos when people are trying to formulate it. Hope this information would be helpful for you!\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nI AM NOT A CHEMIST!\n\nI AM NOT A DOCTOR!\n\nI DON'T HAVE ANY SKINCARE, CHEMISTRY, MEDICAL OR BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION!\n\nAll the information is gathered over the internet sources and some is referenced (+ a bit of personal DIY experience). I am open to any corrections and additions. Please leave them in comments and I'll include them in this article.\n\n# General info\n\n>**BE CAUTIOS! IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY TO ASPIRIN THEN YOU MOST LIKELY HAVE ALLERGY TO SALICYLIC ACID**\n\n**INCI:** Salicylic Acid  \n**Type:** Acid, BHA  \n**Functions:** Exfoliation, Anti-inflammatory  \n**Treats:** Acne, Blackheads, Keratosis Pilaris, Sebum production  \n**Usage rate:** 0.5 - 3.0%  \n**Usable pH range:** 3.5  \n**pKa:** 2.97  \n**Solubility:** Alcohols, Glycols, Oils, Surfactants  \n**Molar mass:** 138.121 g/mol (Daltons)\n\n# Usage rate\n\nDue to possible poisoning, based on European regulations ([SCCS - Final Opinion on Salicylic acid](https://health.ec.europa.eu/latest-updates/sccs-final-opinion-salicylic-acid-2023-06-09_en)) maximum usage rates of Salicylic Acid in skincare products are:\n\n* 3% in wash-off hair products;\n* 2% in other leave-on products, excluding the mentioned below;\n* 0.5% for body lotions, eye shadows, mascaras, eyeliners, lipsticks, oral products and non-spray deodorants.\n\n>**!DANGER!**  \nBetter to avoid formulating sprayable products due to possible inhalation. Also, special attention is required for the use of SA in eye products, as it shows potential of causing serious damage to eyes.\n\nUSA most likely has the same regulation on SA. It is also an OTC drug in USA and should be labeled in a special section of the product packaging.\n\nSouth Korea has even stricter rules for direct SA. The maximum usage rate is up to 0.5% for any product type ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2d613u/maximum_bha_in_korea_05/)). That's why Korean skincare products often use **Willow Bark Extract** and/or **Betaine Salicylate** as active ingredient instead.\n\n# Solubility\n\n# Water\n\nAlthough Salicylic Acid is a polar molecule it is poorly soluble in water (which is also a polar molecule), because the polar parts of the molecule attached to the bigger non-polar part of it, affecting the properties. ([Chemical Book](https://www.chemicalbook.com/article/the-polar-and-non-polar-characteristics-in-the-structure-of-salicylic-acid.htm)).\n\n# Depending on temperature\n\nSolubility in water depending on the temperature ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_acid)):\n\n|Water temperature (°C)|Solubility (g/L)|Solubility (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|0|1.24|0.124|\n|25|2.48|0.248|\n|40|4.14|0.414|\n|75|17.41|1.741|\n|100|77.79|7.779|\n\nWhich means if you take 100ml of water under room temperature (25 °C) you can dissolve up to 0.248g of SA in it. If you boil the water it will take up to 7.779g of SA, but precipitates when you cool the solution down.\n\n# Depending on pH\n\nSolubility increases with increasing pH, because part of SA becomes \"neutralized\" and therefore more soluble in water. Can be estimated for any given pH using the pKa of Salicylic Acid:\n\n* At a pH of 2.97 (pKa): 50% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form\n* At a pH of 4: 90% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form.\n* At a pH of 5: about 99% is in \"neutralized\" form.\n\nHere is a free acid calculator (not only for BHA) at any pH level: [LabMuffin Beauty](https://labmuffin.com/free-acid-calculator-for-exfoliants-at-specific-ph-levels/). WIth this spreadsheet you can calculate how much Salicylic Acid will be in protonated form (not neutralized, free acid) under any pH.\n\n# Betaine\n\nDue to strict regulation of SA in Korea and high popularity of Korean skincare products, new ingredient has been researched and introduced as a gentler alternative to SA called **Betaine Salicylate**.\n\nBetaine forms a hydrogen-bonded complex with Salicylic Acid rather than a salt, which increases its solubility. Formulated with it at pH 3.0-3.5, with a 2:1 molar ratio (1.7g to 1g) of Betaine to Salicylic Acid and it remains relatively soluble. Betaine mixed with Salicylic Acid at the right proportion results in a liquid ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/do-sodium-citrate-or-betaine-react-with-salicylic-acid/)).\n\n# Surfactants\n\nGreat solubility in many surfactants, especially the ones that start with \"Sodium\" (Sodium Laureth Sulfate etc). That's why formulating a face wash or shampoo with Salicylic Acid is not a big problem and won't be covered here.\n\nAccording to [\"The solubilization of salicylic acid by a series of non-ionic surfactants\"](https://academic.oup.com/jpp/article-abstract/23/Supplement_1/241S/6200573) the likely mechanism is somewhere between incorporation into the micelles and encapsulation.\n\nBased on [\"Solubilization of Salicylic Acid by Polysorbate 80 as Determined by Solubility Titration\"](https://jpharmsci.org/article/S0022-3549(15)33858-2/abstract), to completely solubilize SA in water the ratio between SA and:\n\n* **Polysorbate 80** should be 0.15\n* **Polysorbate 20** should be 0.13\n\nTherefore to solubilize 2% of SA in water required around 13.4% of Polysorbate 80 or around 15.4% of Polysorbate 20.\n\n# Ethanol (Alcohol)\n\nSalicylic Acid is highly soluble in **Ethanol**, that's why many companies use Ethanol as a main solvent or a co-solvent of the product.\n\nUnder normal conditions the solubility is 291.3 g/L or 369.2 g/kg Ethanol, which means 36.92g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Ethanol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Propylene glycol\n\n**Propylene Glycol** is often used as a solvent and penetration enhancer in skincare formulations. Solubility rate of SA in Propylene Glycol is 248.63 g/L or 257.64 g/kg Propylene Glycol, which means 25.76g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Propylene Glycol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Sodium Citrate and Sodium Lactate\n\n**Sodium Citrate** and **Sodium Lactate** are salts of weak Citric Acid and Lactic Acid respectfully. Since SA is a stronger acid, when mixed it can replace Citric or Lactic acid and gives **Sodium Salicylate**, which is highly soluble in water:\n\n>Sodium Citrate + Salicylic Acid -> Sodium Citrate + Sodium Salicylate + Citric Acid + Salicylic Acid\n\nMentioned salts are not usable as solubilization enhancers since they basically neutralize SA, but they are good buffering agents to prevent SA recrystallization in case of pH drift or temperature change.\n\nSuggested ratio of salt to SA is 1:10 ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/precipitation-and-gel-incompatibility-salicylic-acid-serum/)), meaning for 2% of Salicylic Acid include 0.2% of the buffer.\n\n# Mixed solvency approach\n\nAccording to [Hydrotropy, mixed hydrotropy, and mixed solvency as trending concept for solubilization of lipophilic drugs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128144558000050) and [\"Mixed-solvency approach\" - Boon for solubilization of poorly water-soluble drugs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44298504_Mixed-solvency_approach_-_Boon_for_solubilization_of_poorly_water-soluble_drugs), a mix of different solvents usually gives better solubility than if one pure solvent is used of the same content. This allows to decrease the content of each individual solvent in the formula leading to a more elegant product.\n\nSolubility in mixes of Water, Propylene Glycol and Ethanol was studied in [Solubility prediction of Salicylic Acid in Water-Ethanol-Propylene Glycol mixtures](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16649546/). The study defined a formula to determine how much Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in a custom mixture of this solvents and also proves mixed solvency approach.\n\nHere is a calculator spreadsheet that I made based on the study: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MqJaMGAa1Wu3BKck55dkqUWt4ACU_FPo). Fill in percentage of Ethanol and Propylene Glycol in the mixture (water will be calculated automatically) and you'll see the solubility calculated.\n\n# Substitutions\n\nThere are alternative ingredients that are readily soluble in water and can be used to avoid the hassle with Salicylic Acid itself:\n\n* **Sodium Salicylate**. Salt of Salicylic Acid. Very soluble in water. There is a publication in cosmetic journal ([Exfoliation for sensitive skin with neutralized salicylic acid](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x)) showing that Sodium Salicylate is as effective as actual Salicylic Acid in terms of exfoliation. But the methodology of studies are not disclosed and anti-acne effect is not tested. Used in [Revox Just Salicylic Acid 2% For Scalp](https://incidecoder.com/products/revox-just-salicylic-acid-2-for-scalp)  and [Keve Salicylic Acid 2% Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/keve-salicylic-acid-2-serum)\n* **WIllow Bark Extract**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Pyunkang Yul Acne Dressing Mask Pack](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-dressing-mask-pack);\n* **Betaine Salicylate**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Cos De BAHA S2 Salicylic Acid BHA 2% Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cos-de-baha-s2-salicylic-acid-bha-2-liquid);\n* **Salicylic Acid in Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine** solution. Used in [The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-salicylic-acid-2-solution)  and [Revolution 2% Salicylic Acid Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/revolution-2-salicylic-acid-serum);\n* Spray dried **Salicylic Acid with Acacia Senegal Gum**. Used in [Somethinc 2% BHA Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment](https://incidecoder.com/products/somethinc-2-bha-salicylic-acid-acne-treatment) and [Attivi Puri Salicylic Acid + Niacinamide Lotion](https://incidecoder.com/products/attivi-puri-salicylic-acid-niacinamide-lotion)\n\n# Formulation strategy\n\nBased on the data above, the strategy of formulating a stable SA serum is:\n\n1. Formulate with not more than 2% of Salicylic Acid to meet requirements for skincare products;\n2. Formulate at pH 3.5 to meet FDA requirements for skincare products. At this pH if you add 2% of Salicylic Acid only 0.46% will be in free form (and hence less solvents needed);\n3. Use several solvents (glycols, ethanol) for better solubility based on mixed solvency approach;\n4. Include some mild non-ionic surfactants (Polysorbate 20, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate etc) to form micelles and encapsulate part of the acid;\n5. Use Betaine to convert part of SA to Betaine Salicylate and adjust the pH;\n6. Add some weak acid salt (Sodium Citrate, Sodium Lactate) to prevent precipitation in case of pH drift or temperature change;\n7. Since our target is low pH, maybe Ethanol content and maybe high salt content be sure to use a tolerant gelling agent. Sepimax Zen, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethylcellulose or HMW Hyaluronic acid are good choices, while Aristoflex, Carbomer, Lecigel won't thicken the solution.\n8. Avoid natural extracts (or add at 0.01% amount for marketing claims) and ingredients that in low pH will hydrolyze over time and shift the pH level up (Niacinamide, Urea etc).\n\n# Example of a commercial product\n\n[Dermarium \"Tricky Duet 2% Salicylic Acid\" toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/dermarium-tricky-duet-2-salicylic-acid-2):\n\n>INCI: Water, **Ethanol**, *Salicylic Acid*, **Propylene Glycol**, **Betaine**, **Sodium Lactate**, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, **Polysorbate 20**, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Menthol, Methyl Lactate.\n\n* Used Ethanol and Propylene Glycol as solvents\n* Used Polysorbate 20 and PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil to boost solubility (but most likely to solubilize the extracts)\n* Used Betaine as a hydrotrope tp boost the solubility;\n* Used Sodium Lactate as a buffering salt.\n\n# Example of formulas\n\n# Very basic waterless solution\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Propylene Glycol|98%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n\nThe easiest and fastest approach is to dissolve Salicylic Acid directly in Propylene Glycol.\n\nPros:\n\n* No water - no solubility and recrystallization problems;\n* No water - no pH;\n* No water - no need for preservation;\n* Easy and fast to prepare;\n* Damn strong since whole SA content is in free acid form.\n\nCons:\n\n* Unpleasant to wear, PG has very oily texture (can be balanced with Ethanol to some degree);\n* Runny texture, hard to thicken;\n* Damn strong. Yes, it is not a typo, this can be both - advantage and disadvantage.\n\n# Basic one-solvent serum\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Optional: preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Propylene Glycol|50%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1. Mix Salicylic Acid with Propylene Glycol until it is completely dissolved;\n2. Add Sodium Hydroxide solution and water;\n3. Add the preservative of choice and stir until dissolved;\n4. Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n5. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nPreservative is optional because the formula has a lot of humectant (Propylene Glycol) that binds water and also low pH.\n\nUsed much more PG as required because no other co-solvents or buffering agents used, so higher amount is required to maintain the stability and prevent recrystallization of SA.\n\n# Basic two-solvent serum\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Ethanol|20%|\n|Propylene Glycol|20%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1.

Add the preservative of choice and stir until dissolved;\n5. Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n6. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nMix of 2 solvents allow to add less of it (40% total comparing to 50% of PG in previous formula). Also, Ethanol makes the serum less oily.\n\n# Advanced serum with surfactant and buffering agent\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Sodium Citrate|0.5%|\n|Polysorbate 80|5%|\n|Propylene Glycol|30%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1.

Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nThis formula utilizes all the formulation suggestions I gathered from different sources. It has several glycols and Ethanol as a mix of solvents, uses surfactant and Betaine plus buffer with Sodium Lactate.\n\n# Formulas from YouTube bloggers\n\nExample of good formulas:\n\n1.

[TaraLee: DIY Paulas Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant](https://youtu.be/LIubTz7QIW8) \\- too little of solvents, too high pH (because lower pH will lead to more free acid and recrystallization due to lack of solvents).\n4. [Cosmateur: DIY Salicylic Acid 2% Serum | 4 ingredients](https://youtu.be/RFBUwxkrkaU) \\- although the amount of solvents seems right, the formula is written in volumes, which means SA content is higher than 2% allowed (ethanol is lighter than water). Also, part of the ethanol evaporates during extensive mixing, so the concentration gets even higher. Moreover, the pH is not adjusted at all.\n\n# Community formulas\n\n* [Cleansing pads](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/vywxmu/super_simple_salicylic_acid_cleansing_pads/)\n* [Paula's Choice dupe](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/jav3qq/i_made_a_2_salicylic_acid_toner_loosely_based_on/)",

        "body": "A great comprehensive view! I have a few comments/corrections/additions. Feel free to disregard them :)\n\n>Under normal conditions the solubility is 291.3 g/L or 369.2 g/kg, which means 36.92g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Ethanol.\n\nI would add \"**g/kg ethanol**\", otherwise this can be confused with g/kg solution (which is the more common use of the unit). \n\n>2. Formulate at pH 3.5 to meet FDA requirements for skincare products. Under this pH if you add 2% of Salicylic Acid only 0.46% will be in free form (and hence less solvents needed)\n\nAs you decrease pH, more acid will be in the free-acid form (that is, protonated). However, above pH 3.5, you'll reduce the amount of free acid (increase the ionized form). It should be updated to read \"**Above** this pH, if you add...\".\n\n>4. Include some mild surfactants (Polysorbate 20, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate etc) to decrease surface tension and boost the solubility;\n\nI don't see that the article comments on the mechanism of solubilization. However, the likely mechanism would be somewhere between incorporation into the micelles and encapsulation. Surfactants decreasing air-water interfacial surface tension is an intrinsic property of surfactants, and doesn't really pertain to boosting solubility. It's a nit-picky suggestion, but it's just because I work with surfactants.\n\n>[Dermarium \"Tricky Duet 2% Salicylic Acid\" toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/dermarium-tricky-duet-2-salicylic-acid-2):\n\n>INCI: Water, **Ethanol**, *Salicylic Acid*, **Propylene Glycol**, **Betaine**, **Sodium Lactate**, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, **Polysorbate 20**, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Menthol, Methyl Lactate.\n\n>1.

However, triethanolamine is a pH adjuster, and will form a small amount of triethanolammonium salicylate (which does increase solubility, albeit by neutralization). \n\n  \nAll in all, a lot of great, helpful information!

    "body": "*My first review here - I apologize in advance for any mistakes...*\n\nSo I keep seeing questions on Dr. Sheth products and I use a quite a few of them in my routine.. Most of the times it has been on the Vitamin C serum and I finally decided to take the plunge and do a review here.. \n\nFirst off - I dont have before and after pictures because I just didnt think...\n\n**Skin type** \\- Combination skin with occasional hormonal acne\n\n**Product** \\- Dr. Sheth's Amla VC20 Vitamin C Serum\n\n**Price** \\- Rs. 999 for 20 ml ( I have picked up on discount both the times)\n\n**Current routine** \\- \n\n**AM** \\- Dermafique PH Restore cleanser, Minimalist PHA toner, Dr. Sheth's Vitamin C Serum, Neemli HA and Oats Amino Acid Moisturizer, Dr. Sheth's Daily Brightening Sunscreen\n\n**PM -**  Dermafique PH Restore cleanser, Dr. Sheth's Gulab and Glycolic Toner, Minimalist Tranexamic Acid, Dr. Sheth's Rosehip and Retinoid Power Emulsion (Started with alternate days and now am using it daily) Follow it up with Squalane if I find my skin to be dry\n\n**Climatic conditions** \\- Hot and Humid\n\n**Age** \\- 39\n\n**Ingredient list** \\-  Purified water, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Propanediol (penetration enhancer), Diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (penetration enhancer), Polysorbate 20 (solubilizer), Sodium Hyaluronate (humectant) , Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E) (antioxidant), Emblica Officinalis Fruit (Amla) Extract (antioxidant), Ferulic Acid (antioxidant), Hydroxyethylcellulose (co-solubilizer), Diazolidinyl Urea (co-preservative), Sodium gluconate (heavy metal chelator), Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate (co preservative) \n\n**Purchase status** \\- Loved it and I am on my second bottle. Will continue to use this\n\n**Review**: I bought this serum somewhere in Feb after my sis raved about . Ironically it didn't work for her. I was into basic CTM for my AM routine till then so decided to give it a go. And I must say that  I have not been disappointed. The serum is clear and has a bit of sticky consistency but doesn't feel like that once I have put it on my face.  It gets absorbed in the skin pretty quickly. There is a bit of fragrance to this serum as well, which I can't describe, but nothing off about it..\n\n*One note - The moisturizer that I use has Niacinamide as one of the ingredients and it seems Vitamin C and Niacinamide work well together (found this out by chance).*\n\nSince I have been using the serum for some time now, I have noticed a evening of the skin tone and the fading of pigmentation and scarring left behind by my hormonal acne.  The glow is so real.\n\nAll in all - I am going to continue with one. Always remember tho YMMV. \n\nI hope this helps people who have been looking for a good Vitamin C serum\n\nEdit: Corrected a few typos and grammar.",

Combining it with the Tranexamic Acid already used in that serum. Vichy is my favourite L'Oréal brand, but I'm not sure I would use this. I never have good look with eye products. They always create a \"reverse panda\" look. Making the skin around my eyes noticeable lighter, making me look unwell.",

I'm listing the prices converted from the retail price in Korea so you can see whether you're outrageously overpaying if you do decide to go look for any of these online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SIDMOOL**\n\nMost products from this brand seem to fragrance-free. They're quite popular in Korea, it looks like. Sensitive skin-friendly, mid-range to very affordable price, good performance/rave reviews. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mu73nuoc8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3671e9c6328bb8cab34a24366fac08d06ace645f\n\n1. **Pure Bifida 95 Ampoule - 30ml/24,600 Won ($20.94)**\n\n*Bifida Ferment Lysate, Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nBifida ferment is the \"star\" ingredient that makes up most of the famed Estee Lauder night recovery serum if you didn't know (although it matters which strain was used apparently, same with SK-II & their dupes). It's said to strengthen your skin barrier over time and provide very slight, gentle exfoliation. Reviews for this Sidmool serum I have read on the Hwahae app do confirm that many people felt their skin became \"stronger\"/less sensitive. Many also said their skin tone & texture improved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmd5qi5e8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9d487bb091642b6ee3ea1e20e2b1f4cc276b0e4\n\n2. **Skin Sauce D Panthenol Ampoule - 12ml/11,800 Won ($10.04)**\n\n*Water, Panthenol, Pantolactone, Xanthan Gum, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root (Chinese Skullcap) Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root (Tree Peony) Extract.*\n\nPanthenol is a great barrier repairing ingredient. Research shows using 5-10% is the best for skin penetration. It's said to be very healing. Note the tiny size, however. 12 ml = 0.4 oz.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kc56mwli8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5deb3f6d7af94d6cd14851695dd3a721e599c8\n\n3. **Madagascar Real Moisture Cream - 80g/23,800 Won ($20.26)**\n\n*Centella Asiatica, Glycerin, Hydrogenated lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Paeonia Suffruticosa (Tree Peony) Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis (Chinese Skullcap) Root Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ethyl Undecylenate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Erythritol, Sorbitol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic acid, Asiatic acid, Astaxanthin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Beta-Glucan, Panthenol, Vaccinium Angustifolium Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Ficus Carica Fruit Extract, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Nut Extract, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nThis lightweight gel-cream (Koreans call watery/hydrating creams \"soo boon cream\" meaning \"moisture cream\") is a crowd-pleaser, starring centella and many other soothing ingredients such as Chinese skullcap extract, allantoin, licorice root (the soothing component, not the skin-lightening), and madecassoside. It also has polyglutamic acid, beta-glucan, and hyaluronic acid as humectants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qi4q3uak8ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0af940dc986ca78892585f4a03d2fd7b23a3b96a\n\n4. **Honey Peptide Moisture Pack - 40ml/9,800 Won ($8.43)**\n\n*Honey Extract(40%), Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Hyaluronic Acid, Sorbitol, Propolis Extract,Royal Jelly Extract, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Beta-Glucan, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Caffeoyl Tripeptide-1, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Glycine Max (Soybean) Seed Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Butylene Glycol, Sucrose, Fructose, Glucose, Trehalose, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allantoin, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Glucosylrutin, Arginine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\nA lightweight, gel-textured sleeping pack. This has been #1 for sleeping packs for a while now, too. Reviewers say this is very hydrating. It's absolutely *stuffed full* of humectants: honey, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, sugars, beta-glucan, collagen, and peptides. Some soothing ingredients as well, allantoin, licorice root & extracts. Very dry skinned people said it wasn't enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfr8w5oo8ku31.jpg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfdcfdfe41ba52ad5d588187902b7d00420478a4\n\n5. **Calendula Ampoule Moisture Cream - 80ml/16,800 Won ($14.30)**\n\n*Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Glycerin, Calendula Officinalis Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Cholesterol, Glyceryl Stearate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Curcuma Longa (Tumeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Water, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Xanthan Gum, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Heptyl Undecylenate, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\nA gel-cream with skin-soothing calendula flower as the star. Other soothing, anti-inflammatory extracts make an appearance here, as well as ceramides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7f77tcs8ku31.jpg?width=280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd7d7db952d0ec115a2a39a569a337f661ac0789\n\n6. **Idebenone Firming Ampoule - 32ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Rosa Canina (Dog-Rose) Fruit Extract, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydroxydecyl Ubiquinone, Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Adenosine, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Human Oligopeptide-1, rh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Acetly Hexapeptide-8, Copper Tripeptide-1, Ethyhexylglycerin.*\n\nIdebenone is the synthetic version of the powerful antioxidant, CoQ10/ubiquinone. CoQ10 molecules are really big though, so it has trouble penetrating. Idebenone has smaller molecules so it can do the job better. I heard that the patent on idebenone ended recently, so maybe we can see more of this goodie in future products. There are also peptides in this ampoule, as well as some soothing & firming ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdnxp8cu8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72616b051ce0532bd51287099a4e28de9871ec0f\n\n7. **Green Tea Peeling Gel - 120ml/4,800 Won ($4.09)**\n\n*Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water(10%), Glycerin, Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Betaine,Beta-Glucan, Arginine, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Allantoin, Sodium Polyglutamate, Carbomer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Hydroxide, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil.*\n\nThis is wildly popular, being so affordable. It's a nice, basic peeling gel. Fragranced with lavender essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cvgwgvv8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b79356fcf60cdd09f5435cd76817e90c5f036c1\n\n8. **Jojoba Lip Essence \\[Original Moisture\\] - 13ml/3,800 Won ($3.23)**\n\n*Polyisobutene, Petrolatum, Diisostearyl Malate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Microcrystalline Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Royal Jelly Extract, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Tocopheryl Acetate*\n\nThis lil' lip balm has been #1 on the Hwahae app for a while now. Which surprises me, personally, as the Korean skincare community is going through a major \"EWG is best source/natural is better\" moment right now. But hey, I guess if it works, it works. Fragranced with orange essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz9arxe39ku31.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff34a25e8bccfe68e01a8ccc85e304df7b1b0826\n\n9. **Saccharo Ferment Therapy Essence - 60ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Saccharomyces/Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Allantoin, Human Oligopeptide-1, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Water.*\n\nI think some of Missha fermented products use Saccharomyces. Whenever you see a ferment ingredient/whatever extract, that means that plant has been fermented to make the nutrients in it more bioavailable for us. Supposedly the fermentation process releases lots more goodies than just using the extract alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/myfq67u59ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecfc805f707759f790b86d6dd65460379b6c9674\n\n10. **Saccharo Ferment Sparkle First Ampoule - 100ml/49,000 Won ($41.70)**\n\n*Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Polyglutamic Acid, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract.*\n\nGalactomyces = SK-II, Bifida = Estee Lauder, though which strains are trade secret or something. A very simple ampoule with ferments, a humectant and some plant extracts. They do have a cream version as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0w9k8ta9ku31.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41a8cd57bde651c10bf016cd3d6cea4a2799e937\n\n11. **Saccharo Essential Mist - 60ml/18,000 Won ($15.32)**\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Beta-Glucan, Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin, Paeonia Suffructicosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6471tkd9ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5903dcfdcc876d4365879230722e61b4da4c2130\n\n12. **Honey Peptide Mist - 60ml/8,600 Won ($7.32)**\n\n*Honey Extract, Water, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Stem Extract, Glycerin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sorbitol, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Beta-Glucan, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Caffeoyl Tripeptide-1, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Butylene Glycol, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allantoin, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.*\n\nA watery, soothing mist with honey, propolis, royal jelly, collagen and peptides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfoo0nzf9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b834384913e4a2a6161fb10bfeed8aeeee4e647\n\n13. **The Calming Essence - 50ml/18,600 Won ($15.83)**\n\nArtemisia Capillaris (Mugwort - Capillary Wormwood) Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Arginine, Cabomer, Pantolactone, Xanthan Gum, 1,2-Hexanediol.\n\nA very simple, soothing mugwort, panthenol, allantoin, and licorice root essence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0fj8zdi9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=915ee84ef3cb6c1dec999de951abe84a8b268783\n\n14. **Dr. Troub Bio Repair Powder Cleanser - 60g/15,600 Won ($13.27)**\n\n*Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Disodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Sobitol, Cellulose Gum, Scutellaria Bicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Artemisia Princeps (Mugwort - Korean Mugwort/Korean Wormwood) Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Citrus Junos Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Human Oligopeptide-1, Acetyl hexapeptide-8, Copper Tripeptide-1, Citric Acid, Arbutin, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower/Leaf Extract, Allantoin.*\n\n\\[Second cleanser\\] An SLS-free powder foaming wash. The surfactants in this (Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate & Disodium Lauroyl glutamate) are extremely gentle surfactants often used for cleansers targeted toward babies and sensitive skin. They're more expensive but provide a bunch of non-stripping foam. We see a lot more of these sort of surfactants in recent years because of the bad rep Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate have gotten, which are used widely because of their cheap cost (whether they are gentle or not depends on the formula and what other surfactants they have been mixed with).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8jz1gqk9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1943c1bb896d85a41596a26febcc48e6a47a684\n\n15. **Dr. Troub Skin Returning Cleansing Milk - 200ml/13,600 Won ($11.57)**\n\n*Water, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Decyl Glucoside, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Diheptyl Succinate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Milk Protein Extract, Allantoin, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n\\[First Cleanser\\] This is a popular cleansing milk that you use like you use an oil cleanser (rub into dry face with dry hands). to remove sunscreen and makeup. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1w3vw2xp9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b0abeef20e0d4ee0787e6101c376d2e70fbb4c3\n\n16. **Galatokside Real Peptide Barrier Moisture Soo Boon Cream - 50ml/29,800 won ($25.36)**\n\n*Copper Tripeptide-1, Glactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Paeonia Suffructicosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Betaine, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Sucrose, Fructose, Glucose, Polyglutamic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium PCA, Beta-Glucan, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Tocopherol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Adenosine, Arginine, 1,2-Hexanediol.* \n\nA nice, soothing cream with tons of humectants/peptides, and centella components. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3ur5mms9ku31.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=480295636783722d34de21a551c16f1fd5a2c4d5\n\n17. **Madagascar Centella Skin - 150ml/14,800 Won ($12.59)**\n\n*Centella Asiatica Extract(97%), Butylene Glycol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol.* \n\nRemember that toners are referred to as \"Skin\" in Korea (Japan = lotion). A simple, calming toner all about centella and soothing licorice and other plant extracts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jittu4x9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c068d9ca9b0ad1830d93a384cfafef950eeebe0c\n\n18. **Eggplant Ampoule - 50ml/22,800 Won ($19.40)**\n\n*Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract**,* *Water**,* *Butylene Glycol**,* *1,2-Hexanediol**,* *Fructose**,* *Sorbitol**,* *Maltitol**,* *Hyaluronic Acid**,* *Sodium Pca**,* *Lupeol**,* *Sodium Hyaluronate**,* *Hydroxyethylcellulose**,* *Sodium Chloride* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6p1j3qf0aku31.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ece7d4d75dea064bfd4febe2f0f610148e9569c\n\n19. **Ferment Care Thermal Mineral Water - 125ml/14,800 Won ($12.60)**\n\n*Onsen-sui, Morus Alba (White Mulberry) Bark Extract, Lactobacillus/Honeysuckle Flower Extract, Cimicifunga Dahurica (Black Cohosh) Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum (Chinese Rhubarb) Root/Stalk Extract, Platycodon Grandiflorus (Balloon Flower) Root Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Extract, Sophora Flavescens (Ku Shen) Root Extract, Rubia Cordifolia (Manjistha) Root Extract, Coptis Japonica (Japanese Gold Thread) Extract, Lithospermum Officinale (European Stoneseed) Extract, Taraxacum Platycarpum (Korean Dandelion) Extract, Pueraria Thunbergiana (Kudzu) Root Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum (Korean Pepper) Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana (Korean Pasque Flower) Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract.*\n\nI like thermal water, idk. I thought there would be more ferments in this, given the name, but I guess not. Thermal water does have a light soothing effect/deposit minerals onto your skin. I thought it was just boring water in a can too, but Labmuffin has a post on it; It's interesting. Korean Pasque Flower is called \"Hal-mi-Kkhot\" meaning \"granny flower\", lol. Because the flower part droops down towards the ground, like how grandmas walk stooped down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqs0h5n2aku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b15d061d15804a54905cf44c73c01d3c8e78da3\n\n20. **Mega Peptide Eco Hydro Soothing Cream - 60ml/28,400 Won ($24.18)**\n\n*Bambusa Vulgaris (Bamboo) Water, Copper Tripeptide-1, Glycerin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic.Capric Triglyceride, Pentapeptide-20, Nicotinoyl Tripeptide-1, sh-Octapeptide-4, sh-Decapeptide-7, sh-Oligopeptide-9, sh-Pentapeptide-19, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Panthenol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Diopyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorce) Root Extract, Punica Granatum (Pomegranate) Seed Oil, Propolis Extract, Chamomilla Recutica (Matricaria) Flower/Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Olibanum, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol (Vitamin E).* \n\nSidmool sure loves peptides! This one seems just loaded. Lots of soothing/calming stuff in here as well. Unfortunately, it is fragranced with lavender essential oil, if you are sensitive to that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSidmool has loads of other things but my fingers are tired ok.",

It absorbs well and I can layer it when needed.\n\nIt has a lot of skin brightening ingredients in it, but I think they’re probably in very low concentrations so it’s not like it’ll have an amazing effect immediately.

One of the sunscreens that I was most excited for that did get along with my skin was the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented. It left my skin with a rash and ever since I have been reluctant to try other chemical sunscreens (even though I'm not really sure why my skin had an allergic reaction: I have used centella/niacinamide products before and never had experience such a thing). Nonetheless, I have decided to try mineral sunscreens and one of them was the Cotz Sensitive SPF 40. Although it left my skin \"greasy\" (I didn't really mind it since I have dry skin), it gave my skin a very tight and dry feeling :(.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThe ATO Mild Sun Cream is a mineral sunscreen with the most runny lightweight texture. Despite it being lightweight oh my it is so pleasant to put on! It does not leave my skin tight and dry and best of all it is fragrance and essential oil free!! It is very easy to blend and it leaves a very minimal white cast in the beginning but it quickly disappears. I believe there was a video with Juan putting on the sunscreen on Ohlolly's instagram page. Overall, I really love this sunscreen :)\n\nEdit: SPF rating: 45 PA+++\n\n**Star Rating 5/5**\n\n​ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n**Ingredient List**\n\nWater, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Methylpropanediol, Cyclomethicone, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Aluminum Stearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Caprylic/Capric/Succinic Triglyceride, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Silica, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Alumina, Cetyl Hydroxyethylcellulose, Cellulose Gum, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tromethamine, t-Butyl Alcohol, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Butylene Glycol, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phosphatidylcholine, Ceramide NP, Glycine, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Alanine, Threonine, Proline, Arginine",

I wish the version with antioxidants contained N-Acetyl Glucosamine too....Now I don't know which one to order.\n\nWhich one would you choose?\n\n\n\nEDIT: I checked the delivery costs and they are $15 for Europe.... In that case The Ordinary still wins. But they have free domestic shipping above $10 for the US.",

I would def go with the first serum.\n\nPros of Serum #1: Assuming you're seeking the \"traditional\" benefits of Niacinamide use (improved uneven texture/tone, hyperpigmentation, excess sebum production, enlarged pores/acne damage), this one will do it much better. Combining Niacinamide with NA-G greatly potentiates the effects of one another- powerhouse combo. Looking at some of the other actives in the formula (Panthenol for anti-acne skin conditioning, licorice root for redness, Willow bark for anti-microbial/inflammation, Cocoyl Honeyate for sebum suppression) it sounds like this is a clear winner.\n\nSerum #2: Contains MSM which is a skin penetration enhancing agent. Normally good, but considering Niacinamide's ease of penetration and the fact that MSM is a \"cheaper\" less potent skin PE (compared to like Dimethyl Iso. etc) there's no real benefit IMO. Especially since both formulas contain Butylene Glycol (solvent/penetration enhancing agent). Aside from Ferulic Acid (which is basically irrelevant w/o any L-Asc. Acid or Tocopherol) I don't see any antioxidant advantage to this serum. FA is normally used as a UV/light stabilizer for more volatile antioxidants, which this serum contains none of.\n\nBoth look great, but Serum 1 clear winner in my books.",

The team at GN announced their next soap, a collaboration with the fragrance house Zaharoff ([https://www.zaharoff.com/](https://www.zaharoff.com/)). This limited edition offering will be available on ***June 15, 2020 at 8:00AM CT***.  Their current offerings feature shaving soap, pre shave, post shave and beard care. The company’s name signifies the respect among gentlemen and their desire for personal care and quality. Each of their current scent offerings is named for a famous gentleman throughout human history. Gentleman’s Nod products can be sourced direct from their website or at West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)) and Maggard Razors ([https://www.maggardrazors.com/](https://www.maggardrazors.com/)).\n\nZaharoff Signature is a warm and spicy scent. The fragrance consists of: Fresh Cardamom, Lavender,Black Pepper, Juicy Pear, Blue Cypress, Ginger Roots, Blonde Cedar, Temple Oud, Florentine Iris, Pimento Leaves, Fir Balsam, Creamy Sandalwood, Gold Patchouli, Black Amber, Myrrh, Frankincense. As with many well blended fragrances, individual notes are not apparent but the fragrance offers more of a vibe. In this case, the warm, spicy vibe is mascualine and confident. Mrs. Ruds adores this scent for any occasion, including the rare date night wear. Strength of scent is strong off the container and remains strong when lathered. \n\nZaharoff Signature is offered in Gentleman’s Nods Cardinal base. This version is slightly tweaked and improves upon an already wonderful post shave.  Ingredients listed in the formula are: Stearic Acid, Glycerin, Aqua (Water), Butyrospermum parkii (Shea Butter), Tallow (Beef), Ricinus communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Theobroma grandiflorum (Cupuacu) Butter, Fragrance, Lanolin, Sucrose Cocoate, Methyl Gluceth 10, dl-Panthenol, Lauryl Laurate, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Capric/Caprylic Triglyceride, Persea gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Sodium Lactate, Raw Honey, Goat's Milk, Albumen, Buttermilk, Coconut Milk, Sodium Citrate, Orbignya Oleifera (Babassu) Seed Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin, Silk Amino Acids, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Bentonite Clay, Sodium Phytate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe) Juice (and) Maltodextrin, Hydroxyethylcellulose. The soap is of mid firmness and loads easily into your desired brush type. The Cardinal base is thirsty and when properly worked will resemble sour cream in terms of lather consistency. Primary and residual slickness of this soap are elite. Much like their other soap bases, post shave is the real star and is among the elite in a crowded soap market. The face feel and protection this lather leaves behind is amazing. Given my experience with the base and the incremental post improvement, Gentleman's Nod Cardinal base receives a ShaveScore of 100. For a similar performance experience I suggest Highland Springs Soap Co.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Zaharoff Signature Collection by Gentleman’s Nod (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Dogwood Handcrafts “Darkness” (purchased)\n* Razor - Razorock Lupo SS (purchased)\n* Post - Zaharoff Signature Collection by Gentleman’s Nod (promotional gift)",

They use a different form of [EGCG](http://www.induchem.com/products/actives/daily-protection/inoveol-egcg/), added Gallyl Glucoside (antioxidant I believe) and use Oxidized Glutathione (as far as I know there's only one study that showed Oxidized Glutathione provided skin lighting benefits [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207440/), but other effects are unclear [link](http://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/beauty/glutathione-may-whiten-skin-topically), isn't it an oxidant?). Took out Vitamin E (Tocophersolan). And added some plant extracts, [link](http://www.rahn-group.com/en/cosmetics/product/27/). Personally I don't like those supplier research documents, not every plant extract really works, and only well published research is relevant in my opinion. I like the fact they replaced Chlorphenesin with Caprylyl Glycol.",

Well known for a wide variety of fragrances, grooming and bath needs, their shaving soap, crema da barba, is highly acclaimed amongst traditional wet shaving enthusiasts. Santa Maria Novella Crema da Barba can be purchased from a lengthy list of stockists, both online and brick and mortar, across the entire world.\n\nSanta Maria Novella Crema da Barba features scents of: menthol, eucalyptus and Tabacco toscano cologne. This blend is invigorating and refreshing. The menthol is just a kiss and not overpowering. It is beautifully complemented by the eucalyptus before the Tabacco toscano cologne ends the scent with a masculine backbone. Mrs. Ruds is neutral about this scent, which is light to mid out of the container and remains this way once lathered. Try That Soap ([https://trythatsoap.com/](https://trythatsoap.com/)) recommends RazoRock Santa Maria del Fiore for a similar scent profile.\n\nSanta Maria Novella Crema da Barba is considered a firm cream and features the following ingredients: Aqua, Stearic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Parfum, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butlyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Camphor, Menthol, Allantoin. I rate this as mid firm and the soap base is an easy loader. It is not a very thirsty soap and when dialed in, the consistency of the lather will resemble whipped cream. Slickness in terms of both primary and residual slickness are very good. There are many soaps that are noticeably slicker than this offering. Post shave is good, but a proper post shave routine will be a must when using this soap. Overall this soap doesn’t knock my socks off but provides enough for a serviceable shave. As such the Crema da Barba receives a ShaveScore of 84. For similar lather performance I suggest Kepkinh or Wild West Shaving Co.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Santa Maria Novella Crema da Barba (gift)\n* Brush - Simpsons Chubby 2 “Super Badger” (gift)\n* Razor - Dovo “Bismarck” (gift)\n* Post - The Club Signature (purchased)",

SMN Crema da Barba is my Austere August soap choice and I’ve come to appreciate it more and more throughout this month. \n\nOverall I think the soap impressed me more than I thought when I started AA, but it still isn’t great. A mid 80’s shave score seems about right. Where I find it’s greatest flaw is in its post-shave. It feels drying.\n\nAs for the scent, I find it inoffensive, but that’s about it. I find when I first purchased it the eucalyptus was way overpowering, and I actually didn’t like it much because of that. In the two years since I purchased it the eucalyptus has faded quite a bit, which allows the tobacco toscano to come through more, which is nice.",

    "body": "• There aren’t that many reviews of products by Bonajour online so I decided to make a review post. All of the products were purchased from Amazon through the official Bonajour seller. \n\n(Obviously not sponsored)\n\n1.) Coconut Oil Body Moisturizer (300 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Olivate, Pinus Densiflora Extract, Saussurea Involucrata Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Olivoyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Glyceryl Oleate, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Arginine, Carbomer, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n- Review: I’ve repurchased this body lotion multiple times already. The scent is so heavenly and it feels so good on my body. This moisturizer is lightweight but moisturizing. 5/5\n\n2.) Sensitive Skin Body Wash (500 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Disodium cocoamphodiacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Propanediol, Sodium cocoyl glutamate, Sodium chloride, Glycerin, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aniba Rosodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Octyldodecanol, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene glycol\n\n- Review: I love this body wash, I’ve purchased it 2 times and it lasts for a while too (even with daily use). It has a relaxing smell and it lathers well. I put this body wash on a Salux washcloth and the body wash doesn’t dry out my skin. 5/5\n\n3.) Mugwort Cream Calming Mask (1.9 fl. oz)\n\n- Ingredients: Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract(32.20%), Water, Kaolin, Butylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Bentonite, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery)Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Brassica Rapa (Turnip) Leaf Extract, Solanum Lycopersicum (Tomato) Fruit/Leaf/Stem Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Brassica OleraceaItalica (Broccoli) Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Enantia Chlorantha (Bark) Extract, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pusatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Citrusparadisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Octyldodecanol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Seed Oil, Oleanolic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (4,000ppm), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Tocopherol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil(500ppm), Sod\n\n- Review: I’m still going through my first purchase of this and it’s grown on me. Although I prefer the I’m From Mugwort Mask, this mask is skin calming too. I use mask this during my menstruation cycle (where my skin is more prone to having skin inflammation) and it felt very nice. I also like how the date when opened can be written on the product + it’s a cheaper mugwort product. 4/5\n\n4.) Propolis Serum (100 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Propolis Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Ulmus Campestris (Elm) Bark Extract, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Gleditsia Australis Thorn Extract, Angelica Dahurica Root Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Bletilla Striata Root Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Extract, Trichosanthes Kirilowii Root Extract, Broussonetia Kazinoki Root Extract, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Extract, Amomum Xanthioides Seed Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Sodium Carbomer, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Epigallocatechin Gallate\n\n- Review: I have mixed thoughts about this product. The price is really good especially for the size (100 ML). I would recommend this serum for oily skin types. This is more of a skin calming serum rather than a hydrating one. It did calm my face but did little for my acne. This product is also unscented. I didn’t repurchase the serum. 3/5 \n\n5.) Seaweed Lotion (150 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycerin, Panthenol, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: I also have mixed thoughts about this lotion. This product is unscented and the smell of the moisturizer doesn’t bother me. This is a very basic moisturizer. Sometimes this would make my face feel itchy but my face was dehydrated at the time I was using this. I wouldn’t repurchase it and am now using it as a hand lotion (which works). 3/5\n\n6.) Seaweed Skin Toner (150 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polyglutamic Acid, Panthenol, Allantoin, Betaine, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: This is a great toner but after I started using the Matsuyama Hadauru Moisturizing Infusion Balancing Lotion, I used this one less. I haven’t repurchased it. I also used it before applying lotion on my body (which feels nice and cooling). This is a lightweight toner that can easily be layered. This product is also unscented. 4/5",

    "body": "I've noticed my favorite hair gels have hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) but I was reluctant to try working with it as I've always heard xanthan gum is so much easier. But as I've gotten more comfortably DIY-ing I decided to try it and while it had a bit of a learning curve, I've figured out how to make a gel out of it. I like HEC because its non-ionic and if I put it over a leave in with BTMS , it won't react and ball up.\n\nYou'll need\n\n* Gram scale (I have a small gram scale and a regular cooking scale and use both)\n* Cooking Thermometer\n* Something to mix in. I use a 1000ml mixing cup with a pouring spout\n* Something to boil water in. I use a glass beaker and boil in the microwave\n* A good mixer. I'm using a Cuisinart stick blender\n* A bottle to store your gel in\n\nRecipe\n\n* Water to 100&#37;\n* 1&#37; HEC (this makes a pretty thick gel. If you want something more runny, use half or .75&#37;)\n* .5&#37; Xanthan Gum (this is your holding ingredient, HEC doesn't provide much hold, If you want more clumping for your curls, keep the HEC the same but reduce the Xanthan to .25&#37;)\n* 8&#37; Glycerin (you can use less but I would use less than 5&#37;, maybe 3&#37;, it keeps the gel from flaking)\n* 2&#37; Propylene Glycol (this is optional but I find that my hair likes the combo of humectants instead of just the glycerin)\n* 1&#37; Panthenol (this is optional too, but its really good for your hair)\n* .1&#37; Disodium EDTA\n* .2&#37; Citric Acid (enough to get the pH between 4-4.5)\n* 1&#37; Germaben II (if anyone thinks I could be using a better preservative, let me know)\n\n1. Measure out your HEC, EDTA and citric acid. Set aside.\n2. Measure out your water and then boil it. I boil mine in a glass beaker in the microwave.\n3. Pour your boiling water in your mixing container with your HEC, EDTA and citric acid and start mixing on low for 30 seconds. Then mix it on high for 60 seconds. Let it sit about 5-20 min and then mix again. It should be getting thick. I originally tried mixing this in room temp water and it got grainy and just did not work.\n4. Measure out and add in the xanthan gum, the glycerin, the propylene glycol, and the panthenol. Mix again.\n5. When the mixture is cooled to less than 50C or 120F, you can add the Germaben.\n6. Bottle and Enjoy. I find this gives me soft but defined curls that are clumpier than when I use a gel that only has xanthan gum as a thickener.",

I recently just purchased the no7 Protect and Perfect facial suncream in SPF50, 5 star UVA from Boots http://www.boots.com/en/No7-Protect-Perfect-Intense-Facial-Sun-Protection-SPF-50-50ml_1483958/\n\nI've been using it for just over a week, and my skin is looking amazing. It is clearing up my redness/uneven skintone and PIH - my skin looks almost as clear as when I was 13, before I started tanning heavily in the summer (I'm 22). Previously I was using the no7 protect and perfect daycreams, because they had spf15 in and 5 star UVA protection. In comparison to this suncream though, they barely did anything to noticeably improve my skin. \n\nAs far as application goes, I find it moisturising but not too greasy (haven't had any trouble with it breaking me out). I've been having trouble finding a good facial sunscreen so pretty pleased I gave this one a go :)\n\n\n\nIngedients:\nAqua (Water), C12-15 alkyl benzoate, Octocrylene, Butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene glycol, Methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol (nano), Polyglyceryl-3 methylglucose distearate, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, Tribehenin, Cetearyl alcohol, Glycerin, Diethylhexyl butamido triazone, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium cetyl phosphate, Decyl glucoside, Parfum (Fragrance), Mica, Acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, Methylparaben, Xanthan gum, Tocopheryl acetate, Ethylhexyl salicylate, Actinidia chinensis (Kiwi) fruit water, Propylene glycol, Sodium hyaluronate, Ethylparaben, Ascorbyl glucoside, Hydrolyzed rice protein, Potassium hydroxide, Alcohol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Retinyl palmitate, Medicago sativa (Alfalfa) extract, Sorbitan laurate, Panax ginseng root extract, Carbomer, Dipropylene glycol, Polysorbate 20, Morus alba leaf extract, Sophora angustifolia root extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium benzoate, Ascorbic acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methyl benzoate, Tocopherol, Acetyldipeptide-1 cetyl ester, Palmitoyl tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7, CI 77891 (Titanium dioxide).",

    "body": "Skin type: dehydrated, eczema-prone, acne-prone\n\nLocation: Toronto, Canada (i.e. I can't access some USA-only type moisturizers)\n\nHi everyone!\n\nSo I've started my journey in Jan 2019 attempting to find the best moisturizer w/ HA (along with a HG sunscreen), and have used the following products:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*NOTE: YMMV - this obviously details my own personal experiences w/ the products below :)*\n\n**1) Cetaphil - Daily Hydrating Lotion w/ Hyaluronic Acid**\n\nIngredients: Water, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Homarine HCI, Sodium PCA, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Erythritol\n\nThis is the best moisturizer I've used; the -1 in the rating is that I use it up too fast! I use three pumps (2 on the face, 1 on the neck) AM and PM. As its consistency is more lotion and watery-like than that of a heavy cream, the bottle is tiny at 88 mL and runs out quickly. I've used up 2 bottles of this in 4-5 months or so (so a bottle per 2 months, and its pricey at that too!). It doesn't break me out, applies like silk and actually gives me lasting moisture. I think it's more because of its hydroxy urea moreso than the HA, tbh, because my Hada Labo premium outperforms TO's HA serum also; and it contains the same urea ingredient. BUT due to the price, I'm not sure if I will buy again... in the event no other moisturizers in the future work as well though then I will resort to this lol\n\nRating: 9/10 (-1 Price)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) The Ordinary - Natural Moisturizing Factors w/ Hyaluronic Acid**\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Glycine, Alanine, Serine, Valine, Isoleucine, Proline, Threonine, Histidine, Phenylalanine, Glucose, Maltose, Fructose, Trehalose, Sodium PCA, PCA, Sodium Lactate, Urea, Allantoin, Linoleic Acid, Oleic Acid, Phytosteryl Canola Glycerides, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Lecithin, Triolein, Tocopherol, Carbomer, Isoceteth-20, Polysorbate 60, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Pentylene Glycol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.\n\nI really wanted to love this, I really do, because I've been attempting to put out an all-DECIEM based routine to save up on my budget and support a Canadian company at the same time. But this moisturizer, given its universal praise isn't cutting it! Lack of silicones in it usually end up with me contracting eczema at the end of the day. Also, heads up - I can't tolerate oils at all because I'm prone to sebborhea, eczema AND acne (I can only use jojoba oil and squalane) - so I really feel the oiliness of this product, despite being oil-free. I think it's because of the oleic and linoleic acids in the product which is basically what oils are comprised of.  To add, it feels tacky on my skin, and the packaging format isn't too nice as i have to squeeze hard for the product to come out. The price is great though, so I didn't waste my money on it. I don't think it breaks me out particularly so I'll still try to use up the entire 100mL of it :p\n\nRating: 7/10 (-1 tacky feeling, -1 oily feeling, -1 no silicones)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) CeraVe AM Lotion w/ SPF30**\n\nMed. Ingredients: Homosalate 10.00%, Menthyl Anthranilate (Meradimate) 5.00%, Octinoxate (Ethylhexyl, Methoxycinnamate) 5.00%, Octocrylene 2.00%, Zinc Oxide 6.3%.Other Ingredients: Water, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Ceramide AP , Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Methylparaben, Niacinamide, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Xanthan Gum\n\nOkay this sucks big time. It clogged ALL my pores, literally and I had to take a week course doxycycline to clear it up a bit. It also left my face a greasy mess. But it does moisturize well so I'm planning on using it up on my neck and hands, lol 😂 Also, there was a very informed post of ceramides in CeraVe not really doing anything so there's that too. Will definitely NOT be buying again.\n\nRating: 4/10 (-5 100% pore-clogging, -1 greasy face)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4) CeraVe PM Lotion**\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\nThis one sucks too, but it doesn't clog my pores as much as the AM variant. I've been using this on and off because I just hate the greasy feeling it leaves my skin, and I'm not really sure if its the main culprit clogging my pores yet (I just started using it last month on and off). I also kind of itch a bit after using it. It's definitely not a silky smooth application feeling as I had when I used the Cetaphil moisturizer. Will not be buying again.\n\nRating: 6/10 (-3 may be pore clogging , -1 greasy face)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in short, I still did not find my HG Moisturizer, unfortunately. I'll be looking into the following products now:\n\n**5) Eucerin Replenishing Face Cream w/ 5% Urea** \\- Due to my success with products containing the hydroxy derivative, and its wonderful reviews I'm dying to try this. I just ordered a tube off of [well.ca](https://well.ca), and hope it works out. I'll be using this after I use up the CeraVe PM or discontinue it lol. I have very high expectations of this, and hope this will end my quest to find my perfect moisturizer  😭\n\n**6) CeraVe SPF 30 Ultra Light Moisturizer** \\- Despite my bad track record with CeraVe, I've heard great things about this version of their sunscreen+moisturizer hybrid, and I still am looking for my HG sunscreen.\n\n**7) Hada Labo Perfect Gel** \\- This thing has squalane, hydroxy urea AND HA. Seems too good to be true, but the Premium Lotion already is a HG for my skin. The problem is, it's an Asian product so I need to buy in bulk online for that free shipping or risk getting a counterfeit product off of Amazon (and I don't like buying off of Amazon due to its treatment of its workers anyways).\n\n**8) Neutrogena Extra Dry Hydro Boost Moisturizer** \\- I'm not sure about this one because HA is the 4th last ingredient, and is listed well after the phenoxyethanol (which is 1% I believe) meaning that the HA % of this is less than 1%. Butttt enough ppl are raving about it for me to notice it  😅 so I'll give this a shot if the other ones don't end up being my HG.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that's that! If anyone has any experiences regarding the products above (especially the ones I want to try in the future) please let me know :)!",

    "body": "Hey guys, so a couple days ago someone on one of the daily help threads asked for a comparison review of the Bonvivant Botanical Mellow Clay Mask and the Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Mask. And since I have both, I said I'd do a comparison! This is my first review so I'm glad to be helping people :) so let's get started!\n\nNOTE: I caught a head cold when I went home for my Thanksgiving break, so please keep that in mind! I'll specify where things were affected as a result of my head cold. (Don't worry, I'm doing better now and was already on the mend by the time I got back to campus to be able to test these!)\n\nBonvivant Botanical Mellow Clay Mask in Hawaiian Pink Calamine\n- Scent: It has a very faint herbal scent. I could smell it when it first arrived, before I got sick, but when I opened it up again to actually use it, I couldn't smell it any more because my nose had gotten so plugged up...\n- Color: It was a very cute pastel pink!\n- Texture: It's kinda like jello! I pushed on it and it pushed back like a soft rubber; it was kinda fun to play with! Normally I hate having long nails when I put on clay or gel masks (I'll admit I'm too lazy to trim them if they still look good), but having longer nails was actually useful this time to get past the bouncy top and scoop it out of the jar. It was also useful when breaking apart the chunks to smooth it onto my face.\n- Time: 10 minutes\n- First impression: It slightly stung on my nose, but my nose was very dry and raw from having to blow it so much (darn you, head cold!). After about 30 seconds, though, the stinging went away and I could enjoy the cooling sensation all over my face.\n- In progress thoughts: You definitely want to do more than a thin layer. Mine was thin because I got less than I thought I did once I broke the chunks apart and smoothed it out, and it dried faster than I thought it would have. I could see it sinking into my pores though.\n- Final thoughts: It's easy to wash off, but I recommend using a sponge to get it off easier than using just your hands like I did. My skin felt very soft afterwards, and even after just one use the raw and dry skin on my nose seemed nice and calm! Definitely still red, but not as extreme as before. Granted this was just one use, but I think it did what it was advertised to do!\n- Ingredients (cosdna.com): Water, Kaolin, Glycerin, PEG/PPG-17/6, Copolymer, Calamine, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Betulla Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Papain, Maltodextrin, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Castanea Crenata (Chestnut) Shell Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Volcanic Ash, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Cellulose Gum, Hydroxyacetophenone, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Betaine, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nInnisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Clay Mask\n- Scent: It was like natural clay (different from art clay). It was very very faint, and while I'm basically done with my head cold, I would not have noticed it if I hadn't just taken a hot shower that cleared my sinuses.\n- Color: It was kind of a brownish gray.\n- Texture: It's like any normal clay mask.\n- Time: 15 minutes\n- First impression: It was very easy to spread on and get a nice even layer. (It was a bit annoying to try to clean out from under my nails, though.) There wasn't really much of a feel to it aside from a somewhat subdued cooling sensation along my cheekbones.\n- In progress thoughts: There really isn't too much of a cooling effect. There was somewhat more in other areas (my forehead and cheeks) than when I first put it on, but not much. I didn't see much sinking into my pores, but I also got a more generous layer with this than I did with the Bonvivant mask.\n- Final thoughts: There still wasn't much visible pulling out stuff from my pores, but I guess that means that the blackheads I thought I had are either large pores or they're closed over (yikes!). It was easy to wash off, but again, a sponge would be easier than your hands (also use warm water, it likes to cling with cool water). Not much of a softening effect immediately (I noticed my skin felt softer maybe 10 minutes later, before I started the rest of my routine for the night), but some of the healing acne that's been popping up due to the stress of finals look less red. It's probably better for those who have more blackheads or sebaceous filaments than I do.\n- Ingredients: Water, Butylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Trehalose, Volcanic Ash, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Bentonite, Zinc Oxide, Polysorbate 60, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Citrus Unshiu Peel Extract, Opuntia Coccinellifera Fruit Extract, Orchid, Camellia Japonica, Cryptomeria Japonica Leaf Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Extract, Theobroma Cacao Seed Extract, Kaolin, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, PVP, Dextrin, PEG-100 Stearate, Sorbitan Stearate, Cellulose Gum, Xanthan Gum, Lactic Acid, Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, CI 77491\n\nThe Bonvivant mask will be more useful for me personally, but the Innisfree one was nice too. They definitely have different purposes, but I only reviewed one version of the Bonvivant mask, the one meant to calm troubled skin. They also have them in Jeju Volcanic, meant for blackhead removal like the Innisfree one, and in Mint Tea Tree, meant for removing dead skin cells. If you're looking for something to soothe your skin, I'd definitely say try the Hawaiian Pink Calamine version of the Bonvivant mask. If you want something more like the Innisfree one, I'd say give the Jeju Volcanic one a try. (I don't have the other two to try out, so sorry!) My skin problem is more keeping skin soft and healing non-blackhead acne, so for me the Hawaiian Pink Calamine mask is better. But that is just me!\n\nHopefully this helps! I kind of tried to model what other reviews I've seen here and over other parts of the Internet look like, so I hope that all the important information is there! Thanks!",

    "body": "I did bury the company name somewhat, but if you made it here, you'll find it. Everything I say here is my opinion based solely on their website content, and I've never tried their products or even heard of them before today. Part of the reason that I am so specifically critical of this brand is that they also sell an expensive oral supplement for hair, which I think is inappropriate for any cosmetics brand to do, but it is especially worrisome from a tiny one that is so loose with their claims for other products.\n\nOn the other hand, seldom does a company make it this easy to read their labels with some kind of confidence, so I thought it might be interesting to share. On the website product pages they do a couple of bullet-point type \"contains X% of Y\" that I call advertising claims for ingredients, but when compared to the full ingredients list it becomes obvious just how far they're stretching. In one case it is obvious that the claim percent is probably how much of the material as supplied they use, the rest are less clear.\n\nI want to say that despite the cleanwashing and the painfully bad sciencewashing this brand does, these may not be bad products to use, though they all range between somewhat and ridiculously overpriced. However, they are pushing the limits of language use in advertising/marketing to the flimsiest edge of reason and legality, and their \"science\" is a mish-mash of misleading puffery, long debunked fearmongering misinformation, and some other stuff I think they pulled out of thin air. Given all of the aroma chemicals in some their ingredients lists, I'd love to know how they would define \"synthetic\" in relationship to fragrance.\n\nThey have filed a patent application both World and US for stirring ingredients together at room temperature to make their products, which has got to be some troll level BS, or maybe a shady sidestep attempt to patent protect the cosmetic products ingredients lists or formulas without actually doing anything patentable. They are not Skinceuticals making a breakthrough with C E Ferulic. I mostly skimmed these because reading such patent apps is a good treatment for insomnia.\n\nWorld patent app here: https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2019165115A1/en\n\nUS here: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200375877A1/en\n\nThe US version removes claims 8-17 as compared to the World version.\n\nNo idea where the hyperbaric chamber nonsense fits into this, but I laughed very hard at what seems to be a cut & paste definition of a pressure chamber from somewhere else. The patent app doesn't mention needing a hyperbaric chamber, despite the website claims.\n\nLast thing that I can't let go of: A quick lab test is not a clinical trial. In this case it \"proves\" that the 3 main products used in sequence will clean some synthetic sebum out of standardized hair samples in a lab.\n\nOh, and they've registered a trademark for Cold Processed. Yeah. https://uspto.report/company/Act-Acre-Inc\n\nAnyway. Enough of my judgemental rambling. On to the real reason for this: the labels!\n\nThey start as expected, but everything under 1% is listed alphabetically for most of their products. There are a few I didn't include here. I've formatted them to italics at the point where they go alphabetical to make it more obvious.\n\n**Act+Acre Stem Cell Serum** (for the scalp)\n\nAdvertising claim amounts: 2% apple stem cells, 2% bamboo and pea extract\n\nIngredients list as of April 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (ALOE), Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract (BAMBOO), Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Citric Acid, Plant-Based Collagen, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glucosamine Hcl, Glycereth-26, Lecithin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate (RADISH), Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract (APPLE), Pentylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract (PEA), Propanediol, Quercus Petraea Fruit Extract (OAK), Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Xanthan Gum*\n\nNote: Raw material manufacturers have been trying to make plant stem cells happen in cosmetics for well over a decade. I have not tried any and have no plans to do so. PhytoCellTec's SDS for their apple stem cell extract on Lotioncrafter's site gives the amount as 9% of the whole solution as supplied.\n\n**Hair Cleanse**\n\nAd Claim: 2% Apple amino acids, 0.045% Baobab oil (they say it supports a healthy scalp microbiome, not sure how that applies in a rinse off)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Triethyl Citrate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, *Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylyl Glycol, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Cocamide Mipa, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Gamma-Nonalactone, Glycol Distearate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hexylene Glycol, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil (LAVENDER), Menthyl Ethylamido Oxalate, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Potassium Sorbate, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Steareth-4, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET), Xanthan Gum* \n\nNote: Oils are only put in shampoos for making label claims.\n\n**Scalp Detox**\n\nUndoubedly misleading as heck ad claims: 4.55% Aloe & Calendula Extract, 2.73% Botanical Blend (either of those could mean anything)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil (SOYBEAN), Isostearyl Linoleate, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (ALOE), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Calendula Officinalis Extract (CALENDULA), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil (ORANGE), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil (COCONUT), Ocimum Basilicum Hairy Root Culture Extract (BASIL), Vetiveria Zizanoides Root Oil (VETIVER)*\n\nNote: Calendula is frequently extracted in sunflower seed oil for commercial use, and oil soluble aloe extracts are also widely available. The process for how they claim to stir this formula together is in the patent application as Working Example 3. A version of the hair cleanse is example 1. Anyway, I would guess that it is probably 80% or more C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate.\n\n**Conditioning Hair Mask** (also called Restorative Hair Mask)\n\nAd claims: 2% castor oil, no other % claims but mentions shea butter and panthenol benefits\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Isoamyl Laurate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Glycerin, Diheptyl Succinate, Triethyl Citrate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Di-C12-15 Alkyl Fumarate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, *Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Arachidyl Glucoside, Behentrimonium Chloride, Behenyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Nut Extract (SHEA BUTTER), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Ceteareth-20, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Ethylhexylglycerin, Gamma-Nonalactone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil (CASTOR), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sclerotium Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET)*\n\nNote: The star here is Crodabond CSA INCI: Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer. It does have a tiny amount of plain castor oil too. Hard to say how accurate that 2% claim is.\n\nTheir **Hair Oil** doesn't have the detailed ingredients list that would show off their obvious fragrance inrgedients, as it would crush the \"just 5 natural ingredients\" idea, but they also say their squalane is squalene in the ad copy and I am petty enough about that kind of thing to put this here. \n\nAd claim from website: 5% plant-based squalene, 5% Argan oil\n\nList: Limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, Squalane, Argania spinosa kernel (argan) oil, Crambe abyssinica seed oil phytosterol esters, Fragrance\n\nNote: As far as brand cohesiveness, this is an odd choice given the detailed ingredients lists of the other products that include the names of aroma chemicals and carefully avoid using the word \"fragrance\" but it is probably the most honest.",

    "body": "I have been wondering about BeautyNetKorea's house brand, Eyenlip, since it first launched. The prices are rock-bottom for most items (sunscreen for $2, BB cream for $3 -- plus shipping). The box of 10 masks was $1.90 when I bought it. It's hard to pass up a mask for 19 cents (plus shipping). Note: This was a promotional price. It looks like they're $2.29 today (April 18, 2018), but more varieties are available than when I purchased.\n\n**Packaging:** The box has that velvety feel and the sheet masks each have a matte background with colorful flowers that are glossy. It appears to be heavily borrowing from the packaging of the [Jayjun Anti-Dust](http://en.jayjun.co.kr/img/main_visual_antidusttherapy_en.jpg) sheet masks. The packaging is nicer than expected. Ingredients are listed in both Korean and English, but instructions are only in pictograms for those who don't read Korean. It's a sheet mask -- it's not that difficult.\n\n**Ingredients:** (I couldn't find these listed in English online, so here they are)\n\nWater, Glycerin, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polysorbate 20, Snail Secretion Filtrate (25g), Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Pinuis Palustris Leaf Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (Tea Leaf), Camellia Japonica Seed Extract (Camellia), Honey Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Hamamelis Virgniana Leaf Extract (Witch Hazel), Phenoxylethanol, Fragrance\n\nI just wanted to list them here for anyone who wants them. I'm not the world's best ingredient analyzer.\n\n**Use:** The first thing I noticed about the mask is how drippy it is. I left the mask on a flat surface for a couple of days so it could absorb the essence better. When I took it out of the pack, it was dripping into the sink -- something most masks don't do. \n\n**Fit/Material:** The mask fit OK, and would work for fiveheads like me. Others may need to fold it over on the forehead. The eye holes seemed smaller than average for sheet masks. The material is fairly thin on this one and it's translucent. Because the eye holes covered my eyebrows and the mask was drippy, I had serum running into my eyes, which was a first for me.\n\n**Fragrance:** The serum has a fairly robust rose fragrance. It's not overwhelming for me, but it is reasonably strong. The rose scent wasn't overly fake or perfumy, but it's definitely there. \n\n**Serum:** I found the serum didn't absorb into my skin as well as other masks I've used (including Innisfree, Mizon, Tosowoong, Leaders, Dermal Korea, MBD, etc.). I was patting for quite some time after I removed the mask. Despite how much was in the mask, I still had leftovers for my next couple of routines. The serum wasn't overly sticky, but I did need to put on moisturizer to make it dry down better. \n\n**Results:** The hydration level I got from this was OK. I didn't break out and my skin felt soft. It was overall a \"meh\" mask for me.\n\nI'm not sure if I'll repurchase or not. Summer is coming and I tend to mask more when it's hot, so these might be a nice way to mask more often at a low price.\n\n**Score:** 3/5",

        "body": "I’ve tried all three of the eyenlip sheet masks once so far, and the salmon oil one is my favorite; my skin felt softer and better hydrated after I used it. I had similar results with the hyaluronic acid mask, but not as pronounced. My experience with the snail essence mask was about the same as your experience.\n\nDid you get a slight itching sensation with the snail essence mask? It wasn’t bad enough that I felt the need to take the mask off immediately and it didn’t leave any irritation, but I definitely had light itchiness on my face a few minutes after putting the mask on. It could be coincidence because my face frequently itches at random.\n\nEdit: Also, thanks for this review! When I was initially looking at buying these masks I had a hard time finding any reviews on them. I hate spending money on untested products, so it’s good to get some reviews out there on these masks.",

The ingredients are typically aren’t superb. \n\nFor example, the Fresh Black Tea Kombucha Facial Treatment Essence (250ml) is $68USD and this is the ingredient list: Water, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Glycerin, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Polyglycerin-3, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Citrus Unshiu Peel Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, Diglycerin, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum (Fragrance), Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Citrate, BHT, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Biotin, Phenoxyethanol, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol. \n \nIn comparison to an Asian Essence with similar claims/ingredients (though the concentration and overall ingredient list is superior)-ATRUE Real Black Tea True Active Essence 180ml for $42USD. The ingredients are: Saccharomyces/Xylinum/Black Tea Ferment(146,340mg), Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycereth-26, Niacinamide, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Dipropylene Glycol, Trehalose, Panthenol, Glycerin, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Maltodextrin, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Sorghum Bicolor Stalk Juice, Adenosine, Tromethamine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Water, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance\n\nIs this price discrepancy due to marketing? I’m just super confused about this and would appreciate any feedback/insight that someone would have! :)",

        "body": "because you're comparing fresh, a higher-end brand, to atrue, a more mid-tier brand. if sulwhasoo released a $65 black tea treatment essence, we wouldn't be having this conversation. but because a cheaper brand happened to release something like fresh, we draw a comparison, but since the brands aren't even on the same price point level within their respective markets, the comparison falls short from a money perspective.\n\nit just so happens that even cheaper korean brands like innisfree, nature republic, etc. happen to release products that are on par with the products released by higher-end western brands. in korean beauty, every brand is focused on having all of these fancy skincare products, whereas in western beauty, only higher end brands do that, while more affordable brands tend to stick with the basics. if cetaphil or cerave were releasing fermented essences or super complex-seeming miracle creams, it wouldn't seem like korean skincare is cheaper at all, but since drugstore brands tend to stick with the more basic niche, we start comparing cheap korean brands to luxury western brands.\n\nso basically, korean beauty isn't necessarily cheaper; korean brands as a whole are all going crazy with skincare, while in the west, only luxury brands tend to use these \"fancy\" ingredients and have these fancy claims. i guess it boils down to mindset. in the west, fancy skincare is a luxury, so brands only feel like it's worth delving into that realm if they know they're going to sell it for an expensive price (which is why you don't see cetaphil releasing an at-home 30% AHA facial with trendy pink packaging). if you want something cheap, you go with the basics. meanwhile, in korea, fancy skincare is kind of a standard i guess, so brands are all releasing products that fill the same niche, regardless of their price points.",

For the past month or so I've tried cutting down on my use of silicones and sulfates (only use a sulfate shampoo once a week or so because my hair feels too gross without it), but overall my hair feels worse than before. About a month ago I bought some natures gate products, because I really like how they're relatively inexpensive and also vegan/cruelty free. \n\nFor anyone who's curious: \n\nThis is the ingredients list for the shampoo I've been using: Water, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, lauryl glucoside, glycerin, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, panthenol, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, borago officinalis (borage) seed oil, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, equisetum arvense (horsetail) leaf extract, geranium maculatum (geranium) extract, salvia officinalis (sage) leaf extract, mimosa tenuiflora (mimosa) bark extract, ascorbyl palmitate, polysorbate 20, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl undecylenate, citric acid, fragrance (parfum)*\nMade in the USA from globally sourced materials.\n* Phthalate free\nNo - sodium lauryl/laureth/coco sulfates, phthalates, butylene glycol, artificial colors.\n\nAnd this is the ingredients list for the conditioner - Water, Glycerin (Vegetable Derived), Stearyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Vegetable Derived), Benzyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride (Vegetable Derived), Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Viola Tricolor (Pansy) Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydroxyethylcellulose (Plant Derived), Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance*.\n*Phthalate free.\n\nMy hair feels straw-like even in the shower, there's no slip unless it's absolutely coated in conditioner and then as soon as it rinses out it feels gross again. I also feel like my hair is falling out more often (if I pull at the tips, long strands will start coming out in the shower). I don't really know what to do. I feel like my hair gets buildup pretty easily because when I've tried cowashing with thick shampoos or have put oil in my hair it always feels really weighed down and greasy the next day. I also have a lot of problems with an itchy, flaky scalp. \n\nI was thinking that using a conditioner with water soluble silicones would be the best compromise - all the benefits of silicones but without the buildup. \n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations? *I've also been looking for a heat protectant spray* that contains water soluble silicones, since I usually straighten my hair a bit to get rid of the really weirdly shaped waves. I've started using a bit of salt spray in my hair as well (not that often), but I feel like it's been drying out my ends. I considered mixing a bit of conditioner or oil (I've heard jojoba is closest to the scalp sebum) into the mix to make it less damaging, but I have no idea what the salt is doing to my hair with or without silicones. On one hand, it seems like silicones would protect my hair from the salt penetrating it too much. But on the other, it would also prevent the moisturizing ingredients from penetrating my hair, so it seems like a catch-22. I do think I need silicones though, because my hair just doesn't seem to be doing too great without them.   \n\nI'm sorry for such a long post! But if anyone could help me, that would be wonderful.

You might want to find a protein free conditioner to use and only use the protein one once every couple of weeks.\n\nAlso salt spray will just dry out your strands and make your hair feel coarse. I'm not sure why you are using salt spray if your straighten your hair. It's more likely to make it wavy and crazy.\n\nIf you use heat I'd maybe get a silicone heat spray/serum and just use it on the parts you straighten. Silicone WILL wash out if you don't use it in every single product and it will help to protect your hair from heat.\n\nWhen not using heat. Use an oil on your ends to keep them soft.\n\nHope that helps :)",

    "body": "TL;DR Foaming cleanser with Coco-Glucoside was too stripping. Started experimenting with the emulsion-cream formula (Sodium Polyacrylate, oils, Glycerin, surfactants/solubilizers) – better but still too strong. Got some random papules. Need help with a cleansing formula to make it less stripping but without residue that might contribute to acne. A simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe left a residue, got some papules and one nodule because of it.\n\nDetailed version:\n\nSince simple foaming cleanser with just 2.7% Coco-Glucoside (and less=no foam) was too stripping to my combo (oily-normal-dry) skin I started experimenting with non-foaming emulsion-cream formula.\n\nI used Sodium Polyacrylate (Cosmedia SP) as an emulsifier and thickener. 1-2%, then found that 2 was too much.\n\nI used some surfactants/solubilizers with it, usually Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate at 0.5-5%. 2-5% was too strong. Every time I tried to add Coco-Glucoside (with an additional thickener, like Xanthan Gum), it was too strong, usually, 4 uses and my skin was crying for help. Even with oils, which I describe below.\n\nThen I added some oils, usually caprylic/capric triglyceride or grapeseed oil. 2-5%. Anything below 5% was too strong. I wonder, maybe Cosmedia is just too good at emulsifying sebum on the face. I still want to use it because it feels great at distributing it on a wet face and it's easy to rinse off.\n\nSo it mostly looked something like this:\n\n* 4-5% Oils\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 0.5-2% Surfactants/solubilizers\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* Lactic acid to pH about 6.\n* Then I tried something simple like:\n* 4% Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n\nIt was still a little too strong, but sebum production lowered and my skin calmed down a little.\n\nNext, I tried something like this:\n\n* 2% Grapeseed oil\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 1.1% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 0.85% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 0.5% Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate\n\nToo strong. Added more oils to 5% total. It's better, but my dry areas are still tight (cheeks) and normal areas a little tight. And now I have a problem with 2-5 papules on oily areas (forehead).\n\nSo I'm not sure what could I change and what's causing inflamed pimples – maybe it's still too stripping or it's because of some PEG-7 residue? I read that it's a surfactant AND a refatener.\n\nSpeaking of residues – I tried to make a simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe:\n\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% BTMS-50\n* 2% Cetyl Alcohol\n* 0.5% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* 0.5% Glyceryl Stearate Citrate\n* 0.5% Hydroxyethylcellulose\n\nI used it like 4 times and didn't like it as it left a powdery residue (I think it's a BTMS and/or Cetyl Alcohol?) and I got some papules and one nodule. It was 16 days ago. I read that BTMS can break some people out badly, I wonder if maybe these papules that I've been getting lately was still because of a cleanser with BTMS that I used 4 times 2 weeks ago.\n\nI know it's not a place for acne, but I think it was important to mention it. I think most of my acne is because of just using too stripping cleansers and/or a residue of product.\n\nI am open to suggestions, I can replace Sodium Polyacrylate with something else, but it's hard to get some emulsifiers/solubilizers here in Poland so I'd like to use it.\n\nI use a simple cream after cleansing:\n\n* 5% Dimethicone 350 CST\n* 4% Betaine\n* 2% Sodium Polyacrylate - I think I'll lower it to 1-1.5% because it's a little too thick and it dries too quickly. Or maybe add something like Sorbitol?\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n\nHere's a list of emulsifiers/surfactants/solubilizers (except ingredients which I described above) which I can buy here I Poland:\n\n* Olivem 1000 - I'm afraid a little that it'll contribute to acne, even in a rinse-off product.\n* Creamy Base 1-1-3 *(Aqua, Glycerin, Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate, Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Trilaureth-4 phosphate, Lauryl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin)*\n* Self-emulsifying creamy base *(Glyceryl Stearate Citrate (and) Sucrose Stearate (and) Sucrose Distearate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Cocoate (and) Cetyl Alcohol (and) Sodium Ricinoleate)* \\- it contains Fatty Alcohol and I'm not sure if it contributed to acne or it was just BTMS.\n* Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate - the description says it needs to have 15-40% of oils to be stable, so I think it's not a good idea for a cleansing formula.\n* Glyceryl Monostearate - it needs to have pH >6.8\n* SLP *(Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate)*\n* Polysorbate 20, 80, 85\n* *Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate* \\- Again, Fatty Alcohol\n* Simulgel Thickener (Sodium Acrylate / Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer & Isohexadecane & Polysorbate 80) - maybe it would be a better option than just Sodium Polyacrylate\n   * Or this: Emulcold Extra (Sodium Acrylate; Acryloyldimethyl Taurate; Dimethylacrylamide Crosspolymer; Isohexadecane; Polysorbate 60)\n* Polawax (Emulsifying Wax NF)\n* Gosulin IL *(Isoamyl Laurate & Isoamyl Cocoate) -* not an emulsifier, but I read it can be used to wash off dimethicone easily.\n* Carbomer - I think it can't be used alone to emulsify, but it works well with Sodium Polyacrylamide, so I can use less Cosmedia and lower pH >6 without loss of a viscosity \n* Surfactants:\n   * Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside (O110) - I read that it's harsher than Coco-Glucoside.\n   * Decyl Glucoside (O10) - same concerns as above.\n   * Lauryl Glucoside\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids - it's a new ingredient in a shop, I haven't made a research about it yet.\n   * Cocamidopropyl Betaine - I think I'm allergic to amphoteric surfactants or it's because of some of it binds to the skin? My skin is itchy after I use it a couple of days in a row.\n   * Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate - same as above.\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate - a product with it made my hands very dry, so I think I don't want to use it on my face. Which is sad because studies have shown that it's one of the mildest anionics...",

It doesn’t foam. I just gently massage the gel around my face. It’s enough to get my pores clear. Doesn’t leave any residue. \n\nIf you needed it a bit stronger you could try 5% sodium cococyl glycinate (that’s calculating for a product with 25% active surfactant matter). \n\nAnother thing-  if you want to try a different oil in your formulas, you could try Neossance Squalane (from sugar cane). It is non-irritating and non-acnegenic. Doesn’t have any astringent qualities. Very lightweight but conditioning oil.",

Commercial cleansers utilises a mix of surfactants to increase the micelle size and gentleness.

Lavender and cypress provide and herbaceous tone and the scent is grounded by the earthy, smoky veitver. The scent is approachable and fairly masculine. Mrs. Ruds is neither a fan nor a detractor of this scent. Strength of scent is mid-strong out of the container and once lathered.

This is considered their premium shave soap offering and as such the formula uses the following ingredients: Aqua (Water), Beef Tallow, Stearic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Garcinia Indica Seed (Kokum) Butter, Orbignya Oleifera (Babassu) Seed Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Fragrance, Sodium Lactate, Raw Honey, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Allantoin, Bentonite Clay, Goat Milk, Silk Amino Acids, Arnica Extract, Lanolin, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Sodium Phytate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hydroxyethylcellulose. The soap is of mid firmness and loads easily into your desired brush type. The formula is of standard thirst in my experience and when properly worked will resemble sour cream in terms of lather consistency. Primary and residual slickness of this soap is excellent. Much like their non-vegan base, post shave is the real star and is among the elite in a crowded soap market. The face feel and protection this lather leaves behind is amazing. Given my experience with the base, Gentleman's Nod tallow receives a ShaveScore of 94. For a similar performance experience I suggest Australian Private Reserve or Zingariman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Gentleman’s Nod Vincent (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Lutin Brushworks (gift) \n* Razor - Wade & Butcher “Buffalo” (gift)\n* Post - Proraso Red (purchased)",

Their current offerings feature shaving soap, pre shave, post shave and beard care. The company’s name signifies the respect among gentlemen and their desire for personal care and quality. Each of their current scent offerings is named for a famous gentleman throughout human history. Gentleman’s Nod products can be sourced direct from their website.\n\nKanpai is named for the Japanese word “cheers”. It honors the community as a thank you for their support of the brand and was developed from a Japanese gin recipe. Scent notes feature: Gin, Yuzu, Grapefruit, Lemon, Mandarin, Ginger, Asian Plum, Cardamom, Coriander, Sweet Basil and Anise. The resulting fragrance is a slightly boozy, citrusy and spicy accord. Mrs. Ruds approves of the fragrance for casual use. It is pleasing to her, but not sexy enough for the date nights. Strength of scent is mid-strong out of the container and once lathered. Try That Soap ([https://trythatsoap.com/](https://trythatsoap.com/)) recommends Oleo Soapworks - Bonaire as a comparable scent profile. \n\nKanpai is offered in Gentleman’s Nods Cardinal base. This base aims to bring an already stellar tallow formula to the elite class of wet shaving soap bases. Ingredients listed in the formula are: Stearic Acid, Glycerin, Aqua (Water), Tallow (Beef), Ricinus communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea Butter), Potassium Hydroxide, Theobroma grandiflorum (Cupuacu) Butter, Fragrance, Lauryl Laurate, Lanolin, Raw Honey, Sucrose Cocoate, Methyl Gluceth 10, Sodium Lactate, Orbignya Oleifera (Babassu) Seed Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Silk Amino Acids, Goat's Milk, Albumen, Buttermilk, Coconut Milk, Persea gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Citrate, Allantoin, dl Panthenol, Bentonite Clay, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Sodium Phytate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe) Juice (and) Maltodextrin, Hydroxyethylcellulose.

Heat protection sprays are designed to protect from heat settings that get up to 450 degrees (depending on the product).\n You can test heat protection sprays and how well they buffer the heat.  1. Simply spray the product on one hand and leave the other hand free from product. I like a liquid spray. 2. Take a blow dryer and apply heat to the hand that has the spray. Count how many seconds you can withstand the heat from the dryer. 3. Next apply heat to the hand that doesn’t have product and count how long you can stand the heat.\n There should be a noticeable difference between the  heat. This will give you an idea of how effective your product is working. \n Also with liquid sprays you can spray the product your hand and apply to avoid contact with your face. Hope this helps.",

I've tried supposedly non-comedogenic chemical sunscreens and chemical sunscreens where I know the non-sunscreen ingredients have not broken me out in the past, but they all still made me break out.  My other option was a mineral/physical sunscreen, but a lot of them are not cosmetically elegant -- often leaving a whitecast and/or a heavy, greasy feeling on top of my face.  This sunscreen is 100% brown skin-friendly, acne-prone skin approved!  It leaves no whitecast and it actually goes on like a chemical sunscreen.  It reapplies on top of make-up beautifully.  Best of all, it has not broken me out! Usually, within 4 days of using a sunscreen, I'll start to break out daily, but I have not had a new pimple since using this.  I wish the SPF was higher and had a PA rating of 4 +'s, but for now, this will have to do!  I will forever buy this sunscreen until I find something with a higher SPF and PA rating that ticks all the same boxes: does not cause breakouts, does not leave a whitecast, not heavy/greasy on face, and under $20 for 1.7 oz.",

I heard her on podcasts and she’s trying to give more access to high quality ingredients to retail customers. This stuff is amazing and 16oz is $68. \n\nAnyhoo, just wanted to share some good finds for at-home use as I just did an intense 2.4mm MN session yesterday at home (I’m an esthetician)  and thought some folks here might find the info of use. \n\nAdmins: if it’s inappropriate to mention products by name, let me now and I’ll delete the post right away!\n",

I really liked the moisturising effect I got from the Natural Repair cream - it cleared up my dryness and turned my skin pretty 'normal', just slightly oily in the T-zone. It was a bit too heavy to use during the daytime but I like having a thick cream in the evening as I always wake up feeling super soft and smooth.\n\nI've looked through the list in our sidebar, browsed the product recommendations on the SCA website and done a search which turned up a couple of suggestions, but mostly things like CeraVe PM and Simple Ultra-Light Gel Moisturiser which I'd have to ship to the UK. I'd prefer something I can just grab in Boots!\n\nOne person suggested [Eucerin Dermo-Purifyer Hydrating Care](http://www.boots.com/en/Eucerin-Dermo-Purifyer-Hydrating-Care-50ml_1213618/) as a near-dupe and I've also seen [Simple Kind To Skin Hydrating Light Moisturiser](http://www.boots.com/en/Simple-Kind-To-Skin-Hydrating-Light-Moisturiser-125ml_861128/) recommended to people with similar skin issues to mine (also maybe the Rich version? I'm not sure which would be closer to the Oilatum formula!).\n\n**I guess I just want to know if anyone else has loved the Oilatum cream and found something similar, or has tried some of the suggestions I've listed so they can tell me if they're close? Thanks!**\n\n\nOilatum Natural Repair Face Cream ingredients: Aqua, Olea Europeae, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Palm Glycerides, Olus, Oleic Triglycerides, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Squalane, Betaine, Palmitamide MEA, Acetamide MEA, Sarcosine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Carbomer, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum",

Eye holes not too big. The mask is black.\n\n**WEAR TIME**\nAverage. I hit 30 min easy.\n\n**AFTEREFFECTS**\nIt managed to leave this sticky film not unlike a clear tar all over my face... without actually managing to penetrate and hydrate AT ALL! (I judge hydration by the depth of my fine lines and wrinkles after a mask.) It didn't whiten, it didn't hydrate... Re: sebum control, it did take the oil off just my nose area, but I'm pretty sure anyone who wants sebum control wouldn't enjoy the sticky tar feeling on the rest of their face. Editx2: It does suck the oil away if you immediately wash your face afterwards.\n\n**Edit: Oh yeah, sensitive types may want to avoid anyway**\nThe preservatives and fragrance are higher up on the ingredients list than usual. \n\nThis one is a HARD SKIP!",

And It didn’t disappoint. It’s very moisturizing, it’s texture is almost like a mayonnaise.  My skin loves it as it seeps easily into the skin, and leaves no greasy or oily feel.  It’s so smooth that it glides easily into the skin. There’s zero fragrance and it makes my skin feel both moisturized and hydrated.\n\nI have been using It as a Night Cream, as PM is a good time to use hydrating and barrier repairing products. It stays true to its hydration claims, but I saw no effect on my pigmentation nor did it reduce tiny bumps on my skin (like Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel). I didn’t see any glow, but it did make my skin look healthy.\n\nAs someone with Combination skin, bit towards the oilier side, it’s so difficult to find a moisturizer that moisturizes without any greasiness or without feeling heavy on your skin, and also not inviting new acne post application. This was a Chef’s kiss. So worth the hype, but not worth the price. \n\n\n**WRP:** Unless I get it again at a cheaper thrift price, WNRP. It is a great product, but 3000 bucks for a 60ml cream is too expensive. But if you’re someone who can afford it, go for it.",

    "body": "Sorry i really had problems with the title. I have just noticed that a lot of AB products tend to have more types of peptides but also almost always contain copperpeptides (specifically copper trieptide-1 made them fat/thicc on the ingredient lists).   \nWhy is that?   \ni heard some conflicting things about copper peptides and L-ascorbic acid. It's fine to mix l-ascorbic acid with AB copperpeptide containing products because the amount of copper peptides is too low to cause problems. But if the amount of copperpeptides is too low to cause problems doesn't that mean the copperpeptide is useless in the formula?  \nAnd does it mean the overall concentration of peptides is too low or just the copperpetide(s) (they tend to be close on the ingredientlist).   \nI mean i can see they don't contain a lot of copperpetides since they are not blue-ish like the ordinary copperpeptides serum but still. I am just cofused......  \n\n\nfyi i usually don't worry about concentrations of peptides since the concentrations needed to work are so low but the copperpeptides + l-ascorbic acid made me a bit confused.  \n\n\n\\+  \n\n\nAnybody know what all the sh-peptides are for in the last one???

        "body": "The most important thing to understand is to not assume one ingredient is good or bad because it all comes down the the **formulation of the product**. Ultimately you'd need to consult with a cosmetic chemist (ie: [LabMuffinBeautyScience](https://www.youtube.com/@LabMuffinBeautyScience)) to understand the relationships because it all ***depends***. \n\nInevitably the question is how much do you trust the brand, because it is not in their best interest to spend time and money on research and development of formulations or sourcing/buying/incorporating ingredients that don't work or cause problems. \n\nCopper peptides are short chains of amino acids that can help maintain skin structure by boosting collagen and elastin production. When applied topically, copper peptides can act as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, and can help soften the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Copper peptides can also help treat scarring, pigmentation, and redness caused by inflammation.\n\nAccording to a board-certified dermatologist, copper peptides are a type of peptide that acts as a messenger to instruct skin cells to perform various functions, such as building collagen and elastin, reducing inflammation, and maintaining hydration.\n\nCopper can oxidize ascorbic acid (vitamin C), causing it to break down too rapidly and resulting in diminished benefits. However, some recommend using copper peptides with vitamin C, as peptides work synergistically with vitamin C to trap moisture and improve the skin's texture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Different strengths of copper can oxidize ascorbic acid, which diminishes the effectiveness of vitamin C\n* Peptides work synergistically with vitamin C to trap moisture and improve skin texture  \nTo achieve maximum benefits, you should use copper peptides consistently for at least 3 months.\n\n**From Board Certified Dermatologists:**\n\n**The Incredible Case For Copper Peptides (& ascorbic acid)**\n\n>[Video from dermatologist](https://youtu.be/lJQJ3i8KCnU)\n\n**What are Copper Peptides?** \n\n>[Video from dermatologist](https://youtu.be/iGAdOBnu3AU)\n\n**INCI Decoder**\n\n>Decode skincare ingredients fast with our science-based but easy-to-understand explanations.

But it can be used by all skin types due to how light it is. \n\nAfter application\nIt looks normal, no glossy/overly matte finish. \n\nAcne fighting\nVery gentle on the skin, does not sting on application and does nor leave the skin looking red or irritated.

The ones I listed above I was just so perplexed as to why they broke me out when they work for so many other people with ultra sensitive skin like mine.\n\n\nThanks, and I appreciate any help you could give me!!",

This led me to this subreddit and now I have been researching various ingredients in haircare. \n\nI would still like to use silicones in my hair but was wondering whether alkyl-quaternized ammonium salts (behentrimonium chloride, cetrimonium chloride, etc.) can be used with amodimethicone. I believe these are cationic surfactants so would they not be suitable in conjunction with amodimethicone as it would cause buildup?

The simplest way to explain it is that the b3 works like doubled sided tape inside each hair strand and helps the strands reform as one strand. This treatment is only designed to last 6ish weeks, and is not a permanent long term fix.\nAlmost all products sold as a split end “repair” treatment will not actually repair the split ends. They’re most likely smoothing the hair shaft to give the appearance of less split ends, and it washes out when you wash your hair. The emollients concentration in these products is heavy, so they can be very challenging to people with oily hair, because you are essentially adding more oil to the hair.  These products will not help repair the split ends, they more likely mask the problem. \n\nThe only way to get rid of split ends once they are actually splitting is to get a haircut.",
