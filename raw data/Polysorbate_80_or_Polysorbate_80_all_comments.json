    "body": "I used to post on GOMI analyzing the ingredients of different Glossier formulations and would generally comment on their product releases, but I thought I'd move to reddit for this one since I think it's more helpful here.\n\nMe: I work in the beauty industry on the product development side and because of that I'm constantly testing new products from competitors either just to keep up with the industry or when clients bring them in as comparisons. Recently I came across a product that I thought omg, I need to post this on reddit bc there are a ton of people who would probably want to know this.\n\nThis post will cover the first [Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser](https://www.glossier.com/products/milky-jelly-cleanser) dupe which is a 99.999% match, is half the price (or usually less) - and the sole difference is that it has a different fragrance.\n\nIf you look up “Glossier Milky Jelly Dupes” the one that is always coming up is the Bliss Makeup Melt Cleanser. That one is annoying because is not a real dupe at all; it’s just vaguely texturally similar and has a similar bottle, but the formulation has nearly nothing in common with Milky Jelly in any way. Kind of pointless.\n\nPresenting the last word in Milky Jelly dupes, the [ELF Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9). It is \\*nearly identical in every way\\* to Milky Jelly and is usually on sale for $3. Srsly.\n\nIngredients comparison:\n\nE.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser Ingredients: Water (Aqua), PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 184, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, Isohexadecane, Xylitylglucoside, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Panthenol (Vb5), Hydroxyacetophenone, Isopropyl Myristate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Allantoin, Xylitol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nGlossier Milky Jelly Ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Propanediol, Isohexadecane, Poloxamer 184, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Xylitylglucoside, Betaine, Allantoin, Glycerin, Panthenol, Symphytum Officinale Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Xylitol, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Isopropyl Myristate, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nThese formulations are nearly identical. They have the same cleansing agents in almost exactly the same order, and even the same textural ingredients. E.L.F. was definitely duplicating the formula exactly when they were formulating.\n\nAs I've said, I've tested the E.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser and the Milky Jelly face wash and they are nearly identical. The texture is bang-on and the use experience is the same. There is just one real difference - the Glossier cleanser uses rosewater as the scent ingredient, and the Bounce Back uses a coconut fragrance. I’m sensitive to fragrances and it doesn’t bother me at all, it’s pretty light.\n\nThe best part? The E.L.F. Bounce Back Milky Jelly dupe is $6.00 for 100ml.\n\n$6.\n\nAnd when I ordered it for testing, it was actually $3 because E.L.F. always has sales.\n\nTo compare, Glossier Milky Jelly is $18.00 for 177ml + shipping.\n\nWhere to buy the Bounce Back: it’s is a little annoying, since they don’t have it in Target, or on Amazon it seems, but you can get it on the ELF website. Here’s the link:\n\n[https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9)\n\nAlso, disclaimer: I don't work for ELF, and never have, and think most of their products are very mediocre. But this one is clearly a copy of something already tested and popular (and I don't feel bad about sharing it because the Glossier Milky Jelly was a total rip-off/copy of the LaRoche Posay Physiological Gel, soooo)",

Kennedy,  Jr. reveals Merck data showing Gardasil increases the overall risk of death by 370%, risk of autoimmune disease by 2.3% and risk of a serious medical condition by 50%  \n* Postmarketing and adverse events reported during use of the vaccine post-licensing are listed on the Gardasil vaccine insert and include blood and lymphatic system disorders, pulmonary embolus, pancreatitis, autoimmune diseases, anaphylactic reactions, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system disorders and more \n* Merck’s use of a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant instead of a proper placebo in its safety trials effectively renders its safety testing null and void, as the true  extent of harm cannot be accurately ascertained \n\n \n\nThe HPV vaccine Gardasil was granted European license in February 2006,1 followed by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval that same year in June.2  Gardasil was controversial in the U.S. from the beginning, with vaccine  safety activists questioning the quality of the clinical trials used to  fast track the vaccine to licensure.3\n\nLauded as a silver bullet against cervical cancer, there have been multiple continuing reports since it was licensed that [Gardasil vaccine](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/05/05/hpv-vaccine-gardasil.aspx)  has wrought havoc on the lives of young girls (and young boys) in the  U.S. and in countries across the world. Serious adverse reactions  reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in  relation to Gardasil include but are not limited to:4\n\n \n\n* Anaphylaxis\n* Guillain-Barre Syndrome\n* [Transverse myelitis](https://articles.mercola.com/shingles.aspx) (inflammation of the spinal cord)\n* [Pancreatitis](https://articles.mercola.com/pancreatitis.aspx)\n* Venous thromboembolic events (blood clots)\n* Autoimmune initiated motor neuron disease (a neurodegenerative disease that causes rapidly progressive muscle weakness)\n* [Multiple sclerosis](https://articles.mercola.com/multiple-sclerosis.aspx)\n* Sudden death\n\n \n\nPostmarketing experiences and adverse events reported during post-approval use listed on the Gardasil vaccine insert5  include blood and lymphatic system disorders such as autoimmune  hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and  lymphadenopathy; pulmonary embolus; pancreatitis; autoimmune diseases;  anaphylactic reactions; arthralgia and myalgia (musculoskeletal and  connective tissue disorders); nervous system disorders such as acute  disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, motor neuron  disease, paralysis, seizures and transverse myelitis; and deep venous  thrombosis, a vascular disorder.\n\nAccording to \"Manufactured Crisis — HPV, Hype and Horror,\" a film6  by The Alliance for Natural Health, there have also been cases of  16-year-old girls developing ovarian dysfunction, meaning they're going  into menopause, which in turn means they will not be able to have  children.\n\nDespite such serious effects, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) and FDA allege the vast majority, or even all, of  these tragic cases are unrelated to the vaccine, and that Gardasil is  safe.\n\nThe Plaintiff's Science Day Presentation on Gardasil video features  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel for Children's  Health Defense,7  an organization originally founded in 2016 as World Mercury Project and  renamed in 2018 to focus on exposing and eliminating multiple harmful  exposures contributing to the epidemic of chronic ill health among  children. The video details the many safety problems associated with  Merck's HPV vaccine, Gardasil.\n\nThe information presented is based on publicly available government documents. Kennedy notes that, if what he says about [Merck](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/05/14/mercks-adhd-drugs-unsafe.aspx) in this video presentation were untrue, they would be considered slanderous.\n\nHowever, Kennedy says he is not concerned about being sued for  slander. He says he knows Merck won't sue, \"because in the U.S., truth  is an absolute defense against slander\" and Merck knows that, were the  company to sue for slander, Kennedy would file discovery requests that  would unearth even more documents detailing Merck's fraudulent  activities.\n\nKennedy's presentation does not go into the biological mechanisms by  which Gardasil causes harm. He directs parents and pediatricians to the  Children's Health Defense website8 to read peer reviewed medical literature sources for that information.\n\nInstead, Kennedy's presentation focuses on what he describes as  Merck's fraudulent clinical trials of Gardasil vaccine, which were used  to gain FDA approval. While this article provides you with a summary of  the key points, I urge you to watch Kennedy's presentation in in its  entirety, as this information may well save you or your child a lifetime  of heartache and exorbitant medical expenses.\n\n \n\n## How Merck committed fraud in its Gardasil safety testing \n\nKennedy says the fraud Merck committed in its safety testing is (a)  testing Gardasil against a toxic placebo, and (b) hiding a 2.3%  incidence of autoimmune disease occurring within seven months of  vaccination.\n\nIn his presentation, Kennedy shows Table 1 from the package insert9  for Gardasil, which looks at vaccine injuries at the site of injection.  It shows that Gardasil was administered to 5,088 girls; another 3,470  received the control, amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate (AAAH)  — a neurotoxic aluminum vaccine adjuvant that has been associated with  many serious vaccine injuries in the medical literature.\n\nA third group, consisting of 320 individuals, received a proper [placebo](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/02/20/placebo-effect.aspx)  (saline). In the Gardasil and AAAH control groups, the number of  injuries were fairly close; 83.9% in the Gardasil group and 75.4% in the  AAAH control group. Meanwhile, the rate of injury (again, relating to  injuries at the injection site only), was significantly lower at 48.6%.\n\nNext, he shows Table 9 from the vaccine insert, which is the \"Summary  of girls and women 9 through 26 years of age who reported an incident  condition potentially indicative of a systemic autoimmune disorder after  enrollment in clinical trials of Gardasil, regardless of causality.\"  These conditions include serious systemic reactions, chronic and  debilitating disorders and autoimmune diseases.\n\nNow all of a sudden, there are only two columns, not three as shown  for the injection site injuries. The column left out is that of the  saline placebo group. Kennedy points out that Merck cleverly hides the  hazards of Gardasil by combining the saline group with the aluminum  control, thereby watering down the side effects reported in the  controls. \"They hide the saline group as a way of fooling you, your  pediatrician and the regulatory agency,\" Kennedy says.\n\nLooking at the effects reported in the two groups, 2.3% of those  receiving Gardasil reported an effect of this nature, as did 2.3% of  those receiving the AAAH (aluminum) control or saline placebo. The same  exact ratio of harm is reported in both groups, which makes it appear as  though Gardasil is harmless.\n\nIn reality, we know very little about Gardasil vaccine safety from  the data as presented, since the vast majority of the controls were  given a toxic substance, and they don't tell us how many of those  receiving a truly inert substance developed these systemic injuries.  Still, we can draw some educated guesses, seeing how the injection site  injury ratios between Gardasil and the aluminum group were similar.\n\nMerck's use of AAAH, a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant instead of a  biologically inactive placebo, effectively nullifies its prelicensure  Gardasil safety testing.\n\nAs noted by Peter Gotzche with the Cochrane Center in 2016, when he  co-filed an unofficial complaint against the European Medical Agency for  bias in its assessment of the HPV vaccine, \"The use of active  comparators probably increased the occurrence of harms in the comparator  group, thereby masking harms caused by the HPV vaccine.\"\n\n## Risk evaluation\n\nWhen making an informed decision, you need to know both sides of the  equation — the risk you're trying to avoid, and the risk you're taking  on. Recall that, on average, 1 in 43,478 women will die from cervical  cancer.\n\nIf 2.3% of girls develop an autoimmune disease from Gardasil, then  that translates into 1,000 per 43,500. Even if a 1 in 43,478 chance of  dying from cancer is gone, does it makes sense to trade that for a 1 in  43 chance of getting an autoimmune disease?\n\nAnd how many parents are comfortable giving a child a substance  knowing there's a 1 in 43 chance that this substance will cause a  lifelong disability? Yet that's the choice parents have been fooled into  making.\n\n## Protocol 18\n\nMerck has not disclosed how many clinical safety trials (also called  protocols) it conducted for Gardasil. A slide in Kennedy's presentation  shows a listing of several of the ones known, including protocol 18.  Kennedy says this clinical trial is critical because that was the one  that FDA used as its basis for giving Merck a license to market the  vaccine for use in children as young as 9 years old.\n\nProtocol 18 is the only trial in which the target audience, 9-  through 15-year-old girls and boys, was tested prelicensure. The other  trials looked at the vaccine's safety in 16- through 26-year-olds.  Protocol 18 included just 939 children — \"a very, very tiny group of  people,\" Kennedy says, \"for a product that is going to be marketed to  millions of children around the world.\"\n\nAside from its small cohort size, protocol 18 is also filled with  \"fraud and flimflam,\" according to Kennedy. Merck presented protocol 18  to the FDA and HHS as the only safety trial that used a true  nonbioactive inert placebo. This, however, was a misrepresentation.\n\nInstead of pure saline, the placebo used in protocol 18 contained a carrier solution composed of [polysorbate 80](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2019/02/07/processed-food-emulsifiers-health-risks.aspx),  sodium borate (borax, which is banned for food products in the U.S. and  Europe), genetically modified yeast, L-histidine and DNA fragments. In  essence, the \"placebo\" was all of the vaccine components with the  exception of the aluminum adjuvant and the antigen (viral portion).\n\nVery little if any safety testing has been done on these ingredients,  so their biological effects in the body are largely unknown. What we  can say for sure is that these are not inert substances like saline.  Still, the 596 children given the carrier solution control \"fared much  better than any other cohort in the study,\" Kennedy says.\n\nNone of them had any serious adverse events in the first 15 days.  Now, here's where Merck committed fraud yet again. As Kennedy points  out, Table 20 in protocol 18 shows that Merck cut the amount of aluminum  used in the Gardasil vaccine by half.\n\n>*\"They tested a completely different formulation,\"* he says*.  \"And, obviously, they took the amount of aluminum out to reduce the  amount of injuries and mask the really bad safety profile of this  vaccine …*  \n>  \n>*Since Merck deceptively cut the amount of aluminum — Gardasil's  most toxic component — in half, the data from that study does not  support the safety of the standard Gardasil formulation. Since protocol  18 data are not based on the Gardasil vaccine formulation, the trial  constitutes scientific fraud.\"*  \n \n\n## Exclusion criteria — Another bag of tricks\n\nKennedy also describes another trick used by Merck to skew results:  exclusion criteria. By selecting trial participants that do not reflect  the general population, they mask potentially injurious effects on  vulnerable subgroups.\n\nFor example, individuals with severe allergies and prior genital  infections were excluded, as were those who'd had more than four sex  partners, those with a history of immunological or nervous system  disorders, chronic illnesses, seizure disorders, other medical  conditions, reactions to vaccine ingredients such as aluminum, yeast and  benzonase, and anyone with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.\n\nYet Merck recommends Gardasil for all of these unstudied groups.  Merck's investigators also had unlimited discretion to exclude anyone  with \"any condition which in the opinion of the investigator might  interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.\"\n\nMerck also used \"sloppy protocols to suppress reports of vaccine  injury,\" Kennedy says. For example, only 10% of participants were given  daily report cards to fill out, and they were only to be filled out for  14 days post-vaccination. What's more, these report cards only collected  information about vaccination site effects, such as redness, itching  and bruising.\n\nAlso ignored were autoimmune problems, seizures and menstrual cycle  disruptions experienced by many of the girls. They also did not follow  up with those who reported serious side effects. Merck also granted  broad discretionary powers to its paid investigators to determine what  they thought constituted a reportable adverse event and to dismiss  potential vaccine reactions.\n\nThe researchers did not systematically collect adverse event data,  which is the whole point of doing a safety study in the first place, and  by not paying for the additional time required by investigators to fill  out time-consuming adverse event reports, Merck effectively  incentivized the dismissal of side effects.\n\nMany of the illnesses and injuries reported were also classified as  \"new medical conditions\" rather than adverse events, and no rigorous  investigation of these new conditions were performed.\n\nAccording to Kennedy, at the time of the vaccine's approval, 49.5% of  the Gardasil group and 52% of the controls (who received either the  aluminum adjuvant or the vaccine carrier solution) had \"new medical  history\" after the seventh month (Table 303, which included protocols 7,  13, 15 and 18), many of which were serious, chronic diseases.\n\n## Risk evaluation, take 2\n\n**Taking all of this into account, here's how the risk-benefit equation  looks now: The 1 in 43,478 chance of dying from cervical cancer may  have been removed (assuming the vaccine actually works), but by taking  the vaccine there is now a 1 in 43 chance of getting an autoimmune  disease, and a 1 in 2 chance of developing some form of serious medical  condition.**\n\n## More lies \n\nAccording to Kennedy, Merck also submitted fraudulent information to its Worldwide Adverse Experience System and the federal Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS) about the death of Christina Tarsell, one of its study participants.\n\n>*\"Merck claimed that Chris' gynecologist had told the company that her death was due to viral infection. Chris' gynecologist denies that she ever gave this information to Merck. To this day, Merck has refused to change its false entry on its own reporting system,\"* Kennedy says.  \n>  \n>*\"Furthermore, Merck lied to the girls participating in these studies, telling them that the placebo was saline and contained no other ingredients. And No. 2, that the study in which they were participating was not a safety study. They were told that there had already been safety studies and that the vaccine had been proven safe …*   \n>  \n>*They made it so that the girls were less likely to report injuries associated with the vaccine, because they believed the vaccine they were receiving had already been proven safe and that any injuries did experience, maybe a month, two months or three months after the vaccine must just be coincidental and had nothing to do with the  vaccine.\"*\n\n \n\nBut it gets worse, because there's a possibility Gardasil could cause cancer. The Gardasil insert13  admits it has never been evaluated for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity,  yet its ingredients \"include potential carcinogens and mutagens,  including aluminum and human DNA,\" Kennedy says.\n\nHe goes on to show the results of Merck's study protocol 13 (Table  17: Applicant's analysis of efficacy against vaccine-relevant HPV types  CIN 2/3 or worse among subjects who were PCR positive and seropositive  for relevant HPV types at day 1.)\n\nWhat this protocol showed is that women who had previous exposure to  the HPV strains used in the vaccine had a 44.6% increased risk of  developing CIN2 and CIN3 lesions after vaccination. Taking the dubious  efficacy of Gardasil into account, and the fact that it may only impact  one-third of cervical cancer cases, the risk-benefit lineup when taking  the vaccine now looks like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* There is still a chance of dying from cervical cancer unrelated to HPV \n* There is a 1 in 43 chance of getting an autoimmune disease\n* There is a 1 in 2 chance of developing a serious medical condition\n* If someone has ever been exposed to any of the nine HPV strains  included in the vaccine prior to getting Gardasil the risk of developing  CIN2 and CIN3 cervical lesions is raised by 44.6%, which may raise the  risk of cervical cancer\n\n## Widespread Gardasil use may trigger more virulent HPV infections \n\n\"To make things even worse, there are recent scientific studies that  suggest a phenomenon known as type replacement,\" Kennedy says. \"Type  replacement\" refers to when the elimination or suppression of one viral  strain allows a more virulent strain to colonize. \n\nThe study,14  \"Shift in Prevalence of HPV Types in Cervical Cytology Specimens in the  Era of HPV Vaccination,\" published in the journal Oncology Letters in  2016 — which analyzed the association between the prevalence of 32 types  of HPV virus in 615 women who had abnormal cervical cytopathology —  reported that:\n\n>*\"… HPV16, which is recognized as the main HR-HPV type responsible  for the development of cervical cancer, was observed in 32.98% of HPV  participants, followed by HPV42 (18.09%), HPV31 (17.66%), HPV51  (13.83%), HPV56 (10.00%), HPV53 (8.72%) and HPV66 (8.72%).*   \n>  \n>*The prevalence of HR-HPV types, which may be suppressed directly  (in the case of HPV16 and 18), or possibly via cross-protection (in the  case of HPV31) following vaccination, was considerably lower in  participants ≤22 years of age (HPV16, 28.57%; HPV18, 2.04%; HPV31,  6.12%), compared with participants 23–29 years of age (HPV16, 45.71%;  HPV18, 7.86%; HPV31, 22.86%), who were less likely to be vaccinated.*   \n>  \n>*Consequently, the present study hypothesizes that there may be a  continuous shift in the prevalence of HPV types as a result of  vaccination. Furthermore, the percentage of non-vaccine HR-HPV types was  higher than expected, considering that eight HPV types formerly  classified as 'low-risk' or 'probably high-risk' are in fact HR-HPV  types.*   \n>  \n>*Therefore, it may be important to monitor non-vaccine HPV types  in future studies, and an investigation concerning several HR-HPV types  as risk factors for the development of cervical cancer is required.\"*\n\n*Sources*\n\n   \n\n* 1 [The Pharma Letter February 10, 2006 ](https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/sanofi-pasteur-msd-s-gardasil-becomes-first-hpv-vaccine-approved-in-europe)\n* 2 [FDA.gov, Gardasil Vaccine ](https://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/safetyavailability/vaccinesafety/ucm179549.htm)\n* 3 [NVIC.

IL-6 causes all three autism traits (social impairment, speech impairment and compulsive behavior), and damage to specific brain structures (e.g., the cerebellum) known to be damaged in human autism. Both prenatal and postnatal surges of IL-6 can cause autism. Immune activation during brain development has also been shown to cause schizophrenia, seizure disorders, and ADHD.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27501128\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22326556\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22310922\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23907982\n\nIn scientific experiments, dosages of 100mcg/kg, 300mcg/kg, and 550mcg/kg Al adjuvant cause neuron death, muscle weakness, learning and memory impairment, and pathological behavior changes in animals.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114826\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740540\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23932735\n\nDosage of 550mcg/kg also caused excessive weight gain (a sign of metabolic disorder).

This is unscientific because ingesting Al salts and injecting Al nanoparticles present very different risks. Both the route of administration and the chemical forms are different.\n\nRecent experiments prove that Al adjuvant is transported into the brain by white blood cells. This explains why injected Al adjuvant can be more dangerous to the brain than ingested Al salts.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23557144\n\nVaccine advocates like Paul Offit make false statements about Al toxicity studies.

I’m also not affiliated with Allie or Kanebo or Kao or even the beauty industry at large in any way.

Kanebo’s [brands](https://www.kanebo-cosmetics.co.jp/products/brand) include, well, Kanebo, as well as Allie, Kate, and Suisai.\n\nThe Allie brand also has a [Facial Gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-facial-gel-n-2020/)^(E) that’s specifically meant for the face, a [milk](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-perfect-n-2020/)^(E) that’s also for the face and body, and a few tone-up/color-correcting gels, all of which are rated SPF 50+ PA++++. (And a few water resistant makeup products that I admittedly tend to forget about.) They’re currently marketing their color-correcting sunscreens, [Allie Color Tuning UV](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-color-tuning-uv/),^(E) quite heavily as a foundation alternative that also provides UV protection. Aside from the Color Tuning line, which was released on February 16, 2021, all of the current sunscreens were released on February 16, 2020 (2020 formula). The previous version of the Allie gel, [Allie Extra UV Gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-spf50/)^(E) (without the “N”), was released on February 16, 2018 (2018 formula), and all the presently discontinued formulations released in 2018 and 2019 were also rated SPF 50+ PA++++.\n\nI’ve been using the Allie gel for nearly a decade now, starting with [the second formulation](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-mineral-moist-n/)^(E) released in 2012. [This 2013 article](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/japan-pa-system-for-uva-protection-revised/) from RatzillaCosme reminded me that I picked it up in the first place because it was one of the first sunscreens to be labelled PA++++. I do still try out other sunscreens from time to time, but I always have a tube of the Allie gel open concurrently with anything else I use. I’ve posted about the difference between the 2018 and 2020 formulas [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/gkgwm8/sunscreen_kanebo_allie_februaryapril_2020_new/), and reviews of each version [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/bz8r9t/japanese_sunscreens_allie_extra_uv_gel_highlight/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/jmkjlk/japanese_sunscreens_pt_2_allie_extra_uv_gel_n/), with an update to the 2020 review coming up.\n\n# On testing and reformulations\n\nAfter learning about the loophole in Korean law through [Odile Monod’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) (via u/bloominglace’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/)) and [Instagram Highlights](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTA0MjgzMTIwODUyNTQ4?story_media_id=2553999541407826596_1588058418) (via u/FrenchbunnyG’s [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/gvbbsmz) in the same post), I tried to find information about the laws surrounding SPF/PA testing for reformulated products in Japan (because I live in Japan and therefore use Japanese sunscreens) but kept getting a bunch of hits about testing methods in general, and gave up trying to sift through it all.\n\nThe only product I personally really care about is the Allie gel, so I wrote to Kanebo directly and asked whether they test their reformulated products individually, with the 2018 and 2020 formulas of the Allie gel as an example, or whether their test results are carried over across formulations. Their response as of April 26, 2021 is that they test each version separately (“SPF/PA値の測定に関しまして、それぞれ測定しております”).\n\nI don’t know whether the same goes for all companies in Japan or not, or even for all Kao/Kanebo brands, but that’s one less thing for Allie users to worry about.\n\n*—And after leaving this sitting in my drafts for a couple of weeks, I am adding that* u/ysy_heart *has posted* [*this*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) *about what the director of Japan Cosmetic Industry Association said about what their guidelines are on this subject.*\n\n# Hong Kong Consumer Council (October 2020)\n\nIn [the October 2020 report by the Hong Kong Consumer Council](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/jj0n81/sun_care_test_report_of_30_sunscreen_products/)^(E/TC) that everyone keeps referring to, the 2018 formula of the Allie gel (as seen in [the photo](https://imgur.com/seDmooL) published with the report) was rated SPF 61.7 PPD 9.8 (PA+++).\n\n*I’ll post a simplified version of [the results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(E/TC) in the comments, mostly for my own convenience.

However, the current standard for SPF testing in Japan is [ISO 24444:2019](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24444:ed-2:v1:en),^(E) effective as of February 21, 2020 according to [this notice](https://www.jcia.org/user/common/download/business/guideline/spf/SPF-jcia-r020221.pdf)^(J) (linked from [this page](https://www.jcia.org/user/business/guideline/spf)^(J)) issued by the [Japan Cosmetic Industry Association](https://www.jcia.org/en/)^(E) (JCIA)—or maybe it was also accepted before then? JCIA isn’t a government organization, by the way, so I don’t think they can actually enforce anything, but they seem to be in charge of setting industry-wide guidelines and work directly with the government in some capacity. Anyway, the same notice states that ISO 24444:2019 was issued in December 2019. The major changes between the 2010 and 2019 versions are listed in the Foreword of ISO 24444:2019:\n\n>— The definition of the minimal erythema response (MED) criteria has been revised.  \n>\n>— The choice of eligible test subjects is now based solely on individual typology angle (ITA°) with a requirement for the average ITA° for the test panel to be within the range 41° to 55°, with a minimum of three subjects within two of the three ITA° ranges.  \n>\n>— The ITA° is used to define the range of unprotected MED doses for the provisional or the test day unprotected MED determination (if no provisional MEDu determination is made).  \n>\n>— Three new reference standard sunscreens have been validated and added to the method to validate SPF test panels for products with SPF equal to 25 or higher (P5, P6 and P8).  \n>\n>— New test methods are provided to determine the uniformity of the beam of both large and small beam size solar simulators. A requirement for uniformity greater than or equal to 90 % has been added.  \n>\n>— Sunscreen application procedures have been described in greater detail.  \n>\n>— An informative Annex F has been added with photographic examples of erythema responses with guidelines for grading.  \n>\n>— The reporting tables in Annex G) and the requirements in Clause 11 have modified to provide more complete information on the results of the testing.  \n>\n>— The bibliography has been updated.\n\nThe notice from JCIA also lists most of these changes, with a few additional details. They point out for example that the Fitzpatrick skin type is being phased out as criteria for test subjects in favor of individual typology angle (ITA°), which will be relevant later in this post.\n\n*If you have no idea what an “individual typology angle” is (like me), it’s strictly based on skin color and seems much less open to interpretation than the Fitzpatrick skin type criteria. I found* [*this 2013 review article*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjd.12529)*^(PDF)* *in the* British Journal of Dermatology *really informative, though I admittedly have only skimmed through it very quickly.*\n\nIt’s possible that Eurofins just hasn’t updated their website, but I think this is what Michelle Ma Chan Mok-lan (Fancl) is talking about in the quote above about the HKCC report using testing methods from 2010. [Fancl Sunguard 50+ Protect UV](https://www.fancl-hk.com/product_details.asp?item_id=5685),^(TC) their product in the report (rated SPF 50+ PA++++ and tested at SPF 14.3 PPD 6.8 or PA++), was apparently released in [2018](https://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/10153767/top)^(J) in Japan, but according to the *South China Morning Post* article, “\\[Ma Chan\\] said that its product went through two rounds of testing by Cantor Research Laboratories in the United States in 2019 and the Chongqing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in China in 2017.” (Fancl also seems to point out that their product needs to be shaken before use in [this article](https://beauty.ulifestyle.com.hk/beauty/skincare/20099/fancl防曬-對消委會測試報告表示失望-強調產品完全符合標示-消委會就事件最新回應),^(TC) which could indeed potentially be something that affected the test results. I feel like it’s common knowledge among anyone that’s familiar with milk sunscreens at all, though, and I would hope that any lab conducting these tests would be aware of this. They also seem to say in the same article that any sunscreens that had extremely different test results should be re-tested in more than one lab, which is fair. But keep in mind that I’m reading a machine-translated version of the article for these observations.)\n\nI’m going to ignore the test run in China in 2017 because I believe it would have been following the so-called outdated testing methods, or ISO 24444:2010 (see the section titled “The Chinese version” below). [Cantor Research Laboratories](http://www.cantorlabs.com) basically just has their contact information on the website, so I can’t tell whether they would have conducted their test according to ISO 24444:2019, which would have been possible if the test took place in December. Cantor Research Laboratories was composed of 15 employees and specialized in anti-aging claims [as of 2016](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cen-09419-cover). *(They apparently do testing for Amway, a major MLM company, by the way; try googling* `\"Cantor Research Laboratories\" Amway study`*. —No, I don’t know whether that actally means anything, it’s just something I noticed.)* Eurofins Scientific on the other hand is composed of approximately 50,000 employees in 800 laboratories in 50 countries ([source](https://www.eurofins.com)), though I don’t have numbers for the Australian location specifically. I don’t know whether larger labs would necessarily produce more accurate results, but I would assume they generally wouldn’t be likely to be *less* accurate (or am I completely mistaken?). Interestingly, Dermatest, an Australian lab that was acquired by Eurofins ([source](https://dermatest.com.au)), lists Cantor Research Laboratories among their “Scientific Associates” on [their Links page](https://dermatest.com.au/information/links/). They also cite Cantor Research Laboratories’ Operating Procedure Manual on what appears to be another one of their factsheets, “No. 28 Antiperspirant Efficacy,” published on p. 12 of the February 2017 issue of *The Science of Beauty* (vol. 6 no. 7; [PDF](https://ascc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SOB-Feb2017.pdf)). On Eurofins’ Australian website, they instruct that samples should be sent to “Eurofins Dermatest,” located at the same address on the Dermatest website ([example](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/)), so I’m pretty sure we can think of them as the same entity. Clearly they know of Cantor Research Laboratories, and I wonder what they would say about the discrepancy.\n\nReturning to the *South China Morning Post* article, I assume that “the sampling of Australians for a product designed for Asians” is in reference to SPF testing, not PA testing, since the latter was *in vitro*. According to Eurofins’ [SPF Testing factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601368/spf-testing.pdf),^(PDF) their test subjects “consisted of fair skin individuals with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II or III” (p. 3). As mentioned above, ISO 24444:2019 no longer uses Fitzpatrick skin types as criteria for test subjects, so I think we can establish that the SPF results in the report cannot be compared directly with any SPF ratings based on ISO 24444:2019. There are however multiple sunscreens that were released before 2020 and would have been based on ISO 24444:2010.\n\nSo referring back to ISO 24444:2010, according to [this PDF from some time before 2013](https://www.tes-h.co.jp/documents/SPFPFA.pdf)^(J)—but I’m not sure whether it’s after 2010—Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III were part of the criteria for SPF test subjects (and types II, III, and IV for UVAPF). This would definitely be before 2010, but [this paper](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sccj1979/26/3/26_3_207/_article/-char/ja/)^(E/J) published by JCIA in 1992 also specifies Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III for SPF testing. As discussed below, the same goes for China as of 2015. So it seems like the Eurofins test subjects and test subjects in Japan and China (before ISO 24444:2019) would have the same Fitzpatrick Skin types, but Dr. Dray suggests in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGwjKOHq02w) (“Can we trust sunscreen? Korean SPF controversies,” April 30, 2021) that test subjects in different regions are likely to be skewed toward different skin tones. This is just speculation, but maybe it’s possible that more of the test subjects in Japan and China could have been types II and III, for instance, and more of the test subjects for the HKCC report could have been types I and II. (I’m guessing that this is what Professor Cheung means when he says that “the Eurofins report unfairly ran the tests on an Australian audience \\[…\\] given the products tested by the Consumer Council were formulated for Asian skin.”) In that case, while we absolutely couldn’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report, perhaps the report’s SPF ratings could possibly be pertinent if you have type I skin. But again, this is entirely speculative.\n\n**PA testing:** The Australian Eurofins website seems to confirm that their UVA tests are performed *in vitro*. I’m assuming they follow the [ISO 24443:2012](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24443:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vitro*), since they have [a factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601373/iso-24443-in-vitro-uvapf.pdf)^(PDF) for that too, linked from [this page](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/uva-tests/) on UVAPF testing. (ISO 24443:2012 is also mentioned at the bottom of [the report’s results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(TC) in footnotes 4 and 5, but I gave up on trying to figure out what it actually says.) In Japan, however, UVAPF testing is performed according to the [ISO 24442:2011](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24442:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vivo*). Eurofins themselves state in this factsheet that both the Japanese and Korean markets require *in vivo* testing, which they also point out is much more expensive than *in vitro* testing (p. 1). They also state that UVAPF ratings determined by these tests are considered **estimates** of Boots Star, FDA Broad Spectrum,\\* and JCIA UVAPF (= what most of us know as PA) ratings (p. 2).\n\n*\\* The FDA website says in vitro testing is accepted in accordance with* [*21 CFR 201.327(j)*](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b97fda59bb83d2742a276a215cdc115e&mc=true&node=se21.4.201_1327&rgn=div8)*, which I didn’t have the energy to actually read and am assuming is the same thing as Eurofins’ factsheet on* [*FDA Broad Spectrum Testing*](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601376/fda-broad-spectrum.pdf).*^(PDF)* *They say it’s based on ISO 24443:2012 but with “differing film thickness and pre-irradiation requirements” (p. 1).*\n\nIf the UVAPF testing for the HKCC report was indeed in accordance with ISO 24443:2012, I wouldn’t discredit the results entirely—but again, I’m not an expert. While we can’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report (same as the SPF ratings), it seems to me that the PPD ratings they give in the report could potentially be used to make comparisons with sunscreens from other countries where UVAPF ratings are also determined in accordance with the *in vitro* ISO 24443:2012 protocol, or at least with other results within the same report (though we would still have to keep in mind that “results reported from a single test should not be deemed conclusive”). Eurofins’ own factsheet suggests that ISO 24443:2012 is accepted in Australia, New Zealand, and the EU, but I haven’t done any research to back this up, and we have already seen that their factsheets might be outdated.\n\nThe next versions of [ISO 24442](https://www.iso.org/standard/75496.html)^(E) and [ISO 24443](https://www.iso.org/standard/75059.html)^(E) are about 40% through their respective development processes, by the way, so that’s something to keep an eye on if you’re looking into this stuff.\n\n**EDIT:** u/lovethewayyoulick has posted [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gycvnq4/) about the formulation of Allie sunscreens, specifically regarding Kao/Kanebo’s proprietary “[ADVAN Technology](https://www.kao.com/jp/skincare/surface/surface-02/),\" the name ADVAN coming from “Anti-Damaging uV-A Network.” In a nutshell, their sunscreens are designed to work with sebum to provide higher UVA protection, which would not be reproducible with standard *in vitro* testing. It also seems to explain why Allie sunscreens don't always do too well in casual experiments using light-sensitive materials (as I discuss in the section I had to delete for length posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyc9sqv/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). I’m now also thinking of other Japanese sunscreens that claim to work with different factors to increase their protection. Shiseido’s [Anessa](http://anessa.shiseido.co.jp/about/) sunscreens, for instance, advertise their “Thermo-Booster Technology” to work with heat and “Aqua-Booster Technology” to work with sweat and water. These product-specific factors may not necessarily be taken into account in third party testing.\n\n**Other possible issues:** Even after looking into all this (without actually reading all the publicly available details in each ISO… sorry, that’s beyond my mental capacity right now), I still don’t know whether the difference between the testing methods would really explain the larger disparities in the SPF results, like the Fancl sunscreen. I’ve seen some of you make a very good point that how old the bottle used for the test is (and I would assume things like storage conditions; last summer was a particularly hot one, and some supplements I ordered from the US arrived practically melted together in the bottle) or even the specific batch could potentially affect test results, too.\n\nFor more information about the actual testing methods, see [\\[Discussion\\]How SPF and PA are measured in Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mqysux/discussionhow_spf_and_pa_are_measured_in_japan/) by u/ysy_heart. (I want to note that the SPF testing methods described here are based on ISO 24444:2010 and have technically been phased out, but it seems general enough to be at least mostly applicable for ISO 24444:2019, too.)\n\n*—Phew, that was long! I keep seeing this report being mentioned, so I wanted to try my best to do my due diligence. I don’t have a background in science, though, and it’s my first time even actually looking at ISOs, so I’m sorry if I’m completely off.*\n\n# National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan (May 2020)\n\nIn another [report by the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/)^(E) published in May 2020, either the 2018 formula or the 2020 formula of the Allie gel (unclear) was confirmed to be SPF 50+ PA++++ in two out of two tests using a spectrophotometer, though I’m honestly skeptical of the general accuracy of these tests, seeing how four sunscreens claiming to be SPF 30–35 tested consistently at SPF 50+. I guess Japanese companies *could* plausibly be motivated to label their products with lower ratings than what they actually are, since many consumers here believe that high-SPF products are rough on your skin and can actively seek lower-SPF products for daily use, but as an amateur, it seems like it would be easier to actually make a low-SPF product if that’s what you want to sell.\n\nAgain, these tests were performed with an *entirely* different method, and I imagine their results can only be used to draw comparisons with other results in this same report, if anything at all. (For more information on the testing method, see u/ysy_heart’s research and thoughts in the link for the report.)  If there’s so much hubbub about the testing methods in the HKCC report, I’m sure testing with a spectrophotometer would be even further off. I want to give the NCACJ credit for at least running each test twice instead of just doing it once and being done with it, but I also don’t know whether running the spectrophotometer tests even a hundred times would necessarily be credible.\n\nAlso, although the HKCC report seems to have product name errors too (I’ll cut them some slack because they’re dealing with products from other countries, and the photo helps with product identification), I can definitively say that the report the NCACJ published has [some mistakes and ambiguities](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/gvsj5eh).^(E) This doesn’t necessarily mean that the tests themselves are equally faulty, but it does make me wary of any other potential mistakes in printing the test results.\n\n# The Chinese version\n\nThe Allie gel is also rated SPF 50+ PA++++ [in China](https://allie.cn)^(SC) (and SPF 45 PA++++ after being immersed in water according to [their official TMall page](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a212k0.12153887.0.0.1a67687dAgrr3k&id=596686898582),^(SC) if I’m interpreting “浴后防晒指数” correctly), where they require testing at National Medical Product Administration (NMPA) accredited labs in China, as well as additional *in vivo* testing ([source](https://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Article/2019/08/19/Sunscreen-regulations-in-the-world-from-European-Union-USA-Canada-to-China)^(E)). The NMPA-approved testing methods seem to be detailed in [this 11 MB PDF](https://www.nmpa.gov.cn/directory/web/nmpa/images/MjAxNcTqtdoyNji6xbmruOa4vbz+LnBkZg==.pdf)^(SC) of their Safety and Technical Standards for Cosmetics (2015), SPF testing from p. 546 and PA or PFA testing from p. 554. I’ve given up on trying to decipher everything, but it appears that their SPF testing either follows or is based on ISO 24444:2010 (so it might have been updated by now), using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III, and their PA testing either follows or is based on ISO 24442:2011, using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types III and IV.\n\nInitially I was satisfied in thinking of this as another separate test performed on the Allie gel, but then it occurred to me that I don’t know whether the Chinese version has the same formulation as the Japanese version or not, though I assume they would at least be very similar. [Based on the packaging](https://imgur.com/a/WbH2gAS),^(E) I’m guessing that the current version there is basically equivalent to Allie Extra UV Gel (the 2018 formula in Japan). [This page](https://www.jeebei.com/pingce/hufupin/ql1z6.html) lists the ingredients as follows:\n\n> 水，乙醇，氧化锌，三乙氧基辛基硅烷，甲氧基肉桂酸乙基己酯，丁羟甲苯，甘油三（乙基己酸）酯，异壬酸异壬酯，丙烯酸钠/丙烯酰二甲基牛磺酸钠共聚物，异十六烷，聚山梨醇酯-80，丁二醇，甘油，双-乙基己氧苯酚甲氧苯基三嗪，乙基己基三嗪酮，聚二甲基硅氧烷，黄原胶，EDTA 二钠，水解胶原，苯氧乙醇，透明质酸钠\n\nThis translates to:\n\n> Water, Ethanol, Zinc Oxide, Trimethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, BHT, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\nThis is the ingredient list for the Japanese 2018 formula, according to the packaging of a tube I bought in a major drugstore in Japan:\n\n> Water, Zinc Oxide, Ethanol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen\n\n*Both are my own translations and I don’t have a background in chemistry. Also, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate = Octinoxate, Ethylhexyl Triazone = Uvinul T 150, and Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine = Tinosorb S.*\n\nObviously, the order of the ingredients differ, but I don’t know whether China has the same rules about the order of the ingredients or not. One definitively different point, though, is that the Chinese version contains Phenoxyethanol and the Japanese version doesn’t. So while I can’t say how different or similar the two versions might be, it’s clear that they aren’t exactly the same.\n\nIt’s been pointed out that the [Bioré UV Athlizm essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-athlizm-skin-protect-essence/)^(E) and the [Bioré UV Aqua Rich gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-gel-2019/)^(E) and [essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-essence-2019/)^(E) are all rated SPF 50+ PA+++ [in China](https://www.kao.com/cn/products/biore/),^(SC) and not SPF 50+ PA++++ as they are rated in Japan, but since they are sold ~~(and possibly manufactured)~~ locally by Kao (China) Holding Co., Ltd. rather than as import products from Japan, you would have to consider the possibility that they may not necessarily have the same formulation as the Japanese equivalents.\n\n**EDIT:** I’ve just figured out that the Chinese versions of the Allie gel and Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence are made in Japan with different formulations specifically for the Chinese market. See links re: each product [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyhq3fu).\n\nSimilarly, RatzillaCosme says in a comment on [this page](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-gel-spf50-4-plus/) that “Rohto products that are marketed for outside of Japan have different ingredients/formulas than Japan’s and they’re not Japan-made (despite the Japanese printed). If the Japanese version is what you want, both the packaging and product name need to be exactly the same as what \\[is\\] shown in my site.” They also say in a comment [here](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-essence-2020/) in response to an inquiry about [Sunplay Skin Aqua](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/index.shtml) Watery Essence SPF 50+ PA++++ (I’m not sure but possibly [this](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-75.shtml)^(SC)), “That product isn’t Japanese — it’s made in China by a different company. It isn’t produced by Rohto Pharmaceutical in Japan.” (Credit goes to someone on this sub for mentioning that Ratzilla talks about this in their comments section. I’m sorry I can’t remember who it was.) Going back to the HKCC report, the results table says that [Sunplay Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-72.shtml)^(SC) is manufactured in China (in addition to the “Sunplay” in the product name already being a giveaway; in Japan, [Mentholatum Sunplay](https://jp.rohto.com/uv-sunplay/) is a separate Rohto brand alongside Skin Aqua, so “Sunplay Skin Aqua” doesn’t exist), so the results in the report would not necessarily be applicable for the Japanese product, not to mention the other concerns I discussed.\n\nSo the situation arises where there are products that aren’t “fake” but also aren’t exactly the same thing as what’s sold in Japan, kind of like how the American versions of LRP sunscreens wouldn't contain their more advanced filters (which is probably more drastic of a difference than what I’m discussing here). This might be especially important for anyone buying the product from non-Japanese vendors. Double check to make sure you’re getting the version you intended to buy—and if you specifically wanted the non-Japanese version, that’s great too. Like [the American and Japanese Curél Intensive Moisture Creams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/labr3m/difference_between_japanese_and_american_version/), it’s possible that the end result (the user experience) is pretty much the same anyway, but in the case of sunscreen, make sure you know what the SPF/PA rating is for the exact version you’re buying.\n\n# Using sunscreens from major corporations\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNsoPyo1PjA)^(J) posted on March 26, 2020, skinfluencer Arata Tomori says that SPF testing is usually outsourced to a third party lab, and that PA testing is often performed in-house (I haven’t looked into this). She says that different labs can come up with different results, and based on her own past experience with trying to make a sunscreen (I think she has her own skincare line), she has heard of labs that are actually known to give higher SPF ratings. She recommends that we stick with major corporations that are more likely to be working with labs that would provide accurate results.\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTS0Xd-T97s)^(J) posted on March 28, 2020, cosmetic chemist YouTuber Sumisho discusses issues with SPF ratings in general, with the AMA Laboratories case in the US as an example. He says we should be careful with smaller brands, and advises that it’s a good idea to pick products that are made by major corporations that put a lot into sunscreen R&D. He also advises that products sold in China go through additional testing and could be more reliable, and that you could check Tmall for listings, but I want to add again that you would need to make sure you’re looking at the version you want.\n\nOdile Monod also breaks down the difference between OBM, OEM, and ODM products in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) I mentioned earlier. Although she’s talking about the Korean beauty industry, I think this part probably applies for other countries, too, and she advises that it’s (not necessarily foolproof but) a good idea to pick OBM products that are formulated and manufactured in-house.\n\nAnd now [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) about the response u/ysy_heart got from the JCIA director can be interpreted to back up this approach as well. I’m generally in favor of indie brands in spirit, and usually I would think more about how these people might be benefiting from making these claims, but I do see how major corporations would have a lot more to lose from these sunscreen scandals. I also don’t think I’ve seen companies like Amorepacific (for instance) mentioned in connection with the recent scandal in Korea.\n\nI’m still looking up different sunscreens and who actually manufactures them, but the Kao Group (including Kanebo), the Kosé Group, the Pola Orbis Group, the Rohto Group, and the Shiseido Group are some major Japanese corporations that seem to generally have OBM products. I have a huge spreadsheet in progress that I plan on sharing whenever I think it’s ready, with specific products from these companies (and others) and some properties I wanted to compare.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nIf you’re *really* concerned about the accuracy of SPF/PA ratings, I guess the truly thorough approach would be to look at as many tests as possible. You could either stick with the sunscreens that consistently do well in third party testing (guilty until proven innocent) or avoid those that consistently do poorly (innocent until proven guilty).\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it just isn’t realistic, especially considering how frequently Japanese sunscreens are reformulated. A test result from last year might not be applicable for a product that was reformulated this year. You would have to make sure where the product tested was manufactured and what year it was released, and then there are the potential issues with storage conditions and different batches, etc. Also, “real” testing is expensive, and it’s not all that likely that there would be multiple credible third party tests following official protocols performed on the same formulation.\n\nAs Professor Tong says in the *South China Morning Post* article, we should probably accept that no single test is going to be an absolutely definitive one. Personally, with regard to what I’m already using, if it’s keeping my sun allergy symptoms from showing up, that’s good enough for me—but I guess you could say that I have the advantage (?) of my face being a hypersensitive UV meter of sorts. As for any products I might try in the future, I’m going to keep trusting the ratings as they are claimed unless there’s a scandal specifically involving that product. We *are* already taking a kind of leap of faith in trusting that the product is otherwise safe to use and that the ingredient list is correct and so on. And regardless of any tests results, even good ones, I would make sure to apply plenty, to reapply, and to avoid relying on sunscreen alone, especially if I’m going to be outside for an extended amount of time.",

I’ve been living in Japan for over 10 years, and am under the impression that the general consensus among Japanese consumers is that you use either Anessa or Allie if you don’t want to tan/burn, Anessa being top-level protection and Allie coming in second while also being easier on your skin. (This seems to specifically be based on Anessa’s [flagship milk](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/anessa-perfect-uv-sunscreen-skincare-milk-a-2020/)^(E) and Allie’s gel products, even though Anessa also has gels and Allie also has a milk.)\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean they’re absolutely the best sunscreens in the entire Japanese market, of course—the products discussed on this sub represent just a small fraction of all the sunscreens available in Japan—nor do I know how they would really compare with European sunscreens (which I’ve never used, aside from a couple of Asia/Australia-specific LRP products), but it does suggest that they must at least be among the best that are commonly available in drugstores nationwide.\n\nAllie sunscreens seem to do well in those completely unscientific experiment memes where people apply a ton of different sunscreens on their backs and lay out in the sun:\n\n|**Video/Article**|**Sunscreens and UV source**|**Conclusion**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sunameri for Kakaku.com, [人気の日焼け止め10種を徹底比較！ 日サロで肌を焼いて効果を確かめてみた](https://kakakumag.com/houseware/?id=11834), January 14, 2019|10 sunscreens including Allie Extra UV Gel (2018 formula);

    "body": "After the snowpocalypse fiasco that resulted in loss of running water for us, I spent a lot of time researching hand washing as clean clothing was our biggest source of discomfort. Oddly (or maybe not oddly) there really isn’t a lot of information out there about proper techniques/routines to keep your clothes/linens clean without the use of a machine. Most of what I did find was basically people just throwing shit in their bathtub. So on an experimental level I’ve been hand washing clothes to varying degrees for my entire family for several months now and I thought I’d share some insights related to that. ERCOT is asking Texans to not use their appliances, but there are other scenarios where you might not have access to a machine for an extended period of time (and frankly, I’ve discovered that it works a lot better for my family of 4 this way but I won’t evangelize on it). \n\n#Reducing wash frequency \n\n* this really goes without saying, but you do not have to wash every item of clothing every time you wear it. You can use a lint brush and a quick spray of fabric refresher (diy is just a little bit of fabric softener diluted with water in a spray bottle), or just quickly removing a stain rather than washing the entire garment. The obvious exception is underwear. \n\n* change clothes throughout the day. Do not lounge in your jammies all day. \n\n* wear full undergarments such as undershirts/camisoles, slips, boxers, etc to prevent your outside clothing from being in a lot of contact with your skin/sweat/oils \n\n* linens such as towels/sheets/blankets should be aired frequently and prevented from being or staying moist. Use a sheet set and/or a duvet. Sheets are much easier to keep clean than sweating on a comforter. Use a protector on your mattress and pillows so that only the top fabrics get dirty. \n\nNow I realize that specifically with regards to the south, it’s hot and we sweat, so people are averse to some of these suggestions. By experimentation I assure you it’s more comfortable to wear a specialized material that is close fitting (many undergarments are designed to be cooling or sweat wicking) and then loose, longer material on top. Listen, clothing styles in the Middle East are the way they are for good reason. \n\n\n#Washing \n\n* treat stains first. Rinse the stain with cool water and *then* apply (preferably with a soft bristled brush) stain remover. The longer it sits, usually the better, but the sooner you treat it the easier it will come out with water alone. \n\n* modern detergents are incredibly powerful. This is not like the 1800’s where you had to beat your clothing on rocks and try to get dirt out by force of water alone. Detergents will readily dissolve and lift dirt, oil and stains without hardly any agitation at all. Give your “load” a 30 minute soak and then you can agitate for a minute or two to knock everything out and you can honestly call it good. \n\n* how much detergent? Really depends on what you’re using, but in general I’d say about a tablespoon per gallon of water is more than sufficient. \n\n* using a bucket or a collapsible sink is a helluva lot easier than trying to do this in a bathtub. \n\n* if you’re going to do this a lot, I highly recommend wearing gloves\n\n* for garments that are truly dirty, scrub/agitate along the seam lines, necklines, and hem lines. This can be done along a wash board but you can also just rub the fabric together in those areas or scrub with your laundry brush. \n\n* since you’re doing small quantities, you’re free to use highly specialized detergents or to run different “cycles” manually as you see fit. For instance you might be doing 2-3 towels and some pillowcases, run a “wash” cycle, rinse and then let the items soak in a sanitizing solution before your second rinse. \n\n* the amount of “loads” you can do simultaneously is really only limited by the amount of containers you have. You can do delicates, linens, regular clothes and athletic gear all at once with custom detergents and water temperatures, and most of the work is really just separating stuff out. You also don’t have to wait for a “full” load of clothes to accumulate. Have plenty of containers if you have multiple people’s stuff to deal with. \n\n* Do not wring water out of your garments. Remove excess water by pressing. You’ll want to press after washing and before rinsing to remove as much soap as you can and spare yourself 3-4 rinse refills, and obviously before you hang stuff up to dry.\n\n* if you can’t soak for some reason, you can make up for soak time with manual agitation/scrubbing. In a pinch you can wash an entire bucket in under 10 minutes and have things clean and up drying (or in the dryer if you have that option). \n\n#routines \n\n* if you want to do this for more than just yourself, you really have to wash something every day. Compared to machine washing this is actually pretty painless — just throw some stuff in a bucket and let it soak. If you forget, it’s probably fine and can sit for a day before you rinse it (although I would not recommend soaking things together for long periods where the dye might run, such as jeans)\n\n* at the end of the day, collect what you’ve used, decide what can be refreshed or hung up, treated for stains or given a full wash. In my experience this usually means I only have to wash or treat a small bucket of stuff. This takes me, on average, less than 15 minutes to deal with (for 4 people, and most of that time is dedicated to food stains cause kids. If you have a different arrangement it might be more/less time), with maybe an additional 5 at a later point to rinse/hang/fold/dry. Basically all of my laundry has been clean and away 100% of the time unless it’s actively soaking or drying. \n\n* washing machines can still be great for bulk items like comforters and heavy duty fabrics like jeans or canvas. That stuff actually is a pain, so I highly recommend limiting how much you wear/use those things if you can. \n\n* very small items like socks and underwear I usually let accumulate for a few days. \n\n* larger items like towels/sheets usually get relegated to a weekly effort. \n\n* if you do happen to have a washing machine available, I’m rather fond of throwing all my washed clothes together for a rinse and spin which actually does reduce my labor and cut drying time, but that’s a very short low-energy use of my washing machine in comparison to trying to run multiple full loads on different cleaning cycles. \n\n\n#best tools \n\n* a variety of buckets/containers\n* rubber gloves \n* dedicated soft-bristled laundry brush \n* enzymatic and surfactant based stain remover \n* lint brush. NOT the sticky paper thing \n* fabric shaver \n* fabric refreshing spray (or make your own)\n* good airflow where you need stuff to dry. \n* oxyclean and fabric sanitizer (unless you want to boil and/or bleach)\n\nI think I pretty much covered everything but I’m happy to answer any questions.\n\n#edit \n\nOn manual washers/plungers/other devices. You can use these. However, they require you to manually plunge/crank/whatever until you feel like your clothes are sufficiently clean. IMO, it’s time consuming and labor intensive. Personally I find this to be a waste of both time and money compared to just sitting back and letting modern chemistry work its magic. As I said, I really don’t manually agitate except right before rinsing and *maybe* just to disperse the detergent and fully wet my load. Otherwise, I promise you can walk away from it and it will get clean without you having to babysit it, unless your garment is spectacularly filthy, in which case a fairly minor amount of scrubbing will take care of the rest without fooling with a hand crank device.\n\n#edit 2: clarifications and additional tips (some in comments, others that have come to mind)\n\nWhy I suggest not wringing clothes: Because particularly natural fibers such as cotton are more fragile when wet and you run the risk of warping the fabric or outright creating weak spots that will end up tearing.\n\nIn order to press fabric: Just squish. You can squish them into a ball, squish them against a flat surface like the side of the bucket, or squeeze parts of them in your fist. Just kind of depends on how big it is. I looked for a mangle solution but I really didn’t find one within a reasonable price range.\n\n* I do wring towels and such. I just wouldn’t do that on anything more delicate than say...tshirt fabric. Mildew and long dry times aren’t going to be an issue on fabrics that are thinner. A sweater might be trickier, but rolling it in a dry towel is usually the solution to that.\n\n* If you have something that has a lot of mud and dirt on it, I have another tip for you! Make sure you wait until your clothes are dry of sweat/mud and then manually knock the clothing against a wall or whatever. I use my porch railing. You want to get as much loose material and dust as you can out of it first before you wash so you only have to deal with the dirt that’s embedded in the fibers. Adding washing soda (not baking soda) to your detergent can help because it increases the suds and the suds are really what helps lift the dirt out. Red clay stains a lot…don’t even bother trying to get it out unless you have powdered Iron Out (which has a high chance of bleaching your stuff), so I’d pick shades of clothing that won’t show it as much. I allow my kids to be wildlings soooo I’ve been down this road lol.\n\n* you can also cut down on dry cleaning by hand washing, fyi. Check the fabric content because some materials truly can’t be put in water, but a lot of stuff labeled “dry clean” really just shouldn’t be put through a washer, but can be hand-treated. \n\n* I prefer Fels Naphtha bars over castille soap if you’re minimalist because it’s very easy to find, very cheap, and removes stains better. That being said, because such a small amount of detergent is required it’s really not outrageous to spend money on specialty detergents and just mix and match stuff based on what you’re washing. The right detergent for the job at hand can save you a lot of manual scrubbing. \n\n* oil based stains should be removed with a surfactant stain remover (as in soap. As another user mentioned, dawn dish detergent works wonders. I will say I’ve had the blue stuff stain so I’d recommend the dye free. For extra oomph the power wash spray stuff is bae). Enzyme stain removers work best on food stains, grass, etc. Otherwise, a healthy scoop of oxyclean solves most problems. \n\n* if your clothes are stained, never apply hot water until you’ve gotten the vast majority of the stain out, otherwise you’ll run the risk of setting it. Applies *especially* to anything oil based. If you do have an extremely set-in grease stain, you can use polysorbate 80 (readily available via amazon) as a last resort. It’s very safe. All it is is an emulsifier often used in cosmetics.",

But there's a high probability that you're either sleeping or at work which is why when people get off work demand usually peaks.\n\nPeople are shocked when you say do your laundry before the hurricane comes. Running a modern high efficiency washing machine takes away less energy than doing it by hand. Although it's good to have a plan for when modern conveniences aren't available.

I had previously bought a [Scrubba wash bag](https://thescrubba.com/) for doing laundry when I was traveling and it has done the job quite well over the past year. The bag has one side with plastic nubs which helps to get the dirt out (I had tried hand washing laundry without the bag and it was much more work than I had expected to get all the dirt out). The downsides are that it is quite small, quite expensive, and that it can take a lot of water to use. I have come up with a system where I reuse the washing water and rinsing water between loads with the use of additional buckets. Long story short, the Scrubba is something I can vouch for, and it's best for folks who have a little laundry to do every day that has a lot of dirt to get out, especially if a portable laundry system might be useful for them in the future.\n\nSomeone mentioned using Dr Bronner's soap. I do that as well but I have found that I miss that \"clean laundry\" smell. Dr Bronner's soap smells lovely while it is being used and then the smell fades away quite quickly after being rinsed. So I now use a mix of Dr Bronner's with a dollop of laundry detergent and that does the trick. Might also be worth noting that I tend to get the soap bars and use a cheese grater to grate them into shavings. Before doing that, I'd always wear down the soap until it was a just a small piece left that just never seemed to get used up.",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), *Australian* websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it, but it can come out a bit forcefully sometimes.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** **Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\nI hope these reviews were useful :)",

I would only trust claims I can see after using a product. \n\n\nAs far as I know, topical creams cannot generate collagen production. Collagen is created from the foods you eat. I’m not even sure you can take collagen supplements to increase collagen production because everything in your body is broken down in the same way and your body will direct the amino acids to where the body needs it most and not where you might want it.",

    "body": "# Background\n\nSkinceuticals CE Ferulic is considered the best vitamin c serum that money can buy in the skincare market today. In fact, many people have sweared by the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, claiming that it makes a larger difference in their skin compared to other vitamin c alternatives. At $166 per oz, it's not as easily accessible by the average consumer. The reason why it's so expensive is because Skinceuticals currently holds the patent for the perfect ratio of vitamin c, vitamin e, and ferulic acid needed to optimize the effectiveness of vitamin c.\n\nThe \"golden ratio\" is **15% L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**, **1% Vitamin E (Tocopherol)**, and **0.5% Ferulic Aced** with a pH level between **2.5 - 3.0**. Skinceuticals CE Ferulic is also **fungal acne safe**.\n\nGiven the price, there have been a lot of posts and comments asking for dupes of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: This post is not sponsored. I used my own money to purchase Skinceuticals and Dr.Brenner for the advancement of skincare data.**\n\n## Why should I use Vitamin C?\n\nI'm not going to go into this too much since that's not really the focus of the post, but you can read more about the research behind Vitamin C here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin\\_c\\_recs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin_c_recs)\n\n## Popular Dupes\n\nThere are some well known popular dupes of Skinceuticals out in the skincare market today. Keep in mind, none of the dupes listed will have the exact same formulation as Skinceuticals due to the patent. Below are some popular dupes and the differences it has with Skinceuticals.\n\n**Paula's Choice C15 Booster**\n\n[Link](https://www.paulaschoice.com/c15-super-booster/777.html)\n\nPrice: \\~$65/oz\n\nDisclaimer: I have not tried this product.\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Paula's Choice C15 Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water (Aqua), Ascorbic Acid, Butylene|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Glycerin,|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Castor Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Tocopherol,|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Norleucine Acetate, Lecithin, Ferulic|\n||Acid, Panthenol, Bisabolol, Oryza Sativa|\n||(Rice) Bran Extract, Propyl Gallate,|\n||Sodium Gluconate, Sodium Hydroxide,|\n||Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.|\n\nPaulas's Choice claims that this a **15% Vitamin C formula, 1% Vitamin E,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid** at pH of **3.1**.

They also claim that it is at a pH of 2.5–3. NuFountain **is fungal acne safe**.\n\nMini Review: I did not see any difference using this vitamin c product for a few months, so I discontinued its use.\n\n# Skin(care) Background\n\nI have Asian, sensitive, combination hormonal/acne prone skin. I have lots of PIE due to old acne and lots of freckles and sun damage on my skin due to the fact that I've lived in Hawaii for most of my life.\n\n## Current Routine\n\nMorning:\n\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n* Shiseido SPF40 Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n* La Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash\n* Tretinoin 0.1% cream\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n\nTret has made my skin extra sensitive. For example, my skin is now unable to use the Cerave hydrating cleanser due to how sensitive it is. The La Roche Posay cleanser is the only non irritating cleaner I can use now that I am on Tret.\n\nI have tried multiple Vitamin C products on my skin over the years. Specifically, I've tried Melano CC, NuFountain C20, The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension, and Philosophy Vitamin C Powder.\n\nI have never been able to spot any visible improvement whenever I started using *any* brand of Vitamin C on my skin.\n\n# Review\n\nThere's quite a number of reviews between Skinceuticals CE Ferulic VS Timeless 20% Vitamin C and Paula's Choice C15 if you make a quick Google search. I didn't want to add to those stats as I think there's enough data there. This post is mainly going to review Skinceuticals CE Ferulic vs Dr.Brenner's 20% Vitamin C Serum. In my opinion, Dr.Brenner is the closest dupe, ingredients wise, to Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.\n\n## Packaging\n\n[Packaging](https://preview.redd.it/y21w3rkgcmi51.jpg?width=1433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=440c465d015a4ab5b9a285ece3ca393f24c7b33a)\n\nSkinceuticals came in a blue paper box, wrapped in plastic. The actual bottle is pretty opaque, but would definitely still allow light through given that it's glass and I was able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nDr.Brenner's came with the glass bottle wrapped in plastic. The bottle was just as opaque as Skinceuticals, and I was also able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nThe general guidance for both is to store in a cool, dry place. I've also read online that Vitamin C should be exposed to as little light as possible. Given that, I think Skinceutical's does a better job protecting the product until it gets to the consumer's home given the paper casing. For Dr.Brenner, it's possible for it to be exposed to light while waiting for it to be packaged and sent. However, they do claim on Amazon that they create their Vitamin C serum every 2 weeks to make sure it's fresh.\n\nI stored both of mine in a cupboard, so they're both only exposed to light when I take it out and use it. However, I kept my Skinceuticals in the paper casing while I stored it in the cupboard.\n\n## Product\n\n**Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-L-Ascorbic-Hyaluronic-Dr-Brenner/dp/B07ZG28M2S/)\n\nPrice: $24.99/oz\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water, Ethoxydiglycol,|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Propylene|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|Glycol, Glycerin, Laureth-23,|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Sodium|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Ferulic Acid, Panthenol,|\n||Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol|\n\nAs you can see, the ingredients used in Dr.Brenner is the same as Skinceuticals, although the ordering seems to be different. Dr.Brenner claims that the ratio is **20% Vitamin C, 1% Vitamin E, 1% Hyaluronic Acid,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid**. Unfortunately, I do not know the pH nor do I have anything to find out the pH of Dr.Brenner. Dr.Brenner **is fungal acne safe**.\n\n## Method\n\nI applied Skinceuticals to the left side of my face, and Dr.Brenner to the right side of my face every morning for 1 month, adjusting for irritation. I also applied the same sunscreen to my entire face after applying the vitamin c serums.\n\n## Thoughts\n\n**Skinceuticals CE Ferulic**\n\nThis has a really strong hot dog smell. The reviews are spot on about this. It really does smell like I'm rubbing hot dog water on my face. The serum is a pale yellow. The texture is slightly more viscous than Dr.Brenner's. The best way I can describe it is that it has the texture of thick water.\n\n**Dr.Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\nThis has a faint hot dog smell, not as strong as Skinceuticals. The texture is not as thick as Skinceuticals, it's more runny and has a closer texture to water, possibly due to the higher hyaluronic acid content. The coloring is a lighter yellow than Skinceuticals.\n\nMy before pictures are from when I applied the Vitamin C serums for the first time on each side. My after pictures are 1 month after daily morning application of the Vitamin C serums.\n\nI found that the Dr.Brenner serum is more irritating on my skin than Skinceuticals. I found that the side where I usually apply the Dr.Brenner serum usually gets more red and irritable compared to the Skinceuticals side. However, this only happens when my skin needs a break from Tret, and the irritation usually goes away if I take a break from Tret for a day.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\n[Before Front](https://preview.redd.it/pu2biihlcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fc6d699da9c03071fedefbf839616465bddf31b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/pbx6am5ncmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8781476d62dbbf083a306021e119563fd226742)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Dr. Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/yr2ofgzocmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be97af34e9328346fb0b41825bf547bce93c3c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Front](https://preview.redd.it/b6v0kgoqcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c50ddcdda52d39e8b434fe78d1e0147ff35c41b7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/wajzo5zrcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cee0f78bdf18dfe3bd284ed2406eb1b08e753b53)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Dr.Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/24ub6lbtcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a7c5406f55dd31b8823a9ff2a62cba875f2ce29)\n\nResults wise, both sides look pretty similar to me, with the Skinceuticals side looking a bit better. However, this could be due to the fact that I just had more acne scarring on the Dr.Brenner side than the Skinceuticals side. Given the fact that I don't think the difference between the two sides is all that large and my experience with them is mostly similar, I would go for the Dr.Brenner serum and probably apply it every other day. However, if you don't have sensitive skin like mine, I still would recommend Dr.Brenner's serum over Skinceuticals. The reason being that I just don't see *that* large of an improvement from Skinceuticals over Dr.Brenner to justify the 8x price tag. The ingredients are also *very* similar, with the only difference being that Dr.Brenner has more hyaluronic acid.",

    "body": "Hi. I'm Heather Simpson. You probably don't know who I am, because I am a nobody to most people. But back in 2019 and the beginning of 2020, I was a viral anti-vaccine \"influencer.\" Let me explain.\n\nI was fully vaccinated as a child. In 2011 I barely poked myself with antique jewelery and I ran to my doctor's office to get a tetanus shot. I was pro vaccine because I was raised to be. My parents are awesome.\n\nAnd then one day....fear crept in. It came in the form of an advertisement dedicated to an anti-vaccine documentary series. My husband and I wanted kids, and I knew this subject was important, so I caved and dumped $200 into the series. 😳\n\nThe series, as you can imagine, described how vaccines are linked to almost every single bad condition you can think of. And, as a young woman preparing to enter motherhood, I didn't know any better. They fed me fear and I ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I was, from that point on, convinced that vaccines could and would cause autism, SIDS, autoimmune diseases, and death in general.\n\nI continued to study anti vaccine theories. You can find anything you want to support your claim, if only you set your mind to it. And boy did I find some things. I mostly found an abundance of fear based stories that terrified me. I decided I was never letting a vaccine near my child or I. \n\nEver.\n\nWhen my child was born in 2017, we gave her the vitamin k shot (which I was scolded by some anti-vaxxers for, and was told it caused her to have health issues) and we opted to give her no vaccines. I was confident in our decision, and so was my husband.\n\nWhen she was about 18 months old, or the Winter of 2019, I started posting on Facebook about my vaccine hesitancy. To be honest, that was a lie, as I was not \"hesitant\"...I KNEW I didn't like vaccines. But I figured looking \"hesitant\" would make me seem less crazy. When I first posted my views and hesitations on vaccines, my post got shared several hundred times.\n\nI was shocked. Friend requests started pouring in. I didn't know what was happening. So I kept posting my views on vaccines, people kept sharing my posts, and my audience grew. It was wild and completely unexpected. I had no idea that this world of anti-vaccine moms and dads existed on social media.\n\nThey were so supportive and I made life long friends that I will always treasure. This whole experience was worth it if not just for the friends I made.\n\nFast forward to October of 2019 when I dressed as the measles because I was \"trying to think of the least scary thing I could be for Halloween.\" Yall, I am taking this moment to openly tell you I was the worst. \n\nThe. Actual. Worst.\n\nIt didn’t even look like measles. It looked like syphilis.\n\nAnd then it went viral. Like, real viral.\n\nIt blew up on both Facebook and Reddit, and several national news oulets picked it up. I got death threats and people begged me to kill myself. It was bad. I did it to myself and I should never have dressed as something so heartless, but it was bad. I was shaken up quite a bit.\n\nA few months later, however, Febraury of 2020 arrived. I started to feel different about things. I was relying on western medicine to treat my endometriosis, I had just had surgery, and had been studying vaccines from a different standpoint. I started to soften my anti-vax views. But when I posted about this softening of my views, a lot of the anti-vax crowd lost it on me. They were furious and just plain cruel. \n\nIt was then that I realized a lot of them are very cult-like, because they will cast you out if you don't have an identical belief system as them. Don't get me wrong, there are MANY of them that are not this way, in whom I love and adore. But a LOT of them are militant about their anti-vax beliefs. They claim to be \"pro medical freedom\" but will tear you apart if you choose a different medical decision than them. \n\nThey bullied me so hard that I ended up in the ER with a panic attack. It was one of the worst weeks of my life....all because I was softening my views on vaccines. \n\nAnd then they \"cancelled\" me. Ohhhh, that online cancel culture. Gotta love it. \n\nBut, if I'm being honest, it turned out to be one of the biggest blessings. Because I then had time to read, think, study and grow on my own without the \"group think\" influencing me.\n\nAnd here I am now, planning to get my flu shot next week. I will also be getting my COVID vaccine. We will also be following our pediatrician's recommended vaccine schedule for our toddler. (I will not be discussing details as it is her private medical record.)\n\nHOW DID I GET HERE?! \n\nThat's really why you're reading this article, after all. So, allow me to explain the magic that happened in those months of studying after being “cancelled.”\n\nFirst of all, when approaching an anti-vaxxer, you have to realize that there are usually three types. Typically, one is a conspiracy theorist, one is scared, and one is an ex-vaxxer. Sometimes they are all three. Sometimes they are none of these. Each person is unique, but these are the three categories I’ve typically observed. Depending on what catergory they fall into is going to help you to know how to approach then.\n\nMy category? I was scared. Terrified. I did not want to inject something into my child if I thought it was going to kill her. I wanted to protect my baby with my life. This is most anti-vaxxers I know. They are fiercely protective of their children, just like pro-vaxxers, and only want to keep them safe. \n\nAnd, to clarify, this is not a bad person versus good person debate. There are incredible parents on both sides. \n\nBut I digress. I kept reading horrifying anecdotes from moms who would say that their baby died the day after vaccines. Or that their baby stopped talking the week later. Or that their baby stopped walking the month after. \n\nWhat finally caused me to start to question my anti-vax beliefs was when I started digging into each of these anectdotes to find the real truth, instead of blindly trusting stories. I found some of them to be true, definitely. But...I started to see that a lot of the \"vaccine deaths\" were actually due to co-sleeping accidents or other underlying conditions. The timing was just very, very unfortunate. The whole situation was sad. But vaccines inevitably took the blame. \n\nAnd sometimes the vaccine DID cause the baby's death or disability. Vaccines have never claimed to be 100% safe. Sometimes your baby is one of the rare statistics. Which makes it even harder to have discernment when reading anecdotes and trying not to be overcome with fear.\n\nI got to a point where I was so engulfed in every anecdote, that I lost my ability to critically think about a situation past my emotions. I would read a story, feel sick to my stomach, and swear to never vaccinate my child.\n\nBut the problem is, anectdotes without proof can get out of hand quickly in the hands of social media. Susie could have broken her leg on the swingset the day after her tetanus shot, but the way Susie's mom told it on social media was that Susie got her shot, and now she can't walk. Then this post gets spread 20,000 times. You now have a bunch of parents not wanting their child to get the tetanus shot because of COURSE they don't want to risk their child losing their ability to walk.\n\nI was told that my child's sleep apnea was due to her Vitamin K shot, and that her heart arrythmia was due to the vaccines I received in my childhood. If someone develops an autoimmune disease 15 years after their vaccines, some anti-vaxxers will still blame the vaccines. People need a reason explaining why they are sick. People need a reason their kid is sick. Vaccines are the perfect scapegoat, no matter how long it has been since they received them.\n\nThe next thing that started pulling me away from the anti-vaccine movement was VAERS. Also known as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. There was something like 48,000 events registered in 2019 alone. But here's the deal: parents can report anything with no proof. Causation does not have to be established to make the list. \n\nFor example, these are real documented events on VAERS:\n\nGunshot wound, fight in school, frostbite, infection of mites, electric shock from a hair straightener, drowning, damaged hair from incorrect hair bleach mixture, sunburn, tested positive for an STD, sports injury (dodge ball), sports injury (football), suicidal ideation due to breakup with boyfriend, murder, motor vehicle accident, and many, many more.\n\nSome anti-vaxxers use VAERS as one of their strongest arguments, but as you can see, by doing this they are able to claim that a sunburn is a vaccine injury. Which, it's just...not.\n\nThe next thing I started studying, and again what many anti-vaxxers use in their arguments, is the vaccine package inserts. They use it as a \"gotcha\" argument. I used this argument too, and was very confident in it. \n\nThe problem, however, is that the pacakage insert is a legal document, one that has to list any adverse event that occured subsequent to the vaccine or during clinical trials or post-marketing studies. No causal relationship has to be proven, but they legally have to list everything that happens. The Gardasil vaccine insert, for example, lists gunshot wounds, car wrecks, and suicide as an adverse event.\n\nNext, I examined the ingredients. The ingredients were the biggest thing I was afraid of. \n\nLet's talk about aluminum, because mercury for the most part has been eliminated from vaccines and aluminum has stolen the spotlight. Babies receive about 10 mg of aluminum their first six months of life if they are breastfed, 30 mg if the are formula fed, and 120 milligrams if they are soy formula fed. But they only receive 4 mg of aluminum from vaccines in their first six months of life on the current vaccine schedule. \n\nI know. \"Injection is not the same ingestion.\" But say 1% of the aluminum from tjhe formula is absorbed. We are still at .1 mg, .3 mg, and 1.2 mg....all stilll less than the 4 mg from vaccines.\n\nScientists have also done research that shows that the aluminum from vaccines does not raise the blood level of aluminum already in your system, and that the aluminum from vaccines exits so quickly that half of it is gone from your body by the next day.\n\nThe second scary ingredient I forced myself to examine is Formaldehyde. It is used to inactivate the viruses and bacteria in the vaccines. Because of that, you are going to end up with some formaldehyde in the final product. The amount of formaldehyde in a vaccine, not exceeding one tenth of a milligram, is considered safe, as you already naturally have formaldehyde in your circulation. Formaldehyde is required in humans for the synthesis of thymidine, purines, and amino acids-which are all necessary for the formation of DNA.\n\nEveryone has detectible formaldehyde in their bloodstream, or about 2.5 micrograms per milliliter of blood. If you take an average weight of a 2 month old (11 pounds) with an average blood volume of 85 milliliters per kilogram, the total quanitity found naturally in that infant's blood would be about 1 milligram. 1 milligram of formaldehyde is ten times that which is in a vaccine. \n\nAnd for the third scary ingredient I examined, we have Polysorbate 80. Anti-vaxxers believe this chemical will open the blood brain barrier (BBB) up and allow aluminum to slip through into the brain. The problem with this, however, is that it is physically impossible for that to happen. But opening up the BBB is not as simple as it sounds. Assuming a vaccine contains 50 mcg (HPV vaccine, for example), a 10 pound baby would have to have dozens upon dozens of vaccines injected straight into its carotid artery to have even a CHANCE at opening up the BBB. Polysorbate 80 is also a very unstable chemical that gets attacked by esterases in your tissue at a very fast rate, and has a half life of 1.07 hours. (1,2)\n\nBut ultimately, what finally changed my mind, was having people reach out, listen to my fears, and talk to me. The thousands of mean comments didn't change my mind. In fact, those comments made me think I was even more in the right. If I had enemies, after all, then I must be doing something right. Those awful comments had the oppopsite effect of the pro vaccine person's intentions.\n\nBut when friends calmly and patiently explained the science to me, showing they cared more about me than about changing my mind, my mind started to open up to the fact that I could be wrong. That's when I started reading a book called \"The Vaccine Book\" by Dr. Robert Sears. He lays out information in a middle-ground sort of way. He seemed to be both pro and anti vax, with a very open mind and honest approach to both positions.  As I read, I started to realize that I trusted the doctor in this book, and that these vaccine injury posts on Facebook just did not line up to the number of vaccine injuries he stated had happened. \n\nBut the final straw that broke the camel's back was when I was hospitalized due to bruising everywhere and endometriosis. The care I received from the medical team was amazing. The western medicine they gave me helped me so much. I realized many anti-vaxxers are anti-vax based on the theory that scientists and doctors are in on a conspiracy to kill or maim children for money. It dawned on me that I definitely don't believe that, and am not a conspiracy theorist at all. \n\nThere is no way that thousands of doctors and scientists are out to kill or maim our kids. It's statistically impossible. Most of them are amazing people with huge hearts for kids. \n\nI want to apologize for anybody I hurt during my anti-vax days. I was harsh, sarcastic, and extremely hurtful. I know that there is a lot of ableism in the anti-vax movement, so just know this: your autistic child was born perfectly. Do not let anyone tell you that they need to be cured or fixed. I am so sorry if I ever promoted ableism. That was never my heart or intent, of course, but I am sorry if I did regardless. I would like to ask the pro vaccine and medical community's forgiveness for my flippant attitude, my Dunning Kruger effect that I put on like a a pair of shoes daily, and my measles costume that looked more like syphilis. I am so sorry. \n\nSo, here I am. About to get my flu shot once I recover from a small case of pneumonia. Planning to trust doctors and scientists from here on out. Wish me luck on my journey-I am looking forward to seeing where it leads me. \n\n(1) Abraham Alahmad, PhD\n\n(2) Vaccines and Your Child, Paul A. Offit, M.D. and Charlotte A.

But is there anything to be said for improved living conditions eradicating most of these diseases, and that that coincided with increased vaccine schedules? Basically my approach right now is that I’m skeptical and someone would have to convince me that the benefits outweigh the cost. Even the rare possibility of death doesn’t seem worth the supposed benefit of avoiding chicken pox (for example). But I can understand inoculating against much more harmful diseases. \n\nSecondly, supposedly they have never done a double blind study of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children over them. But if this is wrong someone please point me to the study. \n\nBasically I’m always willing to talk both sides, but I don’t agree with the approach that “well all these doctors can’t be wrong.” Big groups are often wrong, and usually they’re more likely to be wrong than heterodox opinions. Without dissent we would never have progress, which is basically Thomas Kuhn’s point about the advance of science.",

    "body": "Hi guys. This is basically satire but could I get your opinion on this morning hygiene ritual from American Psycho?\n\n> I pour some Plax antiplaque formula into a stainless-steel tumbler and swish it around my mouth for thirty seconds. Then I squeeze Rembrandt onto a faux-tortoiseshell toothbrush and start brushing my teeth (too hung over to floss properly - but maybe I flossed before bed last night?) and rinse with Listerine. Then I inspect my hands and use a nailbrush. I take the ice-pack mask off and use a deep-pore cleanser lotion, then an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for ten minutes while I check my toenails. Then I use the Probright tooth polisher and next the Interplak tooth polisher (this in addition to the toothbrush) which has a speed of 4200 rpm and reverses direction forty-six times per second; the larger tufts clean between teeth and massage the gums while the short ones scrub the tooth surfaces. \n\n>I rinse again, with Cepacol. I wash the facial massage off with a spearmint face scrub. The shower has a universal all-directional shower head that adjusts within a thirty-inch vertical range. It's made from Australian gold-black brass and covered with a white enamel finish. In the shower I use first a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Vidal Sassoon shampoo is especially good at getting rid of the coating of dried perspiration, salts, oils, airborne pollutants and dirt that can weigh down hair and flatten it to the scalp which can make you look older. The conditioner is also good - silicone technology permits conditioning benefits without weighing down the hair which can also make you look older. \n\n>On weekends or before a date I prefer to use the Greune Natural Revitalizing Shampoo, the conditioner and the Nutrient Complex. These are formulas that contain D-panthenol, a vitamin-B-complex factor; polysorbate 80, a cleansing agent for the scalp; and natural herbs. Over the weekend I plan to go to Bloomingdale's or Bergdorf's and on Evelyn's advice pick up a Foltene European Supplement and Shampoo for thinning hair which contains complex carbohydrates that penetrate the hair shafts for improved strength and shine. Also the Vivagen Hair Enrichment Treatment, a new Redken product that prevents mineral deposits and prolongs the life cycle of hair. Luis Carruthers recommended the Aramis Nutriplexx system, a nutrient complex that helps increase circulation. \n\n>Once out of the shower and toweled dry I put the Ralph Lauren boxers back on and before applying the Mousse A Raiser, a shaving cream by Pour Hommes, I press a hot towel against my face for two minutes to soften abrasive beard hair. Then I always slather on a moisturizer (to my taste, Clinique) and let it soak in for a minute. You can rinse it off or keep it on and apply a shaving cream over it - preferably with a brush, which softens the beard as it lifts the whiskers - which I've found makes removing the hair easier. It also helps prevent water from evaporating and reduces friction between your skin and the blade. Always wet the razor with warm water before shaving and shave in the direction the beard grows, pressing gently on the skin. Leave the sideburns and chin for last, since these whiskers are tougher and need more time to soften. Rinse the razor and shake off any excess water before starting. Afterwards splash cool water on the face to remove any trace of lather. You should use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol. Never use cologne on your face, since the high alcohol content dries your face out and makes you look older. \n\n>One should use an alcohol-free antibacterial toner with a water-moistened cotton ball to normalize the skin. Applying a moisturizer is the final step. Splash on water before applying an emollient lotion to soften the skin and seal in the moisture. Next apply Gel Appaisant, also made by Pour Hommes, which is an excellent, soothing skin lotion. If the face seems dry and flaky - which makes it look dull and older - use a clarifying lotion that removes flakes and uncovers fine skin (it can also make your tan look darker). Then apply an anti-aging eye balm (Baume Des Yeux) followed by a final moisturizing “protective” lotion. A scalp-programming lotion is used after I towel my hair dry. I also lightly blow-dry the hair to give it body and control (but without stickiness) and then add more of the lotion, shaping it with a Kent natural-bristle brush, and finally slick it back with a wide-tooth comb.\n\n",

    "body": "When I heard about this new product line the other day, I decided to look at all the products and their formulations via SkinCarisma to see whether anything looked worth trying. A few products seemed promising, while others seemed... not so much. I thought since I'd already done all the work, I'd share my findings here!\n\nIn order approximately from most to least promising:\n\nBlemish Control Spot Treatment, 5.5% Benzoyl Peroxide\n\n- **fungal acne safe!**\n- 5.5% is a higher concentration that necessary but shouldn't be too irritating\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both near end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (at end of ingred. list)\n- some nice **moisturizing** ingredients, including a good amount of squalane\n\nVitamin C Moisturizer\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 8th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (14th ingred.)\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane, lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- small amounts of cassia and green tea\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- advertises inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is last ingredient\n\nDark Spot Solution Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: polysorbate 20 (8th ingred.)\n- **niacinimide** is 2nd ingredient! brightening and anti-aging properties\n- advertises its inclusion of plankton extract but is 24th ingredient (also not much evidence that plankton extract does anything for skin besides moisturizing)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract  (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (last ingred.), citric acid (15th ingred.)\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- possible **allergen**: benzoyl alcohol\n- contains a lot of **silicones**\n\nRetinol Vitamin A Refining Moisturizer\n\n- amount of retinol isn't specified, but is placed 25th on ingredient list (you only need small amounts, 0.01% or more, to be effective, but need 0.5% or more for dramatic effects)\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.), polysorbate 20 (24th), cetyl palmitate (26th) \n- **retinol** has anti-acne, brightening, and anti-aging properties\n- other **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.), ceramide 3 (27th ingred.)\n- tons of aloe juice, good amount of squalane\n- small amounts of green tea and cassia\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- specifically advertises its inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is 26th (second last) on ingred. list\n\nOil-Free SPF 50 Moisturizing Sunscreen\n\n- broad spectrum\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl stearate (2nd ingredient), isopropyl palmitate (7th), PEG-100 stearate (8th)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.)\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: isopropyl palmitate (7th ingred.)\n- pretty small tube, only 50 mL\n\nFerulic Acid + Vitamins C and E Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for its vit C so is not a dupe for SkinCeuticals, but should still be effective\n- amounts of main ingredients not specified, however, vit C is the 5th ingredient, ferulic is 10th, vit E is 18th (second to last)\n- **brightening** ingredients: SAP\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E, citric acid, ferulic acid\n- citric acid (8th ingredient) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingredient)\n\nBio-Complex Moisturizer for Dry Skin\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- claim to have a \"high level\" of hyaluronic acid, and contains 2 kinds, but they're only 21st and 22nd on ingredient list\n- also super unclear on what their \"bio-moist complex\" is but if it comprises 20% of the product it must just be like, aloe and water and glycerin\n- but yeah, tons of aloe and glycerin, good amount of squalane, some other **moisturizing** ingredients, moderate amount of green tea extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (14th ingred.), vitamin E (23rd)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n\nVitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 5th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (13th ingred.), citric acid (10th)\n- contains **denatured alcohol** (3rd ingred.)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingred.)\n- HA is in the name and yet it's the last ingredient\n\nCharcoal Balancing Mask\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: PEG-100 stearate (9th ingred.), stearic acid (10th), glyceryl stearate (12th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- not sure how much charcoal is needed to be effective, but there may be a deceptively small amount in this, as it's the 16th ingredient and the product contains as much or more iron oxide as a colouring agent. also it lists \"charcoal powder\" and NOT \"activated charcoal powder\" so it may just be all-around useless.\n- advertises its use of hyaluronic acid yet it's the last ingredient \n- main mask component is **kaolin** clay (3rd ingred.)\n- 2 kinds of vitamin E (17th and 24th ingredients)\n- lots of aloe and some glycerin but not many other soothing or moisturizing ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: stearic acid (10th ingred.)\n\nHydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: contains polysorbate 80\n- claims to have 5 types of HA but I only counted 3: sodium hyaluronate, hydrolized HA, sodium acetylated hyaluronate (and they're all 18th or later in the ingredient list)\n- contains a TON of **silicone**, which seems like a poor choice to me, as HA should generally be applied earlier on in your routine and all that silicone will interfere with absorption of subsequent layers\n- no other notable or helpful ingredients, just a few **moisturizing** things like glycerin\n- more of a gel texture than a serum\n\nTriple-Peptide Eye Cream\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: stearic acid (3rd ingred.), glycol distearate (4th), shea butter (5th), ethylhexyl palmitate (8th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- peptides are last ingredient\n- contains ascorbic acid (vitamin C) but is 18th ingredient and what little benefit that amount gives will deteriorate due to air exposure from jar packaging\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane and caffeine\n- small amounts of green tea and green algae extract\n- 5 potential **comedogens** but this likely won't matter for the eye region\n- if you look up this product on Amazon to examine yourself, note that the copyable list of ingredients in the Important Information section is actually the ingredient list for the Retinol Moisturizer, so use the ingredients listed in the product images\n\nHydrating Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.), pomegranate seed oil (14th), coconut oil (15th), olive fruit oil (16th), argan oil (17th), jojoba oil (18th), babassu seed oil (20th), moringa seed oil (21st), crambe seed oil (23rd)\n- 2 potential **comedogens**: coconut oil (15th ingred.), avocado oil (19th)\n- in addition to above listed plant oils, also contains chia seed oil, the only non-problematic one lol\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin E (12th)\n- citric acid and benzoic acid (6th ingred.) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- **surfectants** used: decyl glucoside and glyceryl oleate\n\nOil-Free Micellar Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.)\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin E (12th)\n- citric acid and benzoic acid (6th ingred.) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- micellar agents (**surfectants**) are decyl glucoside and glycerl oleate\n\nBlemish Control Oil-Free Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- advertises 2% **salicylic acid**, but unsure of the pH\n- **denatured alcohol** is the first ingredient!\n- contains grapefruit extract (3rd ingred.) - some sources say this is a great ingredient for skin, others say it's bad - I personally avoid it like I do all citrus-derived ingredients\n- contains **fragrance** (5th ingred.)\n- contains **sulfate**: sodium xylenesulfonate (13th ingred.)\n \nHope this is helpful! Let me know if I missed or got anything wrong!\n\nEdit: formatting\nEdit 2: butchered the spelling of \"comedogen\" all ten times I used it",

In the US, ingredients in concentrations of 1% or lower can be listed in whatever order the manufacturer wants to use. You can sometimes tell where that <1% begins if the product contains phenoxyethanol, because that's approved for use in concentrations of up to 1% -- meaning things *after* that are either at 1% or under.\n\n(Also, 1% HA isn't unusual, nor is it necessarily ineffective; it's normally used at/in concentrations of 0.2-2%. TO often uses 2% because of their unofficial \"more is **always** better\" philosophy [looking at you, 10% niacinamide serum], but <2% can be beneficial, too!)\n\nThat said, you'd think there'd be little reason for Amazon to list a \"banner\" ingredient at the very end when/if they have the option to list it earlier/higher.",

    "body": "Part 2 based on u/winwinnwinnie’s comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/Hair/comments/t82slz/mending_split_ends_part_2_with_castor_oilsebacic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nYou can temporarily mend split ends together with the ingredients polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer. Most products that claim to mend split ends don’t have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here’s the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That’s fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there’s a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don’t let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don’t let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there’s some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can’t tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well.

    "body": "# Introduction\n\nWelcome to the pharmacology research guide.\n\nI frequently get asked if I went to college to become adept in neuroscience and pharmacology (even by med students at times) and the answer is no. In this day and age, *almost* everything you could hope to know is at the touch of your fingertips.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, college is great for some people, but everyone is different. I'd say it's a prerequisite for those looking to discover *new* knowledge, but for those whom it does not concern, dedication will dictate their value as a researcher and not title.\n\nThis guide is tailored towards research outside of an academy, however some of this is very esoteric and may benefit anyone. If you have anything to add to this guide, please make a comment. Otherwise, enjoy.\n\n# Table of contents\n\nBeginners research/ basics\n\n**I - Building the foundation for an idea**\n\n* Sparking curiosity\n* Wanting to learn\n\n**II - Filling in the gaps (the rabbit hole, sci-hub)**\n\n* Understand what it is you're reading\n* Finding the data you want\n* Comparing data\n\n**III - Knowing what to trust**\n\n* Understanding research bias\n* Statistics on research misconduct\n* Exaggeration of results\n* The hierarchy of scientific evidence\n* International data manipulation\n\n**IV - Separating fact from idea**\n\n* Challenge your own ideas\n* Endless dynamics of human biology\n* Importance of the placebo effect\n* Do not base everything on chemical structure\n* Untested drugs are very risky, even peptides\n* \"Natural\" compounds are not inherently safe\n* Be wary of grandeur claims without knowing the full context\n\nAdvanced research\n\n**I - Principles of pharmacology (pharmacokinetics)**\n\n* Basics of pharmacokinetics I (drug metabolism, oral bioavailability)\n* Basics of pharmacokinetics II (alternative routes of administration)\n\n**II - Principles of pharmacology (pharmacodynamics)**\n\n* Basics of pharmacodynamics I (agonist, antagonist, receptors, allosteric modulators, etc.)\n* Basics of pharmacodynamics II (competitive vs. noncompetitive inhibition)\n* Basics of pharmacodynamics III (receptor affinity)\n* Basics of pharmacodynamics IV (phosphorylation and heteromers)\n\n# Beginners research I: Building the foundation for an idea\n\n**Sparking curiosity:**\n\nCommunities such as this one are excellent for sparking conversation about new ideas. There's so much we could stand to improve about ourselves, or the world at large, and taking a research-based approach is the most accurate way to go about it.\n\nSome of the most engaging and productive moments I've had were when others disagreed with me, and attempted to do so with research. I would say wanting to be right is essential to how I learn, but I find similar traits among others I view as knowledgeable. Of course, not everyone is callus enough to withstand such conflict, but it's just a side effect of honesty.\n\n**Wanting to learn:**\n\nWhen you're just starting out, Wikipedia is a great entry point for developing early opinions on something. Think of it as a foundation for your research, but not the goal.\n\nWhen challenged by a new idea, I first search \"\\[term\\] Wikipedia\", and from there I gather what I can before moving on.\n\nWikipedia articles are people's summaries of other sources, and since there's no peer review like in scientific journals, it isn't always accurate. Not everything can be found on Wikipedia, but to get the gist of things I'd say it serves its purpose. Of course there's more to why its legitimacy is questionable, but I'll cover that in later sections.\n\n# Beginners research II: Filling in the gaps (the rabbit hole, sci-hub)\n\n**Understand what it is you're reading:**\n\nGoogle, google, google! Do not read something you don't understand and then keep going. Trust me, this will do more harm than good, and you might come out having the wrong idea about something.\n\nIn your research you will encounter terms you don't understand, so make sure to open up a new tab to get to the bottom of it before progressing. I find trying to prove something goes a long way towards driving my curiosity on a subject. Having 50 tabs open at once is a sign you're doing something right, so long as you don't get too sidetracked and forget the focus of what you're trying to understand.\n\n**Finding the data you want:**\n\nFirst, you can use Wikipedia as mentioned to get an idea about something. This may leave you with some questions, or perhaps you want to validate what they said. From here you can either click on the citations they used which will direct you to links, or do a search query yourself.\n\nGenerally what I do is google \"\\[topic\\] pubmed\", as pubmed compiles information from multiple journals. But what if I'm still not getting the results I want? Well, you can put quotations around subjects you explicitly want mentioned, or put \"-\" before subjects you do not want mentioned. \n\nSo, say I read [a source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2882689/) talking about how CB1 (cannabinoid receptor) hypo- and hyperactivation impairs faucets of working memory, but when I google \"CBD working memory\", all I see are studies showing a positive result in healthy people (which is quite impressive). In general, it is always best to hold scientific findings above your own opinions, but given how CBD activates CB1 by inhibiting FAAH, an enzyme that degrades cannabinoids, and in some studies [dampens AMPA signaling](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32805354/), and [inhibits LTP formation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10061329/), we have a valid line of reasoning to cast doubt on its ability to improve cognition.\n\nSo by altering the keywords, I get the following result:\n\n[Example 1 of using google to your advantage](https://preview.redd.it/zehlomfw4vxa1.jpg?width=432&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb09ba4de0b0dfb786f8b64105c2bd961b9fa6bf)\n\nIn this study, CBD actually impaired cognition. But this is just the abstract, what if I wanted to read the full thing and it's behind a paywall? Well, now I will introduce sci-hub, which lets you unlock almost every scientific study. There are multiple sci-hub domains, as they keep getting delisted (like sci-hub.do), but for this example we will use sci-hub.se/\\[insert DOI link here\\]. Side note, I strongly suggest using your browser's \"find\" tool, as it makes finding things so much easier.\n\n[Example of where to find a DOI link](https://preview.redd.it/a1em82gmivxa1.jpg?width=513&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=555d53f49f9dd240e98c2da0f9aa107645fe9072)\n\nSo putting [sci-hub.se/10.1038/s41598-018-25846-2](https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/s41598-018-25846-2) in our browser will give us the full study. But since positive data was conducted in healthy people and this was in cigarette users, it's not good enough. However, changing the key words again I get this:\n\n[Example 2 of using google to your advantage](https://preview.redd.it/pj78cwkjevxa1.jpg?width=441&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=374735e673cd0e39d2616a0b4cd026229608cce0)\n\n**Comparing data:**\n\nNow, does this completely invalidate the studies where CBD improved cognition? No. What it does prove, however, is that CBD isn't *necessarily* cognition enhancing, which is an important distinction to make. Your goal as a researcher should always to be as right as possible, and this demands flexibility and sometimes putting your ego aside. My standing on things has changed many times over the course of the last few years, as I was presented new knowledge.\n\nBut going back to the discussion around CBD, there's a number of reasons as to why we're seeing conflicting results, some of the biggest being:\n\n1. Financial incentive (covered more extensively in the next section)\n2. Population type (varying characteristics due to either sample size, unique participants, etc.)\n3. Methodology (drug exposure at different doses or route of administration, age of the study, mistakes by the scientists, etc.)\n\nOf course, the list does not end there. One could make the argument that the healthy subjects had different endogenous levels of cannabinoids or metabolized CBD differently, or perhaps the different methods used yielded different results. It's good to be as precise as possible, because the slightest change to parameters between two studies could mean a world of difference in terms of outcome. This leaves out the obvious, which is financial incentive, so let's segue to the next section.\n\n# Beginners research III: Knowing what to trust\n\n**Understanding research bias:**\n\nStudies are not cheap, so who funds them, and why? Well, to put it simply, practically everything scientific is motivated by the idea that it will acquire wealth, by either directly receiving money from people, or indirectly by how much they have accomplished.\n\nThere is a positive to this, in that it can incentivize innovation/ new concepts, as well as creative destruction (dismantling an old idea with your even better idea). However the negatives progressively outweigh the positives, as scientists have a strong incentive to prove their ideas right at the expense of the full truth, maybe by outright lying about the results, or even more damning - seeking only the reward of accomplishment and using readers' ignorance as justification for not positing negative results.\n\n**Statistics on research misconduct:**\n\nTo give perspective, I'll quote from [this](https://www.biochemia-medica.com/en/journal/27/3/10.11613/BM.2017.030201) source:\n\n>The proportion of positive results in scientific literature increased between 1990/1991 reaching 70.2% and 85.9% in 2007, respectively.\n\nWhile on one hand the progression of science can lead to more accurate predictions, on the other there is significant evidence of corruption in literature. As stated [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167876019302818?via%3Dihub), many studies fail to replicate old findings, with psychology for instance only having a 40% success rate. \n\n[One scientist](https://retractionwatch.com/2018/04/10/caught-our-notice-researcher-who-once-threatened-to-sue-retraction-watch-now-up-to-19-retractions/) had as many as 19 retractions on his work regarding Curcumin, which is an example of a high demand nutraceutical that would reward data manipulation.\n\nBy being either blinded by their self image, or fearing the consequence of their actions, scientists even skew their own self-reported misconduct, as demonstrated [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685008/):\n\n>1.97% of scientists admitted to have fabricated, falsified or modified data or results at least once –a serious form of misconduct by any standard– and up to 33.7% admitted other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about the behavior of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12% for falsification, and up to 72% for other questionable research practices. Meta-regression showed that self reports surveys, surveys using the words “falsification” or “fabrication”, and mailed surveys yielded lower percentages of misconduct. When these factors were controlled for, misconduct was reported more frequently by medical/pharmacological researchers than others.  \n>  \n>Considering that these surveys ask sensitive questions and have other limitations, it appears likely that **this is a conservative estimate of the true prevalence of scientific misconduct**. \n\n**Exaggeration of results:**\n\nLying aside, there are other ways to manipulate the reader, with one example being the [study in a patented form of Shilajit](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/and.12482), where it purportedly increased testosterone levels in healthy volunteers. Their claim is that after 90 days, it increased testosterone. But looking at the data itself, it isn't so clear:\n\n[Data used as evidence for Shilajit increasing testosterone](https://preview.redd.it/89y2fkrbzvxa1.jpg?width=1057&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c65d58340192643457a4509466bb0342de7a541e)\n\nAs you can see above, in the first and second months, free testosterone in the Shilajit group had actually decreased, and then the study was conveniently stopped at 90 days. This way they can market it as a \"testosterone enhancer\" and say it \"increased free testosterone after 90 days\", when it's more likely that testosterone just happened to be higher on that day. Even still, total testosterone in the 90 days Shilajit group matched placebo's baseline, and free testosterone was still lower.\n\nThis is an obvious conflict of interest, but conflict of interest is rarely obvious. For instance, pharmaceutical or nutraceutical companies often conduct a study in their own facility, and then approach college professors or students and offer them payment in exchange for *them* taking credit for the experiment. Those who accept gain not only the authority for having been credited with the study's results, but also the money given. It's a serious problem.\n\n**The hierarchy of scientific evidence:**\n\nA semi-solution to this is simply tallying the results of multiple studies. Generally speaking, one should defer to this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y1fuimqs3wxa1.jpg?width=356&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d6780211e40b1af184013adbdc85dec504932bc\n\nWhile the above is usually true, it's highly context dependent: meta-analyses can have huge limitations, which they sometimes state. Additionally, animal studies are crucial to understanding how a drug works, and put tremendous weight behind human results. This is because, well... You can't kill humans to observe what a drug is doing at a cellular level. Knowing a drug's mechanism of action is important, and rat studies aren't that inaccurate, such in [this](https://sci-hub.se/https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt196235665) analysis:\n\n>68% of the positive predictions and 79% of the negative predictions were right, for an overall score of 74% \n\nFactoring in corruption, the above can only serve as a loose correlation. Of course there are instances where animals possess a different physiology than humans, and thus drugs can produce different results, but it should be approached on a case-by-case basis, rather than dismissing evidence.\n\nAs such, rather than a hierarchy, research is best approached wholistically, as what we know is always changing. Understanding something from the ground up is what separates knowledge from a mere guess.\n\nAlso, while the above graph does not list them, influencers and anecdotes should rank below the pyramid. The placebo effect is more extreme than you'd think, but I will discuss it in a later section.\n\n**International data manipulation:**\n\nAnother indicator of corruption is the country that published the research. As shown [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3608538/), misconduct is abundant in all countries, but especially in India, South Korea, and historically in China as well. While China has since made an effort to enact laws against it (many undeveloped countries don't even have these laws), [it has persisted](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.341.6145.445) through bribery since then. \n\n# Basic research IV: Separating fact from idea\n\n**Challenge your own ideas:**\n\nImagining new ideas is fun and important, but creating a bulletproof idea that will survive criticism is challenging. The first thing you should do when you construct a new idea, is try to disprove it.\n\nFor example, a common misconception that still lingers to this day is that receptor density, for example dopamine receptors, can be directly extrapolated to mean a substance \"upregulated dopamine\". But such changes in receptor density are found in both drugs that increase dopamine and are known to have tolerance (i.e. meth), or suppress it somehow (i.e. antipsychotics). I explain this in greater detail in [my post on psychostimulants](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/t4r9h1/the_complete_guide_to_dopamine_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\n**Endless dynamics of human biology:**\n\nThe reason why the above premise fails is because the brain is more complicated than a single event in isolation. Again, it must be approached wholistically: there are dynamics within and outside the cell, between cells, different cells, different regions of cells, organs, etc. There are countless neurotransmitters, proteins, enzymes, etc. The list just goes on and on.\n\n**Importance of the placebo effect:**\n\nAs you may already know, a placebo is when someone unknowingly experiences a benefit from what is essentially nothing. Despite being conjured from imagination, it can cause statistically significant improvement to a large variety of symptoms, and even induce neurochemical changes such as an increase to dopamine. The fact that these changes are real and measurable is what set the foundation for modern medicine.\n\nIt varies by condition, but clinical trials generally report a 30% response to placebo.\n\nIn supplement spheres you can witness this everywhere, as legacies of debunked substances are perpetuated by outrageous anecdotes, fueling more purchases, thus ultimately more anecdotes. The social dynamics of communities can drive oxytocinergic signaling which makes users even more susceptible to hypnotism, which can magnify the placebo effect. Astroturfing and staged reviews, combined with botted traction, is a common sales tactic that supplement companies employ.\n\nOn the other hand there's nocebo, which is especially common amongst anxious hypochondriacs. Like placebo, it is imagined, but unlike placebo it is a negative reaction. It goes both ways, which is why a control group given a fake drug is always necessary. The most common nocebos are headache, stomach pain, and more, and since anxiety can also manifest physical symptoms, those experiencing nocebo can be fully immersed in the idea that they are being poisoned.\n\n**Do not base everything on chemical structure:**\n\nWhile it is true that drug design is based around chemical structure, with derivatives of other drugs (aka analogs) intending to achieve similar properties of, if not surpass the original drug, this is not always the case. The pharmacodynamics, or receptor affinity profile of a drug can dramatically change by even slight modifications to chemical structure.\n\nAn example of this is that Piracetam is an AMPA PAM and calcium channel inhibitor, phenylpiracetam is a nicotinic a4b2 agonist, and methylphenylpiracetam is a sigma 1 positive allosteric modulator.\n\nHowever, even smaller changes can result in different pharmacodynamics. A prime example of this is that Opipramol is structured like a Tricylic antidepressant, but behaves as a sigma 1 agonist. There are many examples like this.\n\nI catch people making this mistake all the time, like when generalizing \"racetams\" because of their structure, or thinking adding \"N-Acetyl\" or \"Phenyl\" groups to a compound will just make it a stronger version of itself. That's just not how it works. \n\n**Untested drugs are very risky, even peptides:**\n\nWhile the purpose of pharmacology is to isolate the benefits of a compound from any negatives, and drugs are getting safer with time, predictive analysis is still far behind in terms of reliability and accuracy. Theoretical binding affinity does not hold up to laboratory assays, and software frequently makes radically incorrect assumptions about drugs.\n\nAs stated [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325638/), poor safety or toxicity accounted for 21-54% of failed clinical trials, and 90% of all drugs fail clinical trials. Pharmaceutical companies have access to the best drug prediction technology, yet not even they can know the outcome of a drug in humans. This is why giving drugs human trials to assess safety is necessary before they are put into use.\n\nAlso, I am not sure where the rumor originated from, but there are indeed [toxic peptides](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29468976/). And they are not inherently more selective than small molecules, even if that is their intention. Like with any drug, peptides should be evaluated for their safety and efficacy too.\n\n**\"Natural\" compounds are not inherently safe:**\n\nLack of trust in \"Big Pharma\" is valid, but that is only half of the story. Sometimes when people encounter something they know is wrong, they take the complete opposite approach instead of working towards fixing the problem at hand. >!\\*Cough\\* communism.!<\n\nBut if you thought pharmaceutical research was bad, you would be even more revolted by nutraceutical research. Most pharmaceuticals are derived from herbal constituents, with the intent of increasing the positive effects while decreasing negatives. Naturalism is a regression of this principle, as it leans heavily on the misconception that herbal compounds were \"designed\" to be consumed.\n\nIt's quite the opposite hilariously enough, as most biologically active chemicals in herbs are intended to act as pesticides or antimicrobials. The claimed anti-cancer effects of these herbs are more often than not due to them acting as low grade toxins. There are exceptions to this rule, like Carnosic Acid for instance, which protects healthy cells while damaging cancer cells. But to say this is a normal occurrence is far from the truth.\n\nThere are numerous examples of this, despite there being very little research to verify the safety of herbals before they are marketed. For instance [Cordyceps Militaris](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3595709/) is frequently marketed as an \"anti-cancer\" herb, but runs the risk of nephrotoxicity (kidney toxicity). The damage is mediated by oxidative stress, which ironically is how most herbs act as antioxidants: through a concept called hormesis. In essence, the herb induces a small amount of oxidative stress, resulting in a disproportionate chain reaction of antioxidant enzymes, leading to a net positive.\n\nA major discrepancy here is bioavailability, as miniscule absorption of compounds such as polyphenols limit the oxidative damage they can occur. Most are susceptible to phase II metabolism, where they are detoxified by a process called conjugation (more on that later). Chemicals that aren't as restricted, such as Cordycepin (the sought after constituent of Cordyceps) can therefore put one at risk of damage. While contaminates such as lead and arsenic are a threat with herbal compounds, sometimes the problem lies in the compounds themselves.\n\nAnother argument for herbs is the \"entourage effect\", which catapults purported benefits off of scientific ignorance. Proper methodology would be to isolate what is beneficial, and base other things, such as benefits from supplementation, off of that. In saying \"we don't know how it works yet\", you are basically admitting to not understanding why something is good, or if it is bad. This, compounded with the wide marketability of herbs due to the FDA's lax stance on their use as supplements, is a red flag for deception.\n\nAnd yes, this applies to extracts from food products. Once the water is removed and you're left with powder, this is already a \"megadose\" compared to what you would achieve with diet alone. To then create an extract from it, you are magnifying that disparity further. The misconception is that pharmaceutical companies oppose herbs because they are \"alternative medicine\" and that loses them business. But if that was the case then it would have already been outlawed, or restricted like what they pulled with NAC. In reality what these companies fight over the most is other pharmaceuticals. Creative destruction in the nutraceutical space is welcomed, but the fact that we don't get enough of it is a bad sign.\n\n**Be wary of grandeur claims without knowing the full context:**\n\nMarketing gimmicks by opportunists in literature are painstakingly common. One example of this is Dihexa: it was advertised as being anywhere from 7-10,000,000x stronger than BDNF, but to this day I cannot find anything that so much as directly compares them. Another is Unifiram, which is claimed to be 1,000x \"stronger\" than Piracetam.\n\nThese are egregious overreaches on behalf of the authors, and that is because they cannot be directly compared. Say that the concentration of Dihexa in the brain was comparable to that of BDNF, they don't even bind to the same targets. BDNF is a Trk agonist, and Dihexa is c-Met potentiator. Ignoring that, if Dihexa did share the same mechanism of action as BDNF, and bound with much higher affinity, that doesn't mean it's binding with 7-10,000,000x stronger activation of the G-coupled protein receptor. Ignoring that, and to play devil's advocate we said it did, you would surely develop downsyndrome.\n\nLikewise, Unifiram is far from proven to mimic Piracetam's pharmacodynamics, so saying it is \"stronger\" is erroneously reductive. Piracetam is selective at AMPA receptors, acting only as a positive allosteric modulator. This plays a big role in it being a cognitive enhancer, hence my excitement for TAK-653. Noopept is most like Piracetam, but even it isn't the same, as demonstrated in [posts prior](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/123tn9i/a_guide_to_the_novel_nootropics_listed_to/), it has agonist affinity. AMPA PAMs potentiate endogenous BDNF release, which syncs closely with homeostasis; the benefits of BDNF are time and event dependent, which even further cements Dihexa's marketing as awful.\n\n# Advanced research I: Principles of pharmacology (Pharmacokinetics)\n\n**Basics of pharmacokinetics I (drug metabolism, oral bioavailability):**\n\nCompared to injection (commonly referred to as ip or iv), oral administration (abbreviated as po) will lose a fraction before it enters the blood stream (aka plasma, serum). The amount that survives is referred to as absolute bioavailability. From there, it may selectively accumulate in lower organs which will detract from how much reaches the blood brain barrier (BBB). Then the drug may either penetrate, or remain mostly in the plasma. Reductively speaking, fat solubility plays a large role here. If it does penetrate, different amounts will accumulate intracellularly or extracellularly within the brain.\n\nAs demonstrated in [a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/n8s2lq/the_oral_bioavailability_of_every_nootropic_84/), you can roughly predict the bioavailability of a substance by its molecular structure (my results showed a 70% consistency vs. their 85%). While it's no substitute for actual results, it's still useful as a point of reference. The rule goes as follows:\n\n>10 or fewer rotatable bonds (R) or 12 or fewer H-bond donors and acceptors (H) will have a high probability of good oral bioavailability\n\nDrug metabolism follows a few phases. During first pass metabolism, the drug is subjected to a series of enzymes from the stomach, bacteria, liver and intestines. A significant interaction here would be with the liver, and with cytochrome P-450. This enzyme plays a major role in the toxicity and absorption of drugs, and is generally characterized by a basic modification to a drug's structure. Many prodrugs are designed around this process, as it can be utilized to release the desired drug upon contact.\n\nAnother major event is conjugation, or phase II metabolism. Here a drug may be altered by having a glutathione, sulfate, glycine, or glucuronic acid group joined to its chemical structure. This is one way in which the body attempts to detoxify exogenous chemicals. Conjugation increases the molecular weight and complexity of a substance, as well as the water solubility, significantly decreasing its bioavailability and allowing the kidneys to filter it and excrete it through urine.\n\nConjugation is known to underlie the poor absorption of polyphenols and flavonoids, but also has interactions with various synthetic drugs. Glucuronidation in particular appears to be significant here. It can adaptively increase with chronic drug exposure and with age, acting almost like a pseudo-tolerance. While it's most recognized for its role in the liver and small intestines, it's also found to occur in the brain. [Nicotine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4752199/) has been shown to selectively increase glucuronidation in the brain, whereas [cigarette smoke](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9498235/) has been shown to increase it in the liver and lungs. Since it's rarely researched, it's likely many drugs have an effect on this process. It is known that bile acids, including beneficial ones such as UDCA and TUDCA stimulate glucuronidation, and while this may play a role in their hepatoprotection, it may also change drug metabolism.\n\nHalf life refers to the time it takes for the concentration of a drug to reduce by half. Different organs will excrete drugs at different rates, thus giving each organ a unique half life. Even this can make or break a drug, such as in the case of [GABA](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11595763/), which is thought to explain its mediocre effects despite crossing the BBB contrary to popular belief.\n\n**Basics of pharmacokinetics II (alternative routes of administration):**\n\nIn the event that not enough of the drug is reaching the BBB, either due to poor oral bioavailability or accumulation in the lower organs, intranasal or intraperitoneal (injection to the abdomen) administration is preferred. Since needles are a time consuming and invasive treatment, huge efforts are made to prevent this from being necessary.\n\nSublingual (below the tongue) or buccal (between the teeth and cheek) administration are alternative routes of administration, with buccal being though to be marginally better. This allows a percentage of the drug to be absorbed through the mouth, without encountering first pass metabolism. However, since a portion of the drug is still swallowed regardless, and it may take a while to absorb, intranasal has a superior pharmacokinetic profile. Through the nasal cavity, drugs may also have a direct route to the brain, allowing for greater psychoactivity than even injection, as well as faster onset, but this ROA is rarely applicable due to the dosage being unachievable in nasal spray formulations.\n\nHowever, due to peptides being biologically active at doses comparatively lower than small molecules, and possessing low oral bioavailability, they may often be used in this way. Examples of this would be drugs such as insulin or semax. The downside to these drugs, however, is their instability and low heat tolerance, making maintenance impractical. However, shelf life can be partially extended by some additives such as [polysorbate 80](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://doi.org/10.1517/17425240903199143).\n\nAnother limitation to nasal sprays are the challenges of concomitant use, as using multiple may cause competition for absorption, as well as leakage.\n\nTransdermal or topical usage of drugs is normally used as an attempt to increase exposure at an exterior part of the body. While sometimes effective, it is worth noting that most molecules to absorb this way will also go systemic and have cascading effects across other organs. Selective targeting of any region of the body or brain is notoriously difficult. The penetration enhancer DMSO may also be used, such as in topical formulations or because of its effectiveness as a solvent, however due to its promiscuity in this regard, it is fundamentally opposed to cellular defense, and as such runs the risk of causing one to contract pathogens or be exposed to toxins. Reductively speaking, of course.\n\n# Advanced research II: Principles of pharmacology (Pharmacodynamics)\n\n**Basics of pharmacodynamics I (agonist, antagonist, allosteric modulators, receptors, etc.):**\n\nWhat if I told you that real antagonists are actually agonists? Well, some actually are. To make a sweeping generalization here, traditional antagonists repel the binding of agonists without causing significant activation of the receptor. That being said, they aren't 100% inactive, and don't need to be in order to classify as an antagonist. Practically speaking, however, they pretty much are, and that's what makes them antagonists. Just think of them as hogging up space. More about inhibitors in the next section.\n\nWhen you cause the opposite of what an agonist would normally achieve at a G-coupled protein receptor, you get an inverse agonist. For a while this distinction was not made, and so many drugs were referred to as \"antagonists\" when they were actually inverse agonists, or partial inverse agonists.\n\nA partial agonist is a drug that displays both agonist and antagonist properties. A purposefully weak agonist, if you will. Since it lacks the ability to activate the receptor as much as endogenous ligands, it inhibits them like an antagonist. But since it is also agonizing the receptor when it would otherwise be dormant, it's a partial agonist. An example of a partial agonist in motion would be Tropisetron or GTS-21. While these drugs activate the alpha-7 nicotinic receptor, possibly enhancing memory formation, they can also block activation during an excitotoxic event, lending them neuroprotective effects. So in the case of Alzheimer's, they may show promise.\n\nA partial inverse agonist is like a partial agonist, but... Inverse. Inverse agonists are generally used when simply blocking an effect isn't enough, and the opposite is needed. An example of this would be Pitolisant for the treatment of narcolepsy: while antagonism can help, inverse agonism releases more histamine, giving it a distinct advantage.\n\nA positive allosteric modulator (PAM) is a drug that binds to a subunit of a receptor complex and changes its formation, potentiating the endogenous ligands. Technically it is an agonist of that subunit, and at times it may be referred to as such, but it's best not to get caught up in semantics. PAMs are useful when you want context-specific changes, like potentiation of normal memory formation with AMPA PAMs. As expected, negative allosteric modulators or NAMs are like that, but the opposite.\n\nThere are different types of allosteric modulators. Some just extend the time an agonist is bound, while others cause the agonist to function as stronger agonists. Additionally, different allosteric sites can even modulate different cells, so it's best not to generalize them.\n\nReceptors themselves also possess varying characteristics. The stereotypical receptors that most people know of are the G-coupled variety (metabotropic receptors). Some, but not all of these receptors also possess beta arrestin proteins, which are thought to play a pivotal role in their internalization (or downregulation). They have also been proposed as being responsible for the side effects of opioid drugs, but [some research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898656820303831) casts doubt on that theory.\n\nWith G-coupled protein receptors, there are stimulatory (cAMP-promoting) types referred to as Gs, inhibitory types (Gi) and those that activate phospholipase C and have many downstream effects, referred to as Gq. \n\nThere are also ligand-gated ion channels (ionotropic receptors), tyrosine kinase receptors, enzyme-linked receptors and nuclear receptors. And surely more.\n\n**Basics of pharmacodynamics II (competitive vs. noncompetitive inhibition):**\n\n\"Real\" antagonists (aka silent antagonists) inhibit a receptor via competition at the same binding site, making them mutually exclusive. Noncompetitive antagonists bind at the allosteric site, but instead of decreasing other ligands' affinity, they block the downstream effects of agonists. Agonists can still bind with a noncompetitive antagonist present. Uncompetitive antagonists are noncompetitive antagonists that also act as NAMs to prevent binding.\n\nA reversible antagonist acutely depresses activity of an enzyme or receptor, whereas the irreversible type form a covalent bond that takes much longer to dislodge.\n\n**Basics of pharmacodynamics III (receptor affinity):**\n\nOnce a drug has effectively entered the brain, small amounts will distribute throughout to intracellular and extracellular regions. In most cases, you can't control which region of the brain the drug finds itself in, which is why selective ligands are used instead to activate receptors that interact desirably with certain cells.\n\nAt this stage, the drug is henceforth measured volumetrically, in uMol or nMol units per mL or L as it has distributed across the brain. How the drug's affinity will be presented depends on its mechanism of action.\n\nThe affinity of a ligand is presented as Kd, whereas the actual potency is represented as EC50 - that is, the amount of drug needed to bring a target to 50% of the maximum effect. There is also IC50, which specifically refers to how much is needed to inhibit an enzyme by 50%. That being said, EC50 does not imply \"excitatory\", in case you were confused. Sometimes EC50 is used over IC50 for inhibition because a drug is a partial agonist and thus cannot achieve an inhibition greater than 40%. EC50 can vary by cell type and region.\n\nLow values for Kd indicate higher affinity, because it stands for \"dissociation constant\", which is annoyingly nonintuitive. It assumes how much of a drug must be present to inhibit 50% of the receptor type, in the absence of competing ligands. A low value of dissociation thus represents how associated it is at small amounts.\n\nKi is specifically about inhibition strength, and is less general than Kd. It represents how little of a substance is required to inhibit 50% of the receptor type. \n\nSo broadly speaking, Kd can be used to determine affinity, EC50 potency. For inhibitory drugs specifically, Ki can represent affinity, and IC50 potency.\n\n**Basics of pharmacodynamics IV (phosphorylation and heteromers):**\n\nSometimes different receptors can exist in the same complex. A heteromer with two receptors would be referred to as a heterodimer, three would be a heterotrimer, four a heterotetramer, and so on. As such, targeting one receptor would result in cross-communication between otherwise distant receptors.\n\nOne such example would be adenosine 2 alpha, of which caffeine is an antagonist. There is an A2a-D2 tetramer, and antagonism at this site [positively modulates D2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6306650/), resulting in a stereotypical dopaminergic effect. Another example would be D1-D2 heteromers, which are [accelerated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6971351/) by chronic THC use and are believed to play an important role in the cognitive impairment it facilitates, as well as motivation impairment. \n\nProtein phosphorylation is an indirect way in which receptors can be activated, inhibited or functionally altered. In essence, enzymatic reactions trigger the covalent binding of a phosphate group to a receptor, which can produce similar effects to those described with ligands. One example of this would be Cordycepin [inhibiting hippocampal AMPA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6493540/) by acting as an adenosine 1 receptor agonist, while simultaneously [stimulating prefontal cortex AMPA receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4851261/) by phosphorylating specific subunits.",

    "body": "I have **combination skin with an oily T-zone and dry acne prone cheeks laden with PIH**, an aftermath of 2020 and some wrong skincare choices. Since I am acne prone, I try to avoid perfume/fragrance, alcohol and essential oils in my products. \n\n*Processing img thx4k3izjnf61...*\n\nI have tried a bunch of sunscreens and these are the **best ones** I have settled on after a long 2 years of trial and error and time/money/effort invested. I have tried to include the swatches of all the four sunscreens and the white cast whereever it was possible (suncros) for the camera to capture. Lets begin.\n\nProduct Name: **Suncros Soft Matte Finish Gel, SPF 50, PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave\n\nAvailability in India: Easily Available in India, offline and online.\n\nIngredient list: Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nSunscreen type: Physical / Mineral \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zgtf9w6knf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0796b78286edcc7126df7421f34ae34c3ae1c7c8\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using this sunscreen since almost one year. I used to use UV Doux before this for as long as I can remember, but had to stop using it as my skin got really sensitive and I had damaged my skin barrier. \n\nYou definitely cannot use the recommended two fingers of sunscreen with this one as it gets really heavy and suffocating. I tried layering it in small amounts (maybe just one fingertip at a time), let that settle and then apply another fingertip. I could only do two fingertips with this one. It did work for my extremely sensitive skin at that time and miraculously it was even calming and healing for my active acne and the PIH post acne was really minimal. The texture is in between a cream and a gel as can be seen in the picture. I totally understand why people detest it so much, the heavy suffocating feeling is a put off. I am not going to lie, it is heavy, feels like a suffocating layer on your face and is uncomfortable but you get used to the feeling once you see that its actually working for your extremely sensitive skin when nothing else does. You have to properly blend it in, take a minute or two to actually spread it on the skin. I have tried to photograph the white cast this one gives immediately post application. but once it settles in 30 minutes or so, the white cast is almost negligible and gives a primer finish (I am NC 43-45 for reference). I don't use makeup so I don't know how it would perform under makeup. The reapplication is difficult. I blot my face a lil before I apply this and again it takes a while to settle which is irritating if you are out and about. I could never reapply this more than once. It is sweat proof, tested it in peak of summer. This is the only zinc oxide based sunscreen that did not dry out my cheeks. \n\nAll said and done, I can't seem to make it work as my stand alone sunscreen as two fingertip amount is just not going to cut it when you are on all sorts of actives. Hence, since I have healed my skin barrier now and can use chemical sunscreens again, I use it over my cheeks (an area where my PIH is the worst) layered over my chemical sunscreen, after it completely dries. It's the perfect sweet spot for me and helps with PIH.\n\nRepurchase Status: Holy Grail (HG). Already repurchased twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Bello Photostable Emugel Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Easily available offline and online.\n\nIngredient list:\n\nKey Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, Ethylhexyltriazone Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyltriazine, Diethyl amino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate.\n\nOther ingredients: Purified water, Dimethicone and Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl phosphate, Ceteth-10 phosphate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Myristyl Myristate, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic Triglyceride, Pentaerythirtyl distearate, Phenyl trimethicone, Vitamin E acetate, Carbomer copolymer, Disodium Edetate, Trolamine, Sodium polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Methyparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr24pvoaknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f726d323339bee404855990ab043e2a3b051acc2\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using it everyday since approximately 4 months. The texture is creamy and you have to work it in for like 2 minutes into the skin. Immediately post-application, the sunscreen feels greasy to touch and looks oily but it gets absorbed into the skin in about 10 minutes and leaves a dewy finish which never goes away. I really like the dewy healthy glow it gives me. I can actually use 2 finger amount of sunscreen and it doesn't leave a white cast on my dark skin tone. If it gets into your eyes, it does sting. I can assume that dry skinned people would loooooove this in the winters. If you are combination or oily, I feel you can completely skip the moisturiser step when using this in summers. Would be perfect for inclusion in a minimal routine in the AM. On reapplication, it does leave a little bit of white cast on the sides of the face where we tend to have the peach-fuzz which will go away with a little bit of rubbing. Overall, this is the best budget sunscreen easily available in India which doesn't make us look like we have dressed up for a meme.\n\nRepurchase Status: HG, WRP. Already repurchased thrice. I will be trying out Photostable Gold SPF 55 in the summer, maybe it will replace this one. If not, I will always come back to this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Biore UV Smooth Kids Milk Spf 50 PA++++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Availability is a serious issue. Used to get it from Dokodemo pre-pandemic. Haven't been able to source since.\n\nIngredient list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Glyceryl Behenate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Distearate, Sodium Acrylate/​Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Paraffin, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Ceresin, Isohexadecane, Arginine, Lauryl Methacrylate/​Sodium Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 80, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Dextrin Palmitate, Agar, Petrolatum, Succinic Acid, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, BHT.\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjsnx8acknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e3e74e3ba70e6471b63c4d83bd3d41c2e876eab\n\nExperience & opinion: I had been using it everyday in dry summer days. Where I live is not very humid and that's why I think this one works so well for me. The texture is very aptly described as milk since it feels like a thick emulsion and spreads into nothingness into the skin. I can use the recommended amount of sunscreen with this one and it doesn't leave a white cast at all. It gets absorbed into the skin within 2 minutes and leaves behind a comfortable breathable layer of moisture on your skin. It does not dry down matte. It doesn't irritate my eyes. Its just so perfect for my combination skin even on my oily T-zone in peak summer days.  Reapplication is such a breeze. I have reapplied it in a taxi, in my office, before a meeting without any downtime. I just absolutely love everything about this sunscreen except that I think it has been discontinued and I am crying over the loss of my only true HG sunscreen. If anyone from Biore is reading this, please accept my plea and bring this back into production!!!!!\n\nRepurchase Status: HG forever. Although on the look out yet again for something that would match this one's status!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **The Blessing Tree Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rant\n\nAvailability in India: Available on Amazon.\n\nIngredient list: \n\nKey Ingredients: Octyl Methoxy Cinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide.\n\nOther ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1, 3, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates /​ C10-30 Alkyl Acrylare Cross Polymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Sryngylidene Melonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside (and) Anhydroxylitol (and) Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume.  That was a task to type!!!!!\n\nSunscreen type: Hybrid\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52ec0gwdknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8dd848f71d4a3939aa1b3ea6f13df4428170a9b\n\nExperience & opinion: I have had this for around 1 1/2 years now. But I never had the courage to put it on my face due to the infamous \"perfume\" in the inci list as I had a compromised barrier and could tolerate only physical sunscreens. All said and done, this has served well as an excellent body sunscreen which doesn't break the bank and provides me excellent protection. It is non-greasy unlike the other body sunscreens on the market. The white cast disappears within 5-10 minutes and you are good to get dressed and head out of the house. I apply it on all the exposed areas of my body - neck, upper shoulders, arms, hands (I don't feel guilty reapplying it even with the frequent hand washing as its relatively affordable + acts as a moisturiser for me) and feet. \n\nHowever for the sake of this review, I mustered all the courage I had to try it on the face but alas it did not suit me and caused me CC's by evening. It spreads well, leaves a white cast on skin which disappears in about 5-10 minutes, although the white residue along the hairline just doesn't disappear. I had to rub it excessively, almost rubbed it out to get it out of my peach fuzz! The finish on this sunscreen is not ultra matte and nor is it dewy to touch, its almost in between which is comfortable for combination and oily skin types. I was worried that this might get drying on my cheeks as the day progressed due to the zinc oxide content but it did not get dried at all. While I was typing the inci list, I realised it has Niacinamide in it!!! Yet another amazing ingredient to be present in this sunscreen. All in all, I would say if you don't have sensitive/sensitized skin and are okay with the \"O\" sunscreen filters, this is an excellent sunscreen.  \n\nRepurchase Status: Might repurchase for body. Not suitable for my face.\n\nThis review took me almost a month to write and photograph, but I am ultimately happy with the final write-up. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this! I have tried to include everything based on the rules of this sub, but still if you have any questions, do hit me up.\n\nI will make another post of the sunscreens which didn't work for me and would include the likes of Cipla Rivela tint sunscreen, Hada Labo UV Perfect Gel, Skin Aqua UV Moisture Gel, Photostable Insta,  Aroma Magic Mineral Sunscreen and The Mom's Co. Mineral Based Sunscreen.",

    "body": "Hi. I'm Heather Simpson. And this is the story of how I went from being a hardcore anti-vaxxer to a pro-vaxxer.\n\nYou probably don't know who I am, because I am a nobody to most people. But back in 2019 and the beginning of 2020, I was a viral anti-vaccine \"influencer.\" Let me explain.\n\nI was fully vaccinated as a child. In 2011 I barely poked myself with antique jewelery and I ran to my doctor's office to get a tetanus shot. I was pro vaccine because I was raised to be. My parents are awesome.\n\nAnd then one day....fear crept in. It came in the form of an advertisement dedicated to an anti-vaccine documentary series. My husband and I wanted kids, and I knew this subject was important, so I caved and dumped $200 into the series. 😳\n\nThe series, as you can imagine, described how vaccines are linked to almost every single bad condition you can think of. And, as a young woman preparing to enter motherhood, I didn't know any better. They fed me fear and I ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I was, from that point on, convinced that vaccines could and would cause autism, SIDS, autoimmune diseases, and death in general.\n\nI continued to study anti vaccine theories. You can find anything you want to support your claim, if only you set your mind to it. And boy did I find some things. I mostly found an abundance of fear based stories that terrified me. I decided I was never letting a vaccine near my child or I. \n\nEver.\n\nWhen my child was born in 2017, we gave her the vitamin k shot (which I was scolded by some anti-vaxxers for, and was told it caused her to have health issues) and we opted to give her no vaccines. I was confident in our decision, and so was my husband.\n\nWhen she was about 18 months old, or the Winter of 2019, I started posting on Facebook about my vaccine hesitancy. To be honest, that was a lie, as I was not \"hesitant\"...I KNEW I didn't like vaccines. But I figured looking \"hesitant\" would make me seem less crazy. When I first posted my views and hesitations on vaccines, my post got shared several hundred times.\n\nI was shocked. Friend requests started pouring in. I didn't know what was happening. So I kept posting my views on vaccines, people kept sharing my posts, and my audience grew. It was wild and completely unexpected. I had no idea that this world of anti-vaccine moms and dads existed on social media.\n\nThey were so supportive and I made life long friends that I will always treasure. This whole experience was worth it if not just for the friends I made.\n\nFast forward to October of 2019 when I dressed as the measles because I was \"trying to think of the least scary thing I could be for Halloween.\" Yall, I am taking this moment to openly tell you I was the worst. \n\nThe. Actual. Worst.\n\nIt didn’t even look like measles. It looked like syphilis.\n\nAnd then it went viral. Like, real viral.\n\nIt blew up on both Facebook and Reddit, and several national news oulets picked it up. I got death threats and people begged me to kill myself. It was bad. I did it to myself and I should never have dressed as something so heartless, but it was bad. I was shaken up quite a bit.\n\nA few months later, however, Febraury of 2020 arrived. I started to feel different about things. I was relying on western medicine to treat my endometriosis, I had just had surgery, and had been studying vaccines from a different standpoint. I started to soften my anti-vax views. But when I posted about this softening of my views, a lot of the anti-vax crowd lost it on me. They were furious and just plain cruel. \n\nIt was then that I realized a lot of them are very cult-like, because they will cast you out if you don't have an identical belief system as them. Don't get me wrong, there are MANY of them that are not this way, in whom I love and adore. But a LOT of them are militant about their anti-vax beliefs. They claim to be \"pro medical freedom\" but will tear you apart if you choose a different medical decision than them. \n\nThey bullied me so hard that I ended up in the ER with a panic attack. It was one of the worst weeks of my life....all because I was softening my views on vaccines. \n\nAnd then they \"cancelled\" me. Ohhhh, that online cancel culture. Gotta love it. \n\nBut, if I'm being honest, it turned out to be one of the biggest blessings. Because I then had time to read, think, study and grow on my own without the \"group think\" influencing me.\n\nAnd here I am now, planning to get my flu shot next week. I will also be getting my COVID vaccine. We will also be following our pediatrician's recommended vaccine schedule for our toddler. (I will not be discussing details as it is her private medical record.)\n\nHOW DID I GET HERE?! \n\nThat's really why you're reading this article, after all. So, allow me to explain the magic that happened in those months of studying after being “cancelled.”\n\nFirst of all, when approaching an anti-vaxxer, you have to realize that there are usually three types. Typically, one is a conspiracy theorist, one is scared, and one is an ex-vaxxer. Sometimes they are all three. Sometimes they are none of these. Each person is unique, but these are the three categories I’ve typically observed. Depending on what catergory they fall into is going to help you to know how to approach then.\n\nMy category? I was scared. Terrified. I did not want to inject something into my child if I thought it was going to kill her. I wanted to protect my baby with my life. This is most anti-vaxxers I know. They are fiercely protective of their children, just like pro-vaxxers, and only want to keep them safe. \n\nAnd, to clarify, this is not a bad person versus good person debate. There are incredible parents on both sides. \n\nBut I digress. I kept reading horrifying anecdotes from moms who would say that their baby died the day after vaccines. Or that their baby stopped talking the week later. Or that their baby stopped walking the month after. \n\nWhat finally caused me to start to question my anti-vax beliefs was when I started digging into each of these anectdotes to find the real truth, instead of blindly trusting stories. I found some of them to be true, definitely. But...I started to see that a lot of the \"vaccine deaths\" were actually due to co-sleeping accidents or other underlying conditions. The timing was just very, very unfortunate. The whole situation was sad. But vaccines inevitably took the blame. \n\nAnd sometimes the vaccine DID cause the baby's death or disability. Vaccines have never claimed to be 100% safe. Sometimes your baby is one of the rare statistics. Which makes it even harder to have discernment when reading anecdotes and trying not to be overcome with fear.\n\nI got to a point where I was so engulfed in every anecdote, that I lost my ability to critically think about a situation past my emotions. I would read a story, feel sick to my stomach, and swear to never vaccinate my child.\n\nBut the problem is, anectdotes without proof can get out of hand quickly in the hands of social media. Susie could have broken her leg on the swingset the day after her tetanus shot, but the way Susie's mom told it on social media was that Susie got her shot, and now she can't walk. Then this post gets spread 20,000 times. You now have a bunch of parents not wanting their child to get the tetanus shot because of COURSE they don't want to risk their child losing their ability to walk.\n\nI was told that my child's sleep apnea was due to her Vitamin K shot, and that her heart arrythmia was due to the vaccines I received in my childhood. If someone develops an autoimmune disease 15 years after their vaccines, some anti-vaxxers will still blame the vaccines. People need a reason explaining why they are sick. People need a reason their kid is sick. Vaccines are the perfect scapegoat, no matter how long it has been since they received them.\n\nThe next thing that started pulling me away from the anti-vaccine movement was VAERS. Also known as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. There was something like 48,000 events registered in 2019 alone. But here's the deal: parents can report anything with no proof. Causation does not have to be established to make the list. \n\nFor example, these are real documented events on VAERS:\n\nGunshot wound, fight in school, frostbite, infection of mites, electric shock from a hair straightener, drowning, damaged hair from incorrect hair bleach mixture, sunburn, tested positive for an STD, sports injury (dodge ball), sports injury (football), suicidal ideation due to breakup with boyfriend, murder, motor vehicle accident, and many, many more.\n\nSome anti-vaxxers use VAERS as one of their strongest arguments, but as you can see, by doing this they are able to claim that a sunburn is a vaccine injury. Which, it's just...not.\n\nThe next thing I started studying, and again what many anti-vaxxers use in their arguments, is the vaccine package inserts. They use it as a \"gotcha\" argument. I used this argument too, and was very confident in it. \n\nThe problem, however, is that the pacakage insert is a legal document, one that has to list any adverse event that occured subsequent to the vaccine or during clinical trials or post-marketing studies. No causal relationship has to be proven, but they legally have to list everything that happens. The Gardasil vaccine insert, for example, lists gunshot wounds, car wrecks, and suicide as an adverse event.\n\nNext, I examined the ingredients. The ingredients were the biggest thing I was afraid of. \n\nLet's talk about aluminum, because mercury for the most part has been eliminated from vaccines and aluminum has stolen the spotlight. Babies receive about 10 mg of aluminum their first six months of life if they are breastfed, 30 mg if the are formula fed, and 120 milligrams if they are soy formula fed. But they only receive 4 mg of aluminum from vaccines in their first six months of life on the current vaccine schedule. \n\nScientists have also done research that shows that the aluminum from vaccines does not raise the blood level of aluminum already in your system, and that the aluminum from vaccines exits so quickly that half of it is gone from your body by the next day.\n\nThe second scary ingredient I forced myself to examine is Formaldehyde. It is used to inactivate the viruses and bacteria in the vaccines. Because of that, you are going to end up with some formaldehyde in the final product. The amount of formaldehyde in a vaccine, not exceeding one tenth of a milligram, is considered safe, as you already naturally have formaldehyde in your circulation. Formaldehyde is required in humans for the synthesis of thymidine, purines, and amino acids-which are all necessary for the formation of DNA.\n\nEveryone has detectible formaldehyde in their bloodstream, or about 2.5 micrograms per milliliter of blood. If you take an average weight of a 2 month old (11 pounds) with an average blood volume of 85 milliliters per kilogram, the total quanitity found naturally in that infant's blood would be about 1 milligram. 1 milligram of formaldehyde is ten times that which is in a vaccine. \n\nAnd for the third scary ingredient I examined, we have Polysorbate 80. Anti-vaxxers believe this chemical will open the blood brain barrier (BBB) up and allow aluminum to slip through into the brain. The problem with this, however, is that it is physically impossible for that to happen. But opening up the BBB is not as simple as it sounds. Assuming a vaccine contains 50 mcg (HPV vaccine, for example), a 10 pound baby would have to have dozens upon dozens of vaccines injected straight into its carotid artery to have even a CHANCE at opening up the BBB. Polysorbate 80 is also a very unstable chemical that gets attacked by esterases in your tissue at a very fast rate, and has a half life of 1.07 hours. (1,2)\n\nBut ultimately, what finally changed my mind, was having people reach out, listen to my fears, and talk to me. The thousands of mean comments didn't change my mind. In fact, those comments made me think I was even more in the right. If I had enemies, after all, then I must be doing something right. Those awful comments had the oppopsite effect of the pro vaccine person's intentions.\n\nBut when friends calmly and patiently explained the science to me, showing they cared more about me than about changing my mind, my mind started to open up to the fact that I could be wrong. That's when I started reading a book called \"The Vaccine Book\" by Dr. Robert Sears. He lays out information in a middle-ground sort of way. He seemed to be both pro and anti vax, with a very open mind and honest approach to both positions.  As I read, I started to realize that I trusted the doctor in this book, and that these vaccine injury posts on Facebook just did not line up to the number of vaccine injuries he stated had happened. \n\nBut the final straw that broke the camel's back was when I was hospitalized due to bruising everywhere and endometriosis. The care I received from the medical team was amazing. The western medicine they gave me helped me so much. I realized many anti-vaxxers are anti-vax based on the theory that scientists and doctors are in on a conspiracy to kill or maim children for money. It dawned on me that I definitely don't believe that, and am not a conspiracy theorist at all. \n\nThere is no way that thousands of doctors and scientists are out to kill or maim our kids. It's statistically impossible. Most of them are amazing people with huge hearts for kids. \n\nI want to apologize for anybody I hurt during my anti-vax days. I was harsh, sarcastic, and extremely hurtful. I know that there is a lot of ableism in the anti-vax movement, so just know this: your autistic child was born perfectly. Do not let anyone tell you that they need to be cured or fixed. I am so sorry if I ever promoted ableism. That was never my heart or intent, of course, but I am sorry if I did regardless. I would like to ask the pro vaccine and medical community's forgiveness for my flippant attitude, my Dunning Kruger effect that I put on like a a pair of shoes daily, and my measles costume that looked more like syphilis. I am so sorry. \n\nSo, here I am. About to get my flu shot once I recover from a small case of pneumonia. Planning to trust doctors and scientists from here on out. Wish me luck on my journey-I am looking forward to seeing where it leads me. \n\nEdit to add: I am now aware that Dr. Bob Sears is not a great doctor to follow. I highly recommend “Vaccines and Your Child” by Paul Offit, M.D., and Charlotte A Moser.",

    "body": "**What motivated this review:**\n\nI grew up in an area with access to natural hot springs.  I used to go for soaks in the geothermal pools quite often and it was (and still is) one of my favorite things to do.  I now live quite far away from where I grew up and sadly there aren't any hot springs within driving distance. Feeling a bit homesick this past winter, I tried out a bunch of Japanese hot springs powders and thought you guys might be interested in some reviews.\n\n\n[Album of the products reviewed.](http://imgur.com/a/B4wC5)\n\n[Bonus cat pic](http://imgur.com/bA5dtMf)\n\n\n**Bath Roman Muddy White**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/5ZXT7Ri)\n\n- I purchased this on Amazon Prime (~$18 for 680g tin).\n\n**Claims:** (from product description on distributor website, Larkin US)\n\n>  Contains Angelicae Radix Extract that increases blood circulation and relieves aches and fatigue\n>  Contains Dried Puerariae Radix Extract that increases skin vitality\n>  Helps to ease rheumatism, cold constitution and relieving fatigue\n> Transforms bathwater into milky white color with a calming citrus floral fragrance\n\n**Ingredients:**  \n- Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, Japanese angelica root extract, pueraria lobata root extract, fragrance.\n\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This was my favorite out of all of the bath powders I tried.  Lovely scent and very relaxing bathing experience! I've seen it described in marketing materials as \"fresh citrus floral bouquet\" but it doesn't smell how I'd imagine based on description alone. There are notes of citrus, but they are subtle. Stronger when you smell it in the tin, and seem to fade once the powder is dissolved in the bathwater.  The floral fragrance is similar to what I think of as hanbang: musky and herbal. Not sickly sweet. Neither feminine nor masculine.  There are notes of rose, but not like Mamonde rose, more like musky rose incense.  The scent is strong but IMO not overpowering. A little bit goes a long way.\n\n\n- RE the claims, adding this to the bathwater does seem to make the heat hold longer and it does soothe minor muscle aches and pains.  However, it definitely does not cure fatigue, as I'm usually so relaxed by the end of it that I'm ready to fall asleep in the bath.  I'm also skeptical of the claims about skin vitality.  It does make my skin feel silky, but beyond that the benefits to skin seem pretty negligible.\n\n\n\n**Bath Roman Muddy Blue**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/s8nXU5q) \n\n- Purchased on Amazon Prime (~$18 for 680g tin)\n\n**Claims:**  (from a description found on Rakuten)\n\n> [H]ot spring mineral (sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen sulfate) and herbal medicines (angelica extract) can work to the core of the body to enhance the warm bath effect, stiff shoulders medicated bath agent that is effective in low back pain, neuralgia. In warm coat of assimilated active ingredients, hot spring mineral turbidity hot water to enhance the warm bath effect prevents Yuzame. Protein and hot springs mineral of the surface of the skin to create a thin film on the entire body, in order to prevent the dissipation of heat, thermal effect will persist. In addition, herbal ingredients, angelica extract (active ingredient) is, to enhance the warm bath effect, warm the body from the core. To promote blood circulation, it is also effective in recovery from fatigue because loosen the body.\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- dried sodium sulfate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, Toukiekisu distributed, oxidation Ti, POE (300) POP (55), perfume, silicic acid anhydride, stearoylglutamic acid Na, anhydrous pyrophosphate Na, salicylic acid, bentonite, glycine, Jiouekisu, BG, blue No. 1\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This smells strongly of artificial fruit in the tin. At first whiff, it reminded me of Sweet Tarts candy.  A reviewer on Amazon compared it to Pez with a hint of flowers, which I think is pretty accurate.  It mellows out quite a bit once it's in the water.  The fragrance is not as strong as some of the other varieties.  The powder is a dark blue right out of the tin.  True to its description, it makes the bathwater a cloudy blue color.  \n\n- RE the claims, adding this to the bathwater does seem to make the heat hold longer.  I am skeptical about the claim that it forms a film that keeps your body temperature warm after leaving the bath.  I didn't notice any real difference compared to the warmth I feel after taking a regular old bath.  I am not sure what “Yuzame” means or why I'd want to prevent it, but the claim about relaxing muscles is definitely true, IMO.\n\n\n**Bath Roman Muddy Green**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/Ro6TWEM)\n\n- Purchased on Amazon Prime (~$24 for 680g tin)\n\n**Claims:**  (from a description found on Rakuten)\n\n> About 90% of hot spring mineral and herbal component of all the components. Enhance the warm bath effect in warm coat of turbidity hot water, to prevent Yuzame. Effective, such as fatigue, shoulder rest, low back pain, neuralgia, poor circulation, arthritis, heat rash, eczema, roughening resistance.\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- The scent is herbal, floral and slightly fruity. There are notes of passionfruit and citrus. Right out of the tin, the product is dark green.  It turns the bathwater into a beautiful cloudy bright green color.  \n\n- RE the claims, I can't speak to the parts about “neuralgia, poor circulation, arthritis, heat rash, eczema” and not sure what “roughening resistance” even means, but this one is just as good at relaxing tired muscles as the blue and white varieties.\n\n\n**Bath Roman Japanese Cypress (Hinoki) **  \n\n[pic](http://imgur.com/rdj2I3t)\n\n- Purchased from Rakuten (Master of Life) (~486 yen or ~$5 USD for 680g tin) but wouldn’t recommend that because it was very expensive to ship (even with SAL shipping, it came out to be about the same amount as Amazon or eBay, but took 10 times longer to get to me).  \n \n**Claims:**   (from a description found on Rakuten)\n\n> [A] medicinal bath salt series with natural essences, relaxing. Ion veil wraps the whole body, retains its warm after bathing, bath effect. Stiff neck, back pain, poor circulation, fatigue effects.\n\n**Ingredients:** \n\n- sodium sulfate, sodium carbonate, thehalose hinokitol, fragrance, D&C Yellow no. 8, polyoxyproplene glycol\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- Straight out of the tin, this stuff is orange in color and smells strongly of earthy pine with a hint of smoky campfire.  A more masculine scent overall.  Once it's in the bathwater, it mellows out but the pine notes stick around.  It turns the bathwater a cloudy orangy white color.  The effect of this one is similar to the Muddy varieties reviewed above.\n\n**Bath Roman Milk Protein**  \n\n[pic](http://imgur.com/q8yX8k8) \n\n- Purchased from Rakuten (Master of Life) (~486 yen or ~$5 USD for 680g tin) but wouldn’t recommend that because it was very expensive to ship (even with SAL shipping, it came out to be about the same amount as Amazon or eBay, but took 10 times longer to get to me).  \n\n**Claims:**  (from product description on distributor website, Larkin US)\n\n> Milk protein penetrates into dry skin cells, replenishing your skin's moisture level.\n> Soaking with Japanese bath powder keeps severely dry skin moisturized and nourished.\n\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n- sodium bicarbonate, sodium caseinate, fragrance, parabens, polyoxypropylene glycol\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This smells like sweetened condensed milk, but not in a bad way.  It’s a lovely sweet steamed milk and slightly floral, slightly baby powder scent, more feminine than some of the others.  It reminds me of Etude House Milk Talk body wash with a bit less baby powder and a bit more milk.  It didn’t seem that strong to me, but my husband came home while I was in the bath and he could smell it when he walked into the house (which is saying something because our bathtub is on another floor). True to the description, this does turn the water a milky white color.  It made my skin feel silky smooth, but I am skeptical about the claims about nourishing dry skin.  My skin certainly didn't feel dry afterward, but it wasn't incredibly moisturized, either.  My skin is naturally on the oily side, so someone with dry skin would probably not find it very moisturizing at all.\n\n\n**Bath Roman Ceramide**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/vHSKQ2t)\n\n- Purchased from Rakuten (Master of Life) (~486 yen or ~$5 USD for 680g tin) but wouldn’t recommend that because it was very expensive to ship (even with SAL shipping, it came out to be about the same amount as Amazon or eBay, but took 10 times longer to get to me).  \n\n**Claims:**  (from product description on distributor website, Larkin US)\n\n> Contains Ceramides that replenish and retain moisture in the skin.\n> Helps eczema, acne, heat rash and other skin irritations.\n> Leaves skin smooth and moisturized after bathing.\n> Soaking with Japanese bath salts relaxes, moisturizes and polishes rough skin.\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n- Sodium bicarbonate, sodium caseinate, fragrance, parabens, polyoxypropylene glycol\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This has a bright, fresh lilac and clean linen scent.  It turned the bathwater a milky white color.  It made my skin feel soft and moisturized, but was not emollient.\n\n- Consistent with my review of the Milk variety, I am skeptical about the claims about moisturizing dry skin.  My skin certainly didn't feel dry afterward, but it wasn't incredibly moisturized, either.  My skin is naturally on the oily side, so someone with dry skin would probably not find it very moisturizing at all. I am lucky to have pretty tolerant skin that's not prone to irritation, so I can't speak to the claims about healing eczema, acne, heat rash and other skin irritations.\n\n**Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe (Uruoi)**  \n\n[pic](http://imgur.com/bJlMZzN)\n\n- Purchased from Japanese grocery store (~$8 for 600g), but you can buy it on Amazon for ~$12 shipped (not Prime)\n\n**Claims:**  (from description on Amazon)\n\n> Increase blood circulation and warm your core. Emerge renewed.\n \n**Ingredients:** \n\n- Sodium sulfate, titanium dioxide, sodium glutamate, fragrance, silica, PEG-75 stearate, cellulose gum, sodium polyacrylate, sekken soji, polyacrylic acid, bentonite, water, butylene glycol, methicone, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, pvp, aloe yohjyu matsu ekisu, sodium hyaluronate.\n\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This was my least favorite of all the bath powders I tried, largely because of the scent.  It’s like a combination of artificial cucumber, lime, Pine Sol and Degree men's deodorant.   That said, it was the most moisturizing and emollient of all the bath powders I tried.  RE the claim about increasing blood circulation and warm[ing] the core,” my hunch is that it's mostly the hot bath water that is responsible for this, rather than the powder itself.\n\n\n**Bathclin Pure Skin**  \n[Pic](http://imgur.com/An3xsiP)\n\n- Purchased from a Japanese grocery store (~$8 for 600g), but you can buy it on Amazon Prime for ~$13\n\n**Claims:**  (from description on Amazon - same as Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe)\n\n> Increase blood circulation and warm your core. Emerge renewed.   \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\n- Sodium sulfate, titanium dioxide, sodium glutamate, fragrance, PEG-75 stearate, cellulose gum, silica, sodium polyacrylate, sekken soji, polyacrylic acid, bentonite, methicone, hydrolyzed collagen, water, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, pvp, glycine soja (soybean) seed extract.\n\n\n**Review:** \n\n- After trying and disliking the scent of Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe, I admit that I was not super eager to try this one, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Like the Bath Roman muddy white, this is marketed as having a “citrus floral” scent.  However, this one actually does have a strong citrus fragrance.  It smells strongly of grapefruit, which to me is heavenly.  There's a hint of Lemon Pledge fragrance, but I don't find it bothersome.\n\n- It could be my imagination, but I swear there is a slight effervescent effect right after the powder goes into the bathwater.  It turned the bathwater a milky white color.  It made my skin feel silky smooth but was not nearly as moisturizing as Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe.  RE the claim about increasing blood circulation and warm[ing] the core,” my hunch is that it's mostly the hot bath water that is responsible for this, rather than the powder.\n\n**Tabino Yado Hot Springs: Milky and Clear varieties**\n\n[Pic of the Clear varieties] (http://imgur.com/QBo58U1) (unfortunately I accidentally got rid of the box for the Milky varieties :-/)\n\n- I purchased these on Amazon Prime (~$23 for 28 packets), but you can also buy boxes of Milky (13 packets, 25g each) and Clear (15 packets, 25g each) separately for around $12 each.\n\n**Claims:**  (from description on Amazon)\n\n- Each of the 9 different varieties is supposed to represent a famous Japanese [onsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsen).\n\n- According to the product description:\n> [n]ot a perfume or bubble bath - Minerals promote circulation and warmth... Intense aromas relax you and last as long as your bath!\n\n**Ingredients for Milky varieties:**\n\n- [KIRISHIMA] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, fragrance, silica, aconus calamus root extract, aloe arborescens leaf extract, dipropylene glycol, alcohol, water, FD&C red no.28, FD&C yellow blue no.1 \n\n- [OKUHIDA] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminim silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090)\n\n- [SHIRAHONE] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, sodium glutamate, calcium carbonate, kaolin, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, potassium chloride, silica, cellulose gum, fragrance, ci no.59040 pyranine conc, ci no.73015 indigo carmine, \n\n- [TOWADA] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminim silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090).\n\n\n**Ingredients for Clear varieties:**\n\n- [BEPPU] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, fragrance, silica, aconus calamus root extract, aloe arborescens leaf extract, dipropylene glycol, alcohol, water, FD&C red no.28, FD&C yellow blue no.1 \n\n- [SHIRAHAMA] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminum silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090)\n\n- [HAKONE] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, sodium glutamate, calcium carbonate, kaolin, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, potassium chloride, silica, cellulose gum, fragrance, ci no.59040 pyranine conc, ci no.73015 indigo carmine, \n\n- [KUSATSU] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminum silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090)\n\n- [NOBORIBETSU] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, dextrin, calcium carbonate, silica, potassium chloride, fragrance.\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- These come in small packets.  The packets are color coded but there is no English labeling so it was hard for me to judge the individual varieties.  TBH, all 9 varieties (4 milky, 5 clear) seem very similar to one another in terms of scent.  Many of them smelled fruity, similar to the Pez candy smell of the Bath Roman Muddy Blue. The only real differences I could observe were the obvious ones: the color and whether the water looked milky or clear.  The results really didn’t seem to differ all that much.   They all smell pleasant and do a nice job relaxing sore muscles.\n\n\n**TL;DR** \n\n- The first one I tried was Bath Roman Muddy White, and it got me hooked!   The Bath Roman Muddy and Hinoki varieties were my favorites overall.  They all made my skin silky smooth, relaxed my tired muscles and seem to hold the heat of the bath water longer.  My favorite is still the Muddy White because I adore the scent.\n\n- Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe was my least favorite of all of them because of its scent.  \n\n- All of them made for a relaxing bath experience, which is really all that I expect out of this type of product.  Unfortunately, hot springs powders are no substitute for the real thing.  That said, these are still fantastic products for soothing sore muscles and stress relief!\n\nEdited formatting & added bonus cat pic",

    "body": "To me, price tag doesnt matter. Its whats INSIDE that matters. and i feel like i see a lot of people ignore the ingredients of their skincare and are getting scammed. on both the low dollar tree end and and the high end.\n\nNow i am not one to be scared of anything with a scientific name like Hydrogen oxide or call everything 'Chemicals'. But if a product claims to have a certain ingredient and its the LAST thing on the list under even fragrance and preservatives, i have questions. Or for what ingredients they claim to have they then package improperly like Vitamin C and Retinal in clear bottles.\n\nSome brands at the DT have proven time and time again to just not use enough of an active they claim they have in a product and its just a waste of my $1.25 (im looking at you BOLERO) while others have shockingly good ingredients like skin nutrition botanicals.\n\nAs a long time DT lover, this newer brand BPure is giving me Bolero vibes with some of their products, and thats an insult.... For example the new glow up serums. I took a look at the ingredients and they just dont line up with the claims on the package.\n\nHere are the ingredients for the strawberry one:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PEG/PPG-17/6 COPOLYMER, POLYSORBATE 80, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, CARBOMER, SODIUM ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ISOHEXADEC- ANE, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLHY-DROXAMIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, DISODIUM EDTA. FRAGRANCE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SODIUM HYALURONATE. SALICYLIC ACID, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM. LINALOOL, FRAGARIA ANANASSA (STRAWBERRY) FRUIT EXTRACT, CITRIC ACID, CARMINE (CI 75470)\n\nThis claims to have AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) and just just does not. it has citric acid which is technically an AHA, but its at the end of the list and in that amount is not doing anything. and the strawberry extract can be considered a 'natural aha' but again, thats not the claims and its so low it wont work like an AHA.\n\nHaving most the actives listed under fragrance means its likely under 1%. The Salicylic acid has to be like 1-2% to work. At MOST this serum is hydrating. but a very basic hydration at that. Which isnt bad, but not what it claims at ALL.\n\nBut then there are brands like skin nutrition and their claims on their products and the ingredients are actually shocking. The actives they claim are there in their true form (not like the AHA lie in the last one). They have correct percentages (and often TELL YOU the % for a lot of things). While they might not be the most life changing product, based on formula alone, they weirdly outclass a lot of brands and their claims for $1.25\n\nWhile i enjoy trying all the new products that come out, when i see items like the BPure strawberry smoothing serum, i get frustrated. They clearly can make and sell quality products like skin nutrition. It feels like they have started to pump out poor performing products that probably have a better profit margin since they dont contain very much of the more expensive ingredients and its \"just a $1.25\" so people scoop them all up since its viral.\n\nIs anyone else seeing this with recent launches? And BPure has put out some great products too, but they are so hit or miss with their claims and how they line up with whats in them. Just because i shop at DT doesnt mean i want to over consume. and i know its easy to just try everything, but it adds up. \n\nwhat viral DT beauty products have you noticed like this? what are your thought on this? Do you just trust what the product is claiming? What are your thoughts?\n\n",

        "body": "Buying DT beauty/skincare is  an option for those who enjoy frequently trying new products, love to experiment, and prefer an inexpensive/budget shopping experience. Over the years I have tried some DT products but have left behind most I had initially considered.  Because after checking the ingredient list, I have concluded that many  products simply won’t meet my needs. Fragrance, niacinamide, floral/fruit extracts are a no. Instead I stick to the OG skincare/haircare/cosmetic products that have never disappointed and I know work for my skin.  I just buy these on sale, stack my coupons, use store promotions and CVS ExtraBucks to restock the products I have already learned work best. For example, a bar of Vanicream soap might be as low as $4 after coupons and promotions. A Maybelline mascara might cost $5. That’s the same cost as four DT products at the current 1.25 price point.  Sure, I could buy 4 DT mascaras for that same $5, but they likely won’t be as effective or as consistent as a Maybelline product. However, if I saw my favorite Maybelline mascara at DT I would certainly buy at least two!\n\nWe can choose how to consume and we can all become smarter consumers. If an active ingredient is dead last or very far down the list, there’s a good chance that ingredient has such a low percentage that it will not produce appreciable results.\n\nAn educated DT consumer is a happier consumer. ❤️",

        "body": "I agree with a lot of what you have said. I think that those specific watermelon, strawberry, Avocado, etc. bpure serums are sort of useless and definitely unnecessary. Not Worth even your $1.25. And so I totally agree with that. \n\nI also agree that there are definitely products that don't have amounts of ingredients that are even going to be effective just like you said. That being said, I think a lot of people hear \"Dollar Tree\" and think, there's no way there's anything good in there or anything in an amount that's effective, which just isn't necessarily true at all. And so I'm glad that you also mentioned a couple brands that are doing good things cause I actually think there are several brands that have extremely effective combinations additionally. \n\nOne thing I thought would be important to point out for those who aren't as adept at ingredient list reading, It isn't always just about how high up in the ingredient list the ingredient is. Some things just have to come in very small percentages for the best situation for your skin. People think they want retinol to be the second ingredient, but we don't usually want like a huge percentage of retinol or something else. AND sometimes a large amount of retinol isn't even helpful if it's not actually being delivered into the skin with proper mechanisms. So an amount of retinol or Vitamin C or whatever underneath 1% could still be effective depending on the situation. \n\nThe whole vitamin C thing is super complicated as well because there's different types of vitamin C that require different percentages to be effective. And also it's just a not a very stable ingredient and so there's a lot of confusion there. \n\nHowever, that being said, I don't think we should write off all clear bottles that have what we consider sun sensitive ingredients like retinol. Studies have shown that while some ingredients prone to deteriorating in sunlight, that is specific to sunlight and not just like the light within the store or within the warehouse. And so in actuality, most of the product is not going to be exposed to very much sunlight at all because it would be made in a factory, stored in boxes, transported in boxes. And then stored in the store until you take it home. And then you have to decide where you're going to put it. It probably experiences minimal deterioration in such circumstances. So saying oh the retinol etcetera in this product is completely ineffective because it's in a clear bottle is over-simplistic and negating a lot of the good. \n\nOverall I agree with you but I just wanted to add some of my thoughts.",

        "body": "This is why I stick with Adapalene for my retinoid because I know it works because it had to be proven that works when it first hit the market as a prescription product. I buy cleanser and sometimes moisturizer from DT because I don’t really need actives per se from these products since I use Adapalene. I’m currently using the glow recipe watermelon moisturizer dupe which has niacinamide. I don’t know the quality of the niacinamide nor the percentage but for 1.25 I’m willing to try it since I’m not relying on it solely for an active ingredient. I prefer moisturizers with niacinamide when I can find them at DT. To me this moisturizer is meh - the packaging is nice since it’s a glass jar and it’s 2 oz. But it’s a very “wet” texture which I don’t like because then I can’t apply while my face is still damp which is customary for me. It takes a while to dry too. \n\nAs a side note - does anyone know if you can or need to exfoliate while using Adapalene? The packaging says not to use any other acne product so I just really haven’t really tried it but was curious if anyone knew.",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

I saw your science of rosacea post  and it pinged an area I've been struggling with. I always have very dry lips, despite drinking plenty of water and using a combo of Laniege lip mask and aquaphor lip ointment. I LOVE lipstick and it makes me really sad that my lips are constantly peeling despite my best efforts. (1) Is this a rosacea thing? (2) Any luck with HG products to help it?   \n\n\nI also have a rage spot on one eyelid. It is the first to flake if I go overboard on new stuff. Annoying but a helpful tool.",

    "body": "Garmi aaa gayi haiiii\\~ dhoop badh hui hai aur heatwaves pardhaar chuke hai 🥵🥵 obviously we need sunscreens! I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh.

I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao.

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

    "body": "I tie a plastic ice pack around my face and commence with the morning's stretching exercises. Afterwards I stand in front of a chrome and acrylic Washmobile bathroom sink - with soap dish, cup holder, and railings that serve as towel bars, which I bought at Hastings Tile to use while the marble sinks I ordered from Finland are being sanded - and stare at my reflection with the ice pack still on. I pour some Plax antiplaque formula into a stainless-steel tumbler and swish it around my mouth for thirty seconds.\n\nThen I squeeze Rembrandt onto a faux- tortoiseshell toothbrush and start brushing my teeth (too hung over to floss properly - but maybe I flossed before bed last night?) and rinse with Listerine. Then I inspect my hands and use a nailbrush. I take the ice-pack mask off and use a deep-pore cleanser lotion, then an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for ten minutes while I check my toenails. Then I use the Probright tooth polisher and next the Interplak tooth polisher (this in addition to the toothbrush) which has a speed of 4200 rpm and reverses direction forty-six times per second; the larger tufts clean between teeth and massage the gums while the short ones scrub the tooth surfaces. I rinse again, with Cepacol. I wash the facial massage off with a spearmint face scrub.\nThe shower has a universal all-directional shower head that adjusts within a thirty-inch vertical range. It's made from Australian gold-black brass and covered with a white enamel finish. In the shower I use first a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Vidal Sassoon shampoo is especially good at getting rid of the coating of dried perspiration, salts, oils, airborne pollutants and dirt that can weigh down hair and flatten it to the scalp which can make you look older. The conditioner is also good - silicone technology permits conditioning benefits without weighing down the hair which can also make you look older.\n\nOn weekends or before a date I prefer to use the Greune Natural Revitalizing Shampoo, the conditioner and the Nutrient Complex. These are formulas that contain D-panthenol, a vitamin-B-complex factor; polysorbate 80, a cleansing agent for the scalp; and natural herbs. Over the weekend I plan to go to Bloomingdale's or Bergdorf's and on Evelyn's advice pick up a Foltene European Supplement and Shampoo for thinning hair which contains complex carbohydrates that penetrate the hair shafts for improved strength and shine. Also the Vivagen Hair Enrichment Treatment, a new Redken product that prevents mineral deposits and prolongs the life cycle of hair. Luis Carruthers recommended the Aramis Nutriplexx system, a nutrient complex that helps increase circulation.\n\nOnce out of the shower and toweled dry I put the Ralph Lauren boxers back on and before applying the Mousse A Raiser, a shaving cream by Pour Hommes, I press a hot towel against my face for two minutes to soften abrasive beard hair. Then I always slather on a moisturizer (to my taste, Clinique) and let it soak in for a minute. You can rinse it off or keep it on and apply a shaving cream over it - preferably with a brush, which softens the beard as it lifts the whiskers - which I've found makes removing the hair easier. It also helps prevent water from evaporating and reduces friction between your skin and the blade. Always wet the razor with warm water before shaving and shave in the direction the beard grows, pressing gently on the skin. Leave the sideburns and chin for last, since these whiskers are tougher and need more time to soften. Rinse the razor and shake off any excess water before starting. Afterwards splash cool water on the face to remove any trace of lather. You should use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol. Never use cologne on your face, since the high alcohol content dries your face out and makes you look older. One should use an alcohol-free antibacterial toner with a water-moistened cotton ball to normalize the skin.\n\nApplying a moisturizer is the final step. Splash on water before applying an emollient lotion to soften the skin and seal in the moisture. Next apply Gel Appaisant, also made by Pour Hommes, which is an excellent, soothing skin lotion. If the face seems dry and flaky - which makes it look dull and older - use a clarifying lotion that removes flakes and uncovers fine skin (it can also make your tan look darker). Then apply an anti-aging eye balm (Baume Des Yeux) followed by a final moisturizing \"protective\" lotion. A scalp-programming lotion is used after I towel my hair dry. I also lightly blow-dry the hair to give it body and control (but without stickiness) and then add more of the lotion, shaping it with a Kent natural- bristle brush, and finally slick it back with a wide-tooth comb.\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/c2jCMqD",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "Review day 2/7\nI've been a pimple patch skeptic for years and I didn't think it was a necessity to buy them (I still don't think you need them but they do help). However, the past two years I noticed that when I do break out it's huge and it takes weeks to heal which sucks. So I decided to buy 4 different brands of pimple patches to determine which ones my skin (which ranges from combo, normal and dry depending on the season) likes the best . I tested them all with the help of some of my friends that have other skin concerns(sensitive acne prone, super oily acne prone, combo dehydrated, dry acne prone, and oily dehydrated skin) \n\nBefore I do start pimple patches should be applied after cleansing when your face is dry or else it won't work well. I'll try to go in depth as possible. \n\nA’PIEU NonCo Tea Tree Spot Patch\nThis patch is thin, clear, and almost unnoticeable on the skin. I've worn these out several times and the only times people noticed was when i was facing a certain way in the light. This is a medicated acne patch. It sticks very well (i had it on my face for 4 days because I forgot I had it there and despite all of my daily activities and my cities strange weather patterns it stayed on). It just really adheres to your skin nicely and imo easy to remove off. It contains tee tree oil and salicylic. If you have a sensitivity to either of these items I'd pass. You won't see stuff come out at least for me but it reduces the size These are best used for 'normal' acne. These are just a good basic if you don't have severe acne problems. \n\nIngredients:\nAcrylates Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Water, Alcohol, Melaleuca Alternofolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Salicylic Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Allantion, Phytosphingosine, Polysorbate 80, Methylparaben\n\nOn yesstyle you can get the 8+2 pack so you get 120 patches for $7CAD RRS sells them too. Any skin type can use these. \n\n\nCOSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch\n A cult fave and the first one I tried out. These patches are made from hydrocolloid which is used in hospitals to treat wounds and prevent infections. They are around the same thickness as the mentholatum patches aka their thicker than expected but not super thick. They are a white colour so its noticeable if you walk out in it. Where this product beats the a'pieu patches is overnight your pimple will be popped and you can see the gunk clearly, it also has more protective features. It really does stay still and doesn't budge If you have oily acne prone skin I recommend this one. They also have three different sizes the third size is perfect for those tiny spots you get. These also work on non severe white heads as well as my friend found out. \n\nIngredients:\nCellulose gum, Styrene Isoprene Styrene Block Copolymer, Polysobutylene, Petroleum Resin, Polyurethane Film, Liquid Paraffin, Tetrakis Methane\n\nComes with 24 patches roughly $5 CAD on yesstyle which u think is like $\t3 something USD. Anybody acne prone skin I think may like it but anyone else can use them too. \n\nAcropass Trouble Cure\n \nThese don't just heal pimples above the skin it goes underneath and fights them too. The patches are made with little microneedles from Niacinamide and Hyaluronic acid serum. They are so tiny I can't see them at all. It has a similar pops a hole in the pimple and sends the serum deeper into the spot. The patches come with two steps. Step one is cleansing the area with a cotton swab filled with tea treatments and salicylic acid. Step two is the serum. Apparently its meant for all types of acne according to soko glam. They are super thick night time use only and don't leave on for more than 8 hours since it started to sting after that. Really good for people suffering with serious acne concern it is very pricey so it's down on my list. \n\nIngredients:\nStep 1 \n\nEthanol, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf oil, Salicyc Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\nStep 2\n\nHydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide, Oligopeptide-76, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nThe box comes enough with only 6 uses and it's $18 USD on Soko Glam so I don't think it's worth it my friend that suffers from cyst and hormonal acne loves it and will continue to splurge on it. It's also good if you have dry skin with break outs. \n\n \nMentholatum Acnes Acne Patch \n\nThey are medicated time so it helps stop the growth of the bacteria while healing it at the same time. These patches are amazing for cyst and prevents your cyst becoming infected. They are kind of thick and are kinda opaque so it's noticeable when you wear them. Also if you have oily skin just to warn you they move around a bit but on dry skin it stays on better than the cosrx. Mine came with this little tweezer applicator so that's a plus if sanitation is big for you. Gave it to my younger sister a few days before her prom and she had to constantly put new ones on since it would just slide off her skin. Some people prefer this one but it was just meh imo. \n\n36 pieces for $8CAD if you're prone to cist and have combo, normal or dry skin this should work. \n\nHope this was a little helpful! \n",

I also find that they're the most thin and discreet patches that I've come across as well. I've used both the ones in the green box and blue box. I think the only difference between the two may just be the size. The green has two different sizes whereas the blue has just the small size. I think the thickness is the same but I'm not 100% certain on that. I did recently purchase the Cosrx invisible ones (black label) but I haven't gotten round to testing them out to see if they're better than the Mentolatum ones. I've also used Nexcare before and I hate them. They're super thick, not discreet at all and have almost zero sticking power that it's frustrating.

    "body": "## **What's in a \"Puppuccino\"; is it safe for dogs?**\nA \"Puppuccino\" is just whipped cream in a small cup.\nWe make this whipped cream by mixing heavy cream and 8 pumps of Starbucks Vanilla Syrup in a pressurized canister.\n\nThe syrup contains: \n> *SUGAR*, WATER, NATURAL FLAVORS, PRESERVATIVE: POTASSIUM SORBATE (E202), CITRIC ACID (E330), COLOR: CARAMEL (E150d).\n\nThe heavy cream brand varies by store location. At my store, we use Kroger Heavy Whipping Cream. It contains the following: \n> *Heavy Cream, Skim Milk*, Mono & Diglycerides, Polysorbate 80, *Carrageenan*.\n\n**It is not safe for dogs.** The amount of sugar in the whipped cream can caused your dog's blood-sugar levels to spike. Most dogs are lactose intolerant after a certain age, and will develop the following symptoms if too much lactose is consumed: abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In some animal studies, carrageenan was shown to cause intestinal lacerations and tumors. The remaining ingredients are non-beneficial, and there could be more of them that are potentially harmful to your dog.\n\n\n## **Why is the \"Puppuccino\" on your \"Secret Menu\" if it's not safe for dogs?**\nFirst and foremost, *there is no \"Secret Menu\"*. Customers can come up with whatever creation they desire, and then give it a name, but that does not make it a real Starbucks product. I don't know who started the \"Puppuccino\" fad, but it was not created or endorsed by Starbucks. We are also not responsible if your dog becomes sick or worse because you decided that it was a good idea to feed it a cup of whipped cream.\n\nYou also should not expect baristas to know what this, or any other \"Secret Menu\" item is.\n\n## **Is it really free?**\nIt likely depends on the store, but typically you won't get charged for asking for a little dab of whipped cream along side your drink. *However, if a customer was clearly abusing this fact (as in coming in 3 times a day for nothing but a cup of whipped cream to feed their dog), I would probably alert my manager, since they are wasting our time and money. Of course, I would first inform them of the dangers of feeding their dog so much sugar and dairy.\n\n\\* *Clarified.*\n\n\n\n# **BARISTAS:**\n\nPlease do not recommend or offer whipped cream or \"Puppuccinos\" to customer's pets. When wearing your green (or black) Starbucks apron, you are representing Starbucks. When a customer is offered a \"Puppuccino\" by someone who is representing Starbucks, they get the impression that it's a real Starbucks product, and may even get the impression that it's safe for dogs. This could lead to a lawsuit and probably your termination if someone's dog is killed by consuming something that you directly offered to them as a treat for their dog, while you were on the clock.\n\n**What you can offer to a customer's pet:**\n\n* Admiration, compliments, etc..\n* A cup or (oatmeal) bowl of filtered water.\n\n### What are your feelings and experiences with \"Puppuccinos\"? Feel free to discuss below, and correct me if I'm wrong about anything. Thanks for taking the time to read!\n\nOr if you didn't take the time to read/ **TL;DR**:\n\"Puppucinnos\" aren't real, are bad for your dog, and not endorsed by Starbucks.",

While dairy and sugar are not good for dogs, an otherwise healthy dog can have it occasionally with no ill effects. \n\nBecause of the potential health concerns that owners may not be aware of, I don't think customers should be *offered* one by baristas, especially for free. When asked for one, I have no problem with Starbucks saying, \"you should be careful about giving too many of these to your dog,\" or something to that effect. \n\nOutright refusal to sell them, however, based on the potential health concerns to an animal you don't own is not appropriate. Starbucks has some beverages that are extremely unhealthy but you don't refuse to sell those to people. I realize that animals can't make their own decisions, which is why a caution by the baristas is ok, and possibly even needed. But it's not ok to automatically assume you know better than the pet owner. Many of us are responsible and take great care of our animals.",

So lets look at all these so called dangerous ingredients and find out why they are as dangerous as they sound. This is going to be a long post. \n\n**Note: I got the ingredients from a antivax website since they got all of these ingredients together and is easier to jump from that to other websites. So I'll list the ingredient, what that website has to say about that and info on why it's safe.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Aluminum-** The website says that it causes brain damage at all doses, linked to Alzheimer's, dementia, seizures, autoimmune issues (not specific on what issues), SIDS (what? iirc it has no know cause) and cancer (again not specific).\n\nHealth individuals can consume up to 7.2 grams daily. The highest dosage of aluminum is in the DTAP, inactivated polio and HPV vaccine at <0.85 mg/dose (one milligram is one thousandth of a gram). These doses all range but the ones I mentioned earlier is highest. A baby may consume about 4.4 milligrams from vaccines in the first six months. If you have a baby you'll either breast feed them, use formula or soy formula. In the same time the babies will consume 7 milligrams, 38 milligrams and almost 117 milligrams respectively. \n\nRegarding diseases there could be an aluminium build up causing Alzheimer's but the association is not completely understood. So it can be the truth or just pure coincidence. This could be the same with the other diseases mentioned as well.\n\n[https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum)\n\n[https://esemag.com/archive/0197/facts.html](https://esemag.com/archive/0197/facts.html) (may be outdated).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Formaldehyde-** One of the most famous ingredients used as an argument by antivaxxers. This website mentions that it causes cancer in humans, poisoning of certain body systems like liver and respiratory, immune, reproductive, and nervous system. And apparently banned in injectbales by certain European countries. \n\nIn regards to the last point they made there seems to be now articles relating to it that I could find unless I looked in the wrong places. Formaldehyde is dangerous but it is naturally occurring in foods like apples, grapes, bananas, grapes, onions, carrots, spinach, seafood, beef and poultry. As well as our body naturally producing it for metabolism and production of certain amino acids. The highest dosage in a vaccine is .02 mg per dose, an average two month old will have 1.1 mg circulating in their bodies. The FDA also reports that 50 to 70 times more formaldehyde present in an average newborn's body than in a single vaccine. Although formaldehyde is dangerous the dose would not affect the newborn due to the fact there is more naturally occurring.\n\n[https://foodinsight.org/chemicals-in-food-two-that-arent-as-scary-as-they-sound/](https://foodinsight.org/chemicals-in-food-two-that-arent-as-scary-as-they-sound/)\n\n[https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/goes-vaccine/](https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/goes-vaccine/)\n\n[https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/ucm187810.htm](https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/ucm187810.htm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Beta-Propiolactone-** The website states that it's know to cause cancer and poison certain organs.\n\nLets start with what is BP? It's an organic compound, colorless, highly reactive and is highly soluble in water. It's vapor form is irritating but the liquid form is carcinogenic. It is used to treat influenza and is dosed in 2-1000 micrometers (1000 micrometers = 1mm). For the lowest dose to have an effect was 5ppm (0.005g/kg) via the inhalation of rat which had turmorgenic effect. The other tests showed the next one being 40mg/kg to have an effect. So the low dose would not have an effect on the individual.\n\n[https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Oxetanone#section=Top](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Oxetanone#section=Top)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24140008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24140008)\n\n[https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Oxetanone#section=NIOSH-Toxicity-Data&fullscreen=true](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Oxetanone#section=NIOSH-Toxicity-Data&fullscreen=true)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Gentamicin Sulfate & Polymyxin B-** The website says that it causes allergic reactions from mild to life threatening.\n\nThis can easily be avoided already by consulting on doctor to see if you child is allergic to these. Both these chemicals are antibiotics used in vaccinations and other things like surgical equipment. Gentamicin is only used in a one vaccines, influenza at a mega dose of <0.00015 mg. Polymyxin B is used in 5 vaccines: Influenza (<0.011 mg), Polio (0.00025 mg), Diptheria, tetanus, pretussis, polio (<0.00000001 mg, <0.00000004 mg, <0.00000001 mg). \n\n[https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/antibiotics](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/antibiotics)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Viral DNA-** The website says it can cause genetic mutations. \n\nFrom what I've found, they are not a common ingredient inside vaccines like polio, measles etc. Except their own vaccine. It is a developing vaccine which could be potentially used for chronic infections. There should be no issue at all for the individuals DNA to be affected at all.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15906276](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15906276)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Glutaraldehyde-** Website says poisonous if INGESTED mind you and causes birth defects in animals.\n\nGlutaraldehyde is a disinfectant used to sterilize hospital equipment. Found in the diptheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine in doses of <50ng (nanograms). If you are exposed to <1ppm = 1mg/L through inhalation or skin contact irritation and mucus. Higher dosages would be required to be needed to be considered dangerous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Latex Rubber-** Website says can cause life-threatening reactions.\n\nIt ain't a motherfucking ingredient but they include it. Latex rubber is used for the tip of syringes. Regarding with if you're allergic to latex it can be administered if the benefits outweighs the risks. Also there was a study of 28 people regarding with the reactions, only 2 needed to be hospitalized. \n\n[https://vaxopedia.org/2016/09/25/latex-allergies-and-vaccines/](https://vaxopedia.org/2016/09/25/latex-allergies-and-vaccines/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Peanut and Soybean Oil-** Website says it's linked to nut and soy allergies so they say that vaccines cause allergies. The only way your are at risk of allergies are if your family has had a history of allergies, are a child or have asthma or other similar conditions. Foods can be a trigger for allergies but are not a cause.\n\n[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/allergies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351497](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/allergies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351497)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Human and Animal Cells (Oh Boy!)-** Website says how vaccines have aborted babies DNA, pig and horse blood, dog kidneys, cow hearts, monkey kidneys, chick embryos, calf serum, sheep blood. Also causes leukemia and diabetes. \n\nThe fun one. These aborted fetal cells, from elective termination of pregnancies in the 1960's. They are not inside the vaccine but are used to help create the viruses. These two embryonic cells have been maintained in a laboratory for years so we won't need new sources. Most of the animal DNA is used to help grow viruses and are not used in a vaccine.\n\nDiabetes have no known cause and they won't cause leukemia.\n\n[https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/fetal-tissues](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/fetal-tissues)\n\n[http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients#human-cell-strains](http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients#human-cell-strains)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mercury (Thimerosal)-** Website says that it is one of the most toxic substances ever known, when a thermometer breaks a HAZMAT teams has to clean it, small doses causes damage and causes autism (I shortened what they said fyi)\n\nThimerosal is a type of mercury and is the safer type of mercury. There are two types of mercury: methylmercury found in fish and high dosages can be toxic, ethylmecury which is what thimerosal is. It is more easier to clear from the body making it safer to be used. Thimerosal is used in multi-dose vials to prevent bacteria from growing. This prevents illness even death from the germs. Thimerosal has no time to build up as it is broken down straight away as well as many studies showing that thimerosal at low doses cause no harm. As for Autism, well you know it does't this expert website below will show you why.\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html)\n\n[http://howdovaccinescauseautism.com/](http://howdovaccinescauseautism.com/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)-** Website says that is linked to birth defects, developmental delays and infertility. As well as being banned in europe.\n\nRegarding being banned it's a gray area. The FDA says it can be included just has to be included on the label. MSG is the sodium salt for glutamaic acid. Glutamic acid naturally occurs in tomatoes, grapes, cheese, mushrooms and other foods. There has been anecdotal reactions from MSG in food including headaches, flushing, sweating, facial pressure, numbness in face and neck, heart palpitations, chest pain, nausea and weakness although studies has found that there is no link between MSG and those issues. Although a small percentage of people may experience a small reaction. It is only found in two vaccines adenovirus and influenza.\n\n[https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/monosodium-glutamate/faq-20058196](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/monosodium-glutamate/faq-20058196)\n\n[https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/goes-vaccine/](https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/goes-vaccine/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Neomycin Sulphate-** Website says interferes with B6 absorption which leads to epilepsy and brain damage. Allergic reactions which can be mild to life threatening.\n\nNeomycin is an antibiotic used to reduce the risk of infection during surgeries on the bowel. Neomycin is used to prevent germs from growing and are usually removed from the final vaccine. B6 is found in many foods and helps with protein metabolism along with other body functions. Vitamin B6 defiency leads to dermatitis and glosstis, depression, confusion and weakened immune system. No signs of epilepsy or brain damage. Babies only need 0.1 mg from birth - 6 months. This can be easily achieved from any food as they provide the recommended amount or more.\n\n[https://vaxopedia.org/2016/09/11/neomycin-in-vaccines/](https://vaxopedia.org/2016/09/11/neomycin-in-vaccines/)\n\n[https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-HealthProfessional/](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-HealthProfessional/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Phenol-** Website says is used as anti-freeze. Toxic to all cells and can destroy the immune system. \n\nPhenol is an organic compound used in household items like disinfectants and mouthwash. It was also the first antiseptic used in surgery in 1865. When it was used the mortality rate dropped from 45%-15%. Phenol is also used for explosives like picric acid, drugs like aspirin. It also found naturally in tryosine (an amino acid in proteins), adrenaline, a hormone, serontonin in a neurotransmitter and urushoil.\n\n[https://www.britannica.com/science/phenol](https://www.britannica.com/science/phenol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Polysorbate 80-** Website says it causes cancer in animals. Causes numerous autoimmune diseases and infertility.\n\nPolysorbate 80 is an emulsifier used in foods and cosmetic products. There is only 50 micrograms inside of a typical vaccine, in comparison to a ice cream scoop (1/2 cup) which contains 170,000 micrograms. The effects of polysorbate is commonly irritations in the skin and other places. It is found to cause cancer in animals but not it humans\n\n[https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients)\n\n[https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+4359](https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+4359)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tributyl Phosphate-** Website says it is potentially toxic to the kidney and nervous system.\n\nBreathing TDP causes irritation and mucus. If its prolonged there can be poisoning with paralysis. If it comes in contact with skin then it can cause irritation it may also cause irritation on the eyes, nose and throat.

    "body": "Hi. I'm Heather Simpson. And this is the story of how I went from being a hardcore anti-vaxxer to a pro-vaxxer.\n\nYou probably don't know who I am, because I am a nobody to most people. But back in 2019 and the beginning of 2020, I was a viral anti-vaccine \"influencer.\" Let me explain.\n\nI was fully vaccinated as a child. In 2011 I barely poked myself with antique jewelery and I ran to my doctor's office to get a tetanus shot. I was pro vaccine because I was raised to be. My parents are awesome.\n\nAnd then one day....fear crept in. It came in the form of an advertisement dedicated to an anti-vaccine documentary series. My husband and I wanted kids, and I knew this subject was important, so I caved and dumped $200 into the series. 😳\n\nThe series, as you can imagine, described how vaccines are linked to almost every single bad condition you can think of. And, as a young woman preparing to enter motherhood, I didn't know any better. They fed me fear and I ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I was, from that point on, convinced that vaccines could and would cause autism, SIDS, autoimmune diseases, and death in general.\n\nI continued to study anti vaccine theories. You can find anything you want to support your claim, if only you set your mind to it. And boy did I find some things. I mostly found an abundance of fear based stories that terrified me. I decided I was never letting a vaccine near my child or I. \n\nEver.\n\nWhen my child was born in 2017, we gave her the vitamin k shot (which I was scolded by some anti-vaxxers for, and was told it caused her to have health issues) and we opted to give her no vaccines. I was confident in our decision, and so was my husband.\n\nWhen she was about 18 months old, or the Winter of 2019, I started posting on Facebook about my vaccine hesitancy. To be honest, that was a lie, as I was not \"hesitant\"...I KNEW I didn't like vaccines. But I figured looking \"hesitant\" would make me seem less crazy. When I first posted my views and hesitations on vaccines, my post got shared several hundred times.\n\nI was shocked. Friend requests started pouring in. I didn't know what was happening. So I kept posting my views on vaccines, people kept sharing my posts, and my audience grew. It was wild and completely unexpected. I had no idea that this world of anti-vaccine moms and dads existed on social media.\n\nThey were so supportive and I made life long friends that I will always treasure. This whole experience was worth it if not just for the friends I made.\n\nFast forward to October of 2019 when I dressed as the measles because I was \"trying to think of the least scary thing I could be for Halloween.\" Yall, I am taking this moment to openly tell you I was the worst. \n\nThe. Actual. Worst.\n\nIt didn’t even look like measles. It looked like syphilis.\n\nAnd then it went viral. Like, real viral.\n\nIt blew up on both Facebook and Reddit, and several national news oulets picked it up. I got death threats and people begged me to kill myself. It was bad. I did it to myself and I should never have dressed as something so heartless, but it was bad. I was shaken up quite a bit.\n\nA few months later, however, Febraury of 2020 arrived. I started to feel different about things. I was relying on western medicine to treat my endometriosis, I had just had surgery, and had been studying vaccines from a different standpoint. I started to soften my anti-vax views. But when I posted about this softening of my views, a lot of the anti-vax crowd lost it on me. They were furious and just plain cruel. \n\nIt was then that I realized a lot of them are very cult-like, because they will cast you out if you don't have an identical belief system as them. Don't get me wrong, there are MANY of them that are not this way, in whom I love and adore. But a LOT of them are militant about their anti-vax beliefs. They claim to be \"pro medical freedom\" but will tear you apart if you choose a different medical decision than them. \n\nThey bullied me so hard that I ended up in the ER with a panic attack. It was one of the worst weeks of my life....all because I was softening my views on vaccines. \n\nAnd then they \"cancelled\" me. Ohhhh, that online cancel culture. Gotta love it. \n\nBut, if I'm being honest, it turned out to be one of the biggest blessings. Because I then had time to read, think, study and grow on my own without the \"group think\" influencing me.\n\nAnd here I am now, planning to get my flu shot next week. I will also be getting my COVID vaccine. We will also be following our pediatrician's recommended vaccine schedule for our toddler. (I will not be discussing details as it is her private medical record.)\n\nHOW DID I GET HERE?! \n\nThat's really why you're reading this article, after all. So, allow me to explain the magic that happened in those months of studying after being “cancelled.”\n\nFirst of all, when approaching an anti-vaxxer, you have to realize that there are usually three types. Typically, one is a conspiracy theorist, one is scared, and one is an ex-vaxxer. Sometimes they are all three. Sometimes they are none of these. Each person is unique, but these are the three categories I’ve typically observed. Depending on what catergory they fall into is going to help you to know how to approach then.\n\nMy category? I was scared. Terrified. I did not want to inject something into my child if I thought it was going to kill her. I wanted to protect my baby with my life. This is most anti-vaxxers I know. They are fiercely protective of their children, just like pro-vaxxers, and only want to keep them safe. \n\nAnd, to clarify, this is not a bad person versus good person debate. There are incredible parents on both sides. \n\nBut I digress. I kept reading horrifying anecdotes from moms who would say that their baby died the day after vaccines. Or that their baby stopped talking the week later. Or that their baby stopped walking the month after. \n\nWhat finally caused me to start to question my anti-vax beliefs was when I started digging into each of these anectdotes to find the real truth, instead of blindly trusting stories. I found some of them to be true, definitely. But...I started to see that a lot of the \"vaccine deaths\" were actually due to co-sleeping accidents or other underlying conditions. The timing was just very, very unfortunate. The whole situation was sad. But vaccines inevitably took the blame. \n\nAnd sometimes the vaccine DID cause the baby's death or disability. Vaccines have never claimed to be 100% safe. Sometimes your baby is one of the rare statistics. Which makes it even harder to have discernment when reading anecdotes and trying not to be overcome with fear.\n\nI got to a point where I was so engulfed in every anecdote, that I lost my ability to critically think about a situation past my emotions. I would read a story, feel sick to my stomach, and swear to never vaccinate my child.\n\nBut the problem is, anectdotes without proof can get out of hand quickly in the hands of social media. Susie could have broken her leg on the swingset the day after her tetanus shot, but the way Susie's mom told it on social media was that Susie got her shot, and now she can't walk. Then this post gets spread 20,000 times. You now have a bunch of parents not wanting their child to get the tetanus shot because of COURSE they don't want to risk their child losing their ability to walk.\n\nI was told that my child's sleep apnea was due to her Vitamin K shot, and that her heart arrythmia was due to the vaccines I received in my childhood. If someone develops an autoimmune disease 15 years after their vaccines, some anti-vaxxers will still blame the vaccines. People need a reason explaining why they are sick. People need a reason their kid is sick. Vaccines are the perfect scapegoat, no matter how long it has been since they received them.\n\nThe next thing that started pulling me away from the anti-vaccine movement was VAERS. Also known as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. There was something like 48,000 events registered in 2019 alone. But here's the deal: parents can report anything with no proof. Causation does not have to be established to make the list. \n\nFor example, these are real documented events on VAERS:\n\nGunshot wound, fight in school, frostbite, infection of mites, electric shock from a hair straightener, drowning, damaged hair from incorrect hair bleach mixture, sunburn, tested positive for an STD, sports injury (dodge ball), sports injury (football), suicidal ideation due to breakup with boyfriend, murder, motor vehicle accident, and many, many more.\n\nSome anti-vaxxers use VAERS as one of their strongest arguments, but as you can see, by doing this they are able to claim that a sunburn is a vaccine injury. Which, it's just...not.\n\nThe next thing I started studying, and again what many anti-vaxxers use in their arguments, is the vaccine package inserts. They use it as a \"gotcha\" argument. I used this argument too, and was very confident in it. \n\nThe problem, however, is that the pacakage insert is a legal document, one that has to list any adverse event that occured subsequent to the vaccine or during clinical trials or post-marketing studies. No causal relationship has to be proven, but they legally have to list everything that happens. The Gardasil vaccine insert, for example, lists gunshot wounds, car wrecks, and suicide as an adverse event.\n\nNext, I examined the ingredients. The ingredients were the biggest thing I was afraid of. \n\nLet's talk about aluminum, because mercury for the most part has been eliminated from vaccines and aluminum has stolen the spotlight. Babies receive about 10 mg of aluminum their first six months of life if they are breastfed, 30 mg if the are formula fed, and 120 milligrams if they are soy formula fed. But they only receive 4 mg of aluminum from vaccines in their first six months of life on the current vaccine schedule. \n\nScientists have also done research that shows that the aluminum from vaccines does not raise the blood level of aluminum already in your system, and that the aluminum from vaccines exits so quickly that half of it is gone from your body by the next day.\n\nThe second scary ingredient I forced myself to examine is Formaldehyde. It is used to inactivate the viruses and bacteria in the vaccines. Because of that, you are going to end up with some formaldehyde in the final product. The amount of formaldehyde in a vaccine, not exceeding one tenth of a milligram, is considered safe, as you already naturally have formaldehyde in your circulation. Formaldehyde is required in humans for the synthesis of thymidine, purines, and amino acids-which are all necessary for the formation of DNA.\n\nEveryone has detectible formaldehyde in their bloodstream, or about 2.5 micrograms per milliliter of blood. If you take an average weight of a 2 month old (11 pounds) with an average blood volume of 85 milliliters per kilogram, the total quanitity found naturally in that infant's blood would be about 1 milligram. 1 milligram of formaldehyde is ten times that which is in a vaccine. \n\nAnd for the third scary ingredient I examined, we have Polysorbate 80. Anti-vaxxers believe this chemical will open the blood brain barrier (BBB) up and allow aluminum to slip through into the brain. The problem with this, however, is that it is physically impossible for that to happen. But opening up the BBB is not as simple as it sounds. Assuming a vaccine contains 50 mcg (HPV vaccine, for example), a 10 pound baby would have to have dozens upon dozens of vaccines injected straight into its carotid artery to have even a CHANCE at opening up the BBB. Polysorbate 80 is also a very unstable chemical that gets attacked by esterases in your tissue at a very fast rate, and has a half life of 1.07 hours. (1,2)\n\nBut ultimately, what finally changed my mind, was having people reach out, listen to my fears, and talk to me. The thousands of mean comments didn't change my mind. In fact, those comments made me think I was even more in the right. If I had enemies, after all, then I must be doing something right. Those awful comments had the oppopsite effect of the pro vaccine person's intentions.\n\nBut when friends calmly and patiently explained the science to me, showing they cared more about me than about changing my mind, my mind started to open up to the fact that I could be wrong. That's when I started reading a book called \"The Vaccine Book\" by Dr. Robert Sears. He lays out information in a middle-ground sort of way. He seemed to be both pro and anti vax, with a very open mind and honest approach to both positions.  As I read, I started to realize that I trusted the doctor in this book, and that these vaccine injury posts on Facebook just did not line up to the number of vaccine injuries he stated had happened. \n\nBut the final straw that broke the camel's back was when I was hospitalized due to bruising everywhere and endometriosis. The care I received from the medical team was amazing. The western medicine they gave me helped me so much. I realized many anti-vaxxers are anti-vax based on the theory that scientists and doctors are in on a conspiracy to kill or maim children for money. It dawned on me that I definitely don't believe that, and am not a conspiracy theorist at all. \n\nThere is no way that thousands of doctors and scientists are out to kill or maim our kids. It's statistically impossible. Most of them are amazing people with huge hearts for kids. \n\nI want to apologize for anybody I hurt during my anti-vax days. I was harsh, sarcastic, and extremely hurtful. I know that there is a lot of ableism in the anti-vax movement, so just know this: your autistic child was born perfectly. Do not let anyone tell you that they need to be cured or fixed. I am so sorry if I ever promoted ableism. That was never my heart or intent, of course, but I am sorry if I did regardless. I would like to ask the pro vaccine and medical community's forgiveness for my flippant attitude, my Dunning Kruger effect that I put on like a a pair of shoes daily, and my measles costume that looked more like syphilis. I am so sorry. \n\nSo, here I am. About to get my flu shot once I recover from a small case of pneumonia. Planning to trust doctors and scientists from here on out. Wish me luck on my journey-I am looking forward to seeing where it leads me. \n\nEdit to add: I am now aware that Dr. Bob Sears is not a great doctor to follow. I highly recommend “Vaccines and Your Child” by Paul Offit, M.D., and Charlotte A Moser.",

This is one of the first memes my mom shared with me when you posted it; my mom is afraid of the covid vaccine because of you, and people like you. She didn’t know anti vaxers were a thing, and now she does and she’s terrified of vaccines and medicine.\nShe hasn’t left the house since March because of the pandemic, and is afraid of the solution that could give her freedom back. You left lasting damage and scared people and planted ideas in the minds of people who have a hard time thinking for themselves. You can’t fix that, none of the anti vax people can.\nI’m glad to hear that you’re trying your best to turn it around. It takes a big person to swallow their pride and admit they were wrong. I do truly hope that you are actually changing, and that this isn’t an effort to save face. I also hope that you can put in as much effort into making things right as you did to make them wrong.",

    "body": "What it looks like on me (sorry still getting rid of the acne): http://imgur.com/a/pqiQUAe\n\nI haven't seen a review for this one yet on here, so I thought I would give it a go as a mini review! \n\nFirst of all, here is the ingredients:\n\n\nWater, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Dibutyl Adipate, Beta Vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract, Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Glycerin,  Pentylene Glycol, Isoamyl p-Methoxycinnamate, Polysilicone-15, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Methylpropanediol, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polysorbate 80, Lithospermum Erythrorhizon Root Extract, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Sorbitan Oleate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Butylene Glycol, Resveratrol\n\nAccording to [Cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d3ef383038.html) Basically lots of nice antioxidants and the UV filters are Uvinal A Plus, Tinosorb S, Parsol SLX. \n\nNotably, it contains alcohol so avoid if you have issues etc. Also, it's not waterproof.\n\n**The Review**\n\nFor background, I'm oily, dehydrated & acne prone (as the pictures show lol)\n\nI like this sunscreen because:\n\n1) ZERO whitecast (and I used a generous quarter dollop like we are supposed to)\n\n2) Non-drying despite alcohol (and I'm currently very dehydrated so alcohol has been a problem in the past)\n\n**EDIT** \nJust washed it off after wearing for a couple hours and I do have a liiiittle flakes... However if you prepped your skin properly/don't have dehydrated skin you probably won't have the an issue.  (i.e was super lazy and didn't put moisturizer underneath)\n\n3) Dries down in 5 min or less to what I could consider a pretty transfer proof finish to the touch. \n\n4) No Scent\n\nHowever, what I don't like is how greasy this sunscreen is on my face (IRL looks greasier than the picture too). To be fair, most sunscreens are greasy for me because I'm oily, and Liah does mention in her intro video for this that this may not be the best sunscreen for oily skin. I'm a bit bummed because I was hoping I could finally find a sunscreen with no shine... But I'm not surprised either. \n\nWith that said, with a matte powder on top (just using a basic Neutrogena matte powder here) it looks like a really nice skin I'm-not-wearing-anything finish. Which I like, as I don't wear any other makeup. Just don't except to skip the powder step if you are normal/oily to oily. \n\nIt also sliiiiiightly irritates my eyes, but it's not that noticeable and it wouldn't bother me majorly on a day to day basis (for reference I have only found 1 other chemical sunscreen among many to irritate my eyes, but that was a much more severe reaction). Interestingly enough a YouTuber who reviewed this said it really irritated her eyes (Genevieve Fields if you want to look it up) so YMMV.\n\nThis does remind me of the Make Prem Blue Ray Defense Me Gel which is also SPF 50+ PA++++ , 0 whitecast. The MP also supposedly protects you from IR and the blue light from screens but... I honestly don't believe that lol. Otherwise, the greasiness is much more pronounced with the MP (I'm pretty sure this would only be non-greasy if you have dry skin), if you use a matte powder on top I'm not sure how much that matters. Price wise, the BS is more expensive, as I paid 26.40 for 50ml (1.89 ml per dollar when you factor shipping), and the MP is 32 for 75ml (2.3 ml per dollar, free shipping for me bc Prime). Although, Krave Beauty does do free shipping for orders over $40, so if you buy 2 at a time, it then makes the BS 2.5 ml per dollar and the cheapest of both! \n\nOverall, while a little expensive I would recommend this to all skin tones and especially dry/normal skin. Oily/combination types, only go for this if you are willing to powder! Oh and if you're sensitive, this is probably a gamble\n\n**4.5/5.0! :)**",

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm thinking doing creams or gels next. =) Thank you everybody for the comments, glad to see the time I spent making these posts is helping some of you!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Oils & Gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6dqq7/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing_oils_gels/)\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams & Foams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6fso3/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing/)",

The late-stage trial of the Oxford vaccine was about to begin.\n\n>The shipment, batch K.0011, had undergone the Italian company’s quality check using an established genetic test - quantitative PCR, or qPCR - to determine viral matter per milliliter.\n\n>Oxford ran its own analysis for good measure. The university had been using a different method known as spectrophotometry, which measures viral material in liquids based on how much ultraviolet light the viral matter absorbs.\n\n>Oxford’s measurement showed that the batch was more potent than the Italian manufacturer had found, the documents show. Oxford trusted its own result and wanted to remain consistent with a measuring tool it had used throughout an earlier trial phase. So it asked Britain’s drugs regulator for permission to reduce the volume of vaccine injected into trial participants from the K.0011 batch. Permission was granted.\n\n\nAnd the issue between the two measurement methods:\n\n\n> IRBM/Advent told Reuters there was no manufacturing issue with the batch. The company said in a written statement that the measuring mishap was “the result of a change in the testing method” used to confirm the potency of the dose “once the material had been shipped.”\n\n>The documents published in The Lancet confirm that the error lay with the Oxford researchers. A common emulsifier, polysorbate 80, used in vaccines to facilitate mixing, had interfered with the ultraviolet-light meter that measures the quantity of viral material, according to the documents. As a result, the vaccine’s viral concentration was overstated and Oxford ended up administering half doses of vaccine, believing they were full doses.\n\n\nHave you run across a similar situation in your line of work where different measuring techniques resulted in different results for what should be the same value?",

Some of the liquid vaporizes during handling and freezing, so the same amount of material is in a smaller amount of liquid.\n\nThen there is a problem with working with viruses that produce material. Every time a freeze/thaw cycle happens the ratio of usable to unusable material decreases, but the spectrometry data stills says its all good. A spectrometry test can be done in 60 seconds, testing the amount of viable material takes days or weeks.\n\nThis is why virus derived medicines are so hard to get approved outside of a worldwide pandemic.

    "body": "My foray into skincare began around July last year when I decided I wasn't happy with my skin and wanted to do something about it. Initially I researched foundations, but none of the products I tried evened my skin to my satisfaction, which is when I found /r/SkincareAddiction. Here, I learned that my skin was dehydrated, more than likely due to using Dove bar soap and BP on my face and zero moisturizer every day. :) My skin has changed so much since I started and I am finally ready to review some products I have been using and maybe help others find their way.  \n**Disclaimer** This is my first Reddit text post, I'm really hoping the formatting turns out the way I anticipated.  \n\n**Where we started:**  \n* 25/F/FL; combo/oily dehydrated skin with mild acne, some PIE, sporadic CCs and occasionally painful nodules usually on my forehead, chin, or temples. Noteworthy: I have been on oral contraceptives since I was a teenager and switched to Skyla in 2015. I don't believe my acne is hormonal, but since I've always had some sort of hormonal birth control it's hard to tell how much it has affected my skin.  \n\n\n* No real routine, just washing my face with bar soap in the (scalding hot) shower, using a Neutrogena BP mask to annihilate acne. I was under the (false) impression that since my face was oily I certainly wouldn't want to add moisturizer!  \n\n\n* Mostly concerned with the nodules I was getting because they were big and painful and took forever to heal. Admittedly, I am a skin picker and just recently I realized this is probably the cause of the nodules because the two that I have dealt with recently developed in spots that I had messed with just a few days before.  \n\n\n**Level one: Build a routine.**  \n* At this point, I read everything. EVERYTHING. I spent a couple of months just researching products, learning about skin types, and poring through threads on SCA. I put down the BP mask and bought Neutrogena foaming face wash and CeraVe PM. This was around September when Irma hit and I was without power for a few days, but still managed to keep my fledgling routine. \\o/\n\n* Unfortunately, I felt that CeraVe PM was contributing to a new outbreak of whiteheads around my mouth, where I don't normally get whiteheads. I wound up replacing it with Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow which I LOVE. More on that later.\n\n* I also incorporated Neutrogena Sheer Touch sunscreen around this time, but that gave me small breakouts as well and I just didn't like the way that it sat on my skin so I decided to put sunscreen on hold while I did more research.\n\n* While incorporating these products into my routine I tried my best to follow SCA's advice and start slow, one product at a time, and patch test first. I don't really feel that patch testing helped me determine if a product would break me out, as I wouldn't notice any difference in the area I patch tested but then within a few days of trying a new product on my whole face I would see an increase in whiteheads in strange areas. It sucked, but it's alright since the breakouts were mild and didn't take long to appear so I knew fairly quickly that a product wasn't working for me. I still recommend patch testing for sensitivity purposes.\n\n**Level 2: Sunscreen and acids.**  \n* Finally, after months of reading, I felt ready to take on an acid. I settled on CosRX BHA Blackhead Power liquid because it was purportedly more mild (and less expensive!) than other options and I felt that I should start gentle. I picked this up from Ulta in early December and used it every three days for 4 weeks. During that period I don't feel like I had a purge; I kind of expected my acne to go into overdrive but it didn't really get any worse. After the 4 weeks I started using it MWF. \n\n* I also bought Skinfood's Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel from Amazon, but shipping took about a month so I was able to incorporate it well after the BHA.\n\n**Level 3: Skincare God.**  \n* *Just kidding.* So here we are in mid April and I have repurchased the Neutrogena cleanser once (although I switched to hydrating instead of foaming), Peach Slices moisturizer three (!!!) times, Skinfood sunscreen once, and am 1/3 of the way through the CosRX BHA. Let me tell you, I am SO much happier with my skin. \n\n* My skin is more bright and even and I have had much fewer blemishes than I used to, which I would attribute equally to a marked decrease in picking. Taking better care of my skin and working towards a goal makes it easier to keep myself from messing up my progress, although I still have setbacks during times when I am very stressed out, but I try not to let that discourage me.\n\n* Oil production WAS down, but a couple of weeks ago I tried to incorporate Cosrx Ultimate Moisturizing Honey Overnight Mask at night for added hydration, but it wound up drying me out? Additionally, I am running dangerously low on Peach Slices Moisturizer and could not find it at any of my local CVS locations so I have been rationing it while I wait for more to come in the mail. :'( \n\n* From here, I want to try to find a more hydrating cream for nighttime and an easily accessible drugstore sunscreen because currently it takes the Skinfood 2-4 weeks to come in so I have to make sure I order it in advance. I also REALLY want to try Krave Beauty Kale-lalu-yAHA, but I am waiting until I get back from vacation next month before I incorporate a new exfoliant. Finally, someone talk me out of buying something from the Dr Jart Cicapair line because I'm not quite sure what it's for but I really want it.\n\nI hope this will be helpful for those still figuring out what works for their skin, as I know I felt completely overwhelmed when I first started. I am still interested in experimenting with new products but I feel that I have a really solid routine as it is so I am content to wait until I am in a better situation financially to mix things up.\n\n**Current routine**  \nAM: splash with water  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSkinfood sunscreen  \n\nPM: cleanse with Neutrogena  \nCosRX BHA MWF  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSometimes a sheet mask when I'm feeling fancy (I really like Ariul Seven Days masks)  \nVaseline (not so much lately after I read a thread here about Vaseline potentially trapping bacteria if your face isn't cleansed properly)\n\n**Reviews**  \n* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser: Not much to say here, but from what I have read that is good to say about a cleanser. It took a little time to get used to not having that tight, \"squeaky clean\" feeling that I got using the foaming cleanser, but ultimately I think this has been better for my skin. I have had my eye on Glossier's Milky Jelly cleanser for MONTHS but I can't bring myself to buy it when I am pretty satisfied with how this has been for my skin.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n* Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow: Light gel formula, sinks into my skin really well. I am still a bit oily toward the end of the day, but I have kind of resigned myself to the fact that that may not fully go away. Maybe when I start incorporating a more hydrating night cream it will help. Either way the slight oil doesn't bother me much and I really like this moisturizer.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide NP, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol*\n\n* Skinfood Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel 50+ PA+++: Very happy with this sunscreen, although the oil control is hit or miss. Some days when I apply it after moisturizer it has a nice, almost powdery finish and I forget it's even there. Some days I'm more oily but I'm still figuring out what the cause of that might be. I don't wear foundation so I can't speak to how this sits under makeup but I do wear a little blush and I can still see it at the end of the day. When I apply it I pat it around my face and then rub it in, there is a slight white cast at first but for me it disappears very quickly, however, I am fair skinned.\n\n*Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Octyl Salicylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Lauryl Peg-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Titanium Dioxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Propylene Carbonate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Fragrance, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Tocopherol*\n\n* CosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid: I use three pumps MWF and occasionally a tiny amount to spot treat nodules. Overall I feel like it helps existing acne heal more quickly and keeps it from getting to that huge, inflammatory state. It applies and dries down very nicely and I typically wait 15-20 minutes after application to apply moisturizer. I didn't realize until recently that it has niacinamide, which I had thought didn't agree with my skin because it was also in CeraVe PM, but I think it has really helped lighten my PIE, particularly a spot on my forehead that I really went to town on last year and it was a pain in the ass to heal.\n\n*Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Betaine Salicylate, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arginine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol*\n\n**Links that I found helpful along the way**  \n[Try a gentle hydrating cleanser -- even if you have oily skin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7j6juf/psa_try_a_gentle_hydrating_cleanser_even_if_you/)\n\n[Routines which involve inadequate cleansing, high moisture, and heavy occlusion are risky...](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/86twai/psa_routines_which_involve_inadequate_cleansing/)",

    "body": "I finally made the cult favourite Skinceuticals CEF serum. For the method I mostly followed [Acid Queen's](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/01/12/fun-with-diy-skinceuticals-dupe-vitamin-c-tutorial/amp/) steps. The one ingredient that I substituted was Laureth-23 with Polysorbate 80 (a solublizer for vitamin e) because I just couldn't find it anywhere. I did most of my troubleshooting by reading other people's failures and experience making the Acid Queen's formulation on r/DIYBeauty . Honestly, r/DIYBeauty is simply a treasure trove especially on formulation of vitamin C serum. The final pH of my serum is 3.16 adjusted using Sodium Lactate.\n\nHowever what I wanted to discuss here is the total cost and whether DIYing the serum is worth it.\n\n**Ingredients**|**Percentage**|**Weight(gm)**|**Cost of ingredient**|**Cost/bottle**|**Seller**|**Cheaper place to order**\n:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:\nFerulic Acid|0.50%|0.15|765 for 5gm|22.95|SRL Chemicals|300 for 10gm at Skinfuel\nPropylene Glycol|10.00%|3|129.8 for 100gm|3.894|Vijay Impex|250 for 500gm at Skinfuel\n1% HA stock|15.00%|4.5|1200 for 10gm(MMW)|5.4|Artconnect|700 for 10gm at Skinfuel\nDistilled water|35.70%|10.71|Free| | | \nPanthenol|0.50%|0.15|236 for 25gm|1.416|VijayImpex| \nPolysorbate 80 |2.00%|0.6|118 for 100gm|0.708|VijayImpex| \nEthoxydiglycol|20.00%|6|529 for 500ml(495gm approx)|6.41|SRL Chemicals| \nTocopherol|1.00%|0.3|135.7 for 25ml( approx 24gm)|1.69|VijayImpex| \nLiquid Germall Plus|0.30%|0.09|250 for 25gm|0.9|Artconnect| \nL-Ascorbic Acid|15.00%|4.5|522 for 20gm|117.45|BeautyBay |503 for 100gm at SRL Chemicals\nSodium Lactate |Q.S for pH| |118 for 100gm| |VijayImpex| \n**Total** |**100.00%**|**30**|**4,003.5**|**160.818**| | \n\n**Additional Costs**\n\n* [Ph meter](https://www.amazon.in/NEXQUA-digital-meter-calibration-accessories/dp/B08JJLKFQ2/ref=asc_df_B08JJLKFQ2/?tag=googleshopmob-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397653841825&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11345605332900110399&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9299180&hvtargid=pla-1086875042858&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi) ₹800\n* Beakers free\n* [Weighing scale](https://www.amazon.in/gp/aw/d/B01LPOZA2M?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_image)₹279\n* Silicone Spatula ₹300 for 2\n* Isopropyl 70%(surgical spirit for sterilization) ₹120 for 400ml\n\nTo store the finished serum, I used an old The Ordinary amber bottle that I had sterilized.\n\n**Some Changes I will make next time**\n\n* Use TEA( triethanolamine) to adjust the pH. I needed quite a bit of Sodium Lactate to bring the pH up. This means that my final percentages may be slightly out of whack.\n* Use Liquorice root extract.\n\n**Finally is it worth it....**\nEven though I bought some of the chemicals at a higher rate, the final cost per bottle is definitely cheaper than the market alternatives. Having said that there is quite a bit of initial investment. I personally don't mind it because I have started making a lot of my own skincare serums and products and thus my initial investment is spread out over multiple products. \n\nNote: \n\n* If you'll decide to buy anything from Skinfuel and see that it is available only in larger volumes, ask her if she can give it to you in smaller. They are usually quite flexible in this regard.\n\n* The chemicals that I bought from SRL Chemicals are of the highest purity grade  i.e. even higher than cosmetic grade. Please don't buy the cheapest grade like Industrial grade because they may have inclusions that may not be skin safe.\nAlso forgive the formatting, I am typing this out on my phone.",

It is a rinse-off makeup remover that is oil based and solid at room temperature - you melt it with your hands a bit as you put it on.

Everyone and their mother recommends coconut oil, and I tried it and it sucked. I don't want the greasiness I'm always left with from it, and I have a lot of trouble getting greasy hairs rinsed out of the razor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSOOOO a couple nights ago these two ideas collided and I tried it out. Not only does it work, but I can adjust the ratios to make an oil that 100% rinses off or one that leaves just enough coconut oil behind to leave a smooth and moisturized feeling. After testing it, I can confidently report I've found something that would not only work as a makeup remover, but I'm going to mix up a big batch as my shaving cream, and I might mix up a partial-rinse batch to use as hand washer/lotion during the winter!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDefinitely worth messing around with some ratios if you're into DIY.",

In fact, I like it so much that I ordered another one plus extra heads. All the reviews say that it's a shaver, but I think that it's a mini epilator because I can feel the hair being pulled out. Absolutely satisfied with its performance.\n\nThis is an amazing product, it actually works.I bought it ( 8$ ) from \nhttp://nanacorner.com/product/epilator-wax-finishing-touch-flawless-hair-remover-razor-women-body-face-electric-hair-removal-painless-lipstick-shaving-tool/ . \nSo I want to share this link to you to know where you can buy this product. in this site have a lot of another good products. Hope can help people to choose a best products.",

    "body": "I’m writing this review after going through two bottles of **Minimalist’s Vitamin C (Ethyl Ascorbic Acid) 10% + Acetyl Glucosamine 1% serum** (since around the time they launched this) and one week of **Chemist At Play’s 20% Vitamin C + 1% Tocopherol + 0.5% Ferulic Acid serum**. I had initially planned to write this review 2 weeks after using the latter, but I’ve had a below average experience in one week itself so I’d like to share my review in hopes of being of help to those who want to purchase it.\n\n*I have dry skin not prone to acne, have very little to no pigmentation and use Vitamin C as a preventive measure against ageing, sun damage and dullness. I live in an area with high UV levels and a very humid climate.*\n\n*My routine: Episoft Cleansing Lotion, Laneige Cream Skin Refiner: Toner & Moisturiser, Minimalist's Vitamin C Serum, Bello Photostable Emulgel SPF 40 (day) and Moskina Cream (night).*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Texture Shot](https://preview.redd.it/35qouoy87q871.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9053ecf1c188f97b487b54a5a2b714b59a0a04cd)\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\nChemist At Play:\n\n>Water, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic acid, Propan-di-ol, Sodium Isomerate, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Ferulic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Oryza Sativa (Rice Phytoceramide), Amorphophallus (Konjac Phytoceramide), Hamamelis Virginiana, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 80.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMinimalist:\n\n>Centella Asiatica Leaf Water, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Ethoxydiglycol, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Glycerin, Sodium Gluconate, Acetyl Glucosamine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pullulan, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lecithin, Lactic Acid\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/q0l52oub7q871.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=452589ce63e896b49a2bb5a08fbc6956ad6b9cf5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChemist At Play has Witch Hazel and Citric Acid; this may not be problematic for all, but if they are for you then keep this serum away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, Minimalist gave me the actual results a Vitamin C serum is supposed to give but Chemist At Play did the reverse. I'm just glad that it didn't give me any CC's or acne. I'm going to go ahead and reverse the dullness through Minimalist's serum. I'm better off using a ceramide infused moisturiser after my serum than have it in my serum in this case, which is a pity because if this serum had worked for me, it would've been an all-rounder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, everyone's skin is different and this is just one, hopefully helpful review.",

Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

The reviews on Sephora have been fantastic and it has 20% THD ascorbate (which they call a mega-potent, ultra stable form of vitamin c. They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid. The only negative I read in the reviews is people saying it was not ideal for dry skin types. Do you have any experience with this? \n\nPS- thank you so much for your comprehensive list, it is much appreciated!!

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

For the high-technology measurements and the care of the investigation, all the controls were activated and reference measurements adopted in order to obtain validated results. \n\nIt must be observed that the components that are not declared but we identified are not biocompatible and some have also a mechanical impact once they are inside the blood circulation, especially in contact with the vascular endothelium. Once in the blood circulation, the particles can be carried also to the brain. In this case, the patient can suffer from a stroke, and/or a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nIf the damage of the endothelium caused by the particles occurs in the heart, there is a high probability of contracting myocarditis. In addition to all that, the toxicity of graphene is well-known.\n\nMODERNA This is what they are claiming to be in this respective injection\nMessenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), lipids (SM-102, polyethylene glycol [PEG] 2000\ndimyristoyl glycerol [DMG], cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC]),\ntromethamine,tromethamine hydrochloride, acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, and sucrose.\n\nMODERNA This is what was also discovered in the injection\n\nA mixed entity (organic-inorganic) was identified in a Moderna “vaccine”. It is a Carbon-based substrate where some nanoparticles are embedded. The nanoparticles are composed of Aluminium-Copper-Iron-Chlorine.\n\nMany foreign bodies were identified with a spherical morphology with some bubble-shaped cavities. They are composed of Silicon- Lead-Cadmium-Selenium. This highly toxic composition reminds that of quantum dots (Cadmium selenide).\n\nA 100-micron entity that reminds that of graphene. It is composed of Carbon and Oxygen with contamination of Nitrogen, Silicon, Phosphorus, Chlorine.\n\nCarbon-based entities in a Moderna “vaccine” (see below) mixed with aggregates filled with Aluminium-silicate particles\n\nPFIZER This is what they are claiming to be in this respective injection\nCrystalline Carbon-based nanoparticles\nmRNA, lipids ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldec​anoate), 2\n[(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-\nphosphocholine, and cholesterol), potassium chloride, monobasic potassium\nphosphate, sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and sucrose.\n\nPFIZER This is what was also discovered in the injection\n\nSharp debris of 20micron of length identified in a Pfizer “vaccine”. It is composed of Carbon, Oxygen Chromium, Sulphur, Aluminium, Chloride, Nitrogen.\n\nA strange foreign body, surely engineered with strange holes on the surface. The white debris are composed of Carbon, Oxygen, Aluminium, Silicon, Calcium, Magnesium, Chlorine and Nitrogen.\n\nDebris identified in a Pfizer “vaccine”.

It could be a Trypanosoma parasites several variants of which are lethal.\n\nJANSSEN This is what they are claiming to be in this respective injection\n\nRecombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus type 26 expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,\n\ncitric acid monohydrate, trisodium citrate dihydrate, ethanol, 2 hydroxypropyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin (HBCD),\npolysorbate-80, sodium chloride.\n\nJANSSEN This is what was also discovered in the injection\n\nShows an organic-inorganic aggregate identified in a Janssen “vaccine”. The particles are composed of stainless steel and are glued together with a “Carbon-based glue”.

Kennedy,  Jr. reveals Merck data showing Gardasil increases the overall risk of death by 370%, risk of autoimmune disease by 2.3% and risk of a serious medical condition by 50%  \n* Postmarketing and adverse events reported during use of the vaccine post-licensing are listed on the Gardasil vaccine insert and include blood and lymphatic system disorders, pulmonary embolus, pancreatitis, autoimmune diseases, anaphylactic reactions, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system disorders and more \n* Merck’s use of a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant instead of a proper placebo in its safety trials effectively renders its safety testing null and void, as the true  extent of harm cannot be accurately ascertained \n\n \n\nThe HPV vaccine Gardasil was granted European license in February 2006,1 followed by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval that same year in June.2  Gardasil was controversial in the U.S. from the beginning, with vaccine  safety activists questioning the quality of the clinical trials used to  fast track the vaccine to licensure.3\n\nLauded as a silver bullet against cervical cancer, there have been multiple continuing reports since it was licensed that [Gardasil vaccine](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/05/05/hpv-vaccine-gardasil.aspx)  has wrought havoc on the lives of young girls (and young boys) in the  U.S. and in countries across the world. Serious adverse reactions  reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in  relation to Gardasil include but are not limited to:4\n\n \n\n* Anaphylaxis\n* Guillain-Barre Syndrome\n* [Transverse myelitis](https://articles.mercola.com/shingles.aspx) (inflammation of the spinal cord)\n* [Pancreatitis](https://articles.mercola.com/pancreatitis.aspx)\n* Venous thromboembolic events (blood clots)\n* Autoimmune initiated motor neuron disease (a neurodegenerative disease that causes rapidly progressive muscle weakness)\n* [Multiple sclerosis](https://articles.mercola.com/multiple-sclerosis.aspx)\n* Sudden death\n\n \n\nPostmarketing experiences and adverse events reported during post-approval use listed on the Gardasil vaccine insert5  include blood and lymphatic system disorders such as autoimmune  hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and  lymphadenopathy; pulmonary embolus; pancreatitis; autoimmune diseases;  anaphylactic reactions; arthralgia and myalgia (musculoskeletal and  connective tissue disorders); nervous system disorders such as acute  disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, motor neuron  disease, paralysis, seizures and transverse myelitis; and deep venous  thrombosis, a vascular disorder.\n\nAccording to \"Manufactured Crisis — HPV, Hype and Horror,\" a film6  by The Alliance for Natural Health, there have also been cases of  16-year-old girls developing ovarian dysfunction, meaning they're going  into menopause, which in turn means they will not be able to have  children.\n\nDespite such serious effects, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) and FDA allege the vast majority, or even all, of  these tragic cases are unrelated to the vaccine, and that Gardasil is  safe.\n\nThe Plaintiff's Science Day Presentation on Gardasil video features  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel for Children's  Health Defense,7  an organization originally founded in 2016 as World Mercury Project and  renamed in 2018 to focus on exposing and eliminating multiple harmful  exposures contributing to the epidemic of chronic ill health among  children. The video details the many safety problems associated with  Merck's HPV vaccine, Gardasil.\n\nThe information presented is based on publicly available government documents. Kennedy notes that, if what he says about [Merck](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/05/14/mercks-adhd-drugs-unsafe.aspx) in this video presentation were untrue, they would be considered slanderous.\n\nHowever, Kennedy says he is not concerned about being sued for  slander. He says he knows Merck won't sue, \"because in the U.S., truth  is an absolute defense against slander\" and Merck knows that, were the  company to sue for slander, Kennedy would file discovery requests that  would unearth even more documents detailing Merck's fraudulent  activities.\n\nKennedy's presentation does not go into the biological mechanisms by  which Gardasil causes harm. He directs parents and pediatricians to the  Children's Health Defense website8 to read peer reviewed medical literature sources for that information.\n\nInstead, Kennedy's presentation focuses on what he describes as  Merck's fraudulent clinical trials of Gardasil vaccine, which were used  to gain FDA approval. While this article provides you with a summary of  the key points, I urge you to watch Kennedy's presentation in in its  entirety, as this information may well save you or your child a lifetime  of heartache and exorbitant medical expenses.\n\n \n\n## How Merck committed fraud in its Gardasil safety testing \n\nKennedy says the fraud Merck committed in its safety testing is (a)  testing Gardasil against a toxic placebo, and (b) hiding a 2.3%  incidence of autoimmune disease occurring within seven months of  vaccination.\n\nIn his presentation, Kennedy shows Table 1 from the package insert9  for Gardasil, which looks at vaccine injuries at the site of injection.  It shows that Gardasil was administered to 5,088 girls; another 3,470  received the control, amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate (AAAH)  — a neurotoxic aluminum vaccine adjuvant that has been associated with  many serious vaccine injuries in the medical literature.\n\nA third group, consisting of 320 individuals, received a proper [placebo](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/02/20/placebo-effect.aspx)  (saline). In the Gardasil and AAAH control groups, the number of  injuries were fairly close; 83.9% in the Gardasil group and 75.4% in the  AAAH control group. Meanwhile, the rate of injury (again, relating to  injuries at the injection site only), was significantly lower at 48.6%.\n\nNext, he shows Table 9 from the vaccine insert, which is the \"Summary  of girls and women 9 through 26 years of age who reported an incident  condition potentially indicative of a systemic autoimmune disorder after  enrollment in clinical trials of Gardasil, regardless of causality.\"  These conditions include serious systemic reactions, chronic and  debilitating disorders and autoimmune diseases.\n\nNow all of a sudden, there are only two columns, not three as shown  for the injection site injuries. The column left out is that of the  saline placebo group. Kennedy points out that Merck cleverly hides the  hazards of Gardasil by combining the saline group with the aluminum  control, thereby watering down the side effects reported in the  controls. \"They hide the saline group as a way of fooling you, your  pediatrician and the regulatory agency,\" Kennedy says.\n\nLooking at the effects reported in the two groups, 2.3% of those  receiving Gardasil reported an effect of this nature, as did 2.3% of  those receiving the AAAH (aluminum) control or saline placebo. The same  exact ratio of harm is reported in both groups, which makes it appear as  though Gardasil is harmless.\n\nIn reality, we know very little about Gardasil vaccine safety from  the data as presented, since the vast majority of the controls were  given a toxic substance, and they don't tell us how many of those  receiving a truly inert substance developed these systemic injuries.  Still, we can draw some educated guesses, seeing how the injection site  injury ratios between Gardasil and the aluminum group were similar.\n\nMerck's use of AAAH, a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant instead of a  biologically inactive placebo, effectively nullifies its prelicensure  Gardasil safety testing.\n\nAs noted by Peter Gotzche with the Cochrane Center in 2016, when he  co-filed an unofficial complaint against the European Medical Agency for  bias in its assessment of the HPV vaccine, \"The use of active  comparators probably increased the occurrence of harms in the comparator  group, thereby masking harms caused by the HPV vaccine.\"\n\n## Risk evaluation\n\nWhen making an informed decision, you need to know both sides of the  equation — the risk you're trying to avoid, and the risk you're taking  on. Recall that, on average, 1 in 43,478 women will die from cervical  cancer.\n\nIf 2.3% of girls develop an autoimmune disease from Gardasil, then  that translates into 1,000 per 43,500. Even if a 1 in 43,478 chance of  dying from cancer is gone, does it makes sense to trade that for a 1 in  43 chance of getting an autoimmune disease?\n\nAnd how many parents are comfortable giving a child a substance  knowing there's a 1 in 43 chance that this substance will cause a  lifelong disability? Yet that's the choice parents have been fooled into  making.\n\n## Protocol 18\n\nMerck has not disclosed how many clinical safety trials (also called  protocols) it conducted for Gardasil. A slide in Kennedy's presentation  shows a listing of several of the ones known, including protocol 18.  Kennedy says this clinical trial is critical because that was the one  that FDA used as its basis for giving Merck a license to market the  vaccine for use in children as young as 9 years old.\n\nProtocol 18 is the only trial in which the target audience, 9-  through 15-year-old girls and boys, was tested prelicensure. The other  trials looked at the vaccine's safety in 16- through 26-year-olds.  Protocol 18 included just 939 children — \"a very, very tiny group of  people,\" Kennedy says, \"for a product that is going to be marketed to  millions of children around the world.\"\n\nAside from its small cohort size, protocol 18 is also filled with  \"fraud and flimflam,\" according to Kennedy. Merck presented protocol 18  to the FDA and HHS as the only safety trial that used a true  nonbioactive inert placebo. This, however, was a misrepresentation.\n\nInstead of pure saline, the placebo used in protocol 18 contained a carrier solution composed of [polysorbate 80](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2019/02/07/processed-food-emulsifiers-health-risks.aspx),  sodium borate (borax, which is banned for food products in the U.S. and  Europe), genetically modified yeast, L-histidine and DNA fragments. In  essence, the \"placebo\" was all of the vaccine components with the  exception of the aluminum adjuvant and the antigen (viral portion).\n\nVery little if any safety testing has been done on these ingredients,  so their biological effects in the body are largely unknown. What we  can say for sure is that these are not inert substances like saline.  Still, the 596 children given the carrier solution control \"fared much  better than any other cohort in the study,\" Kennedy says.\n\nNone of them had any serious adverse events in the first 15 days.  Now, here's where Merck committed fraud yet again. As Kennedy points  out, Table 20 in protocol 18 shows that Merck cut the amount of aluminum  used in the Gardasil vaccine by half.\n\n>*\"They tested a completely different formulation,\"* he says*.  \"And, obviously, they took the amount of aluminum out to reduce the  amount of injuries and mask the really bad safety profile of this  vaccine …*  \n>  \n>*Since Merck deceptively cut the amount of aluminum — Gardasil's  most toxic component — in half, the data from that study does not  support the safety of the standard Gardasil formulation. Since protocol  18 data are not based on the Gardasil vaccine formulation, the trial  constitutes scientific fraud.\"*  \n \n\n## Exclusion criteria — Another bag of tricks\n\nKennedy also describes another trick used by Merck to skew results:  exclusion criteria. By selecting trial participants that do not reflect  the general population, they mask potentially injurious effects on  vulnerable subgroups.\n\nFor example, individuals with severe allergies and prior genital  infections were excluded, as were those who'd had more than four sex  partners, those with a history of immunological or nervous system  disorders, chronic illnesses, seizure disorders, other medical  conditions, reactions to vaccine ingredients such as aluminum, yeast and  benzonase, and anyone with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.\n\nYet Merck recommends Gardasil for all of these unstudied groups.  Merck's investigators also had unlimited discretion to exclude anyone  with \"any condition which in the opinion of the investigator might  interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.\"\n\nMerck also used \"sloppy protocols to suppress reports of vaccine  injury,\" Kennedy says. For example, only 10% of participants were given  daily report cards to fill out, and they were only to be filled out for  14 days post-vaccination. What's more, these report cards only collected  information about vaccination site effects, such as redness, itching  and bruising.\n\nAlso ignored were autoimmune problems, seizures and menstrual cycle  disruptions experienced by many of the girls. They also did not follow  up with those who reported serious side effects. Merck also granted  broad discretionary powers to its paid investigators to determine what  they thought constituted a reportable adverse event and to dismiss  potential vaccine reactions.\n\nThe researchers did not systematically collect adverse event data,  which is the whole point of doing a safety study in the first place, and  by not paying for the additional time required by investigators to fill  out time-consuming adverse event reports, Merck effectively  incentivized the dismissal of side effects.\n\nMany of the illnesses and injuries reported were also classified as  \"new medical conditions\" rather than adverse events, and no rigorous  investigation of these new conditions were performed.\n\nAccording to Kennedy, at the time of the vaccine's approval, 49.5% of  the Gardasil group and 52% of the controls (who received either the  aluminum adjuvant or the vaccine carrier solution) had \"new medical  history\" after the seventh month (Table 303, which included protocols 7,  13, 15 and 18), many of which were serious, chronic diseases.\n\n## Risk evaluation, take 2\n\n**Taking all of this into account, here's how the risk-benefit equation  looks now: The 1 in 43,478 chance of dying from cervical cancer may  have been removed (assuming the vaccine actually works), but by taking  the vaccine there is now a 1 in 43 chance of getting an autoimmune  disease, and a 1 in 2 chance of developing some form of serious medical  condition.**\n\n## More lies \n\nAccording to Kennedy, Merck also submitted fraudulent information to its Worldwide Adverse Experience System and the federal Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS) about the death of Christina Tarsell, one of its study participants.\n\n>*\"Merck claimed that Chris' gynecologist had told the company that her death was due to viral infection. Chris' gynecologist denies that she ever gave this information to Merck. To this day, Merck has refused to change its false entry on its own reporting system,\"* Kennedy says.  \n>  \n>*\"Furthermore, Merck lied to the girls participating in these studies, telling them that the placebo was saline and contained no other ingredients. And No. 2, that the study in which they were participating was not a safety study. They were told that there had already been safety studies and that the vaccine had been proven safe …*   \n>  \n>*They made it so that the girls were less likely to report injuries associated with the vaccine, because they believed the vaccine they were receiving had already been proven safe and that any injuries did experience, maybe a month, two months or three months after the vaccine must just be coincidental and had nothing to do with the  vaccine.\"*\n\n \n\nBut it gets worse, because there's a possibility Gardasil could cause cancer. The Gardasil insert13  admits it has never been evaluated for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity,  yet its ingredients \"include potential carcinogens and mutagens,  including aluminum and human DNA,\" Kennedy says.\n\nHe goes on to show the results of Merck's study protocol 13 (Table  17: Applicant's analysis of efficacy against vaccine-relevant HPV types  CIN 2/3 or worse among subjects who were PCR positive and seropositive  for relevant HPV types at day 1.)\n\nWhat this protocol showed is that women who had previous exposure to  the HPV strains used in the vaccine had a 44.6% increased risk of  developing CIN2 and CIN3 lesions after vaccination. Taking the dubious  efficacy of Gardasil into account, and the fact that it may only impact  one-third of cervical cancer cases, the risk-benefit lineup when taking  the vaccine now looks like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* There is still a chance of dying from cervical cancer unrelated to HPV \n* There is a 1 in 43 chance of getting an autoimmune disease\n* There is a 1 in 2 chance of developing a serious medical condition\n* If someone has ever been exposed to any of the nine HPV strains  included in the vaccine prior to getting Gardasil the risk of developing  CIN2 and CIN3 cervical lesions is raised by 44.6%, which may raise the  risk of cervical cancer\n\n## Widespread Gardasil use may trigger more virulent HPV infections \n\n\"To make things even worse, there are recent scientific studies that  suggest a phenomenon known as type replacement,\" Kennedy says. \"Type  replacement\" refers to when the elimination or suppression of one viral  strain allows a more virulent strain to colonize. \n\nThe study,14  \"Shift in Prevalence of HPV Types in Cervical Cytology Specimens in the  Era of HPV Vaccination,\" published in the journal Oncology Letters in  2016 — which analyzed the association between the prevalence of 32 types  of HPV virus in 615 women who had abnormal cervical cytopathology —  reported that:\n\n>*\"… HPV16, which is recognized as the main HR-HPV type responsible  for the development of cervical cancer, was observed in 32.98% of HPV  participants, followed by HPV42 (18.09%), HPV31 (17.66%), HPV51  (13.83%), HPV56 (10.00%), HPV53 (8.72%) and HPV66 (8.72%).*   \n>  \n>*The prevalence of HR-HPV types, which may be suppressed directly  (in the case of HPV16 and 18), or possibly via cross-protection (in the  case of HPV31) following vaccination, was considerably lower in  participants ≤22 years of age (HPV16, 28.57%; HPV18, 2.04%; HPV31,  6.12%), compared with participants 23–29 years of age (HPV16, 45.71%;  HPV18, 7.86%; HPV31, 22.86%), who were less likely to be vaccinated.*   \n>  \n>*Consequently, the present study hypothesizes that there may be a  continuous shift in the prevalence of HPV types as a result of  vaccination. Furthermore, the percentage of non-vaccine HR-HPV types was  higher than expected, considering that eight HPV types formerly  classified as 'low-risk' or 'probably high-risk' are in fact HR-HPV  types.*   \n>  \n>*Therefore, it may be important to monitor non-vaccine HPV types  in future studies, and an investigation concerning several HR-HPV types  as risk factors for the development of cervical cancer is required.\"*\n\n*Sources*\n\n   \n\n* 1 [The Pharma Letter February 10, 2006 ](https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/sanofi-pasteur-msd-s-gardasil-becomes-first-hpv-vaccine-approved-in-europe)\n* 2 [FDA.gov, Gardasil Vaccine ](https://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/safetyavailability/vaccinesafety/ucm179549.htm)\n* 3 [NVIC.

        "body": "Alright my dude, your local big pharma shill weighing in. Let's go section by section. Personally, I don't believe Gardasil will be the final evolution of the HPV vaccine, there is a significant amount of space for a competitor to produce and market a safer, more inert competitor. Also, don't think I didn't notice you literally copying and pasting from your biased anti-vax websites, probably a whole lot less work than writing up that entire thing yourself. \n\nFirst, let's talk about your sources because holy shit, this is the biggest clusterfuck I have ever seen on your posts to date. You're making it extra hard to link jump to the original paper. You need to stop citing obviously biased sources like Mercola, NVIC, law firms that would profit from cases, and dedicated antivax orgs. Its fine if you read them, but do us the courtesy of citing the original peer-reviewed articles (NIH and their foreign counterparts, recognized journals, institutional research). Besides, a bunch of your links don't even lead to the point you're making.\n\n>Gardasil is said to protect against cervical cancer, a disease that in the U.S., has a relatively low mortality rate of 1 in 43,478 (2.3 per 100,000)\n\nYou for some reason like to cite mortality figures instead of prevalence figures. And on top of that, you cite mortality relative to total population, not mortality relative to infection rates. Yes, its only 2.3 dead per 100,000, but you fail to mention that there are about 12,000 women diagnosed with cervical cancer, 70% of those were caused by HPV, and about 4,000 will die from it. I'm not sure anyone wants to be a part of that 8,400 each year, especially considering the cost of care. Risk analysis should be conducted from there.\n\n>(a) testing Gardasil against a toxic placebo, and (b) hiding a 2.3% incidence of autoimmune disease occurring within seven months of vaccination.\n\nI don't think you or Kennedy understand the point of a placebo (or are trying to pretend like you don't). The placebo in this case was not to measure Gardasil vs nothing, rather it was measuring Gardasil vs other vaccines. The reason they do this is because they are well aware of the side effects of immune system priming and want to be able to separate the effects of Gardasil alone. If the effects of Gardasil vs the empty vaccine is minimal, it is because the vaccine isn't much worse than other vaccines. Though, in my opinion, we need to move away aluminum adjuvants and rebuild current vaccines dependent on them. People who can't be given the empty vaccine won't be given the Gardasil vaccine (obviously).\n\n>And how many parents are comfortable giving a child a substance knowing there's a 1 in 43 chance that this substance will cause a lifelong disability\n\n>There is a 1 in 2 chance of developing a serious medical condition\n\nWhere are you getting these numbers? I am having trouble finding the sources. Also 1 in 2 is a **very very very** bold claim. I have gotten the novemivalent HPV vaccine, so are you telling me there is a 50% chance of me developing a serious medical condition now? If you're gonna pull numbers out of your ass, at least make them believable.\n\n>Kennedy also describes another trick used by Merck to skew results: exclusion criteria. By selecting trial participants that do not reflect the general population, they mask potentially injurious effects on vulnerable subgroups.\n\nThat's not the point of exclusion criteria. The point of this type of safety study is to find and confirm potential issues with the vaccines. You need to exclude all of the participants that might have problems that might replicate those issues because you can't be sure if it's a symptom or a side-effect. It's not because they might be at more risk of side effects. \n\n>>For example, individuals with severe allergies and prior genital infections were excluded, as were those who'd had more than four sex partners, those with a history of immunological or nervous system disorders, chronic illnesses, seizure disorders, other medical conditions, reactions to vaccine ingredients such as aluminum, yeast and benzonase, and anyone with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.\n\nPeople with severe allergies might have a reaction to vaccines and often have specialized vaccines plans with their doctors. Vaccines don't work on people who already have HPV so no point testing people with genital warts. Lots of partners increases probability of infection and you need to keep out people that might be infected. Of course, if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in the vaccine, you won't be given the vaccine, even outside the trial. Histories of drug and alcohol abuse can manifest in the form of neurological symptoms which is a side-effect that they are looking for.\n\nAlso, can you link directly to table 20? I literally have no idea where you're getting the numbers on cutting the aluminum adjuvant for protocol 18.\n\n>Serotypes\n\nThis is among the few things you might not be fibbing about. Yes, there is significant research showing that serotypes that we are not vaccinated against are showing up in relatively higher quantities. There aren't actually more cases of HPV, just the ratio is changing and a redesign will become necessary as less common serotypes become more common. Which is pretty ironic, considering that you don't think vaccines work. They are only gaining a higher percentage because the serotypes we are vaccinating against are being eliminated.",

    "body": "[Here](https://imgur.com/a/Mnijy) are some pictures of the goods! \n\nWhen you get a haul, even a mini one, there is always at least one thing that doesn't work out the way you thought it would. For my finicky skin, it's usually several things. So I was ***shocked*** when not only did everything from my recent AB haul work for me, but it all worked ***really*** well. So well that I wanted to share my excitement with all of you! I'm still mildly in disbelief right now, this never happens. \n\nCVS was having a BOGO 50% off sale so I decided to try a couple things that I’ve had my eye on. I thought these reviews might be helpful for those in this sub that aren’t very familiar with AB products. My routine is a mix of different types of brands (I do love my French pharmacy products) but I’ve had a lot more luck finding things that work for my skin type in the AB world. Some people get scared off at the idea of ordering things from overseas - either because of shipping cost or the length of shipping times. Since these are all products carried at CVS, they are a lot more accessible for those in the US. \n\n**Skin type:** Oily, dehydration-prone, sometimes sensitive (depends on its mood that day), with a very low tolerance for silicones. \n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Cleansing Foam -** I've had rough luck with foaming cleansers as they all seem to strip my skin (other than my HG LRP Toleraine but it's fun to switch it up sometimes). Not this guy! My skin loves anything aloe and this did not disappoint (aloe is the best humectant for oily skin imo). It has a very dense, thick foam that feels very nice on my skin. The scent is very fresh, it almost reminds me of fresh-cut watermelon and aloe mixed together. It leaves my skin very soft and not remotely stripped. No squeaky-clean feeling here! I'm not positive of the pH but it does contain potassium hydroxide (a pH adjuster) so I'm assuming it's in the normal range and not on the higher end. I think this is going to make a great AM cleanser since it's so gentle. \n\nIngredients: \nAloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Water, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Chlorphenesin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Palmitic Acid, Capric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Potassium Sorbate.\n\n(*Ah-ha! I just saw the watermelon extract as I was adding this, so that explains the lovely scent.)\n\n**Peach Slices Citrus-Honey Aqua Glow Hydrating Moisture Gel -** Holy shit you guys, this is ***everything*** I've been looking for in a winter moisturizer. It's lightweight, a gel, has ceramides, is hydrating *and* moisturizing and doesn't make me oily. The search is over! Seriously, I've been trying to find the perfect moisturizer for about 8 months now. I thought I had the perfect one (Etude House Moistfull Collagen Water Jelly Cream) but turns out it was perfect *for summer*. Once winters cold, dry air came it just wasn't enough. I've desperately wanted to add ceramides to my routine with no luck (Rosette Ceramide Gel was a greasy disaster). The inclusion of ceramides is what originally caught my eye and also the lack of any -cones. My skin is sensitive to silicones and finding a heavier winter moisturizer without any has been virtually impossible. This does include a couple -anes so I was skeptical at first but they don’t seem to bother me as much as straight up dimethicone. Dimethicone + my skin = a greasy mess and lots of clogged pores (and fun little whiteheads all over). The first time I used it, I squeezed out too much but thought 'what the heck, I'll see what happens'. As I began to spread it around, I realized that it was *way* too much product and figured I was doomed for an oily face that night. Cut to a few minutes later, when I was shocked to find that it had ***all*** absorbed. It dries down quickly to a soft, almost-matte finish. It legit gives my skin a healthy glow without making it oily, something that I didn't think was possible. The first time I wore it to work, I was ***incredibly*** impressed by the fact that my skin was still matte at the end of the day. My work's super dry air usually drives my dehydrated skin nuts and by the end of the day, it's over-produced a ton of oil to compensate. But not with this!! It gives my skin the hydration it always needs with just enough moisture to seal it all in. I am absolutely over-the-moon in love with this product and I can't recommend it enough! \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide Np, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol.\n\n**The Saem Iceland Hydrating Soothing Gel -** The name pretty much says it all and it lives up to those claims. It's very hydrating, soothing and feels very refreshing. The fascinating thing about this product is how it dries down. It leaves an almost undetectable finish. I've never had anything disappear into my skin before - and I say that in the best way possible. It doesn't leave a tacky film the way most gels do. I use the Skinfood aloe gel daily (which does leave a bit of stickiness) and out of curiosity, I applied this on top of it. The combo dried down to almost nothing! It took away the stickiness all together. I am highly impressed with this gel! It is definitely a staple in my routine now and (*gasp*) may just replace my beloved Skinfood aloe (at least in the AM).\n\nIngredients: Water, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Perfume, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Silica, Betaine, Heptane, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Propylene Glycol, Butylene glycol, Cetraria Islandica Extract, Sorbitol, Citric acid, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Lactic acid.\n\n**Elisha Coy Refreshing Ampoule Solution Sheet Mask -** Another product that lives up to its name. I was nervous because these are on the cheaper side and usually the quality reflects that. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised! The mask itself fit very well. It's on the thinner side and it reminds me a lot of my fav sheet masks, the Etude House 0.2mm Air Therapy. It stayed in place and despite the essence being very watery, it didn't drip everywhere. The mask really seemed to hold onto the essence. After I took it off, I patted in the remaining essence from the pouch and it all absorbed completely. I was able to continue my routine with no issues. My skin was left hydrated, soothed and happy. \n\nIngredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Chrysanthellum Indicum Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance.\n\nI haven’t had the chance yet to try the rest of the sheet masks yet but I am very excited to do so!! If anyone has any questions, I’m happy to help! :)\n",

    "body": "If you're seeking an incredibly gentle chemical sunscreen then this could be the one for you! Biore UV Kids Milk SPF 50 PA++++ is alcohol-free, fragrance-free, water-proof, sweat-proof, coloring-free, zero white cast, and free of all common irritants/unnecessary ingredients. It's one of the only sunscreens that doesn't annoy my very sensitive, acne-prone, easily reddened, and (currently) badly dehydrated face. It's never caused me to break out. Despite being water-resistant it washes off easily at the end of the day with a mild cleanser (I use Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser) which I really appreciate due to the fact that any kind of scrubbing of my face stings and burns while it's in this dehydrated state. This sunscreen does contain petrolatum, so if that's a sensitivity of yours or an ingredient that you prefer to avoid, you may want to avoid this sunscreen. Personally, I don't find that it makes the sunscreen feel greasy or heavy and it's never cause me to break out. It leaves a delicate dewy coating on my face that I really like (for reference, it has a slightly thicker consistency than Neutrogena's Hydroboost Gel Cream). The addition of petrolatum is invaluable for my dehydrated skin as I feel that it forms a slight occlusive barrier over my morning moisturizer (Cerave Moisturizing Cream or Hada Labo Skin Plumping Gel) to prevent TEWL along with protecting my skin from the sun.  \nIt's available on Amazon in a cheerful-looking 90g yellow bottle. It does take a while to arrive because of how far it has to ship, but it's well worth the wait. I personally adore this sunscreen and will never be without it. I never thought I'd be able to say that I look forward to applying sunscreen every day!  \n\n\nUV filters used:  Octinoxate, Tinosorb S, Uvinul A Plus, and Uvinul T 150    \n\n\nIngredients:  Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, C12-15 Akyl Benzoate,  Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol  Mehtoxyphenyl Triazine, Glyceryl Behenate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl  Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Distearate, Sodium  Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Stearoyl Glutamic  Acid, Paraffin, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Ceresin, Isohexadecane, Arginine,  Lauryl Methacrylate/Sodium Methacrylate Crosspolymer, PEG-12  Dimethicone, Polysorbate 80, Dextrin Palmitate, Disodium EDTA, Agar,  Succinic Acid, BHT, Petrolatum, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol,  Methylparaben, Sodium Dehydroacetate",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**E**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804)**tude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope these reviews were useful & feel free to ask any questions / start any discussions :)",

    "body": "Krave Beauty Kale-Lalu-yAHA \n\nExfoliation can be such a fickle, fickle skincare step. Understanding what type of exfoliating ingredients your skin might need, at what percentage, and how often can be an exhausting process.\n\nEven after playing with different products for a couple of years...I still find myself accidentally over-exfoliating. That ended up being the case with the Krave Beauty Kale-Lalu-yAHA. \n\nFIrst things first, this exfoliating fluid is a lovely thin and watery texture which makes it easy to apply/swipe on using a cotton pad. While a watery acid based toner isn’t that hard to come by...it’s the Kale-Lalu-yAHA’s lack of stickiness or residue that impressed me.\n\nFrom there...5.25% glycolic acid goes to work in removing dead skin cells, reducing dark spots, and all of the other wonderful benefits that AHA products provide. Krave takes it a bit further by including aloe for hydration/soothing, plus a farmers market worth of antioxidant rich greens.\n\nMy first application of this product did include a slight tingling, but it faded rather quickly. The next morning I was stunned to see skin that was noticeably brighter and refined...Kale-Lalu-yAHA works quickly! All of this without irritation...so I made the mistake so many of us make by adding it to my routine every other day.\n\nThis turned out to be way too much for my skin and after that first week or so my skin was feeling raw, looking red, and generally pissed. Luckily I had some great soothing products to turn to and was able to regain control fairly quickly (Beauty of Joseon Calming Serum and Centella Sheet Masks).\n\nEven though this amazing AHA product is fairly gentle and packed with skin supporting ingredients...it is still potent enough to approach with a bit of caution and ease. Once a week or even once every other week might be just fine for some, while others will want to bump the frequency up as they go.\n\nFor me, I’ll be sticking to twice a week with a couple/few days off in between. The last few weeks with this toner have been amazing now that I have a rhythm down and it really has become one of my favorite AHA toners/fluids.\n\nI don’t know why I assumed Krave/Liah Yoo would release an exfoliation product that might be less powerful than some others I have used/geared towards ultra-sensitive skin...but it seems they aren't playing around lol! \n\nFull Ingredients List: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Water, Butylene Glycol, Brassica Oleracea Acephala Leaf (Kale) Extract, Glycolic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Spinacia Oleracea (Spinach) Leaf Extract, Carum Petroselinum (Parsley) Extract, Chlorella Minutissima Extract, Malus Domestica Fruit (Green Apple) Extract, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Betaine Salicylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Pseudozyma Epicola/Camellia Sinensis Seed Oil/Glucose/Yeast Extract Ferment Filtrate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Bacillus/Folic Acid/Soybean Ferment Extract, Coptis Japonica Root Extract, Malachite Extract, Polysorbate 80, Disodium EDT\n\nWhere To Buy (Krave Beauty Site - $25.00 USD - 200ml): [https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/kale-lalu-yaha](https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/kale-lalu-yaha) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/swqk9l2jyxv51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e437de64851fc0e67dbb06dda32677493d4b9291",

The tube seems to have a larger capacity than 50ml, so when you open the product and activate the pump, it already feels a tiny bit empty, but as long as I get the 50ml, I'm satisfied. The pump top does not unscrew easily (I couldn't open it at all) so it won't leak unless the pump is pressed.\n\n**Ingredients:** They aren't using any of the new generation filters, and they are using a combination of organic and inorganic filters. I'm neither elated nor disappointed, if this provides the stated protection I'll be okay with it since I do not have any sensitivities to the filters used.\n\n**Texture:** The texture is a dream😍😍!! It's almost serum like and literally sinks into my skin (oily) and there is no white cast at all, and it leaves a very natural finish; 20-25 minutes post application it almost like there isn't anything on my skin. Y'all can see from the photos that I have skin on the darker end of the spectrum and there is no white cast at all. It doesn't take long to rub in either. They claim it is for all skin types, but I feel it might be too light for some normal-dry skin types, so you might need to use a moisturiser underneath. With the summers about to be full force, I'm excited to test this one out since the texture is so light!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wanc60qwsrn81.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07d0eba133b98bb08c490ef298786a8eaabdaec9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6r4rd5qwsrn81.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=debe98b9921f07c87a9f447e971bee07c997763c\n\n**Protection:** I couldn't really gauge this yet; this is a first impression and I received it today😅😅\n\n**Issues I have with this product:** The brand doesn't mention the water resistance anywhere - not on the tube, the box, the website. This leads me to believe this product isn't water resistant. It sinks into the skin like so I'm kinda confused if it will be able to withstand sweat or not. I'm feeling that it will but that is something that has to be tested\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I will post an update in 2-3 weeks regarding the protection, longevity and how well it reapplies, whether it clogs my pores, etc.*",

    "body": "Dupe of Beauty of Joseon?\nHi, I have recently tried a few products from Korea. While they are not the exact products of Beauty of Joseon, some of the ingredients are similar but of course not exactly the same.  Some of the products are particularly popular in Korea at the moment because Hanbang and plant based?\n\n[KIcho Sheep Oil](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-kicho-sheep-oil-cream.html)\n-this product is free from T.E.A, artificial scents, mineral oil, isopropyl alcohol, paraben, urea, heavy metals and formaldehyde.   Since it is anti aging product and is for dry skin, it contains a lot of plants extract(8 types of berries), essential oil, beeswax, silicone, shea butter hyaluronic acid and oils(grapefruit,lemon, orange) Dimethicone is the second ingredients after water.   So, it can be clogging if you do not like those ingredients.  The moisture lasted whole day.  There are ceramide, lanolin, collagen and sea water. No butylene glycol. (press sample, no affiliate link)\n \n[Hansaeng Cosmetics RIN Bi-gyeol Soo Essence](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-hansaeng-cosmetics-rin-bi.html)\nThis is a hanbang skincare from Korea. Niacinamide is high on the list along with a lot of hanbang which include the famous ginseng ingredients(6 fermented years). It has floral scent to it. Texture is light and absorb well.  It has Triethanol amine  which some said it is dangerous but it is not a problem for me.  No paraben.( press sample ,no affiliate link)\n\n[Hansaeng Cosmetics RIN Bi-gyeol Soo Cream](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-hansaeng-cosmetics-rin-bi_28.html)\nIt has the same hanbang ingredients(fermented 6 years ginseng) in the cream with the same smell but with different kind of texture. It is pretty light and calming. The jar is of course luxurious and looks like a blue pearl. Niacinamide is lower than the essence but it is still high. No paraben but contains Triethanol amine  to adjust the ph.

This is an alternative for someone who doesn't have a doctor willing to prescribe it for them. They have historically made it well. \n\nI do not make any money whatsoever off of my hair formula. The formula is free to use as long as it is attributed to me. AgelessRX pays me royalties to use my image in their marketing, but I do not prescribe it to be sold, their doctors do. 100% of all royalties from AgelessRX go to our patient assistance fund to help our own patients struggling financially get access to medical care or HRT that they would otherwise not be able to afford. \n\nAs always, I have spent a stupid amount of time messing around with this thing in my lab and perfecting it over the past decade with slow but steady gradual improvements. This thing is my baby.\n\nI cannot patent it or sell it, nor do I want to. I am not trying to make money from it (and it wouldn't be legal for me to do so under stark law anyway), but I will voraciously go after anyone who tries to claim it as their own. The formula is **public and free**, and can be used by **any doctor anywhere to any compounding pharmacy they want**. All I ask is that it be written for by name, as \"Dr. Powers Hair Serum V 6.0\" . This is my only request. I need nothing in return, I just am not okay with someone passing this off as their own creation and selling it (which has happened before). \\[If you're thinking about jacking my formula from this post and selling it as your own, I can show you the google reviews of a company that did this before, and I'll say this, it did not go well for them\\]. In short, use the formula for free, make it, sell it, I don't care as long as you list who made it and where it came from. That's all. I want it to help as many people as possible. \n\nIf your doctor would like, if they use Panacea or Braselton, simply writing a script for \"Dr Powers Hair Serum V 6.0\" is enough.

To give you a short answer, yes – such a compound as below is certainly possible but the formulation below Is a terrible formulation and 90% of actives will go to waste. The pharmacists preparing such combination has no pharmaceutical knowledge and just add a bunch of actives together and hope for the best.\n\n \n\nFor topical actives to have a pharmacological effect they need to be in solution – there are published studies on just Minoxidil detailing what the exact ratio of solvents and excipients should be in order to be absorbed – too little solvent and the active does not penetrate – too much alcohol and the solution evaporates too quickly leaving a residue of active. The below formulation starts off being a suspension, meaning those actives in suspension might not even get as far as out of the spray nozzle, never mind having pharmacological effect.\n\n \n\nMinoxidil/Dutasteride and Tretinoin in combination are compatible and yield a solution with good pharmacological effect.\n\n \n\nWe utilise all the other actives, but in different solvent systems as they can be challenging to formulate with and when added together will precipitate out. I can go into great pharmaceutical detail on each of the actives and what sort of pH, solvent systems etc they require but do not want to bore you with the detail.\n\n \n\nI would suggest a combination of Minoxidil 8%/Dutasteride 0.2%/Tretinoin 0.01% applied daily for men – we compound this often for patients. A new trend is also low dose oral Minoxidil for men and women.",

    "body": "# The Rise of Autism\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Centers for Disease Control states:**\n\n>\"About 1 in 6 children in the United States had a developmental disability in 2006-2008, ranging from mild disabilities such as speech and language impairments to serious developmental disabilities, such as intellectual disabilities, cerebral palsy, and autism.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe rates of autism have skyrocketed dramatically in the past two decades nearly 500%. In the year 2000, only 1 in 150 had autism. In the year 2014, that number climbed to 1 in 59[^(1)](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html). In 2018, that number has risen to 1 in 40. It should be expected that in the year 2023 that number will be roughly 1 in 21.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Autism rates in schoolchildren jumped 15% between 2012 and 2014, continuing a two-decade rise, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which does not detail the reasons for the increase.\"  \n>  \n>— *USA Today, April 26, 2018, by Karen Weintraub*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Roughly one in 40 U.S. children has been diagnosed with autism, and a national survey of parents suggests these kids have a harder time getting mental health services than youth with other emotional or behavioral issues.\"  \n>  \n>— *Reuters, November 26, 2018, by* *Lisa Rapaport*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP):\n\n>\"The estimated prevalence of US children with a parent-reported ASD diagnosis is now 1 in 40.\"[^(4)](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/142/6/e20174161)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to a Jama Pediatrics report, findings show that:\n\n>\"The cost of supporting an individual with an ASD and intellectual disability during his or her lifespan was $2.4 million in the United States and £1.5 million (US $2.2 million) in the United Kingdom.\"[^(5)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/1879723)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is accounting for this sudden and rapid increase in the developmental disorder called autism? I will explore those reasons in detail, with a focus on aluminum, by examining how vaccines induce toxicity in the human body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAutism has shown a rapid increase along with the increased rate of vaccinations in children given from birth, until the age of 18. The amount of vaccinations has increased from 2 to 3 on average after birth in 1990, to 30+ on average in the year 2018—this is a conservative estimate. Some personal reports indicate 50+ are given. I have listed a modern vaccine schedule in the references below[^(2)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/child-easyread.html). The Hepatitis B vaccine is given 24 hours after birth, and a 2nd dose at 1 to 2 months old. At 2 months, DTaP (involving 3 vaccinations in one), and 4 other vaccines are given. The process is repeated in the 4th month, and again in the 6th month. It is at 6 months, and annually thereafter that the flu vaccine is given, usually always by needle injection.\\*There has been no long-term study of the vaccine schedule nor the cumulative effect of vaccines in the human body[^(3)](https://www.nvic.org/PDFs/IOM/NVIC-Stmt-2011-AEFI-Rpt.aspx).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAsk yourself: Is the human population getting healthier as a result of this drastic increase of vaccinations, or is health deteriorating? As I have shown, autism rates continue to gradually increase along with the increased rate of vaccinations. This must not be ignored, for within this understanding is the answer to why the prevalence of autism is what it is today. But how, according to modern medical science, do vaccines work?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How Do Vaccines Work?\n\n*(partial explanation for shortness)*\n\nVaccines are supposed to work by provoking the immune response, with the help of an antigen and adjuvant, the latter being made of aluminum nano-particles that invoke the immune system, thereby provoking the production of antibodies. Animal virus tissue is injected into the body along with this adjuvant. The immune response is thusly elevated and anti-bodies are formed to fight against viruses in the future, according to science. But is this the truth of science and reality?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Concerning The Function of Vaccination, and Hyper-Stimulation of the Immune Response:**\n\nAluminum in vaccines helps to artificially elevate the immune response when injected. This is because aluminum in this form is an immune system irritant and allergen, and is stated as such by vaccine manufacturers. These nano-particles of metal find and lodge their way into the brain and spinal cord where they are deposited. I have listed in the section below the ways aluminum stores in the body and the damage it does. These adjuvants easily pass through the blood-brain barrier because they are in such a small particle form that their ability to travel into such regions is made easier, permeability is increased via infection by the hyper-stimulated immune response.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this process, immune cells are provoked and secrete cytokines (types of proteins that direct cell behavior) to produce antibodies by white blood cells (in this case, lymphocytes), but this process creates antibodies that are mutant in nature due to the extreme reaction of the immune system. These mutant antibodies do not go dormant for many years and do not turn off as a natural immune response would. As such, the immune response is constantly in an unnaturally elevated state that does not turn off easily.\n\n^(7)\n\n>Regarding the immediate trauma that vaccines cause in many people, the eminent scientist and physician, Dr. William F. Koch, M.D., Ph.D. said:  \n>  \n>\"The injection of any serum, vaccine, or even penicillin has shown a very marked increase in the incidence of polio - at least 400%. Statistics are so conclusive no one can deny it.\"  \n>  \n>The long term effects of vaccines are just as harmful. Vaccines are made of disease, mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde and other poisonous chemicals. Pharmaceutical houses manufacture diseases in animal tissue. The diseases are sterilized to make vaccines. Sterilization alters the RNA, DNA, structure and actions of diseases or virus. The body cannot find the logical reason for the unnatural disease or virus. Nor can it find the key to the time that the bacteria or virus will be active. Therefore the body creates mutant antibodies that do not go dormant for up to decades.  \n>  \n>These mutant antibodies remain active long after the disease or virus becomes inactive. The mutant antibodies eat sub-particles from the inside of amino acids (proteins) in the blood.^(31) That renders proteins unstable. The amount of proteins damaged and lost to mutant antibodies depends on the number of vaccines. Because amino acids are the primary building blocks of cells, the consequence is cellular malnutrition. In all animals, the malnutrition causes gradual genetic mutations, resulting in weaknesses, diseases, malfunctions, and deformities. The lifespan of mutant antibodies varies, from at least 1 year (penicillin) up to 50 years (polio).^(32) Each vaccine multiplies the number of mutant antibodies, which increases cellular malnutrition and results in greater weaknesses, diseases, malfunctions and deformities.  \n>  \n>*^(31)* *The nature of the sub-particles eaten from proteins is explained in The Persecution and Trial of Gaston Naessens* *by Christopher Bird*  \n>  \n>*^(32)* *The body reacts to antibiotics (like penicillin, tetracycline, etc.) the same as it does to vaccines - that is, mutant antibodies are created.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis also erodes the delicate myelin of the child, the fatty coating around the brain, causing the brain to become more susceptible to damage from vaccines thereafter, especially nerve damage which I will cover in the next section. Myelin insulation is not fully developed at birth. As a result, unprotected nerves are more readily damaged from vaccine induced toxicity. This is called autoimmune encephalomyelitis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How Aluminum Stores in the Body:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAluminum nano-particles are stored in the body, and these particles dissolve slowly over time. These substances have low solubility, and are therefore not filtered from the kidneys. Aluminum particles do not necessarily appear in the blood in high amounts because these particles are eaten by the processes of phagocytosis. Monocytes, a type of white blood cell, feed upon foreign debris and tissue to cleanse them from the body at and around the site of injection. During this janitorial process these cells travel throughout the lymphatic system thus bringing the aluminum particulate they feed upon with them into various organs and tissue, including the brain and spine where they are more easily deposited. When those cells enter these areas after 1 to 2 days, they are called macrophages, where they become part of phagocytosis. Once they reach these areas, they eventually are dissolved and die due to their own metal toxicity since they cannot readily discard such substances easily, and in the process the settlement of these metals occur. The reason these metals are more attracted to areas such as the brain and spine is because they use metallic minerals to conduct light and electrical energy throughout the nervous system, such as iron and other such minerals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAluminum is classified as a neurotoxin that does not occur naturally in the human body. Yet, in this current age of deception, individuals like Paul A. Offit has alluded to the non-fact that aluminum is a nutrient used by the body itself. The reason aluminum would be classified as such, is because aluminum toxicity is so widespread that it is easily and readily found within tissue and/or blood. However, This does not mean it is a nutrient whatsoever that is actually utilized by the body. In perfect conditions, aluminum is not found within the body. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How Damage is Caused:**\n\nAs the body detoxifies over time, the cleansing cycle takes place, which could begin years from the initial accumulation. Subsequent toxicity from vaccines causes a quicker buildup, and thus a detoxification may occur sooner. This cleansing process happens during sleep, when the nervous system and  brain are at rest. When it does decide to cleanse toxicity from the brain and spine, it uses bacteria and/or virus to do so. Waste products are excreted from these processes and discharged through the spine via cerebrospinal fluid, and through the mucosal membranes of the nose via mucus, wherein they can then be excreted from the body, or perspired out through the skin. Yet this is not as simple a process when it involves such substances as metals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a result of metallic toxicity from aluminum, Zeta-Potential is destroyed^(7); nuero-serums in the brain that allow for neurons to move smoothly. This causes clotting making smooth movement of these substances to become restricted, causing a back-up and sedimentation in blood restricting proper blood flow. This essentially causes mini-strokes to occur in the brain, including scarring and hardening. Because of this, great cellular and nerve destruction occurs in these areas. Further deterioration of the spine and brain occur as bacteria and/or viruses appear from infection and the resultant inflammation in order to dissolve accumulated toxicity in and around the tissue of the body. But because this process involves inorganic substances, they cannot readily cleanse the body as they normally could, essentially eating and destroying healthy tissue in the process of attempting the removal of these substances. This makes it appear as though the body is attacking its own tissue, but this is partly an illusion. This function is also present in diseases such as polio, cerebral palsy, and Alzheimer's Disease etc. All of these neurological diseases share almost the same functions; various levels of paralysis of the brain and nervous system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVirus and bacteria's role in the human body, contrary to modern medical science, is to cleanse foreign tissue and debris in order so that is may maintain relative homeostasis. Virus are manufactured in their whole form cellularly to cleanse themselves and surrounding tissue, when the process of phagocytosis, bacterial, parasitical, and fungal processes are largely destroyed due to systemic toxicity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"If you take water into your system as a drink, it goes into your bloodstream directly from the stomach, but if you take in fats, they move in through your lymphatic system. When you take other substances like carbohydrates and proteins, they go into the intestines and from there are passed into the liver as the body's chemical filter. Before they go out into the blood and circulate in the body. Most of your vaccination serums and proteins are not filtered by the liver, consequently vaccinations can be a terrific shock to the system. Injections of foreign substances like viruses, toxins and foreign proteins into the blood stream via vaccinations, have been associated with diseases and disorders to the blood, brain, nervous system and skin. Rare diseases such as atypical measles and monkey fever as well as such well-known disorders as premature aging, allergies, etc. have been associated with vaccines. Also linked to immunizations are such well-known diseases as cancer, leukemia, paralysis, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and sudden infant death syndrome.\"  \n>  \n>— *Dr. William Albrecht, Physician's Desk Reference 34th Edition, 1980*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***I will now show two of my own theories of how autism can possibly arise in children:***\n\n# How Autism Is Passed onto Children\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the adult, the body stores metals in the brain and spine causing cellular destruction. This causes genetic mutation in the parent which is then passed from parent to child causing developmental disorders in the early stages of growth in the fetus. These metals are introduced in the majority of the population through tap water, canned foods, canned drinks, nonstick and aluminum cookware, deodorants, soaps, baking powders, candies, and other such items. These cause steady accumulation of aluminum, metals, and heavy metals in the population over a period of years. As a result of this, widespread neurological maladies increase and grow, and is passed onto the parents' children. It is usually the sperm of the male parent that is affected, but during pregnancy, the mother can induce her own toxicity to the fetus in various ways. However, what must be noted is that an adult may not necessarily have signs of autism, but because these metals cause certain cellular destruction especially in the reproductive areas, the child becomes much more susceptible. This accounts for the reason a parent may not exhibit signs of autism, yet the child does, even if vaccines are not received in either. It must also be noted that it is not only metal that inhibits proper child development. It is also due to many environmental factors, one of which is high levels of fluoride and lead in water, toothpastes, and bottled water for children. This in combination with the detrimental effects of metallic toxicity creates certain toxic degenerative conditions, especially neurological.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Another Way Autism Occurs in Children:**\n\nA 2nd way autism can occur is through what I call 'rapid vaccine induced toxicity' (RVIT) after birth. This occurs almost instantly in children who receive vaccinations, such as the Hepatitis B vaccine given merely 24 hours after birth or before. As stated in the previous sections, myelination has not yet occurred to its full extent, and does not begin to fully develop until the age of 20 and into early adulthood. This means that the elevated immune response, and the resultant infection, is much more likely to cause damage to the function of the brain bringing about developmental autism; a stunted growth wherein the brain and nervous system cannot properly develop as it should. Without proper myelin, the brain is not insulated or protected. This is why vaccine induced toxicity is such a problem for children.\\*This proceeds the earlier topic above, where I covered the science behind how this elevated immune response works, and why the injection of foreign tissue along with adjuvant causes the body to become overly alerted, creating an immune response that is unnatural. This process of rapid vaccine induced toxicity also has the potential of occurring at later stages other than newborn, if vaccines are administered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Known Ingredients in Vaccines That Also Cause Toxicity****^(6)****:**\n\n* Aluminum hydroxide (directly linked to Alzheimer's Disease)\n* Aluminum phosphate (directly linked to Alzheimer's Disease)\n* Ammonium sulfate (an inorganic chemical compound used a fertilizer and \"protein purifier\"; known to cause kidney & liver damage, gastrointestinal dysfunctions)\n* Amphotericin B (an \"antifungal disinfectant” that damages the urinary tract, bowels, heart functions)\n* Animal tissues: pig blood, horse blood, rabbit brain, dog kidney, monkey kidney, chick embryo, chicken egg, duck egg, and calf (bovine) serum, fetal bovine serum VERO cells, a continuous line of monkey kidney cells, and washed sheep’s red blood cells. Those build foundation for neurological diseases)\n* Betapropiolactone (disinfectant)\n* Ethylene glycol (antifreeze, proven to have extreme neurotoxic side effects)\n* Formaldehyde (used as a preservative, embalming fluid, and disinfectant, known to cause cancer, chronic bronchitis, eye irritation and numerous other diseases)\n* Formalin (used as a disinfectant or anti-bacterial, containing 37% formaldehyde)\n* Gelatin (causes allergic reactions and anaphylaxis usually associated with sensitivity to processed egg or gelatin)\n* Gentamycin (antibiotic: destroys digestion and impairs healing)\n* Glycerol (used as a solvent, an antifreeze, a plasticizer, and a sweetener and in the manufacture of dynamite, cosmetics, liquid soaps, inks, and lubricants)\n* MF-59 (oil-based and composed of squalene, Tween 80 and Span85. All oil adjuvants injected into rats were found to be toxic, caused disease similar to multiple sclerosis which left them crippled and dragging their paralyzed hindquarters)\n* Human diploid cells (from aborted fetal tissue)\n* Hydrolyzed gelatin (obtained by chemical extraction from the skin, white connective tissue and bones of animals, such as cowhide splits, bones (ossein), pork skin, and fish skin)\n* Monosodium glutamate (MSG; causes cancer in humans, also linked to obesity)\n* Neomycin (antibiotic: destroys digestion and impairs healing)\n* Neomycin sulfate (antibiotic: destroys digestion and impairs healing)\n* Nonoxynol (toxic chemotherapy used to treat venereal diseases)\n* Octoxinol 9 (toxic chemical used in vagina to kill sperm)\n* Phenol red indicator (a highly toxic carolic acid disinfectant dye, attributed to liver, kidney, heart and respiratory damage)\n* Phenoxyethanol (antifreeze, proven to have extreme neurotoxic side effects)\n* Potassium diphosphate (destroys libido and motivation)\n* Potassium monophosphate (destroys libido and motivation)\n* Polymyxin B (antibiotic: destroys digestion, damages liver and kidneys, and impairs healing)\n* Polysorbate 20 (trademarked Tween 20; emulsifier that often prevents absorption of nutrients causing malnutrition)\n* Polysorbate 80 (trademarked Tween 80: a preservative that can cause severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis)\n* Porcine (pig) pancreatic hydrolysate of casein (isolated concentration of certain proteins that cause nutritional imbalances, allergies and often excessive hunger or the opposite anorexia)\n* Residual MRC5 proteins (chemically isolated toxic proteins from cancerous DNA)\n* Resin (causes allergic reactions)\n* Sodium phosphate (solvent, dangerous, even lifethreatening, toxicity may occur while using sodium phosphate if you have kidney disease, have congestive heart failure, have an electrolyte imbalance; or are on a sodium restricted diet)\n* Sorbitol (sugar alcohol that dissolve intestinal villi)\n* Squalene (causes severe arthritis and lupus in humans at only 10-20 parts per billion)\n* Sucrose (dissolves cellular walls and intestinal villi)\n* Thimerosal (mercury; a neurotoxin linked to psychological, neurological & immunological problems. Nervous system damage, kidney disease, birth defects, dental problems, mood swings, mental changes, hallucinations, memory loss, nerve damage and inability to concentrate can occur. Symptoms also include tremors, loss of dermal sensitivity, slurred speech and, in rare cases, even death and paralysis. This additive alone was the catalyst for another recent Class Action Lawsuit organized by mothers of children born with Autism & the many related behavioral disorders associated with it. Autism is now occurring at levels never seen before in history, 1 in 67. The average used to be 1 in 20,000.)\n* Tri(n)butylphosphate (solvent and plasticizer)\n* Triton X100 (a strong detergent)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Summary\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Aluminum adjuvant from vaccines, and other such metals from the environment, are deposited in the body.**\n* **The processes of phagosytosis carries these metals into various organs and tissues within the body, including the brain.**\n* **Metal is deposited from the cellular destruction of the processes of phagocytosis, wherein these cells self dissolve and die due to their own metal toxicity.**\n* **Zeta-Potential is destroyed in this process; serums in the brain that maintain smooth movement of neurons. This causes coagulation/congestion and clotting of blood flow to and in brain, which causes strokes in the brain, brain lesions and scarring, and hardening of the brain.**\n* **The brain and spine more readily store these metals because they use metallic minerals to reflect and conduct light and electrical energy throughout the nervous system.**\n* **Lack of adequate myelination in newborn children greatly increase the likelihood of damage to the brain and nerves. Demylination from vaccine damage thereafter opens the brain and nerves up to further damage.**\n* **Autism can occur in more than one way: Two ways include through mutated genetics of the male parent caused by metal toxicity over time, which causes such reproductive harm. Or more commonly, through rapid vaccine induced toxicity—(RVIT).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVaccine induced toxicity is largely to blame for the incredible increase in autism and developmental disorders. Metals from the environment play a large role as well, but is not as much of an immediate direct threat as that of vaccines; but their threat is a reality nonetheless. Vaccines can cause instant damage to the undeveloped child. As well as this, the accumulation of vaccine toxicity over ones life is a danger to all children and adults that receive them.  This includes all vaccines—some being more dangerous than others, but *all* being dangerous, and all being ineffective. The toxicity accumulated through the use of 30+ vaccines almost certainly guarantees the manifestation of disease at a later point in life, even if autism has already occurred from it in the early stages. Each body responds differently, but more often than not they respond in similar ways to one another.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is not merely the metal and chemical toxicity of vaccines that are a threat to health—it is vaccine itself, irregardless of ingredients. The very premise of vaccines cannot work, nor can they ever work, for vaccines are predicated upon the false Germ Theory of disease that states virus and bacterium cause disease. This is a subject for another posting, but is a subject that goes to the heart of why the medical industry operates as it does today. And it is a subject that must be understood before understanding how vaccines are supposed to work. Vaccines are a great deception to mankind, whom has lived on this earth relatively disease-free since their existence without the use of vaccinations; living in vibrant health where they had access to natural food, and clean air and water.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVaccine supporters point to better diagnosis being the cause of autism, yet as I have shown, this is simply not the case. For this to be the case, a spectrum of diseases would show a decline in light of this better way of diagnosis, but the data does not reflect this. Diagnosis would hardly be any different 20 years ago to what it is today, and in the past 30 years, there has been a steady increase of autism, and 'autism-like' disorders. The increase of autism is real. Compounding the problem is a great cognitive dissonance especially with regards to vaccination, for admitting fault with your own ignorance and complacency comes at a personal price and toll—the awakening; the price of admitting that you have possibly damaged yourself, your children, and your family's health as a result of your unwillingness to seek out the truth of what you are placing into your body. That you stubbornly believed the majority without hesitation. In this way, one would have to admit fault with themselves if they were to seek out this truth; to realize that it is possible they were in fact wrong in their initial stance. Pride, ego, and fear dictate their belief system, and they will not be moved unless they are open to the truth and all therein.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis taking place is usually never the outcome for such people. Emotions are used against the weak-minded, and they succumb to the temptation to displace their courage to question, when their intuitive instincts tell them otherwise. After-all, who are you to question someone who has the authority and credentials to back themselves up? Who are you to question the majority of the population and popular belief? And yet, it is the majority who time and time again, because of their great ignorance toward truth, allowed such authority to maintain control over them, and because of their willingness to go along to get along, they gladly get in line to be sheered and slaughtered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReferences:\n\n^(1) [https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html)\n\n^(2) [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/child-easyread.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/child-easyread.html)\n\n^(3)  [https://www.nvic.org/PDFs/IOM/NVIC-Stmt-2011-AEFI-Rpt.aspx](https://www.nvic.org/PDFs/IOM/NVIC-Stmt-2011-AEFI-Rpt.aspx)\n\n (*Institute of Medicine report on vaccines, review by NVIC, 2011. — Thanks to* [*Tsuikaya*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tsuikaya) *for this study.)*\n\n^(4) [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/142/6/e20174161](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/142/6/e20174161)\n\n^(5) [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/1879723](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/1879723)\n\n^(6) *The Only Answer to Cancer, 2009, by Leonard Coldwell* \n\n^(7) *We Want to Live, 2007 2nd edition, page 135 & 223 by Aajonus Vonderplanitz*\n\n&#x200B;",

Reviewing some sunscreen/makeup removers today.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o825xixzx6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=686f4f5f086654b57e35cd8906675ccf223ed22a\n\n**My skin type:** Sensitive, very dry (Actives: tretinoin microsphere 0.04%, AHA/BHA peel)\n\n**I Wear:** Heavy-duty, waterproof sunscreen on the daily, on makeup days - heavy-duty waterproof makeup, especially waterproof eye makeup that is difficult to remove. I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance. Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@!

The medical literature should not be removed from the debate because it informs the public of the risks of vaccines - all the science needs to be debated. \n\n>And the debate should not be framed as pro or anti-vaccination - it is only the media that is framing it this way. Informed choice is about debating all the science in the medical literature\n\n>Why is the Australian public being prevented by the media and pro-vaccine lobby groups from seeing all the medical literature on vaccines? \n\n>Science is about scrutiny of the evidence, not selective evidence, yet Australian journalists have been informed by the Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA) that they [do not have to present](http://vaccinationdecisions.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ACMA-Final-Report-2976-May-2013.pdf) (pdf) the other side of the vaccination debate. \n\n>How can population health be protected if all the science is not being presented to make an informed choice? \n\n>[Here is the science](http://vaccinationdecisions.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/5754-Health-PosterA4_no-logo.pdf) (pdf) that is being left out of the vaccination debate. \n\n>Public health is at risk if the government is developing public health policies on selective science controlled by lobby groups.\n\n>Australian state and federal legislation is infringing on freedom of speech, association and peaceful protests in Australia and a Melbourne Human Rights Lawyer, Emily Howe, [has discussed these concerns](http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2015/02/04/australia-urged-remove-restrictions-rights) that are currently in a report before the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.\n\n##HPV Vaccine \n\n>In 2011 I asked the Australian public health authorities [why](http://vaccinationdecisions.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/OpenletterProfStanleyandTGA2011.pdf) (pdf) sodium borate and polysorbate 80 are found in the HPV vaccine? These ingredients are known to cause infertility in laboratory animals.\n \n>The Australian regulatory board for vaccines did not provide an answer to this question. \n\n>The aluminium adjuvant found in HPV vaccines is also linked to causing neurological disorders and autoimmune diseases yet in December 2014 [the FDA approved](http://aapnews.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/12/11/aapnews.20141211-1) a new HPV vaccine that contains double the amount of aluminium adjuvant as the current HPV vaccine. \n\n>The current HPV vaccines [have been linked to thousands of serious adverse events](http://sanevax.org/) and adolescents will now be receiving 1,500 mcg of aluminium adjuvant from 3 doses of the new HPV vaccine if it is approved in Australian school vaccination programs. \n\n>*This amount of aluminium has never been tested in long-term studies of children's health.*\n\n>The World Health Organisation states that Pap screening is the safest and most effective method of detecting and preventing cervical cancer in women.\n\n##HPV Vaccines and Fertility\n\n>Dr. Deirdre Little, an Obstetrician in NSW Australia, reveals that HPV vaccines have never been tested in animal studies for the effects on the reproductive system before they were implemented in global vaccination programs targeting adolescents. \n\n>The information that she presents [in her video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=CoWUSuGCo-I#t=531) was published in the British Medical Journal in 2012 and she describes the lack of safety and efficacy known about HPV vaccines before they were introduced. \n\n>The lack of animal studies done on this vaccine is significant because it is necessary to test vaccines in animals to understand the possible adverse events that might occur in humans. \n\n>This is particularly the case for determining the long-term safety of the vaccines in humans and specifically the effects on the human reproductive organs and fertility.

But since the spring I’ve been taking a medication for migraines that’s injectable monthly called Aimovig. \n\nIt says “Aimovig (erenumab-aooe) Injection is a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.” \n\nErenumab-aooe is a human immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) monoclonal antibody that has high affinity binding to the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor. Erenumab-aooe is produced using recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. It is composed of 2 heavy chains, each containing 456 amino acids, and 2 light chains of the lambda subclass, each containing 216 amino acids, with an approximate molecular weight of 150 kDa.  *Each 1 mL single-dose prefilled autoinjector and single-dose prefilled glass syringe contains 70 mg erenumab-aooe, acetate (1.5 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.10 mg), and sucrose (73 mg)*. \n\n\nSo my question is, this particular medication seems a bit different then anything I’ve ever tried before. What exactly does it do? It binds to a protein within the body to prevent migraines?",

During migraines CGRP is released, so by blocking up the receptor (CGRPR) with this antibody, that CGRP cannot bind to its receptors to cause the downstream effects which are the symptoms of a migraine.

        "body": "Something you might find interesting is how Aimovig is an 'antibody protein' therapeutic whereas the vast majority of drugs are 'small molecule' therapeutics.  If you think human cellular activity as being dictated by series of chemical pathways, we have all these receptors and enzymes within us that control those pathways.  They're like doors that help control what can occur and how much within the cell.  You can think of drugs as tools that help unlock or open those doors, depending on whether you want to increase or decrease the activity of some cellular pathway.  Small molecules (most drugs) are tiny molecular entities that insert into the pockets of proteins to shut them down.  In our analogy they're like keys that can unlock or lock a door.  Now coming to your protein antibody drug Aimovig.  Instead of delicately inserting into the key hole of the door, antibody drugs are like a big piece of clay that covers the doorknob entirely.  They're often over two orders of magnitude larger in size as small molecules since they are proteins designed to bind a general region of a cellular target (our door).  This often has a cool knock on effect in the fact that large proteins take a lot longer for our bodies to clear from our systems.  This means antibody drugs can often be dosed more infrequently since they tend to evade metabolic enzymes in our livers and aren't immediately filtered into urine by our kidneys so it's a double win.  Hope you find this informative and interesting.",

They grew human microbiome colonies in vitro and directly applied the emulsifiers to them in incredibly, impossibly high levels, which is totally valid but not really how you'd eat them. It assumes they 100% survive gut transit and are unaffected by everything else you eat with them.\n\nFor example, glycerol stearate and oleate will be sensitive to lipase and gut pH and likely split in to fatty acid and glycerol well before reaching your large intestine. So the impacts observed here are probably not reflective of what actually happens in your gut.\n\nTl;Dr this is important and interesting but needs to not be over extrapolated just yet.

    "body": "Hair Type: Thin, 2B/C Curl Patterns, Oily scalp, prone to hairfall\n\nSome hair background:\nSo I switched to using silicone and sulphate free haircare on a whim back in 2017. To my surprise, this changed my previously mostly straight hair to pretty curly. I learnt about CGM afterwards but since that seemed like a lot of effort, I just stuck to using CG friendly products and was happy with what my hair looked like. Cut to 3 months ago, when I moved to a new place with a really humid climate and my hair fall became like 10 fold. I tried going back to products that had worked for me in the past but nothing helped. Eventually, I thought, that the increased frizziness caused by humidity was the cause of the hair fall and since no product seemed to make my hair soft and silky like before, I decided to go back to silicones. A combination that helped my hair fall to some extent was Bblunt Intense Moisture Shampoo (the blue one) and Loreal Professional Serie Quinoa Protein Hair Mask (used this as conditioner after every wash). But this combination also did make my hair straighter than it had been in recent years. Decided to give the BBlunt Curly Hair range a try (the pink color one). This range does contain Silicones, so it is not strictly CG friendly but it has worked for me. I do not use any leave-in products to style my hair, but I don't mind some frizz. The curls I get from just these 3 products are pretty impressive, as good as any other CG friendly shampoo/conditioners I have used in the past. And my hair fall though still not as less as it was 6 months ago, is definitely better. Details below.\n\n1) Bblunt Curly Hair Prepoo (Pink and white tub packaging)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Vera Extract, Cocos (Coconut)Water, Aayla mido propyltrimonium Chloride/Acrylamide Copolymer, Citric Acid, PEG-90M, Parfum (Perfume)\n\nThoughts: Definitely my favourite of the 3. I have been looking for a  pre-shampoo product to add to my routine. Oiling and Aloeing have not worked for me. I have previously used some hair masks that said they can be used before shower but they were thick and creamy and impossible to spread properly on semi-wet or dry hair. THIS product is everything I wanted. It is a gel-like consistency, spreads super easily. I usually brush out my hair before showering and this is when I lose the most hair. Since this product claims at helping in detangling I decided to use this before I brush my hair and the hair I lost was significantly less! During and post-shower, my hair maintains great slip!  This has the potential to be HG for me. It has a pleasant coconutty smell, but the fragrances in these products do not last too long, which is nice (The loreal mask makes my hair smell like a salon even 2 days later).\n\nRepurchase Status: WRP Definitely!\n\n2) Bblunt Curly Hair Shampoo (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Cocamidopropyl Retain, Decyl Glucoside, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Acrylates Copolymer, Cocamide MEA, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol, PEG-150 Distearate, Polysilicone-29, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Menthol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine,TriticumVulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polysorbate-80, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Parfum (Perfume).\n\nThoughts: It is a shampoo that does its job. It cleans my oily scalp well without stripping it too much. It does not lather and spread as well as the blue BBlunt shampoo but that is to be expected as this one does not have SLS. One thing I have to mention is that near my roots this is the only product from the 3 that I used, and I noticed that the hair in that area did have some curls (usually hair close to my roots does not curl up), so this shampoo is definitely doing something right. Smells pretty fresh (like a cactus? or something softer than that lol) cant describe it. But again the smell does not linger post-shower.\n\nRepurchase Status: Maybe (I have a bunch of other shampoos lying around that I have to finish up first post-monsoon. If using any of those increases my hair fall again, will return to this)\n\n3) Bblunt Curly Hair Conditioner (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Behentrimonium, Methosulfate, Isopropyl Myristate, Dimethicone, Almond Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Silicone Quaternium, Polyquaternium-7, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cococoyl Satosire, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Polysorbate-20, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Panthenol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, MAgnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Trideceth-12, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Dipropylene Glycol, Perfume\n\nThoughts: When I first used it I felt like it was super light and would not do much conditioning, but to my surprise when I rinsed it out, my hair had great slip, and detangled very easily. Some of that I will say must be because of the prepoo, but this conditioner also must be contributing. I guess since I was using the super thick loreal mask as conditioner previously, that's why this conditioner feels very light to me, but if it's doing its job, then it's ok of course. This smells like something sweet... white chocolate or marzipan. Overall I like it, and in combination with the prepoo, my hair is a lot softer than the loreal mask. \n\nRepurchase Status: Probably (again have a bunch of conditioners, i wish to use up first)\n\nI am a bit confused that even with silicones, how do these products work so well in giving me curls. Maybe I just don't know enough about how silicones work. But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down, I can use my Fix My Curls Cleansing Shampoo once in a while, I guess.",

Silicones are nothing but emollients just like natural oils that cg community likes to sing praises about... Except silicones are better than natural oils at their job of calming down the frizz and are lighter. And about weighing down, would your hair feel weighed down if you continuously apply oil without washing it off? Yes, yes you will. And what are oils again? Emollients same as a silicones. You see the similarity and the comparison. It took me a while to get out of the influencer-fed info that SILICONES WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY CURLY HAIR... Because I use sulphate free shampoo (wow shampoo at that) and silicone conditioner and feel no difference.\n\nSome people cannot tolerate silicones because that's how their *individual* hair is... Just like some people can't tolerate hyaluronic acid or a niacinamide serum. But this fear of silicones and this blanket statement that silicones are bad for curly hair comes from lack of education and knowledge about them. And if you have any doubt, feel free to ask.",

I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha. \n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL.

This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent. \n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**E**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804)**tude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent. \n\n**Feel:** A watery toner. \n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation. \n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent. \n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope these reviews were useful & feel free to ask any questions / start any discussions :)",

    "body": "I love MBD sheet masks, but I’ve always suspected that they are not actually that different from one another, even though there are lots of different types that [supposedly have different properties.](https://www.google.com/search?q=my+beauty+diary+masks&espv=2&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=vLF3VL6dGvKHsQSF24C4BQ&ved=0CDYQsAQ&biw=1093&bih=514) I compared the ingredients in 12 of the masks and wanted to share my findings and solicit the opinions of others. All ingredient data comes from Amazon.com or Makeup Alley, so it might be imperfect.\n\n*My questions for you:* Are any of these ingredients especially noteworthy? Do you think there are any functional differences between the masks?\n\n*Observations:* The top 5 ingredients in all of the masks are nearly identical, although they appear in different orders on the list, indicating that there may be more or less of them in different masks. They are: **Purified water, Glycerin(e), 1,3-Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Gel/Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice/Aloe Extract.** (Not sure of the differences between the aloe ingredients, I'm counting them as one item for the purposes of this comparison.)\n\nA few masks had a unique item in their top 5 ingredients.

Serious adverse reactions  reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in  relation to Gardasil include but are not limited to:4\n\n \n\n* Anaphylaxis\n* Guillain-Barre Syndrome\n* [Transverse myelitis](https://articles.mercola.com/shingles.aspx) (inflammation of the spinal cord)\n* [Pancreatitis](https://articles.mercola.com/pancreatitis.aspx)\n* Venous thromboembolic events (blood clots)\n* Autoimmune initiated motor neuron disease (a neurodegenerative disease that causes rapidly progressive muscle weakness)\n* [Multiple sclerosis](https://articles.mercola.com/multiple-sclerosis.aspx)\n* Sudden death\n\n \n\nPostmarketing experiences and adverse events reported during post-approval use listed on the Gardasil vaccine insert5  include blood and lymphatic system disorders such as autoimmune  hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and  lymphadenopathy; pulmonary embolus; pancreatitis; autoimmune diseases;  anaphylactic reactions; arthralgia and myalgia (musculoskeletal and  connective tissue disorders); nervous system disorders such as acute  disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, motor neuron  disease, paralysis, seizures and transverse myelitis; and deep venous  thrombosis, a vascular disorder.\n\nAccording to \"Manufactured Crisis — HPV, Hype and Horror,\" a film6  by The Alliance for Natural Health, there have also been cases of  16-year-old girls developing ovarian dysfunction, meaning they're going  into menopause, which in turn means they will not be able to have  children.\n\nDespite such serious effects, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) and FDA allege the vast majority, or even all, of  these tragic cases are unrelated to the vaccine, and that Gardasil is  safe.\n\nThe Plaintiff's Science Day Presentation on Gardasil video features  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel for Children's  Health Defense,7  an organization originally founded in 2016 as World Mercury Project and  renamed in 2018 to focus on exposing and eliminating multiple harmful  exposures contributing to the epidemic of chronic ill health among  children. The video details the many safety problems associated with  Merck's HPV vaccine, Gardasil.\n\nThe information presented is based on publicly available government documents. Kennedy notes that, if what he says about [Merck](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/05/14/mercks-adhd-drugs-unsafe.aspx) in this video presentation were untrue, they would be considered slanderous.\n\nHowever, Kennedy says he is not concerned about being sued for  slander. He says he knows Merck won't sue, \"because in the U.S., truth  is an absolute defense against slander\" and Merck knows that, were the  company to sue for slander, Kennedy would file discovery requests that  would unearth even more documents detailing Merck's fraudulent  activities.\n\nKennedy's presentation does not go into the biological mechanisms by  which Gardasil causes harm. He directs parents and pediatricians to the  Children's Health Defense website8 to read peer reviewed medical literature sources for that information.\n\nInstead, Kennedy's presentation focuses on what he describes as  Merck's fraudulent clinical trials of Gardasil vaccine, which were used  to gain FDA approval. While this article provides you with a summary of  the key points, I urge you to watch Kennedy's presentation in in its  entirety, as this information may well save you or your child a lifetime  of heartache and exorbitant medical expenses.\n\n \n\n## How Merck committed fraud in its Gardasil safety testing \n\nKennedy says the fraud Merck committed in its safety testing is (a)  testing Gardasil against a toxic placebo, and (b) hiding a 2.3%  incidence of autoimmune disease occurring within seven months of  vaccination.\n\nIn his presentation, Kennedy shows Table 1 from the package insert9  for Gardasil, which looks at vaccine injuries at the site of injection.  It shows that Gardasil was administered to 5,088 girls; another 3,470  received the control, amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate (AAAH)  — a neurotoxic aluminum vaccine adjuvant that has been associated with  many serious vaccine injuries in the medical literature.\n\nA third group, consisting of 320 individuals, received a proper [placebo](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/02/20/placebo-effect.aspx)  (saline). In the Gardasil and AAAH control groups, the number of  injuries were fairly close; 83.9% in the Gardasil group and 75.4% in the  AAAH control group. Meanwhile, the rate of injury (again, relating to  injuries at the injection site only), was significantly lower at 48.6%.\n\nNext, he shows Table 9 from the vaccine insert, which is the \"Summary  of girls and women 9 through 26 years of age who reported an incident  condition potentially indicative of a systemic autoimmune disorder after  enrollment in clinical trials of Gardasil, regardless of causality.\"  These conditions include serious systemic reactions, chronic and  debilitating disorders and autoimmune diseases.\n\nNow all of a sudden, there are only two columns, not three as shown  for the injection site injuries. The column left out is that of the  saline placebo group. Kennedy points out that Merck cleverly hides the  hazards of Gardasil by combining the saline group with the aluminum  control, thereby watering down the side effects reported in the  controls. \"They hide the saline group as a way of fooling you, your  pediatrician and the regulatory agency,\" Kennedy says.\n\nLooking at the effects reported in the two groups, 2.3% of those  receiving Gardasil reported an effect of this nature, as did 2.3% of  those receiving the AAAH (aluminum) control or saline placebo. The same  exact ratio of harm is reported in both groups, which makes it appear as  though Gardasil is harmless.\n\nIn reality, we know very little about Gardasil vaccine safety from  the data as presented, since the vast majority of the controls were  given a toxic substance, and they don't tell us how many of those  receiving a truly inert substance developed these systemic injuries.  Still, we can draw some educated guesses, seeing how the injection site  injury ratios between Gardasil and the aluminum group were similar.\n\nMerck's use of AAAH, a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant instead of a  biologically inactive placebo, effectively nullifies its prelicensure  Gardasil safety testing.\n\nAs noted by Peter Gotzche with the Cochrane Center in 2016, when he  co-filed an unofficial complaint against the European Medical Agency for  bias in its assessment of the HPV vaccine, \"The use of active  comparators probably increased the occurrence of harms in the comparator  group, thereby masking harms caused by the HPV vaccine.\"\n\n## Risk evaluation\n\nWhen making an informed decision, you need to know both sides of the  equation — the risk you're trying to avoid, and the risk you're taking  on. Recall that, on average, 1 in 43,478 women will die from cervical  cancer.\n\nIf 2.3% of girls develop an autoimmune disease from Gardasil, then  that translates into 1,000 per 43,500. Even if a 1 in 43,478 chance of  dying from cancer is gone, does it makes sense to trade that for a 1 in  43 chance of getting an autoimmune disease?\n\nAnd how many parents are comfortable giving a child a substance  knowing there's a 1 in 43 chance that this substance will cause a  lifelong disability? Yet that's the choice parents have been fooled into  making.\n\n## Protocol 18\n\nMerck has not disclosed how many clinical safety trials (also called  protocols) it conducted for Gardasil. A slide in Kennedy's presentation  shows a listing of several of the ones known, including protocol 18.  Kennedy says this clinical trial is critical because that was the one  that FDA used as its basis for giving Merck a license to market the  vaccine for use in children as young as 9 years old.\n\nProtocol 18 is the only trial in which the target audience, 9-  through 15-year-old girls and boys, was tested prelicensure. The other  trials looked at the vaccine's safety in 16- through 26-year-olds.  Protocol 18 included just 939 children — \"a very, very tiny group of  people,\" Kennedy says, \"for a product that is going to be marketed to  millions of children around the world.\"\n\nAside from its small cohort size, protocol 18 is also filled with  \"fraud and flimflam,\" according to Kennedy. Merck presented protocol 18  to the FDA and HHS as the only safety trial that used a true  nonbioactive inert placebo. This, however, was a misrepresentation.\n\nInstead of pure saline, the placebo used in protocol 18 contained a carrier solution composed of [polysorbate 80](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2019/02/07/processed-food-emulsifiers-health-risks.aspx),  sodium borate (borax, which is banned for food products in the U.S. and  Europe), genetically modified yeast, L-histidine and DNA fragments. In  essence, the \"placebo\" was all of the vaccine components with the  exception of the aluminum adjuvant and the antigen (viral portion).\n\nVery little if any safety testing has been done on these ingredients,  so their biological effects in the body are largely unknown. What we  can say for sure is that these are not inert substances like saline.  Still, the 596 children given the carrier solution control \"fared much  better than any other cohort in the study,\" Kennedy says.\n\nNone of them had any serious adverse events in the first 15 days.  Now, here's where Merck committed fraud yet again. As Kennedy points  out, Table 20 in protocol 18 shows that Merck cut the amount of aluminum  used in the Gardasil vaccine by half.\n\n>*\"They tested a completely different formulation,\"* he says*.  \"And, obviously, they took the amount of aluminum out to reduce the  amount of injuries and mask the really bad safety profile of this  vaccine …*  \n>  \n>*Since Merck deceptively cut the amount of aluminum — Gardasil's  most toxic component — in half, the data from that study does not  support the safety of the standard Gardasil formulation. Since protocol  18 data are not based on the Gardasil vaccine formulation, the trial  constitutes scientific fraud.\"*  \n \n\n## Exclusion criteria — Another bag of tricks\n\nKennedy also describes another trick used by Merck to skew results:  exclusion criteria. By selecting trial participants that do not reflect  the general population, they mask potentially injurious effects on  vulnerable subgroups.\n\nFor example, individuals with severe allergies and prior genital  infections were excluded, as were those who'd had more than four sex  partners, those with a history of immunological or nervous system  disorders, chronic illnesses, seizure disorders, other medical  conditions, reactions to vaccine ingredients such as aluminum, yeast and  benzonase, and anyone with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.\n\nYet Merck recommends Gardasil for all of these unstudied groups.  Merck's investigators also had unlimited discretion to exclude anyone  with \"any condition which in the opinion of the investigator might  interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.\"\n\nMerck also used \"sloppy protocols to suppress reports of vaccine  injury,\" Kennedy says. For example, only 10% of participants were given  daily report cards to fill out, and they were only to be filled out for  14 days post-vaccination. What's more, these report cards only collected  information about vaccination site effects, such as redness, itching  and bruising.\n\nAlso ignored were autoimmune problems, seizures and menstrual cycle  disruptions experienced by many of the girls. They also did not follow  up with those who reported serious side effects. Merck also granted  broad discretionary powers to its paid investigators to determine what  they thought constituted a reportable adverse event and to dismiss  potential vaccine reactions.\n\nThe researchers did not systematically collect adverse event data,  which is the whole point of doing a safety study in the first place, and  by not paying for the additional time required by investigators to fill  out time-consuming adverse event reports, Merck effectively  incentivized the dismissal of side effects.\n\nMany of the illnesses and injuries reported were also classified as  \"new medical conditions\" rather than adverse events, and no rigorous  investigation of these new conditions were performed.\n\nAccording to Kennedy, at the time of the vaccine's approval, 49.5% of  the Gardasil group and 52% of the controls (who received either the  aluminum adjuvant or the vaccine carrier solution) had \"new medical  history\" after the seventh month (Table 303, which included protocols 7,  13, 15 and 18), many of which were serious, chronic diseases.\n\n## Risk evaluation, take 2\n\n**Taking all of this into account, here's how the risk-benefit equation  looks now: The 1 in 43,478 chance of dying from cervical cancer may  have been removed (assuming the vaccine actually works), but by taking  the vaccine there is now a 1 in 43 chance of getting an autoimmune  disease, and a 1 in 2 chance of developing some form of serious medical  condition.**\n\n## More lies \n\nAccording to Kennedy, Merck also submitted fraudulent information to its Worldwide Adverse Experience System and the federal Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS) about the death of Christina Tarsell, one of its study participants.\n\n>*\"Merck claimed that Chris' gynecologist had told the company that her death was due to viral infection. Chris' gynecologist denies that she ever gave this information to Merck. To this day, Merck has refused to change its false entry on its own reporting system,\"* Kennedy says.  \n>  \n>*\"Furthermore, Merck lied to the girls participating in these studies, telling them that the placebo was saline and contained no other ingredients. And No. 2, that the study in which they were participating was not a safety study. They were told that there had already been safety studies and that the vaccine had been proven safe …*   \n>  \n>*They made it so that the girls were less likely to report injuries associated with the vaccine, because they believed the vaccine they were receiving had already been proven safe and that any injuries did experience, maybe a month, two months or three months after the vaccine must just be coincidental and had nothing to do with the  vaccine.\"*\n\n \n\nBut it gets worse, because there's a possibility Gardasil could cause cancer. The Gardasil insert13  admits it has never been evaluated for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity,  yet its ingredients \"include potential carcinogens and mutagens,  including aluminum and human DNA,\" Kennedy says.\n\nHe goes on to show the results of Merck's study protocol 13 (Table  17: Applicant's analysis of efficacy against vaccine-relevant HPV types  CIN 2/3 or worse among subjects who were PCR positive and seropositive  for relevant HPV types at day 1.)\n\nWhat this protocol showed is that women who had previous exposure to  the HPV strains used in the vaccine had a 44.6% increased risk of  developing CIN2 and CIN3 lesions after vaccination. Taking the dubious  efficacy of Gardasil into account, and the fact that it may only impact  one-third of cervical cancer cases, the risk-benefit lineup when taking  the vaccine now looks like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* There is still a chance of dying from cervical cancer unrelated to HPV \n* There is a 1 in 43 chance of getting an autoimmune disease\n* There is a 1 in 2 chance of developing a serious medical condition\n* If someone has ever been exposed to any of the nine HPV strains  included in the vaccine prior to getting Gardasil the risk of developing  CIN2 and CIN3 cervical lesions is raised by 44.6%, which may raise the  risk of cervical cancer\n\n## Widespread Gardasil use may trigger more virulent HPV infections \n\n\"To make things even worse, there are recent scientific studies that  suggest a phenomenon known as type replacement,\" Kennedy says. \"Type  replacement\" refers to when the elimination or suppression of one viral  strain allows a more virulent strain to colonize. \n\nThe study,14  \"Shift in Prevalence of HPV Types in Cervical Cytology Specimens in the  Era of HPV Vaccination,\" published in the journal Oncology Letters in  2016 — which analyzed the association between the prevalence of 32 types  of HPV virus in 615 women who had abnormal cervical cytopathology —  reported that:\n\n>*\"… HPV16, which is recognized as the main HR-HPV type responsible  for the development of cervical cancer, was observed in 32.98% of HPV  participants, followed by HPV42 (18.09%), HPV31 (17.66%), HPV51  (13.83%), HPV56 (10.00%), HPV53 (8.72%) and HPV66 (8.72%).*   \n>  \n>*The prevalence of HR-HPV types, which may be suppressed directly  (in the case of HPV16 and 18), or possibly via cross-protection (in the  case of HPV31) following vaccination, was considerably lower in  participants ≤22 years of age (HPV16, 28.57%; HPV18, 2.04%; HPV31,  6.12%), compared with participants 23–29 years of age (HPV16, 45.71%;  HPV18, 7.86%; HPV31, 22.86%), who were less likely to be vaccinated.*   \n>  \n>*Consequently, the present study hypothesizes that there may be a  continuous shift in the prevalence of HPV types as a result of  vaccination. Furthermore, the percentage of non-vaccine HR-HPV types was  higher than expected, considering that eight HPV types formerly  classified as 'low-risk' or 'probably high-risk' are in fact HR-HPV  types.*   \n>  \n>*Therefore, it may be important to monitor non-vaccine HPV types  in future studies, and an investigation concerning several HR-HPV types  as risk factors for the development of cervical cancer is required.\"*\n\n*Sources*\n\n   \n\n* 1 [The Pharma Letter February 10, 2006 ](https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/sanofi-pasteur-msd-s-gardasil-becomes-first-hpv-vaccine-approved-in-europe)\n* 2 [FDA.gov, Gardasil Vaccine ](https://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/safetyavailability/vaccinesafety/ucm179549.htm)\n* 3 [NVIC.

The    trigger could be the vaccine immunogen contents or the adjuvants, the    latter are used to increase the immune reaction. The adjuvant in HPV4    contains aluminum. Animal models have shown aluminum exposure to  inhibit expression of female reproductive hormones and to induce  histologic changes in the ovaries.  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26125978](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26125978)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mumps and ovarian cancer: modern interpretation of an historic association**\n\nMumps parotitis may lead to expression and immune recognition of a    tumor-associated form of MUC1 and create effective immune surveillance of ovarian cancer cells that express this form of MUC1.  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951028/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951028/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Premature ovarian failure 3 years after menarche in a 16-year-old girl following human papillomavirus vaccination.**\n\nThis patient presented with amenorrhoea after identifying a change  from her regular cycle to irregular and scant periods following   vaccinations against human papillomavirus. Premature ovarian failure  was then notified as a possible adverse event following this  vaccination.  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23035167](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23035167)",

However, many of your points are at best fear mongering, or at worst, straight misinformation of misunderstanding.\n\n\n1 Makes sense. I think the safety of one should not be assumed to be the same as taking everything at once.  \n\n\n2 Is the literal point of vaccines. Plenty of people travel the tropics and avoid yellow fever. Still a good idea to get the vaccine and not risk it.\n\n\n3 Is basic common sense. There are no guarantees in medicine since biology is not a monolith across race, gender, underlying genetic factors, etc. \n\n\n4 Death is a possible adverse effect of getting out of bed or crossing the street. The real question is the actual odds vs the benefit. Risk/reward ratio.\n\n\n5 If the evidence was as strong as you suggest, there would be far more successful lawsuits.\n\n\n6 You are conflating two issues. The first is problematic. The second is the doctor covering their own ass from a malpractice suit if your child dies from a preventable disease or kills another child with one. \n\n\n7 There's good reason for that since frivolous lawsuits can bury a company and people are always quick to look for someone to blame. Average life expectancy is as high now as it is in large part by reducing infant and childhood death from serious illness. I won't say that every vaccine is needed, or everything is perfectly safe, or that drug companies don't do shady stuff, but comparatively, vaccines have been a net positive for humanity and not protecting the companies that make them would mean no companies make them. Most cases get thrown out due to lack of evidence. \n\n\n8 Is exactly what should happen if there is negligence, and highly amusing when your last point complained about cases being tossed. \n\n\n9 Is irrelevant. People would eat fresh dog turds if it cured cancer. The ingredients only matter if they are demonstrated to be unnecessary or unsafe at the levels present. The big issue with aluminum and formaldehyde is not their presence, but the evacuation rate and absolute toxicity levels. I will admit I haven't seen any good proof that they are safe when given in multiple shots all at once, but they are safe in single shots.\n\n\n10 Double blind placebo tests would be unethical and never approved. There are good reasons for that. As I said earlier, we have all of human history to glean the effectiveness on vaccines by comparing death rates then and now. We also are getting long term information now that geriatrics are getting ready to die that had vaccines as children and can compare end of life  expectancy and quality to what existed previously and compare them to their leers who may have not gotten vaccinated.",

[It's now finally up on the website](https://www.superdrug.com/search?text=calm+skin), meaning I can post about it without having to type out all the ingredients by hand ;)\n\nThe range has a night mask, a facial oil, a cleanser, a 'rescue gel', a hydrating spray and a 2-in-1 serum/moisturiser. They're all £2.99, and they're all on buy 1 get 1 half price. I bought 4 products - the mask, the rescue gel, the spray and the serum/moisturiser. I skipped on the cleanser, as it has SLS, and I couldn't be bothered with the oil at the time, especially since I wanted even numbers because of the offer. \n\nI also emailed Superdrug's customer support to enquire about the % of niacinamide, as I was worried it would be insufficient. After some back-and-forth, the customer service rep contacted the new product team and got this response:\n\n\"I cannot give out specific information regarding our formulations but I can confirm that the percentage of niacinamide is >5% in all of the below.\"\n\nThe below being the four products I was asking about, I imagine. (The oil doesn't have niacinamide, btw - it's only soluble in water)\n\nAnyway, nice!\n\nAfter a month or so of testing on and off, here's my mini reviews of the ones that I got:\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin De-Stress Refreshing Facial Spritz 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-De-Stress-Refreshing-Facial-Spritz-100ml/p/741142)**\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Glycerin, Niacinamide, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Betaine, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Potassium Sorbate, Bisabolol, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Moisturising spray? It's kind of weird. There's a slight oiliness to it, and a definite stickiness which is probably the large amount of glycerin. \n\n**Scent:** Definitely floral, vaguely chamomile-y\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, this is... a bit weird? I've mostly been using it as a hydrating toner. The difficulty is that it plays nice with some serums/moisturisers, but with others it seems to lead to bobbling. But I am rather bobble-prone, so it might just be me. Anyway, if I can get it to go on okay it definitely makes me feel more hydrated, particularly when I'm in the dry-aired office I keep complaining about. One day I was feeling kinda bored so I tried out the '7 skin' method by spraying it on every few minutes until it wouldn't absorb any more. I think I got to about six? It definitely hydrated my skin! And probably calmed it down as well. Is it a bad idea to put so much niacinamide on your skin? I don't know, but it's unlikely I'm going to be doing this on a regular basis.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Well, it's a very cheap, very hydrating toner, so probably.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Hydrating 2in1 Serum & Moisturiser 50ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Face-Cream/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Hydrating-2in1-Serum-%26-Moisturiser-50ml/p/741125)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Isopropyl Myristate, Niacinamide, ‭Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Polyacrylamide, Butylene Glycol, ‭Phenoxyethanol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethiconol, Parfum, Betaine, Laureth-7, ‭Bisabolol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, ‭Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa ‭Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower ‭Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, ‭Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** So siliconey it's vaguely unnerving\n\n**Scent:** Heady floral, not unpleasant but kinda odd to find in this context. It's not at all chamomile-like? More of a tuberose, kinda luxe-y but definitely not one for people who don't like heavy scent\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, I think the reason it's described as a 2-in-1 is that there's SO MUCH SILICONE you really can't use much else with it or it will turn into a peeling gel, which is what it did to me several times. I think it might be a good thing for me in the summer when I need something very light, but right now I want to use a heavier, more wintery moisturiser and to layer stuff and this isn't meant for that at allll\n\n**Will I repurchase?** I don't know, let me try it out in the summer and see if I can find a sunscreen that'll play nice with it.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Rescue Gel 15ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Rescue-Gel-15ml/p/741146)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Salicylic Acid, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Bisabolol, Potassium Sorbate, Allantoin, Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile)Flower Extract, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gel\n\n**Scent:** Alcohol\n\n**Overall Experience:** Okay, so in the cold light of day I should have looked at that ingredient list and run screaming. Why are they trying to combine salicylic acid (works best at pH <3.5) and niacinamide (becomes irritating at pH<4.5)? Why is the fourth ingredient citric acid? Did putting on an alcohol gel ever help a single spot?\nI did actually try this a couple of times and it did nothing much, which honestly is better than I should have expected, by rights it should have made my face fall off.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Nope\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Overnight Face Mask 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Overnight-Face-Mask-100ml/p/741143)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, ‭Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, Prunus ‭Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, ‭Phenoxyethanol, Polyacrylamide, Parfum, Sodium ‭Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, ‭Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Isohexadecane, C13-14 ‭Isoparaffin, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 80, Bisabolol, ‭Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate ‭(Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sorbitan ‭Oleate, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, ‭Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium ‭Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gloop. Sinks in pretty quickly.\n\n**Scent:** Light floral\n\n**Overall Experience:** Help, I really like this. It goes on nicely even over other stuff (eg Scinic Honey AIO), is nice and occlusive, smells okay and - the kicker - actually leaves my skin looking better in the morning, with red marks noticeably diminished. My only complaint is that it's tiny, considering you'll want to use a hefty glop of the stuff.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Almost certainly",

Niacinamide isn't necessarily irritating in higher pH products, otherwise the vast majority of skincare products with niacinamide would be irritating, since most products aren't formulated at <pH 4.5. Alcohol denat. is a penetration enhancer and many people don't have issues with alcohol in skincare, particularly if their skin is in good condition to begin with and/or if they don't have alcohol in every single product. Citric acid is a pH adjuster.

The allergic responses caused by vaccines can stem from activation of mast cells via Fcε receptor-1 type I reaction, mediated by the interaction between immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against a particular vaccine, and occur within minutes or up to four hours. The type IV allergic reactions initiate 48 h after vaccination and demonstrate their peak between 72 and 96 h. Non-IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation via activation of the complement system and via activation of the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 can also induce allergic reactions. Reactions are more often caused by inert substances, called excipients, which are added to vaccines to improve stability and absorption, increase solubility, influence palatability, or create a distinctive appearance, and not by the active vaccine itself. Polyethylene glycol, also known as macrogol, in the currently available Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, and polysorbate 80, also known as Tween 80, in AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, are excipients mostly incriminated for allergic reactions.\"\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pio-Conti/publication/339066959_Mast_cells_contribute_to_coronavirus-induced_inflammation_New_anti-inflammatory_strategy/links/5ea16111a6fdcc88fc364a63/Mast-cells-contribute-to-coronavirus-induced-inflammation-New-anti-inflammatory-strategy.pdf\n\nNow covid itself:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220307323 (this one's short and important, read it).\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306987720310410\n\n\"The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by MC viral activation leads to increase pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Sodium Chromo-Glycate (SCG) described as a MC stabilizer, prevents the release of inflammatory chemical compounds, improve mouse survival and respiratory pathological changes in lung viral infection and suppresses inflammation. Furthermore, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) a nuclear factor agonist, an endogenous fatty acid amide, which exerts a variety of biological effects, related to chronic inflammation and pain, is involved also in MCs homeostasis with an inhibitory and protective effect on the respiratory tract during viral infections. \"\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.650331/full?fbclid=IwAR08c6n0aiL1h9Ei1s-TD_iv_igXD55qM6oIXl3GVMnEpZML6ZGd93K3tNo\n\n\"This study has several limitations. The cohort of individuals used for serum collection and RNA-seq analyses was small and lacked robust clinical information, including disease severity, comorbidities, and patient outcomes. Follow up studies are needed on a well-characterized patient population. In addition, the blood-derived MCs and eosinophils used in these studies may not completely reflect the function and phenotype of mature diseased human tissue lung MCs and eosinophils. Lastly, the use of viral RNA mimetics or RSV to study MC and eosinophil responses to SARS-CoV-2 may not fully recapitulate the complexity of COVID-19.\"\"\n\n\"\"**The data presented here suggest that systemic MC and eosinophil activation play a role in the inflammatory mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis of COVID-19.** Importantly, these data also demonstrate that targeting Siglec-8 with an antibody reduces TLR-mediated inflammation and suggest that Siglec-8 mAbs, such as liretelimab, could be used as a means of limiting immune cell infiltration and excessive inflammation in severe viral infection.\"\n\n\n\n**Just want to add a note that A LOT of the peer reviewed studies keep trying to talk about \"patients with mast cell disorders including mastocytosis does not impact mast cell activation symptoms after vaccination\", a lot of those studies ignore a lot of what I previously posted and just talk about literally \"jab and observe\" type studies, a little sketchy.**\n\n\nOh but look, ANOTHER STUDY:\n\nhttps://covid19-evidence.paho.org/handle/20.500.12663/1569\n\n\"Mast cells are present in mucosal and connective tissues throughout the body. They participate in the innate and adaptive immune process and have an important role in inflammation and allergy. Mast cells located in the submucosa of the respiratory tract are known to be activated by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Once activated, degranulation occurs releasing histamine and proteases. Late mast-cell activation leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α. Vitamin D is required to maintain the stability of mast cells, and Vitamin D deficiency results in mast cell activation.\"\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7644430/\n\n\"The pulmonary pathological findings associated with COVID-19 seems to result from the release of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin (IL)-6, that can damage the lungs.3 A key source of such cytokines and chemokines is the mast cells, which are ubiquitous in the body, especially the lungs, and are critical for allergic and pulmonary diseases.3 In fact, activated mast cells were recently detected in the lungs of deceased patients with COVID-19 and were linked to pulmonary edema, inflammation, and thromboses.4\"\n\n**\"Mast cells are typically activated by allergic triggers, but they can also be triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns via activation of Toll-like receptors. In addition, mast cells express the renin-angiotensin system, the ectoprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 required for SARS-CoV-2 binding, and serine proteases, including TMPRSS2, required for priming of the corona spike protein.\"** \n\nHMMM\n\n\n\"Such triggers could lead to secretion of multiple proinflammatory mediators selectively, without release of histamine or tryptase, as we had previously reported in the Journal of Immunology for release of IL-6 in response to IL-1β from cultured human mast cells (Fig 1 ).3 Moreover, we recently reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America that human mast cells can be synergistically stimulated by the peptide substance P and IL-33 to release impressive amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor, IL-1β or tumor necrosis factor again without secretion of histamine or tryptase.3\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recent coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is associated with high morbidity and mortality mostly in adults, owing to systemic symptoms, especially pulmonary sequalae.\n\nInterestingly, children seem to have milder symptoms than adults associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, the incidence of allergy or asthma in children infected with COVID-19 seems to be lower than that of the general population giving the impression that these atopic diseases may be protective.1 Such a conclusion is premature, because the increased lung eosinophils found in these diseases may had some protective effect especially because reduced numbers of eosinophils were reported in COVID-19.1 Moreover, medications used for the treatment of these atopic diseases (eg, antihistamines, corticosteroids) may had offered some protection rather than the atopic diseases themselves. Nevertheless, there have been recent reports of childhood multisystem inflammatory syndrome with symptoms resembling toxic shock or Kawasaki syndrome,2 suggesting children may still experience symptoms related to inflammation.\n\nThe pulmonary pathological findings associated with COVID-19 seems to result from the release of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin (IL)-6, that can damage the lungs.3 A key source of such cytokines and chemokines is the mast cells, which are ubiquitous in the body, especially the lungs, and are critical for allergic and pulmonary diseases.3 In fact, activated mast cells were recently detected in the lungs of deceased patients with COVID-19 and were linked to pulmonary edema, inflammation, and thromboses.4\n\nMast cells are typically activated by allergic triggers, but they can also be triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns via activation of Toll-like receptors.

SARS-CoV-2 stimulates mast cells to release pathogenic mediators, inhibited by luteolin. Luteolin inhibits histamine release. Human mast cells were stimulated with substance P (10 μM, 30 minutes) with or without luteolin (50 or 100 μM) or cromolyn (100 μM) on 30-minute preincubation (the asterisk and double asterisk indicate P < .05 and P < .01, respectively; n = 3). COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; IL, interleukin; lut, luteolin; MMP-9, matrix metalloproteinase 9; PAF, platelet-activating factor; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SP, substance P; TGF-β, transforming growth factor beta; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TXB2, thromboxane B2; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.\n\nIn addition to the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, activated mast cells could release matrix metalloproteinases (eg, matrix metalloproteinase 9) and transforming growth factor beta, which could contribute to lung fibrosis, including thromboxanes (thromboxane B2) and platelet-activating factor, leading to the recently reported microthromboses in the lungs of deceased patients with COVID-19.4 Moreover, mast cells communicate with endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages (Fig 1), further stimulating release of proinflammatory, fibrotic, thrombogenic, and vasoactive mediators.\"\n\n\"\"Liposomal luteolin could be supplemented with the H1 receptor antagonist rupatadine (not available in the United States except if compounded), which has anti–platelet-activating factor and mast cell–inhibitory actions, and the H2 receptor antagonist, famotidine, which has been reported to be beneficial in COVID-19. In addition, supplementation with vitamin D3 could be useful, because it can reduce allergic inflammation and has been reported to be of benefit in COVID-19.\"\"\n\n\"\"In conclusion, mast cells could contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and any postinfectious inflammatory syndromes through the release of proinflammatory, fibrotic, or thrombogenic mediators. Hence, it is reasonable to consider their inhibition at least for prophylaxis if not symptomatic treatment of patients diagnosed as having COVID-19 with mild symptoms. However, there is no published evidence on whether patients with MCAS or systemic mastocytosis may be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection or experience symptoms after infection. Hence, more basic and clinical research should be conducted to evaluate the associations suggested.\"\"\n\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.31.21255594v1.full-text\n\n\"\"We also noted an unusually high density of MCs in damaged and hemorrhagic regions NHP lungs at 3 weeks post SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increased transcriptional upregulation of the chemokine CXCR2 in the blood of severe COVID human patients is also suggestive of MC precursor migration into lung, as was seen in the context of other diseases(42).\n\nSimilarly, other studies have identified transcriptional signatures of granulocyte activation as well as increases in cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils and T cells in the blood or lung tissue itself in severe COVID-19(1, 6-8). As tissue-resident cells, MCs are considered sentinels and they can promote the trafficking of many of these cell types into tissues during both allergic and infection-induced inflammation(9, 12, 43).\"\"\n\n\" These effects on the vasculature and cardiovascular system are also consistent with the effects of MCs in other sterile inflammatory conditions. MCs line the blood vessels within tissues(14), which not only places them in a location where they can directly exert their effects on the vasculature, but also where their mediators can gain access to the blood. We observe that lung SARS-CoV-2 inoculation in mice and humans both results in increased levels of MC-specific chymase, on a systemic level. In the renin-angiotensin system, MC-chymase is a potent converter of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which regulates microvascular blood flow and systemic blood pressure(45-47). However, production of chymase by MCs is also associated with vascular diseases. For example, in atherosclerotic aorta, angiotensin II activity was largely ACE-independent and dependent on chymase(48) and increased expression of chymase in the lung was associated with early pulmonary vascular disease(49). Notably, higher levels of angiotensin II in the plasma of COVID-19 patients are correlated with lung injury suggesting its involvement in the tissue damage(50). Moreover, angiotensin II could increase the expression of endothelial-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (TIE2) ligand, Ang2(51). An imbalance of Ang2/1 is known to be associated with vascular leakage and coagulation in other diseases(52). We observed increased plasma levels of Ang2 and increased ratio of Ang2/Ang1 in severe COVID-19 patients compared to milder COVID-19 patients or healthy controls. Interestingly, we also observed transcriptional responses of the angiotensin pathway were substantially perturbed in the peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients. As exemplified by the endothelial activation in severe COVID-19, this highlights a potential causal role of MC activation in critical features of COVID-19 disease, including abnormalities of pulmonary blood flow leading to shunting and hypoxemia or loss of endothelial integrity leading to tissue edema. Notwithstanding its role as an angiotensin converting enzyme, a more direct effect of chymase in cleaving endothelial tight junctions or potential contributions of other MC products, such as tryptase and serotonin(12), in COVID-19 related vascular pathologies cannot be ruled out. As such, we found intriguing parallels to DENV as another virus that induces MC activation. Although DENV does not specifically infect the lung, DENV infection is also characterized by increases in microvascular permeability and bleeding, which are augmented through the actions of MCs. It is noteworthy that in dengue, MCs play an important role in limiting virus burden in early disease, but drive clinical deterioration in disseminated disease(12). As a result, drugs targeting MCs and their products are promising as a therapeutic strategy to prevent severe clinical courses in DENV infection and may bear similar promise in preventing severe COVID-19, which warrants further evaluation.\"\n\n\nCorrect me if I'm mistaken, but are they comparing Dengue virus Mast cell activation/internal bleeding to the way covid functions? \n\n@-@\n\nGoing to look into this further, here is a **short TL;DR:**\n\n\nMC activation in humans was confirmed, through detection of the MC-specific protease, chymase, levels of which were significantly correlated with disease severity.\n\nI don't even fully understand all of this because its immunology, but it basically seems everyone needs an immunologist, wouldn't be too surprised if its almost impossible to book an appointment for one, even a year out, guarantee it. \n\n\n\n@-@ No idea what the fuck is going on still, as my previous posts showed prion domains in the covid spike and the vaccine...

In a microwave safe bowl melt the butter. \n2. In a mixing bowl add the dry ingredients \n3. Stir them together real good \n4. Mix in the melted butter, make sure to break up any large pieces \n5. Spray the bottom of the pie pan with oil\n6. Gently pour in the mixture into the pie pan\n7. Gently press in the crust batter, Make sure that the crust is even.\n\nOptional: I baked mine at 350°F for 5 minutes in a preheated oven to give it more of a graham cracker like texture. \n\n**Filling:**\n\n* 2 packs room temperature cream cheese \n* 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream \n* 1 cup pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie mix) \n* 1 tsp vanilla extract \n*  2/3 cups confectionery sweetener (I made brown sugar allulose) see notes\n* 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice\n* Xanthan gum (see notes)\n\n1. In a mixing bowl, add 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream plus the sweetener and mix it until blended\n2. Break your cream cheese into chunks so it will be easier to mix and add it\n3. Mix on low until smooth \n4. Add remaining ingredients including optional thickener\n5. Mix on low until smooth\n6. Spoon in batter into the prepared pie pan\n7. Even the batter and let refrigerate at least 6 hours (I do mine overnight) \n\n**Optional topping:**\n\nAfter your cheesecake has set and it is ready to serve, I top mine with a little bit of homemade keto whipped topping and sprinkle a little bit of cinnamon on it. \n\n**Notes**\n\n**Xanthan gum**\n\nThe original recipe uses cream cheese and heavy whipping cream that has ingredients like polysorbate 80, mono and diglycerides, carrageenan and other binding agents. \n\nI use Philadelphia brand cream cheese or organic valley cream cheese.\n\nI use BJ's Wholesale Club or organic valley heavy whipping cream. \n\nThose have minimal binders and the cheesecake will separate and start to liquefy. \n\nAdd 1/4 tsp at a time of xanthan gum or thickener of choice until you get a texture that you like.\n\n**Sweetener**\n\nIf you have a blender with a grinding blade or a coffee grinder, it is much cheaper to make your own confectionery sweetener. \n\nI made this with homemade keto brown sugar I made 2/3 cup powdered allulose and added 1/4 teaspoon molasses into the batter to give it more of a traditional pumpkin pie taste. \n\n**Variations**\n\nThis is a very versatile recipe, here's some that I have made: \n\n* Omit the cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and pumpkin and add 1 cup fruit puree for a berry cheesecake add a thickener if the berry puree is too thin, add additional sweetener if your fruit is too tart.\n\n* Omit the cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and pumpkin and add unsweetened cocoa powder. \n\nTake a little bit of your heavy whipping cream, add the cocoa powder and a little thickener and put that in a smoothie blender, blend it until the cocoa powder is no longer grainy. Add any additional sweetener that you might need. (That will be a smaller cheesecake).\n\n* Plain cheesecake, omit pumpkin pie spice and pumpkin puree. Bake the pie crust for 5 or so minutes for a more graham cracker texture. (This will make a smaller cheesecake).\n\nI've made the plain cheesecake recipe into a lemon cheesecake and a key lime cheesecake by adding lemon juice and lemon zest and lime juice and lime zest.",

    "body": "I’ve made a few mistakes in my life. Hell, maybe more than a few. Somewhere between a handful and a fuck-ton is probably a good estimation. I think the issue is I put my trust in the wrong places, but I’m just trying to navigate the world as best I can - same as everyone else. I’ve been told I’m gullible, but I like the word “*suggestible”*. Let me put it this way: my beliefs and convictions can be like loose flower petals on a blustery day - they drift in whatever way the wind pushes them. One moment I’m floating east, the wind changes direction, and now I’m floating west. One day, I’ll believe in climate change, then I listen to a certain popular podcast, and now I think it’s a hoax. I know that it’s pathetic. If I can just make it through this year, I swear I’ll change, but my savings are depleted, and the pills are running out. I can hear them all skittering and slamming all around me, just out of sight, biding their time until the effects of the medication to wear off.\n\nThis all began a few weeks back. My life was unremarkable then, but at least it was normal. I had a cushy job at a local tech company, the same one I’ve had for the last five years. Reasonable hours, good benefits plan, 6 weeks of paid time off - I lived comfortably but noticeably alone. No wife, no girlfriend. I wasn’t born with a lot of charm. I was never very proficient at initiating pleasantries, and even if I did manage to start a conversation with a lady, I couldn’t find the words to maintain it. Of course, that would all be one thing if I was some hulking adonis, smooth and chiseled and all that - maybe then I could have compensated for my lack of a silver tongue. But I could never grow any muscle despite my efforts. I bought and tried a lot of different supplements that were supposed to help stimulate growth. Powders with names like “Muscle Matrix” and “Crazy Muscle”. They never did a damn thing, even put me in the hospital one time for kidney damage.\n\nRetrospectively, I should have also been working out while on those supplements. I wanted to wait until the supplements started having an effect before I began really working out.\n\nTerrible cystic acne was the icing on top. Red, painful craters had littered my face since I turned 16. Tried everything for that too - bee venom, reiki, power juicing. None of the online recommendations produced the desired effect. And it all gave me the impression that I was utterly unworthy compared to other guys my age. I could feel myself giving up on a life that was more fulfilling than the one I already had, and on companionship. Then, I saw the ad pop on my Facebook page. It promised to fix me, and I fell for it. Hook, line, and sinker. \n\nIt read something like this:\n\n*Do you have trouble attracting women? Unable to catch a vixen’s eye from all the way at the other end of the bar? Does your mere presence in a room inspire overwhelming, knee-buckling repulsion from any potential mates? Before the modern age, there were no solutions. Lonely devils would go to their doctors, looking for salvation, only instead to be told there was nothing else to be done - Western Medicine cursing them to die alone. But we don’t live in the past, do we, dear friends? With major advancements in natural attraction technology, L. Bartleby, Ph.D., is proud to announce: Zygentra Ultimate, the miracle medication for the misbegotten common man. With Zygentra Ultimate, even the lowliest bachelor has hope for a happy ending. One pill is all it takes to change everything about you.* \n\nIn big, confident words, the bottom said:\n\n*One payment, one pill - one solution to the problem of you.*\n\nEven though the advertisement omitted what it would improve about me, I was intrigued. The ad had all the buzz words - “miracle”, “technology”, “happy ending”. Their distrust of Western Medicine hit close to home, too. As far as I was concerned, doctors were pill pushers controlled by pharmaceutical companies that pulled their marionette strings from the shadows. I mean, what was in the pills they recommended, anyway? And for that matter, why can’t I pronounce half the compounds that make up vaccines? Thiomersal, Polysorbate 80 - I mean formaldehyde, for Christ’s sake. It all felt so artificial and unsafe. But this advertisement seemed to promote something more “of the earth” and “organic”, the so-called “natural attraction technology”. Tired of being lonely and unworthy, I emailed the company. \n\nLike I said, hook, line, and sinker. Biggest mistake of my life.\n\nIn my message to the company, I tried to perform my due diligence in vetting the supplement. What was in it? How much was the supplement? Would it interact with the Chinese muscle-enhancing herbs I ordered the week before? \n\nThis was their response, copy-pasted from my Gmail:\n\n*Greetings Zach,*\n\n*Thank you for your interest in Zygentra Ultimate. One pill, one payment, one solution to the problem of you.* \n\n*To clarify, Zygentra is a medication, not a supplement - though no matter what you call it, it is a miracle. Through a proprietary mechanism of action that utilizes the wonders of CRISPR technology, Zygentra enables the human body to naturally self-regulate the hormonal disequilibriums that are to blame for a variety of male inequities: it can resolve poor muscle growth, weak libidos, erectile dysfunction, and a bevy of disfiguring skin conditions including but not limited to: seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, lichen planus simplex, and cystic acne.* \n\n*Unfortunately, the future is not always affordable, and it is rarely covered by insurance. Thankfully, this onetime cost can last upwards of a year, if not much longer. Zygentra teaches your body to produce life-changing pheromones that are genetically transplanted from the naturally occurring Lepisma saccharium species. In short, one pill is all you need.* \n\n*Zygentra Ultimate can solve the problem of you with a onetime payment of 30,000 US dollars. We do not accept payment plans. Also, for obvious reasons, we recommend all of our clients relocate prior to taking their dose; Antarctica is preferable, but Northern Canada is a reasonable alternative.* \n\n*Please let us know if you are planning to pursue a happy ending. If so, we can help set up a wire transfer.* \n\n*Amy,*\n\n*Senior Sales Associate and Miracleworker at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals* \n\nI had to pick my jaw off the floor after I finished quickly scanning the email, skipping the scientific mumbo-jumbo to find the price point. They seriously wanted me to pay 30,000 dollars, one lump sum, for this supplement. Not that I couldn’t afford the payment - I could, but barely, using a nest egg my mom left for me after she passed. It was just an obscene amount of money. But it was alluring - one pill that would fix my body, or I guess teach it to fix itself, naturally? Was that even possible? When I thought about it more, the exorbitant fee made it feel more legitimate, like I was paying for cutting-edge technology that actually could work. Wouldn’t the Better Business Bureau prevent a company from selling a product for much more than it was worth? Wasn’t that illegal? \n\nTo speed things up, I’ll skip the part where I contemplated my options, did a lot of online research, and signed a waiver that Amy mailed to me. Two weeks later, the singular pill arrived in an icebox as an overnight shipment from the Delfoy Pharmaceuticals headquarters. Amy told me they needed to keep it cold. \n\nIt wasn’t like any pill I had taken before. The supplement more resembled an extra-large piece of caviar - gelatinous and orb-shaped. The box had no instructions, so I shrugged my shoulders and ingested it, using a swig of the nearest open Mountain Dew to wash it down.\n\nI was ready not to be alone anymore. \n\nNo big change the first few days. Maybe I really was a sap, I thought. But one morning, while looking in the mirror, I noticed it - my skin was clearing up like it never had before. More than that, I felt virile and confident, out of the blue. My muscles even looked more toned. It was a state of being entirely new to me, and at first, it was incredible. For the first time, I felt deserving of love and happiness. Riding that sensation for all it was worth, I asked Stacy, an attractive coworker, on a dinner date. I had fantasized about asking her out for what seemed like my entire life. She said yes. The ecstasy I experienced after that moment was unparalleled. It was like some heavy, invisible weights had been taken off my shoulders. We planned a dinner date at a local Italian place later that week. With the supplement coursing through my veins, I felt unstoppable and was pleasantly surprised by the lack of side effects. I had experienced some new floaters in my peripheral vision and mild armpit pain, but that was it.\n\nAt first, the date was everything I could have hoped for. Stacy always had an aura of kindness about her - she was angelic, honestly. It’s what drew me towards her. Even though I secured the date, I was still nervous about my ability to keep up a conversation through the meal. To my surprise, it wasn’t difficult. Because I was different, improved by the supplement, I guess I just wasn’t as fearful of rejection anymore. I was stunned to discover Stacy had been secretly planning to ask me out too.\n\n*“Over the last week? Since I started my new skin regimen, I mean.”* I said, choking on the last few words because I was never very good at lying. I didn’t want to scare Stacy off by volunteering the information that I had recently purged my bank accounts to pay for Zygentra. \n\nShe giggled, a cute and tiny laugh that made my heart swell with affection.\n\n*“No, nothing to do with whatever new moisturizer you invested in. And a lot longer than just this week. For at least a year, I think. I always found you handsome, and you were always polite to me and everyone else in the office - a good sign of character. You were just quiet and reserved. I couldn’t tell if you’d say yes if I asked, so I never did. A bit childish and cowardly, I know, but sometimes I just feel small and out of place in the world, if that makes any sense,”* remarked Stacy, eyes diverting from mine while she made this confession.  \n\nHer words felt familiar - or maybe not her words; it was the way she put the words together. The underlying self-deprecation, I mean. She had some venomous monologue playing on a loop in her head, just like I did. Broke my heart at first, and I wasn’t sure how to respond. But I noticed at that moment that I felt a little less lonely for the first time in my adult life. I smiled, met her eyes, and came up with the most ornate, reverent statement I could to comfort her and let her know I understood.\n\n*“You’re an absolute vision, Stacy. Like, you’re radiant. I’m sorry it’s hard for you to see it sometimes, but I really get that pain.”*\n\nHer expression changed, now warm and relaxed, and I could tell I actually managed to console her. I got lost in that moment then, in the beautiful comfort of it. Even as I type it up, I find myself getting lost in the memory of it. But something hoicked me out of the moment then, and it’s the same thing that’s pulling me out of its memory now: terrible, skittering things on the outskirts of my vision. \n\nIn the restaurant, I was experiencing worsening floaters in my periphery, but I was too transfixed on Stacy to notice something was off - that maybe they weren’t just floaters. As our dessert arrived, I felt something vibrating in the sole of my dress shoe. It really gave me a start, and I reflexively stomped my right foot onto the floor, surprising Stacy in turn. I took off my shoe to examine its contents, only to find the crushed body of a silverfish. Its greyish carapace was split into three asymmetric pieces from the force of my stomp. Each piece was still wriggling a little bit, and I felt nausea rise in my stomach. \n\nIt was bigger than any silverfish I’d ever seen before, too. In my experience, they never grew larger than an inch. This silverfish was *easily* 5 inches long, if not more. I could count at least 20 other, equally large silverfish crawling around in a wobbly circle, with me as the center. Before I killed the insect in my shoe, the other dinner goers had noticed the bugs and were flagging down restaurant staff to complain. At first, I was with them - what kind of restaurant serves food with this type of infestation? It took the tickling, wriggling feeling of something crawling up my left pant leg to cause me to re-evaluate the situation. \n\nWildly, I made a circle with my thumb and index finger and tightened it around my knee, pushing down the length of my calf in an attempt to expel what I knew were more silverfish before they found their way higher into my pants. When my palm first connected with my knee, I felt a sickening crunch under the tip of my index finger. The maneuver pushed out three silverfish - one headless from being caught in the crossfire of my hand meeting my knee. When I looked up, the restaurant was in a state of pandemonium. At that point, there were definitely over 20, maybe 100 or 200, silverfish radiating in a circle around me. It finally registered - whatever was happening, I was the cause, and I hadn’t been experiencing floaters before - I was seeing silverfish skittering around in my peripheral vision. \n\nI shot up from my chair, frightening Stacy again, accompanied by the sensation of another crunch in the shoe I hadn’t yet taken off. I said something to my date, couldn’t tell you what, and I excused myself from the table while moving towards the door. Outside in the parking lot, I began sprinting to my car with only one shoe on; but then I remembered I had driven Stacy here. I briefly turned around to get her, but I could see gleaming silver little bullets racing to catch up to me on the asphalt, lit up by the sparkle of parking lot lights. I U-turned and sprinted even faster to my car, got in, and just started driving. After 15 minutes, I pulled over and urgently emailed Delfoy Pharmaceuticals from my phone. I wanted to know how to reverse the effects of Zygentra Ultimate.\n\nNot long after I parked, I saw silverfish on the front windshield, leaking into the car through whatever cracks they could find. I floored it, but it was in a park, so I went nowhere. For the third time that night, I again felt the snap of their brittle bodies against my foot, having just crushed another two silverfish. A moment later, I felt one making its way up my left earlobe. I whipped my head to the right so hard that my neck would later be painfully sore, but the force launched a silverfish off my ear to somewhere in the back of my sedan. Putting the car in drive, I exploded down the country road I had parked on. I kept driving, killing silverfish as I went, till I heard an inbox notification come from my iphone, which was about two hours after I had sent the email:\n\n*Hello Zach,*\n\n*I am sorry to hear you are disappointed with our product. Unfortunately, there is no reversal agent for Zygentra Ultimate. I thought I made this very clear in our introductory email, and you did sign a release saying you understood the risk-benefit profile of the medication.* \n\n*To re-explain, Zygentra Ultimate utilizes CRISPR technology to give the human body the ability to produce pheromones from Lepisma saccharium, the most common species of silverfish in America. Laboratory studies have shown that these pheromones can help with male sexual dysfunction and certain skin conditions due to an anti-inflammatory effect. As you must know, pheromones are designed to attract members of the opposite sex of the species producing them. It is basically a big sign around an animal’s neck saying: “I am ready to mate”. Therefore, we recommend relocation to Northern Canada or Antarctica in conjunction with Zygentra Ultimate - these are some of the few areas in the world that Lepisma saccharium does not naturally inhabit.* \n\n*The medication is not reversible, however, because CRISPR is gene-editing technology - the reason your body “learns” to create the foreign hormones is because Zygentra Ultimate inserts the pheromone-producing silverfish DNA into your genetic code. How else would one pill cause an effect lasting a year or more? Additionally, the armpit pain you are experiencing is most likely the rapid growth of modified glandular tissue responsible for producing the silverfish pheromones.* \n\n*I still recommend considering physical relocation. I hear the Yukon is wonderful this time of year! The alternate solution would be to invest in Zygentra Plus, which can help mitigate some of the silverfish-attracting side effects of Zygentra Ultimate. We recognize that this is an emergency situation, and Defloy Pharmaceuticals is always willing to help where we can! We have shipped a 48-hour trial supply of Zygentra Plus to your home, for free.* \n\n*Please consider your options and get back to us. If you would like to purchase additional Zygentra Plus, a week’s supply costs $750, with a 5 percent discount if you purchase the medication in bulk.*\n\n*Amy,*\n\n*Senior Sales Associate and Miracleworker at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals* \n\nWhen I received this email, I had a grand total of 3,500 dollars to my name. Desperation hit me like an avalanche. A little under 4 grand was nowhere near the funds I would need to move from Miami to Northern Canada. Moving would also force me to quit my job, and I didn’t want to leave Stacy behind. Retrospectively, I should have just used that money to move myself and my shitty car as far north as it would take me. \n\nWhen Zygentra Plus arrived five days later, I was beyond sleep-deprived. I had called out of work that week, as I certainly couldn’t come in and work on code as the fucking pied piper of silverfish. I spent that time driving around, stopping only when I felt myself drifting into sleep at the wheel. Pulled over to wherever I could and close my eyes, but before long, the sensation of silverfish crawling into my mouth or between my armpits would wake me up with a start, like I had jabbed myself with an adrenaline shot - at which point I would resume driving. No amount of insect repellant spray or mouse traps seemed to prevent the legion from getting to me. \n\nI hastily unpackaged the box containing the pro bono Zygentra Plus. The instructions on the supplement were: *take four pills by mouth every two hours*. Every *two fucking hours*. It did work at keeping the bugs away, but only if I religiously took the medication as instructed, which only served to minimally improve my sleep deprivation. I needed to return to work, but that ended up being a mistake, too. I had ditched Stacy on our first date without explanation and then proceeded not to talk to her for a week while I was driving around in circles, waiting for the Zygentra Plus to arrive. When she saw me again at work, I had dark circles around my bloodshot eyes the size of trash bags, and I nervously scanned my surroundings for silverfish. She said hello to me, and I don’t think I said hello back. Instead, I opted to launch into a minute-by-minute retelling of my last week. What I told her was an incoherent mess. Stacy nodded along politely to my tale, but I could see fear and concern rising in her eyes. Eventually, I gave her mercy, excused myself in the middle of a sentence, and pitifully returned to my desk. I dragged my body through about half of a workday before the side effects of Zygentra Plus started.\n\nOut of nowhere, I felt my mouth fill uncomfortably with saliva. When I tried to sip my morning coffee, dribble would involuntarily spill out of my mouth, down my chin and onto my shirt collar. Before long, I had a half-crescent of soaked fabric around my neck despite my efforts to keep my mouth closed. Next, my eyes began watering uncontrollably, making it look like I was quietly sobbing all morning. The final straw was when I took my hand off my coffee cup, only to have a thin layer of palm skin remain stuck to the grip, peeling from my hand and causing immense and immediate pain. I screamed. And then, of course, there was a lot of bleeding. In a panic, I hastily left my desk without saying a word, no doubt leaving behind plenty of tears, saliva, skin and blood. My boss caught up and confronted me about my behavior before I could leave the building. I tried to say something, but saliva just erupted from my mouth instead. I probably looked rabid.\n\nI didn’t come back to work the next day, or the following day. A few days after that, a message on my cellphone answering machine told me I was fired.\n\nAmy, resident miracle worker at Defloy Pharmaceuticals, wasn’t much help with the situation. I let her know that, although Zygentra Plus was helping keep the insects away, the side effects from it weren’t much more bearable. The excess saliva and tears were one thing, but pieces of my skin were sloughing off with the slightest manipulation, like I was some human danish. And I still wasn’t sleeping - I needed to set multiple alarms to get myself up every two hours to take the new medication; otherwise, the silverfish would be back. She explained to me that this was expected, as Zygentra Plus acted as a low-dose insecticide I was digesting and releasing into the surrounding air from my pores or what was left of them. At the brink of insanity, I demanded to speak with “Mr. Bartleby”, the supposed genius creator and mind behind the Zygentra line of products mentioned in the original advertisement. I thought maybe he would have an elegant solution to all of this. In response, Amy said, and I quote:\n\n*“Well, that will be impossible. Mr. Bartleby is more of an idea than a person. Here at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals, we all aspire to achieve the goals that Dr. Bartleby represents. Also, it seems to help with sales.”*\n\nBut don’t worry, she said, there was still something to be done - Amy theorized that drastically increasing my zinc levels might mitigate some symptoms from Zygentra Plus. I spent my last 500 dollars on that supplement, unsure of what I would do next, even if it helped. But I needed relief. Moreover, I needed to keep taking the pills because I was terrified of what would happen to me when I ran out, and the silverfish came back. My car was out of gas, my skin was breaking down, I was jobless and nearly out of money. If they returned, I would have limited defenses and nowhere to hide. I’m not particularly eager to think about what would happen to me.\n\nThe zinc supplement was a purple-reddish liquid that I was instructed to drink once a day. I voraciously gulped it down, immediately experiencing excruciating pain from my lips to deep in my chest. I would come to learn that the compound I drank, Zinc Hydrosulfide, is a very strong acid. I stared at the words “strong acid” in the email, dumbfounded, with blood and saliva dripping from my scalded mouth onto the screen. Amy then offered a subdermal injection to help me tolerate the Zinc Hydrosulfide, and I just started laughing. Must have been laughing for a while, because when my laughing slowed down, I saw silver floaters in my periphery again, meaning I was due for my next dose of Zygentra Plus.\n\nI could barely swallow the pills after what the liquid had done to my mouth and esophagus, almost passing out from the pain. Even if I had the money to pay for the 2,000-dollar subdermal injection, which I do not, I have no idea where I would even inject it into. Didn’t have much of a “dermis” left after the effects of Zygentra Plus, which had liberated me from a good portion of my skin.\n\nEffectively, I am now stuck. The acidic liquid that was supposed to help with the side effects from the pills has now prevented me from taking *any* pills, or at least has made it a great deal harder and more painful. The medication that would help me tolerate the acidic liquid was no good either - the pills had dissolved the skin that it was supposed to be injected under. Perhaps most critically of all, I am now broke.\n\nThought about going to the hospital - some combination of fear and shame prevented me from doing that. Calling an ambulance may be my next move, but I’m not sure they can do anything for me now. The silverfish will find me no matter where I am. I’m sure there are plenty lurking unseen in the cracks and crevices of the hospital.\n\nPlus, who knows if the medications they’d give me would interact with the supplements.\n\nSo, with about 12 hours of my oral insecticide left, I have decided to throw a bit of a Hail Mary. Has anyone else taken Zygentra Ultimate before and knows how to reverse it? \n\nAlternatively, anyone have a good way to kill thousands of silverfish at a time without hurting [yourself?](https://linktr.ee/unalloyedsainttrina)",

One vaccine will give forty years of the contamination from eating cooked fish. \nBeing injected directly in the blood is much worse than ingesting such a toxin. \n They also contain aluminum, various solvents, detergents.\n\nTaking each ingredient individually will reveal the extent of its toxicity. For example, on formaldehyde, the CDC writes: « Exposure to formaldehyde can irritate the skin, throat, lungs, and eyes. Repeated exposure to formaldehyde can possibly lead to cancer. ». \nHere is an exhaustive list below: \n In addition to the viral and bacterial RNA or DNA that is part of the vaccines, below are some of the fillers considered inert but which have harmful side effects: \naluminum hydroxide (directly linked to Alzheimer's Disease) aluminum phosphate (directly linked to Alzheimer's Disease) thimerosal (mercury; a neurotoxin linked to psychological, neurological & immunological problems.

Mix the sugar (or allulose) with the skim milk powder (if using), carboxymethyl cellulose, guar gum and lambda carrageenan. If you don't have the stabilizers, which are the last three ingredients, for easy-to-find stabilizers, substitute 1 g of xanthan gum, and then dissolve 3 g of gelatin in about ⅓ of the milk you heat to 140 °F (60 °C). If you don't have any stabilizers at all, you can still make this recipe, but you might need to eat it immediately when you're done, because it might not keep well in the freezer overnight.\n2. If you are not using pecan butter, you will need to grind the pecans into a paste, which is pecan butter. The best way is with a melanger or wet grinder, but it is possible with a blender or food processor, scraping down the sides every so often.\n3. Put one egg yolk (and half the water, if using) into a cylindrical container, slightly wider than the diameter of your immersion blender. Start your immersion blender, and add the pecan butter, a little at a time. If your blender struggles to incorporate, add a little of the cold milk, until it no longer struggles. Continue to add the pecan butter until you have used half the pecan butter, and set it aside. Repeat the entire process with the other egg yolk (and the rest of the water, if using) with the other half of the pecan butter.\n3. Put a little of the pecan mixture, (a little of the melted butter, if using,) a little of the milk and a little of the sugar mixture into the blender and blend until well combined. Only do a little, or else you might clog your blender. Once blended, pour into a bowl, and then put a little of the pecan mixture, (melted butter, if using,) milk and sugar mixture into the blender again, blending and pouring into the bowl once more. Repeat until all your ingredients are blended together.\n4. If you have an ice cream maker, empty the bowl into your ice cream maker, and follow the manufacturer's instructions for making ice cream. If your ice cream maker doesn't have its own compressor, you will need to let you batter cool to at least room temperature first. If you don't have an ice cream maker, empty the bowl into a loaf pan, and then place it in the freezer, scraping down the sides and bottom with a spatula and then beating with an electric mixer every 10 to 15 minutes, until your desired consistency.\n\n#Variations:\n1. If you're allergic to eggs, remove the eggs. Instead, use 2 g of soy lecithin (or 0.8 g polysorbate 80), 7 g pecan and 25 g water, which is enough to replace the two eggs.\n2. For butter pecan gelato, let the pecan butter sit in a container at room temperature, until the oil rises to the top. While still in the container, weigh the pecan butter (in the container). Gently remove pecan oil. Now weigh again and subtract. This is how much oil you removed. Replace this with the same amount of clarified butter, also called ghee.\n\n#Taste & Texture:\n1. The texture is incredible, easily scoopable even immediately out of the freezer, even with just a room temperature spoon. The ingredients really do a fantastic job here, emulsifying the fat from the pecans and stabilizing the air in the ice cream.\n2. The pecan superpremium ice cream is very much a pecan lover's ice cream. The gelato is more mild and lower in fat. Butter pecan superpremium ice cream is a balance between the mild flavor of the gelato with the rich taste of the superpremium ice cream.",

I first used this sunscreen when I went to Amritsar in December. Very easy to apply, blends easily, skin feels smooth post application. The texture gave the feel that it’s meant for winters but didn’t face any heaviness back then.\n\nOnce I returned home, a state that happens to be bit hot and humid, it started feeling heavy initially. I continued applying it coz during my trip, it easily preventing my skin from getting tanned so trusted its efficacy.\n\nHowever, lately whenever I squeeze the tube, a drop or two of oil is dispensed first before the actual product. My combination skin lately hates the product coz it feels too heavy, I mean quite heavy post application. The oil is clearly visible, maybe separated within the product itself.\n\nI’ve used the Orange variant, so was no newbie to the fragrance and heavy texture, but the Aqua variant felt way heavier than the Orange variant. Its claims of feeling like a moisturizer are probably true coz you can skip it while using this sunscreen and your skin won’t know.\n\nI’ve used two variants of A’pieu sunscreen, and my experience with both of them has been that while they protect you from getting tanned, they are not meant for Combination or Oily skin, especially summers. They are quite affordable, I bought the Aqua variant for Rs. 391/-. So it’s sad to see a good product suiting my budget but not suiting my skin. But this is definitely recommended for Dry & Very Dry Skin peeps.\n\nI’ve also stocked up on A’pieu purple variant. Will put up a review post usage.\n\n**Reapplication:** If the initial application felt so greasy, post application is your face becoming tel ki kadhai, plus mild pilling. Didn’t face this issue during reapplication in December, but then I wasn’t reapplying every 4 hours, just whenever I could get time to.\n\n**Repurchase:** WNRP",

I have recently gathered all the info on Salicylic Acid that I have in my personal knowledge base and decided to publish it as a guidelines that can be referenced in the future.\n\nI decided to do this because question about Salicylic Acid appear from time to time in the sub and I also see some wrong information from YouTube videos when people are trying to formulate it. Hope this information would be helpful for you!\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nI AM NOT A CHEMIST!\n\nI AM NOT A DOCTOR!\n\nI DON'T HAVE ANY SKINCARE, CHEMISTRY, MEDICAL OR BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION!\n\nAll the information is gathered over the internet sources and some is referenced (+ a bit of personal DIY experience). I am open to any corrections and additions. Please leave them in comments and I'll include them in this article.\n\n# General info\n\n>**BE CAUTIOS! IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY TO ASPIRIN THEN YOU MOST LIKELY HAVE ALLERGY TO SALICYLIC ACID**\n\n**INCI:** Salicylic Acid  \n**Type:** Acid, BHA  \n**Functions:** Exfoliation, Anti-inflammatory  \n**Treats:** Acne, Blackheads, Keratosis Pilaris, Sebum production  \n**Usage rate:** 0.5 - 3.0%  \n**Usable pH range:** 3.5  \n**pKa:** 2.97  \n**Solubility:** Alcohols, Glycols, Oils, Surfactants  \n**Molar mass:** 138.121 g/mol (Daltons)\n\n# Usage rate\n\nDue to possible poisoning, based on European regulations ([SCCS - Final Opinion on Salicylic acid](https://health.ec.europa.eu/latest-updates/sccs-final-opinion-salicylic-acid-2023-06-09_en)) maximum usage rates of Salicylic Acid in skincare products are:\n\n* 3% in wash-off hair products;\n* 2% in other leave-on products, excluding the mentioned below;\n* 0.5% for body lotions, eye shadows, mascaras, eyeliners, lipsticks, oral products and non-spray deodorants.\n\n>**!DANGER!**  \nBetter to avoid formulating sprayable products due to possible inhalation. Also, special attention is required for the use of SA in eye products, as it shows potential of causing serious damage to eyes.\n\nUSA most likely has the same regulation on SA. It is also an OTC drug in USA and should be labeled in a special section of the product packaging.\n\nSouth Korea has even stricter rules for direct SA. The maximum usage rate is up to 0.5% for any product type ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2d613u/maximum_bha_in_korea_05/)). That's why Korean skincare products often use **Willow Bark Extract** and/or **Betaine Salicylate** as active ingredient instead.\n\n# Solubility\n\n# Water\n\nAlthough Salicylic Acid is a polar molecule it is poorly soluble in water (which is also a polar molecule), because the polar parts of the molecule attached to the bigger non-polar part of it, affecting the properties. ([Chemical Book](https://www.chemicalbook.com/article/the-polar-and-non-polar-characteristics-in-the-structure-of-salicylic-acid.htm)).\n\n# Depending on temperature\n\nSolubility in water depending on the temperature ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_acid)):\n\n|Water temperature (°C)|Solubility (g/L)|Solubility (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|0|1.24|0.124|\n|25|2.48|0.248|\n|40|4.14|0.414|\n|75|17.41|1.741|\n|100|77.79|7.779|\n\nWhich means if you take 100ml of water under room temperature (25 °C) you can dissolve up to 0.248g of SA in it. If you boil the water it will take up to 7.779g of SA, but precipitates when you cool the solution down.\n\n# Depending on pH\n\nSolubility increases with increasing pH, because part of SA becomes \"neutralized\" and therefore more soluble in water. Can be estimated for any given pH using the pKa of Salicylic Acid:\n\n* At a pH of 2.97 (pKa): 50% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form\n* At a pH of 4: 90% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form.\n* At a pH of 5: about 99% is in \"neutralized\" form.\n\nHere is a free acid calculator (not only for BHA) at any pH level: [LabMuffin Beauty](https://labmuffin.com/free-acid-calculator-for-exfoliants-at-specific-ph-levels/). WIth this spreadsheet you can calculate how much Salicylic Acid will be in protonated form (not neutralized, free acid) under any pH.\n\n# Betaine\n\nDue to strict regulation of SA in Korea and high popularity of Korean skincare products, new ingredient has been researched and introduced as a gentler alternative to SA called **Betaine Salicylate**.\n\nBetaine forms a hydrogen-bonded complex with Salicylic Acid rather than a salt, which increases its solubility. Formulated with it at pH 3.0-3.5, with a 2:1 molar ratio (1.7g to 1g) of Betaine to Salicylic Acid and it remains relatively soluble. Betaine mixed with Salicylic Acid at the right proportion results in a liquid ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/do-sodium-citrate-or-betaine-react-with-salicylic-acid/)).\n\n# Surfactants\n\nGreat solubility in many surfactants, especially the ones that start with \"Sodium\" (Sodium Laureth Sulfate etc). That's why formulating a face wash or shampoo with Salicylic Acid is not a big problem and won't be covered here.\n\nAccording to [\"The solubilization of salicylic acid by a series of non-ionic surfactants\"](https://academic.oup.com/jpp/article-abstract/23/Supplement_1/241S/6200573) the likely mechanism is somewhere between incorporation into the micelles and encapsulation.\n\nBased on [\"Solubilization of Salicylic Acid by Polysorbate 80 as Determined by Solubility Titration\"](https://jpharmsci.org/article/S0022-3549(15)33858-2/abstract), to completely solubilize SA in water the ratio between SA and:\n\n* **Polysorbate 80** should be 0.15\n* **Polysorbate 20** should be 0.13\n\nTherefore to solubilize 2% of SA in water required around 13.4% of Polysorbate 80 or around 15.4% of Polysorbate 20.\n\n# Ethanol (Alcohol)\n\nSalicylic Acid is highly soluble in **Ethanol**, that's why many companies use Ethanol as a main solvent or a co-solvent of the product.\n\nUnder normal conditions the solubility is 291.3 g/L or 369.2 g/kg Ethanol, which means 36.92g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Ethanol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Propylene glycol\n\n**Propylene Glycol** is often used as a solvent and penetration enhancer in skincare formulations. Solubility rate of SA in Propylene Glycol is 248.63 g/L or 257.64 g/kg Propylene Glycol, which means 25.76g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Propylene Glycol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Sodium Citrate and Sodium Lactate\n\n**Sodium Citrate** and **Sodium Lactate** are salts of weak Citric Acid and Lactic Acid respectfully. Since SA is a stronger acid, when mixed it can replace Citric or Lactic acid and gives **Sodium Salicylate**, which is highly soluble in water:\n\n>Sodium Citrate + Salicylic Acid -> Sodium Citrate + Sodium Salicylate + Citric Acid + Salicylic Acid\n\nMentioned salts are not usable as solubilization enhancers since they basically neutralize SA, but they are good buffering agents to prevent SA recrystallization in case of pH drift or temperature change.\n\nSuggested ratio of salt to SA is 1:10 ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/precipitation-and-gel-incompatibility-salicylic-acid-serum/)), meaning for 2% of Salicylic Acid include 0.2% of the buffer.\n\n# Mixed solvency approach\n\nAccording to [Hydrotropy, mixed hydrotropy, and mixed solvency as trending concept for solubilization of lipophilic drugs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128144558000050) and [\"Mixed-solvency approach\" - Boon for solubilization of poorly water-soluble drugs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44298504_Mixed-solvency_approach_-_Boon_for_solubilization_of_poorly_water-soluble_drugs), a mix of different solvents usually gives better solubility than if one pure solvent is used of the same content. This allows to decrease the content of each individual solvent in the formula leading to a more elegant product.\n\nSolubility in mixes of Water, Propylene Glycol and Ethanol was studied in [Solubility prediction of Salicylic Acid in Water-Ethanol-Propylene Glycol mixtures](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16649546/). The study defined a formula to determine how much Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in a custom mixture of this solvents and also proves mixed solvency approach.\n\nHere is a calculator spreadsheet that I made based on the study: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MqJaMGAa1Wu3BKck55dkqUWt4ACU_FPo). Fill in percentage of Ethanol and Propylene Glycol in the mixture (water will be calculated automatically) and you'll see the solubility calculated.\n\n# Substitutions\n\nThere are alternative ingredients that are readily soluble in water and can be used to avoid the hassle with Salicylic Acid itself:\n\n* **Sodium Salicylate**. Salt of Salicylic Acid. Very soluble in water. There is a publication in cosmetic journal ([Exfoliation for sensitive skin with neutralized salicylic acid](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x)) showing that Sodium Salicylate is as effective as actual Salicylic Acid in terms of exfoliation. But the methodology of studies are not disclosed and anti-acne effect is not tested. Used in [Revox Just Salicylic Acid 2% For Scalp](https://incidecoder.com/products/revox-just-salicylic-acid-2-for-scalp)  and [Keve Salicylic Acid 2% Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/keve-salicylic-acid-2-serum)\n* **WIllow Bark Extract**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Pyunkang Yul Acne Dressing Mask Pack](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-dressing-mask-pack);\n* **Betaine Salicylate**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Cos De BAHA S2 Salicylic Acid BHA 2% Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cos-de-baha-s2-salicylic-acid-bha-2-liquid);\n* **Salicylic Acid in Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine** solution. Used in [The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-salicylic-acid-2-solution)  and [Revolution 2% Salicylic Acid Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/revolution-2-salicylic-acid-serum);\n* Spray dried **Salicylic Acid with Acacia Senegal Gum**. Used in [Somethinc 2% BHA Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment](https://incidecoder.com/products/somethinc-2-bha-salicylic-acid-acne-treatment) and [Attivi Puri Salicylic Acid + Niacinamide Lotion](https://incidecoder.com/products/attivi-puri-salicylic-acid-niacinamide-lotion)\n\n# Formulation strategy\n\nBased on the data above, the strategy of formulating a stable SA serum is:\n\n1. Formulate with not more than 2% of Salicylic Acid to meet requirements for skincare products;\n2. Formulate at pH 3.5 to meet FDA requirements for skincare products. At this pH if you add 2% of Salicylic Acid only 0.46% will be in free form (and hence less solvents needed);\n3. Use several solvents (glycols, ethanol) for better solubility based on mixed solvency approach;\n4. Include some mild non-ionic surfactants (Polysorbate 20, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate etc) to form micelles and encapsulate part of the acid;\n5. Use Betaine to convert part of SA to Betaine Salicylate and adjust the pH;\n6. Add some weak acid salt (Sodium Citrate, Sodium Lactate) to prevent precipitation in case of pH drift or temperature change;\n7. Since our target is low pH, maybe Ethanol content and maybe high salt content be sure to use a tolerant gelling agent. Sepimax Zen, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethylcellulose or HMW Hyaluronic acid are good choices, while Aristoflex, Carbomer, Lecigel won't thicken the solution.\n8. Avoid natural extracts (or add at 0.01% amount for marketing claims) and ingredients that in low pH will hydrolyze over time and shift the pH level up (Niacinamide, Urea etc).\n\n# Example of a commercial product\n\n[Dermarium \"Tricky Duet 2% Salicylic Acid\" toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/dermarium-tricky-duet-2-salicylic-acid-2):\n\n>INCI: Water, **Ethanol**, *Salicylic Acid*, **Propylene Glycol**, **Betaine**, **Sodium Lactate**, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, **Polysorbate 20**, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Menthol, Methyl Lactate.\n\n* Used Ethanol and Propylene Glycol as solvents\n* Used Polysorbate 20 and PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil to boost solubility (but most likely to solubilize the extracts)\n* Used Betaine as a hydrotrope tp boost the solubility;\n* Used Sodium Lactate as a buffering salt.\n\n# Example of formulas\n\n# Very basic waterless solution\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Propylene Glycol|98%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n\nThe easiest and fastest approach is to dissolve Salicylic Acid directly in Propylene Glycol.\n\nPros:\n\n* No water - no solubility and recrystallization problems;\n* No water - no pH;\n* No water - no need for preservation;\n* Easy and fast to prepare;\n* Damn strong since whole SA content is in free acid form.\n\nCons:\n\n* Unpleasant to wear, PG has very oily texture (can be balanced with Ethanol to some degree);\n* Runny texture, hard to thicken;\n* Damn strong.

Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n5. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nPreservative is optional because the formula has a lot of humectant (Propylene Glycol) that binds water and also low pH.\n\nUsed much more PG as required because no other co-solvents or buffering agents used, so higher amount is required to maintain the stability and prevent recrystallization of SA.\n\n# Basic two-solvent serum\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Ethanol|20%|\n|Propylene Glycol|20%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1.

Add the preservative of choice and stir until dissolved;\n5. Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n6. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nMix of 2 solvents allow to add less of it (40% total comparing to 50% of PG in previous formula). Also, Ethanol makes the serum less oily.\n\n# Advanced serum with surfactant and buffering agent\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Sodium Citrate|0.5%|\n|Polysorbate 80|5%|\n|Propylene Glycol|30%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1.

Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nThis formula utilizes all the formulation suggestions I gathered from different sources. It has several glycols and Ethanol as a mix of solvents, uses surfactant and Betaine plus buffer with Sodium Lactate.\n\n# Formulas from YouTube bloggers\n\nExample of good formulas:\n\n1.

Feel free to disregard them :)\n\n>Under normal conditions the solubility is 291.3 g/L or 369.2 g/kg, which means 36.92g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Ethanol.\n\nI would add \"**g/kg ethanol**\", otherwise this can be confused with g/kg solution (which is the more common use of the unit). \n\n>2. Formulate at pH 3.5 to meet FDA requirements for skincare products. Under this pH if you add 2% of Salicylic Acid only 0.46% will be in free form (and hence less solvents needed)\n\nAs you decrease pH, more acid will be in the free-acid form (that is, protonated). However, above pH 3.5, you'll reduce the amount of free acid (increase the ionized form). It should be updated to read \"**Above** this pH, if you add...\".\n\n>4. Include some mild surfactants (Polysorbate 20, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate etc) to decrease surface tension and boost the solubility;\n\nI don't see that the article comments on the mechanism of solubilization. However, the likely mechanism would be somewhere between incorporation into the micelles and encapsulation. Surfactants decreasing air-water interfacial surface tension is an intrinsic property of surfactants, and doesn't really pertain to boosting solubility. It's a nit-picky suggestion, but it's just because I work with surfactants.\n\n>[Dermarium \"Tricky Duet 2% Salicylic Acid\" toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/dermarium-tricky-duet-2-salicylic-acid-2):\n\n>INCI: Water, **Ethanol**, *Salicylic Acid*, **Propylene Glycol**, **Betaine**, **Sodium Lactate**, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, **Polysorbate 20**, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Menthol, Methyl Lactate.\n\n>1.

However, triethanolamine is a pH adjuster, and will form a small amount of triethanolammonium salicylate (which does increase solubility, albeit by neutralization). \n\n  \nAll in all, a lot of great, helpful information!

Prevnar 13 & Gardisil, just 2 of the 15 vaccines given to INFANTS, on average. \n\nPrevnar 13 (given to infants) http://www.drugs.com/pro/prevnar-13.html Ingredients: (aside from the viruses they already put into infants) - Polysorbate 80 (go to conclusion: \"of these 2-year feed studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity for polysorbate 80\"\n\n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12616296 - Aluminum Phosphate (go to conclusion: \"findings have showed a solid link with neurotoxic effects in humans\") http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4344667/ \n\nGARDASIL Vaccine (given to infants) https://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/g/gardasil/gardasil_ppi.pdf Some Ingredients below (aside from the viruses they already put into infants) - Aluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate  (\"In young children, a highly significant correlation exists between the number of pediatric aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines administered and the rate of autism spectrum disorders. \" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23609067 - Polysorbate 80 (go to conclusion: \"of these 2-year feed studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity for polysorbate 80\" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12616296 - Sodium Borate  Used to kill cockroaches.  Borax is now required to be labelled with the warnings \"May damage fertility\" and \"May damage the unborn child\" http://www.gahp.net/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Borax-in-ASGM-Final-April-1-2013.pdf Yeast Protein: (This is a hidden form of MSG, as it creates synthetic free glutamic acid in the processing. Most vaccines contain some hidden form of MSG (eg hydrolysed gelatin) as this feeds the live virus and \"induces obesity and diabetes\"  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18178378 Not only did I link you to the manufacturers own ingredients, I linked you to official studies which state clinical results which are usually hidden from the public via lack of media exposure. \n\n\nIf you aren't familiar about NCBI, it's a database of federally funded scientific research. You can find conclusive studies about pretty much everything dealing with human health. Some of the studies are done paid by multi nationals. As a rule of thumb, always try to find at least 3 to 4 sources, to get a general consensus. Also, older studies seem to be more accurate when dealing with legacy elements such as mercury, aluminum, and other common metals, effects, and ingredients used in medicine. There was less big pharma involved back then, and scientists were able to do research without having their lives threatened. So if you can find a study on \"The effects of mercury on humans\" in 1966, that is just as valid, if not more valid than a study from 2013, that debates if it's toxic at all. Some things are well noted, and big money and manipulation is still used to sway consensus. Fortunately, it's usually obvious, so big pharma typically just makes sure news and popular media doesn't mention old or newer studies that form a consensus around conclusive data. Everybody on this thread hating, is either paid informants, or uneducated and defensive about shooting their own children with poison. The combination of vaccines, and the Standard American Diet will trigger all types of issues from obesity, auto immune issues, autism, and the list grows. Standard vaccines like mumps, tetanus, are relatively safe, but the newer vaccination list recommended to infants grow every year, are apart of a bigger plan. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information",

        "body": "None of these are facts. These are opinions with some of the most extreme cherry picking I've ever seen. Similar to the snake-oil salesmen of the past. Mixing a few misplaced \"facts\" with a slurry of BS.\n\nWater in high doses can kill you.\n\n\"Toxins\" in low doses can be in a therapeutic range.\n\nIs that range 100% perfect? No, nothing in science is. But should 99 people potentially die because of the adverse affect on 1 person? That's a balance medical researchers try to figure out.\n\nYou can't just pull out a name of a chemical and call it a poison without mentioning dosages and the effects of that dosage on a statistically significant amount of subjects.\n\nLearn the science before commenting on it. None of the education is hidden. People are just either lazy or truly not capable of understanding, or seek information which agrees with whatever bias they have. These people aren't genuine, and shouldn't risk the lives of others by spouting their lazy or uneducated opinion.\n\n**If you trust science enough to believe that diseases are real and caused by viruses/bacteria/pathogens, then you should understand that the same science explains why vaccines are therapeutic.**\n\nIf not, then go back to thinking diseases are caused by demons, stepping on a sidewalk crack, or whatever superstition uneducated people used to and apparently still believe.\n\nAre there profiteers? Absolutely yes, as with any other invention made in a capitalistic society.\n\nShould we abandon science and reason because of these cases where they are abused for profit? Absolutely not.\n\nIn fact, profiteers probably benefit from this thinking because it creates the dichotomy where not getting a vaccine = being crazy. Which pushes even more people towards vaccines to dissociate from stigma.\n\nTL;DR - If you use hand sanitizer or wash your hands, or use scientific studies to try to prove your point then you should be able to understand why you are absolutely a hypocrite. It's not a perfect process and oversight is needed, but all those exist already.",

I realized it contained alcohol and have since switched to Lait U. I did enjoy Lait VIP o2 but I don’t believe in using products with alcohol for extended periods of time so that’s why I decided to switch and Lait U is very gentle. \n\n- I was recommend complexe iribiol for pimples I get from time to time. Yes, it clears it up very quickly, but the second ingredient is alcohol denat and I would get rough patches on my skin if I used it multiple days in a row. \n\n- I do love Masque Vivant although it also contains denatured alcohol. Since I only use it about 3 times a week for about 30 min I have decided it’s of low risk to my skin since the alcohol is a little bit lower on the list. \n\n- Masque vip o2 does seem to make the skin around my eyes a little brighter but I have a pimple right near my eye that won’t seem to go away. After looking at the ingredient list and seeing mink oil as the 5th ingredient it makes sense since mink oil is very comedogenic. \n\n- I love lotion MC 110 N*1, and since I doesn’t contain any alcohol I will continue to use. It really plumps my skin and gives me a glow. It is meant to be used after your P50 lotion (toner). \n\n- I was recommended P50 PIGM400 for my skin and it does lighten my skin and make it feel super balanced. After looking at the ingredients though, it also contains denatured alcohol and therefore after I finish this bottle I will move on to the regular P50 (without phenol) since it doesn’t contain alcohol. \n\n- The placenta serum is probably my favorite. It hydrates and heals my skin and I also use it on my eyes during the day. \n\n- The PIGM400 serum is just ok. It also contains alcohol and I feel like my other products have lightened my dark spots from recents acne more than this serum. It also contains some ingredients that can cause acne. \n\n- Creme Dermopurifiante makes my skin glow when I use it and it does great with skin that is acne prone but it also contains alcohol so for me, using it long term is a no go. \n\n\n\n",

As an emollient, Cromollient™ SCE offers unique benefits in that it is both ‘hydroactive’ and surfactant-friendly, making it ideal for products like body washes, liquid soaps, facial cleansers and shampoos.\n\nI looked up Myristyl Alcohol and it can be derived from a number of sources (nutmeg, palm oil), but can also be (and in the cosmetic industry, usually is) derived from coconut oil. I don’t know if the Myristyl Alcohol would be directly related to a coconut allergy or not. \n\nThe other ingredient (Adipic Acid) is made from a mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, two ingredients whose ultimate origins stem from petrochemical derivatives, which have no relation to coconut.",

    "body": "Because \"heavy cream\" isn't always just cream, I thought it might be helpful to have a central location where we can see what brands are carnivore and what brands are not.\n\nI don't know about other countries, but in the US most heavy cream being sold contains plant based thickeners. Here are some common ones you might see:\n\n|Ingredient|Source|\n|:-|:-|\n|Carrageenan|Seaweed|\n|Gellan Gum|Pond Scum|\n|Mono-and Diglycerides|Soybean Oil|\n\nI have no way of researching every brand of heavy cream out there, but I thought I'd get things started by listing ones that I often see. Please share your findings as well so we all know what our options are.\n\nFirst I'll start with some brands that should probably be avoided.\n\n# Dairy Pure\n\nI see this one used a lot at restaurants and coffee shops (including Starbucks). The manufacturer doesn't list the ingredients on their [web site](https://www.dairypure.com/products/creamers/heavy-whipping), but I was able to find them on [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/products/2633554).\n\nIngredients:  Heavy Cream, Contains Less Than 1% Of: Mono And Diglycerides, Polysorbate 80, Carrageenan\n\nThis sums up pretty much all store brand heavy cream as well.\n\n# Horizon\n\nI see a lot of people drinking this one thinking it's pure cream, but even their [web site](https://horizon.com/organic-dairy-products/organic-heavy-whipping-cream/organic-heavy-whipping-cream/) says otherwise.\n\nIngredients: Organic Grade A Cream, Gellan Gum\n\n# Organic Valley\n\nThis is another very common one that tricks people. According to their [web site](https://www.organicvalley.coop/products/cream/cream/heavy-whipping-cream-pasteurized-pint/) it's just cream, but if you look at the reviews you'll see complaints about other ingredients being added. They claim that the **Ultra Pasturized** is the one contains additives and the **Pasturized** is just cream. Their web site only shows the pasturized version, but Instacart has a listing for both and agrees with what is being said.\n\n[Pasturized Ingredients](https://www.instacart.com/products/3169077): Organic Grade A Cream (milk)\n\n[Ultra Pasturized Ingredients](https://www.instacart.com/products/17314298): Organic Grade A Cream (milk), Gellan Gum\n\nI have not been able to find the pasturized version of this product anywhere though.\n\n# Publix - GreenWise\n\nI can't find this one on the Publix web site, but I am able to find it on [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/products/16686720).\n\nIngredients: Organic Grade A Cream (Milk), Gellan Gum\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow on to the few brands I've found that are good...\n\n# Harrisburg Dairies\n\nThis one is from Pennsylvania, but I can find it in Alabama, so I'm assuming it's wide spread. According to their [web site](http://www.harrisburgdairies.com/page36.html) (as well as personal experience with the brand)...\n\nIngredients: Milk, Cream\n\n# Kalona SuperNatural\n\nAccording to their [web site](https://kalonasupernatural.com/product/organic-milk-cream/organic-whipping-cream/).\n\nIngredients: Certified Organic Grade A Cream.\n\n# Natural by Nature\n\nThis one doesn't list the ingredients on their [web site](https://www.naturalbynaturedairy.com/heavy-cream), but according to [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/products/133872) (as well as personal experience with the brand)...\n\nIngredients: Organic Heavy Cream\n\n# Trader Joe's\n\nUnfortunately they don't provide information about their products online and you can't buy it from a third party service like Instacart, so I'm not able to link to any evidence. But I do know their heavy cream is good as well.",

    "body": "Detoxing from vaccines is a process without a definite timeline.  Think of it as an ongoing journey. Toxin accumulation, especially heavy  metals like mercury, can take a long time to remove from the body.  Vaccine toxins can be cumulative, building up with each vaccination,  adding to the toxin load we acquire from the enormous amount of  environmental toxins we encounter every day.\n\nIf you’ve been vaccinated and suffer from serious vaccination damage,  you’re best off living a lifestyle that promotes detoxification for the  rest of your life. The truth is, you may never be able to dispel all of  the toxins that have caused the damage. Living the healthiest possible  lifestyle may be your only way to live symptom-free. But then again, to  one degree or another, this is true for everyone.\n\n## Contents\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Ingredients That Need To Be Detoxified and Why**](https://www.organiclifestylemagazine.com/issue/17-how-to-detoxify-and-heal-from-vaccinations-for-adults-and-children#ingredients)\n* [**What Damage Is Caused By Vaccines**](https://www.organiclifestylemagazine.com/issue/17-how-to-detoxify-and-heal-from-vaccinations-for-adults-and-children#what)\n* [**Pre-Vaccine – Maximize the Safety of Vaccinations**](https://www.organiclifestylemagazine.com/issue/17-how-to-detoxify-and-heal-from-vaccinations-for-adults-and-children#pre)\n* [**Vaccine Detoxification Protocol(s) For Adults**](https://www.organiclifestylemagazine.com/issue/17-how-to-detoxify-and-heal-from-vaccinations-for-adults-and-children#vaccine)\n* [**Detoxification For Children**](https://www.organiclifestylemagazine.com/issue/17-how-to-detoxify-and-heal-from-vaccinations-for-adults-and-children#detoxification)\n* [**Enzyme Supplementation For Vaccine Damage**](https://www.organiclifestylemagazine.com/issue/17-how-to-detoxify-and-heal-from-vaccinations-for-adults-and-children#enzyme)\n* [**Recommended Supplements**](https://www.organiclifestylemagazine.com/issue/17-how-to-detoxify-and-heal-from-vaccinations-for-adults-and-children#recommended)\n\nClearing the vaccine injury with naturopathic and homeopathic  remedies is an option. The time between the beginning of the protocol  and full recovery is dependent on the severity of the damage, the length  of time the damage has been severe, and the amount of suppressive  therapy that was administered (pharmaceuticals). All pharmaceuticals  will need to be flushed from the body, and the damage they caused must  be healed as well.\n\nWhile some can often recover from a vaccine injury in a matter of  weeks or months, detoxifying and repairing the body can take years if  the damage is severe (brain damage) or the protocol and diet are not  strictly followed, (for example, children who refuse to eat raw  vegetables.)\n\n## Ingredients That Need To Be Detoxified and Why\n\nIngredients and derived-from ingredients include, thimerosal (yes,  there are plenty of vaccines that still contain mercury), aluminum (some  say it’s even worse than thimerosal), MSG, GMOs, and human DNA, Every  single vaccine is toxic, and many ingredients are known carcinogens or  neurotoxins. Vaccines are toxic by nature; the vaccine is designed to  excite the immune system. In fact, every single ingredient in vaccines  is toxic in one way or another.\n\nConsider that the preservatives are designed to kill or prevent the  growth of microorganisms. That’s what preservatives do. But vaccines  need to do this while preserving the antigen. So we’ve got an antigen,  which of course is toxic to the body, and we have a preservative, which  is generally very heavy and very toxic that is designed to kill  organisms, and we have ingredients designed to cause damage so that the  immune system is aroused. It doesn’t take a scientist to understand how  damaging this can be to the body, especially when repeated over and  over.\n\nAn individual’s reaction to a vaccine is often similar to how the body would react to the natural disease\n\nSome of the damage is due to the sheer accumulation of toxins, some  of the damage is due to the immune response, some of the damage is due  to dumb luck of where the toxins settle within the body. It should be  noted that these toxins can shift at any time, which is why vaccine  injuries can occur days, weeks, and even years after the actual  vaccination.\n\nA person who would willingly administer or receive an immunization is  a person who does not fully understand the importance of microbes in  our biology, how the immune system and natural selection works, and how  toxins affect biology.\n\nWe’ve got formaldehyde (a probable human carcinogen), mercury (a  neurotoxin and the second most toxic substance known to man), aluminum  (a known neurotoxin, 75% of which is retained in a newborn and up to 40%  in an adult, stored in the kidneys, spleen, liver, heart, brain, lymph  nodes, and muscle), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (a hazardous  substance), MSG (a neurotoxin), 2-Phenoxyethoanol (a hazardous toxin),  and polysorbate 80 (a toxin associated with serious adverse effects  including death), and this list is not complete.\n\nMany of these toxins are synergistically toxic, for instance  thimerosal’s toxicity is multiplied by the presence of aluminum, and  some antibiotics. You can have harmful reactions with your immunizations  from past vaccines.\n\nEven if each and every vaccine were to be proven safe and effective  despite its toxic ingredients, no one knows how much damage is done by  combining multiple vaccines.\n\n## What Damage Is Caused By Vaccines\n\nAn individual’s reaction to a vaccine is often similar to how the  body would react to the natural disease. In most cases, those most  susceptible to vaccine damage are those with a compromised immune system  – the same individuals who would suffer the most damage from the  natural disease if they contracted it.\n\nGenerally, the healthier the individual is prior to the shot, the  less severe the reaction. The directions in the package insert (package  inserts that provide medical directions to the doctors and information  for the patients) specifically say not to vaccinate a sick child.   Vaccinating sick children and adults dramatically increases the risk of  an adverse reaction.\n\nMinor vaccine damage typically includes fevers, ear infections, sinus  infections, diarrhea, and other similar symptoms. This is the body’s  attempt to discharge the vaccine matter. Often these reactions are  suppressed with antibiotics and other drugs. When antibiotics are given,  the gut becomes diseased with fungi and antibiotic resistant pathogenic  microbes. Vaccine ingredients alone can still cause diseased intestines  due to their powerful antimicrobial nature.\n\n…if you think vaccines are “perfectly safe” or “healthy” you do not understand health…\n\nMany vaccine ingredients linger in the body, especially the viruses.  Vaccines are cocktails of preservatives, pathogens, and adjuvants.  Adjuvants are intended to stimulate your immune response to the  vaccine-introduced pathogens, and they do stimulate your immune system  successfully, but they destroy tissues in the process. Mercury and  aluminum are used as adjuvants and preservatives, so this is a case  where the treatment for the disease (the vaccine) can be worse than the  disease.\n\nIt should be easy to understand now why the majority of vaccine  toxins will have to be expelled from the body before the body can quit  reacting to the disease the vaccine was intended to protect against.\n\nVaccine ingredients can also cause severe allergic reactions to  certain proteins that have been injected into the body, creating an  immediate allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or a food sensitivity like a  peanut or egg allergy. The body will not stop reacting to the allergens  until the body has expelled the vaccine ingredients and has been  returned to full health.\n\nVaccines severely distort the balance of minerals in the body, which  causes vitamin and other nutrient imbalances as well. This leads to a  weakened endocrine system, which causes hormonal imbalances and poor  brain function, along with fatigue. Eventually, if the gut is not  healed, the body will deteriorate into an autoimmune state. (Sometimes  this happens very quickly and other times very slowly.) Almost all  disease is based on inflammation. Vaccines are designed to cause an  immune response, which causes inflammation. Until the vaccine  ingredients are expelled from the body, the body is in a constant  inflammatory state. It’s no wonder multiple sclerosis, cancer,  fibromyalgia, lupus, diabetes, and so many other autoimmune diseases can  be tied back to vaccinations.\n\nUnderstanding basic biology, how cells function, and what just a few  of the vaccine ingredients do (as proven by science), one can only  conclude that vaccines are toxic to the body. Again, if you think  vaccines are “perfectly safe” or “healthy” you do not understand health,  and consequently it will be much more difficult to get well.\n\nOther common vaccine damage symptoms include, but are not limited to,  anaphylaxis, fever, convulsions, coughs that do not resolve, cramps,  decomposition of the blood, developmental delays, degenerative  conditions, acne, ADD, ADHD, food allergies, seasonal and environmental  allergies, Asperger’s, asthma, autism, cavities, colds and flus (often  times ongoing), confusion and disorientation, digestive problems,  diphtheria, ear infections, eczema, emaciation, epilepsy, eruptions,  head banging, behavioral problems, cancer, headaches, hepatitis, hives,  inability to eat various foods, inability to focus, insomnia, learning  disorders, liver and kidney problems, measles, neurological deficits,  polio, repetitive illnesses, meningitis, multiple sclerosis, neuralgias,  restlessness, rheumatic conditions, septicemia, shingles, shock, SIDS,  skin eruptions, sleeping all the time, sleeplessness, tendency to get  sick, tics, violent outbursts, and warts.\n\nThe reason vaccines cause damage and the body can react with so many  different diseases and ailments is that vaccines aggravate the immune  system and the vaccine toxins build up; they do not easily dissipate.\n\n## Pre-Vaccine – Maximize the Safety of Vaccinations\n\nIf a vaccination is being forced on you, do not agree to pay for it  and do not sign any kind of release or consent form. If you are about to  choose to vaccinate or you feel the risks are better than the  consequences (loss of job, CPS, vaccine mandate laws), you can minimize  the risk by detoxifying the body of heavy metals, strengthening the  immune system, and ensuring the gut flora is balanced and healthy. This  can all be done by starting the detox protocol a couple of weeks before  the vaccine is to be administered.\n\nOn the day of the vaccination, take an ice pack with you. Apply it to  the injection site immediately after receiving the shot to lessen the  immune response.\n\n## Vaccine Detoxification Protocol(s) For Adults\n\nThe first step is to eat right. Eating the right kind of foods  promotes constant, proper, gentle, healthy detoxification. We also  recommend supplements from Green Lifestyle Market. For Shillington’s  products, we give recipes so that you can make these products yourself  (check the bottom of [this article](https://www.organiclifestylemagazine.com/total-nutrition-make-your-own-homemade-multivitamin-and-mineral-formula)). If  you’re choosing to use a product from another brand for the purpose of  use in this protocol, make sure the ingredients are clean and potent!  There’s a lot of junk out there, so shop carefully.\n\nSome of our favorite brands include Shillington’s Organic Solutions,  Wise Woman Herbals, Gaia Herbs, Thorne, Progressive Labs, Pure  Encapsulations, Douglas Labs, Standard Process, Allergy Research Group,  and Professional Complementary Health Formulas. Green Lifestyle Market  sells most of these brands, but not all. With Shillington’s products, we  also give the recipe whenever possible so you can make the tinctures,  teas, and other formulas yourself.\n\nThis is not a specific protocol, and natural medicine does not have  to be an exact science. Some people will see more benefit from one  aspect of the program than another. But it’s important to get the diet  right. Don’t eat crap and expect to get well. It does not work that way.  For detoxing and for healing, the diet is far more important than the  supplements. In fact, most people who suffer from a vaccine injury could  heal fully with only the diet and lemonade recipe and no  supplementation though it would take longer, and will vary depending on  the severity of the injury. And while supplementation without diet can  reduce and even reverse some symptoms, it takes much longer, and the  person will not get to a place of vitality and well-being.\n\n## Eat to Detoxify\n\nFruits and vegetables all have some form of detoxification  properties. The only problem with fruit is its high sugar content. When  someone’s gut is damaged, sugar can promote Candida overgrowth. So, if  Candida symptoms exist, fruit should be severely limited and eaten with  anti-fungal supplements.\n\nVegetables should be varied and plentiful. Eat a large salad every  day with lots of different vegetables. Try introducing new vegetables  and fresh herbs into your salads each shopping trip. Food has  synergistic properties, and this is especially true for vegetables (and  fruits that are known as vegetables, too).\n\nA healthy diet consists of a minimum of 80% raw fresh produce with  many more vegetables than fruits. Add herbs into your cooking like  garlic, oregano, cinnamon, turmeric, and other spices and herbs with  amazing health benefits. Try to find the whole herbs, like turmeric and  ginger root and cinnamon bark, as opposed to the powdered versions. Your  food will taste much better, and your body will feel the difference,  too. Cilantro (coriander), garlic, and parsley are well known for their  ability to chelate metals and they have many benefits including huge  immune system boosting properties.\n\nEliminate refined foods, smoking, (including marijuana), and limit or  eliminate anything else that can introduce heavy metals and other  toxins to your body. This, unfortunately, can include rice and many  kinds of fish. These are normally fine foods for health, but they are  too often contaminated with heavy metals. If you do eat rice or fish, do  your research and find the brands that have been proven clean (arsenic  in rice) and the fish with the lowest contamination (mercury). Avoid  root vegetables and herbs that are not grown in clean soil. This means  choosing organic vegetables and avoiding all vegetables grown in China!  The majority of garlic sold in the U.S. is grown in China and it is  often highly toxic.\n\nEat lots of vegetables rich in sulfur compounds like, cabbage,  cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, bok choy, broccoli, onions, shallots,  garlic, and leeks.\n\n## A Gallon a Day\n\nHere’s what you’ll need for cranberry lemonade:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Glass gallon jar\n* 14 cups (almost a gallon) of safe, clean, spring water or distilled water\n* 1 cup of organic cranberry juice, not from concentrate\n* 3 organic fresh lemons – juice them\n* A citrus juicer\n* Liquid stevia – to taste\n* Liquid cayenne – to taste\n\nMost people should drink a gallon a day. Some people cannot due to  health issues or due to their smaller size, but regardless, you can  drink a lot of it, and it will help flush and cleanse the whole body.  There are many benefits to this recipe, but make sure you use healthy,  organic ingredients and safe, clean drinking water.\n\n## Balance and Heal the Intestinal Tract\n\nMaintain one bowel movement for each meal or at least two to three  movements per day. If this is difficult, Shillington’s Intestinal  Cleanse, or a product of similar formula with high-quality ingredients  should be taken. Bowel movements, for most people, will come with ease  shortly after adopting the aforementioned diet high in produce. Anyone  who has trouble eliminating after a few days on this diet or who has any  digestive issues, Candida overgrowth symptoms, or any likelihood of  “leaky gut” will also benefit from [Shillington’s Intestinal Cleanse](https://www.greenlifestylemarket.com/shillingtons-intestinal-cleanse-formula-90c).\n\n**Links for all recommended products, where to buy and how to  make, and for more information for those with specific ailments, are  also listed below the article.**\n\nIf bowel movements did not come easily, especially for anyone who  eats raw produce and other fiber rich foods, hypothyroidism may be a  problem. It is very common for mercury to affect the thyroid. If your  thyroid function is fine, the next likely reason for difficult bowel  movements with a proper diet is a magnesium deficiency. (This deficiency  is likely to correct itself with a proper diet.)\n\nWellness does not happen without balanced intestinal flora. Taking a  probiotic and supplementation known to kill Candida and other yeast ([SF722](https://www.greenlifestylemarket.com/shillingtons-intestinal-cleanse-formula-90c)),  can balance the flora. The intestinal cleanse also balances and kills  Candida and other parasites. Any probiotic should be formulated or  encapsulated to pass through stomach acid alive.\n\nGet as much rest and sleep as your body needs. During detoxification,  many people need more than the typically recommended 8 hours of sleep.\n\n## Other Recommended Detoxifying Supplements\n\nThe proper diet is by far the most important aspect of health,  healing, and detoxification. In cases where damage is severe or you  really just want to boost or speed up the process, supplements can help  you detoxify. Supplements are not, and never will be, a substitute for  the right diet. They are a supplementation to the right diet and nothing  more. In fact, they don’t work well with a poor diet.\n\nNiacin, charcoal, [vitamin C, spirulina, chlorella](https://www.greenlifestylemarket.com/shillingtons-total-nutrition-formula),  diatomaceous earth, edible earth clays, and beneficial fats and other  nutrients and herbs can radically accelerate the detoxification process  when they accompany a healthy diet.\n\n## Flushing with Niacin.\n\n[Niacin](https://www.greenlifestylemarket.com/supplements/vitamins/vitamin-b/vitamin-b3/niacin-with-flush),  otherwise known as B3, is a very inexpensive way to boost the efficacy  of a detox. You want the flush kind, not the “no flush.” Doctors usually  recommend starting with 100 mg, but up to 5,000 a day has been used for  serious drug detoxification and other urgent detox needs (such as  chemical poisoning).\n\nDon’t take niacin for too long. Taking any one single B vitamin for a  long time causes an imbalance or deficiency of other B vitamins. Long  term, high dose use of B3 can also damage the liver.\n\nTake it in the morning. In 30 to 45 minutes when it kicks in,  exercise or do the sauna. Try some hot tea. Drink lots of fluids (like  the cranberry lemonade) and sweat out the toxins. Niacin won’t do you  much good if you aren’t flushing out the junk while you do it. It’s  powerful. You’ll be itchy, hot, and flushed red all over. Most people  without seriously damaged livers can easily handle 500 mg for a few  days. The effects last about an hour.\n\n>Perhaps 15 – 25 mg would keep first timers from screaming bloody murder, and allow for a more gentle, beneficial  experience.A word about the process might also be  appropriate, as in the patients where I worked for seven years did not  appear to have a clue about how to best utilize this vitamin as a  cleanse.  (Take a small amount to start, if no effects, i.e., the flush,  observed, up the dose by the same increments, until it occurs.  Then  stay at that dose until no more effects felt, followed by upping the  dose until next flush.  Maintain until no more effect, then up the third  time, repeating this process.  Three times through should then be put  on hold for weeks to a month or two depending upon health status, before  starting again.)  Hopefully, a side note or a foot note, will save  beginners that pain and frustration from overdosing the first time  around, i.e., a simple word of strong caution.  This note of concern is  from one who has used this cleanse for many decades, as well as  assisting others through the process.” – Richard\n\n## Detox With Food Grade Activated Charcoal\n\n[Food grade activated charcoal](https://www.greenlifestylemarket.com/supplements/food-grade-clays-charcoal-and-diatomaceous-earth/activated-charcoal)  is derived from burning pure, untainted organic substances such as  coconuts or certain woods without using toxic chemicals in the process.  Charcoal forms a chemical bond with heavy metals and many other toxins  and is easily flushed from the body.\n\n>The action of activated charcoal involves adsorption, not  absorption of toxins. Adsorption is the electrical attraction of toxins  and heavy metals, but not beneficial nutrients, to the surfaces of the  fine charcoal particles. This is more of a chelation process. The  charcoal itself is not absorbed into the body, so the toxins attached to  the charcoal particles exit via the bowels. Don’t be surprised by black  stools.” – [Natural Society](http://naturalsociety.com/food-grade-activated-charcoal-detox-agent/)\n\nFor vitamin C, spirulina, and chlorella, Dr. Shillington has developed a [nutrition formula](https://www.greenlifestylemarket.com/shillingtons-total-nutrition-formula).  It contains clean, high-quality spirulina and chlorella along with  highly bioavailable vitamin C in its best forms – ground rose hips and  citrus. Check out the [recipe here](https://www.greenlifestylemarket.com/shillingtons-total-nutrition-formula)  or see the link below. If you choose another multi-nutritional  supplement, we highly recommend using a brand that is a nutrition powder  made of ground, pure, nutritionally complete food with the enzymes  still intact. The chlorella and spirulina are not only amazing  superfoods that chelate and detoxify the body, they are both highly  bio-available proteins, and they have a synergistic effect with the  other ingredients. Do make sure any chlorella or spirulina is from a  trustworthy source. These ingredients, when coming from cheap sources,  are known to have contaminants.\n\n[Dr. Shillington also makes an intestinal detox](https://www.greenlifestylemarket.com/shillingtons-intestinal-detox), which contains psyllium, flax, pectin, bentonite clay, and charcoal.\n\n## Epsom Salts, Clay Baths, and Hot & Cold Hydrotherapy\n\nEpsom salts and clay baths help to pull toxins from the body while  they cleanse the skin and unclog pores to allow more toxins to flow out.  Hot and cold hydrotherapy increases blood flow throughout the body. Hot  water pushes and increased blood flow to the skin’s surface while cold  water drives the blood deep to the core.\n\nAlternating hot and cold water brings fresh blood with oxygen and  nutrients to the organs and glands and carries away toxins and  pathogens. Dr. Shillington suggests starting with water as hot as you  can stand for a minimum of two minutes. Then turn off the hot water for  two minutes of cold—the colder the better. Alternate back and forth for a  total of 20 minutes, ending with cold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.organiclifestylemagazine.com/issue/17-how-to-detoxify-and-heal-from-vaccinations-for-adults-and-children](https://www.organiclifestylemagazine.com/issue/17-how-to-detoxify-and-heal-from-vaccinations-for-adults-and-children)",

    "body": "Krave Beauty Kale-Lalu-yAHA \n\nExfoliation can be such a fickle, fickle skincare step. Understanding what type of exfoliating ingredients your skin might need, at what percentage, and how often can be an exhausting process.\n\nEven after playing with different products for a couple of years...I still find myself accidentally over-exfoliating. That ended up being the case with the Krave Beauty Kale-Lalu-yAHA. \n\nFIrst things first, this exfoliating fluid is a lovely thin and watery texture which makes it easy to apply/swipe on using a cotton pad. While a watery acid based toner isn’t that hard to come by...it’s the Kale-Lalu-yAHA’s lack of stickiness or residue that impressed me.\n\nFrom there...5.25% glycolic acid goes to work in removing dead skin cells, reducing dark spots, and all of the other wonderful benefits that AHA products provide. Krave takes it a bit further by including aloe for hydration/soothing, plus a farmers market worth of antioxidant rich greens.\n\nMy first application of this product did include a slight tingling, but it faded rather quickly. The next morning I was stunned to see skin that was noticeably brighter and refined...Kale-Lalu-yAHA works quickly! All of this without irritation...so I made the mistake so many of us make by adding it to my routine every other day.\n\nThis turned out to be way too much for my skin and after that first week or so my skin was feeling raw, looking red, and generally pissed. Luckily I had some great soothing products to turn to and was able to regain control fairly quickly (Beauty of Joseon Calming Serum and Centella Sheet Masks).\n\nEven though this amazing AHA product is fairly gentle and packed with skin supporting ingredients...it is still potent enough to approach with a bit of caution and ease. Once a week or even once every other week might be just fine for some, while others will want to bump the frequency up as they go.\n\nFor me, I’ll be sticking to twice a week with a couple/few days off in between. The last few weeks with this toner have been amazing now that I have a rhythm down and it really has become one of my favorite AHA toners/fluids.\n\nI don’t know why I assumed Krave/Liah Yoo would release an exfoliation product that might be less powerful than some others I have used/geared towards ultra-sensitive skin...but it seems they aren't playing around lol! \n\nFull Ingredients List: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Water, Butylene Glycol, Brassica Oleracea Acephala Leaf (Kale) Extract, Glycolic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Spinacia Oleracea (Spinach) Leaf Extract, Carum Petroselinum (Parsley) Extract, Chlorella Minutissima Extract, Malus Domestica Fruit (Green Apple) Extract, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Betaine Salicylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Pseudozyma Epicola/Camellia Sinensis Seed Oil/Glucose/Yeast Extract Ferment Filtrate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Bacillus/Folic Acid/Soybean Ferment Extract, Coptis Japonica Root Extract, Malachite Extract, Polysorbate 80, Disodium EDT\n\nWhere To Buy (Krave Beauty Site - $25.00 USD - 200ml): [https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/kale-lalu-yaha](https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/kale-lalu-yaha)",

The  decreased  size  of  micro  emulsion  was  increasing  the  release  rate  of  drug  this  is  may  be  due  to decreased size and increase in surface area\n\nso the final formula, giving micelles of about 100nm is:\n\n - Pioglitazone hydrochloride : 45 mg\n\n - oleic acid : 84 mg\n\n - polysorbate 80 : 224 mg\n\n - propylene glycol : 252mg\n\nthis is the 45% and 40%, switched around (possible typo, as table 2 changed the order table 4).\n\nany volunteer to try and see the effect on hips?

Recent studies have suggested a link between the expression of the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHr) and adipogenesis in the orbital tissues of patients with TAO [6, 7]. Specifically, the activation of PPAR-γ by its agonist, TZD, was shown to stimulate functional TSHr expression, and also to induce the recruitment and differentiation of orbital fibroblasts into mature lipid-laden adipocytes [7–9]. This potential for preadipocyte differentiation is shared with abdominal subcutaneous tissue. Other studies have shown that the expression of PPAR-γ was greater in adipose and connective tissue from patients during the active stages of TAO [10, 11]. These results suggest that TSHr expression in orbital fibroblasts may be linked to adipogenesis, and that the activation of the PPAR-γ, such as by TZD, may play an important role in the stimulation of adipogenesis and the pathogenesis of TAO.",

        "body": "A friend pointed me to this very interesting spanish study:\n\nTopical Pioglitazone Nanoformulation for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis: Design, Characterization and Efficacy in Hairless Mouse Model \n\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/12/3/255/htm\n\nIt's using a different recipe to use TZD against contact dermatitis, with histologic analysis providing great diffusion: even if the micelles were a bit big the pH was well matched for the skin: \"PGZ-NE had a pH value of 5.23. The mean droplet size was 158.30 ± 4.67 nm with a PI value of 0.28 ± 0.06. \"\n\n> Capryol 90 was selected as the oil phase, Labrasol as surfactant, Transcutol-P as cosurfactant, and water as the aqueous phase. Labrasol and Transcutol-P (Smix) were used at the ratio 1:2\n\n> Labrasol and Transcutol-P (Smix) were used at the ratio 1:2. To determine the boundaries of diagram, oil and Smix were mixed at the ratios from 9:1 to 1:9 (w/w) while water was added to each mixture by titration method until turbidity or phase separation. PGZ-NE (1 mg/mL) was prepared by incorporating PGZ in oil phase under stirring at 700 rpm for 15 min, after which Labrasol and Transcutol-P were incorporated by continuous stirring for 20 min. Finally, the solution of Pluronic F127 dissolved in water was added under the same condition of stirring for 15 min.\n\n> Final formulation of PGZ-NE (Table 2) was obtained by incorporating PGZ in Capryol 90 (8%), Labrasol (19%), Transcutol-P (38%), water (17%), and Pluronic F127 (18%). The addition of the triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 into NE was an uncomplicated process thanks to its amphiphilic nature, which allowed it to form a homogeneous mixture with oil, surfactant and cosurfactant of the NE.\n\nTable 2 says:\n\n> Pioglitazone (1 mg/mL)\t\n\n> Capryol 90 (propylene glycol monocaprylate),\t8%\n\n> Labrasol (caprylocaproyl polyoxyl-8 glycerides)\t19%\n\n> Transcutol-P (diethylene glycol monoethyl ether)\t38%\n\n> Water\t17%\n\n> Pluronic F127 (Poloxamer 407)\t18%\n\nAs for skin flux, it's not great but decent:\n\n> After 46 h of assay, an amount of 187 µg of PGZ was released from the NE, representing 93.5% of the drug placed in the donor compartment\n\n> The evaluation by HPLC of the aliquots extracted from the receptor compartment showed that PGZ did not permeate through human skin and thus the permeation and prediction parameters could not be calculated. However, PGZ was found inside the skin showing a high retention value of 478.08 µg/g skin/cm2\n\nfor 46h, this means a pale 10 ug/cm2/h while the study mentionned here stupidly using Carmomer 934 got micelles of 166 nm, and 47 ug/cm^2/h\n\nThis may be why they mostly got local effects: to reach the subcutaneous fat layer, we may need a different microemulsion providing a greater skin flux:\n\n> Ex vivo permeation studies showed that the drug is retained in the tissue without reaching the receptor compartment, thereby demonstrating that PGZ-NE could be successfully used to achieve a local effect in the skin without adverse systemic effects. The high amount of PGZ retained inside the skin (478.08 µg/g skin/cm2) indicates that the drug can cross the SC, which is the limiting step in the permeation process from topical formulations. Consequently, it is possible to reach an effective drug concentration in the target area\n\n> This can be attributed to the properties of Transcutol-P (polar solvent) and Capryol 90 (non-polar solvents), whose combination in the formulation could result in synergetic skin penetration enhancement due to the fact that Transcutol-P increases drug solubility in the stratum corneum (SC), whereas Capryol 90 favors the diffusion of drug in the SC [30]. Additionally, Pluronic F127 enhances the diffusion ability of drug thanks to its amphiphilic structure which allows it to act as a surfactant and interact with biological membranes [31,32].\n\n\nRemoving F127 could be a good idea, as its amphiphilic nature may prevent further diffusion, and as it was mostly included for the feelz lolol:\n\n> This nanoformulation exhibited improved consistency by the incorporation of Pluronic F127, resulting in a fluid that is aesthetically acceptable, pleasant to the touch, physically stable, and has Newtonian behavior, which allows for easy administration by spray or roll-on.",

    "body": "🤚ATTENTION‼️For over 15 hours I have researched and assessed the safety of the excipients included in the available vaccines for COVID-19. Including: Pfizer-BioNTech (mRNA), Moderna (mRNA) and Janssen/Johnson & Johnson (viral vector). I have made EXTREMELY important findings and it is imperative that I share them with The People. \nNote: I am releasing this information to help everyone make their OWN- independent, informed decision regarding their personal health.\n\nTo adequately assess the safety regarding vaccines, one needs to become familiar with the ingredients in vaccines and relate those ingredients to (a) Public health debacles caused by the same toxic environmental exposures, and (b) Recently evolving notions of disease causation in vague syndromes such as CFS(chronic fatigue syndrome). \n\nFirst, you need to understand that many vaccines including the controversial HPV Gardasil 4 and 9 vaccines contain an ingredient known as ‼️POLYSORBATE 80 It is added as a surfactant and emulsifier. \nPS 80 is a sorbitan compound, but the manufacturing process to produce PS 80 also produces an end product in the soup mixture known as sorbitol. Sorbitol makes the final PS 80 product cloudy. In order to render the vaccine clear and colorless, sorbitol is removed from PS 80 by adding amorphous silica (silicon dioxide) and \n‼️ORGANOSILOXANES (organosilicones). \nOrganosiloxanes, with their artificial silicon carbon bonds that NEVER occur in any living organism on earth, are also a mission impossible for humans to deal with. The toxicity of organosiloxanes is now a proven reality and is DIRECTLY responsible for the multiple ailments, specifically in women suffering from the novel entity known as “silicone gel-filled breast implant toxicity.” \n\nThis toxicity has nothing to do with autoimmunity, but rather involves disruption of more than TWO DOZEN biochemical processes in the body. As an example, one of the degradation products of organosiloxanes is silicic acid, which readily crosses the BLOOD-BRAIN barrier and chelates neurotransmitters such as dopamine. Cognitive dysfunction is the outcome. \n\nSilanols (another degradation product of organosiloxanes) can biointegrate into the proteoglycan matrix macromolecule receptor for acetylcholine, thereby causing unchecked activity of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system (and hence, palpitations, or rapid heartbeat). Silanols can readily donate a methyl group to any accumulated mercury already present in one's body, thereby synthesizing methylmercury (a vastly more toxic compound). Enhanced DNA methylation can also easily occur, thereby altering epigenetic factors that create disturbances in gene expression and the production of autoantibodies and cytokines. Latent viruses that one has acquired during his or her lifetime can be reactivated by a similar toxicity mechanism adversely affecting viral epigenetic control.\n\nAn ISCOM (immune stimulating complex) is another ingredient in HPV vaccine materials, whose function is to enhance humeral and cellular immune responses to the antigens in question. ISCOMs contain ❗️SAPONINS, which are surfactants and emulsifiers indigenous to a variety of edible plants. Saponins are capable of causing intense foaming activity in aqueous solutions, which is desirable when they are added to soaps, shampoos and detergents. But when saponins are routinely utilized in BEER production, manufacturers add organosiloxanes to control the foaming activity. \n\nThere is a vast difference between ingestion of a toxin versus parenteral administration of a toxin. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has never required any consumer products containing organosiloxanes to have these compounds listed as ingredients on any labels (this applies to organic foods as well). This is because for decades physical chemists have brainwashed biochemists into believing that organosiloxanes are chemically and biologically inert, a premise that is now known to be completely untenable. Organosiloxanes and their degradation products also adversely affect enzyme functions (and thereby substrates and metabolites), as well as membrane permeability, neuronal transmission, and mitochondria(power house cells). With regard to mitochondria, oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transfer system are disrupted because silicon behaves like a METAL at times, thereby ALTERING electromagnetic fields. This leads to deficiencies in energy production and energy utilization plus impairment of the mitochondrial-mediated cell danger response to other environmental contaminants (such as pesticides, phthalates, etc.) \n\nOrganosiloxane-induced mitochondrial dysfunction can thus be viewed as \"the straw that broke the camel's back\" - it is analogous to one's house being on fire, but the fire engines cannot get there. Extracellular spillage of damaged mitochondrial organelles readily triggers activation of both innate and adaptive immunity, creating another secondary amplification loop. Organosiloxanes and their degradation products can biointegrate into life-sustaining matrix macromolecules, which then causes a host of biochemical disruptions.\n\nHEAVY METALS, such as platinum and rubidium, are utilized in the polymerization manufacturing process of organosiloxanes, and they do NOT fall out of the soup mixture at the end. A multitude of pathologic clinical phenomena are known to occur from excessive exposure to heavy metals.\nCervarix vaccine ingredients do not contain PS 80, but they do contain SODIUM DIHYDROGEN PHOSPHATE DIHYDRATE (SDPD), a pH buffer and emulsifier. SDPD is manufactured from sodium carbonate (soda ash), and purified sodium carbonate contains residues of silica (silicon dioxide). The true residual silica content of sodium carbonate can vary substantially depending on the assay used to measure it.\n\nSO, Why does HPV vaccine-induced illness encompass numerous overlapping clinical features described in patients with CFS/ME, FM, POTS, CRPS, SFN and AD!?\nBecause over 60,000 organosiloxane compounds have been synthesized in the past eighty years, and they now contaminate every worldwide environmental compartment. A recent publication has linked organosiloxane contamination to the ever-expanding reports of metabolic and biochemical disruptions inherent to vague syndromes like CFS/ME. The list of metabolic dysregulations and dysfunctional physiology in CFS/ME has now been expanded to include both transcriptome changes and hypothalamic dysfunction abnormalities that can easily be caused by the organosiloxane. Chronicity can easily become the norm for all of the above syndromes and illnesses due to (a) Organosiloxane interference with normal healing processes, and (b) The perpetuation of biochemical and epigenetic disruptions during cell division. Vaccine-induced illness exemplifies the fact that the complexity of nature far transcends man's ingenuity.\n\nI have attached evidentiary support of the ingredients/excipients in the 3 COVID vaccines.\nBut, let’s quickly point out these harmful ingredients I listed above:\n\n1. Pfizer-BioNTech: POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL, SODIUM DIHYDROGEN PHOSPHATE DIHYDRATE.\n\n2. Moderna: POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL [PEG] 2000\n\n3. The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19: POLYSORBATE-80 \n^ This vaccine makes the cells in the body create spike proteins. If your body can’t stop making these, this bombardment overloads the immune system, creates a cytokine storm and ultimately results in a break/disconnect between the parasymethietic and sympathetic nervous system-causing long hauler symptoms of COVID.\nhttps://youtu.be/SQztlqblgVI\n\nPEG has❗️NEVER❗️been used before in ANY approved vaccine, but it is found in many drugs that have occasionally triggered anaphylaxis. There are an increasing number of PEG-associated anaphylaxis case reports, many of which demonstrate clinical cross-reactivity with polysorbates. Most reported adverse events occurred on an apparent first exposure to a parenteral version of a specific-PEG-containing product. \n\nFDA approved vaccines vs. Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) shows two very different vaccine development processes (see attached photo). We the People are currently the experimental test subjects of these vaccines.\n\nhttps://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(20)31231-9/fulltext\\\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/suspicions-grow-nanoparticles-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-trigger-rare-allergic-reactions",

    "body": "After reading about milk fortification with vitamin A in one of Grant Genereux's books ([https://ggenereux.blog/my-ebooks/](https://ggenereux.blog/my-ebooks/)), I took a look into the milk pasteurization process and found some interesting tie-ins with seed oils.\n\nHere are some quotes from *Vitamin Fortification of Fluid Milk* ([https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1750-3841.13648](https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1750-3841.13648))\n\n>*Vitamin A can be found in significant amounts in unfortified whole milk because it is primarily associated with the fat phase of the milk at 37.7 IU per gram of fat (McBean and Speckmann 1988). However, milk fat removal results in vitamin A reduction in low-fat and skim milks. As demand for low-fat and skim milk products increased in the United States, there was a nutritional concern for reduction of vitamin A present in these products. This concern was addressed in the 1978 PMO (Public Health Service 1978), which required low-fat and skim milks to be fortified with vitamin A to the nutritional equivalence of the general milk standard-containing not less than 2000 IU per quart. Vitamin A fortification is optional for whole milk, but if added, the concentration must not be less than 2000 IU per quart.*  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>*In the United States, ... vitamin A is added as synthetic retinyl palmitate ... There are 2 different forms of vitamin premix: oil-based and water-dispersible ... Water dispersible vitamins are not water soluble, only oil soluble. An emulsifier (polysorbate) is added into the vitamin premix to make it water dispersible. ... Oil-based vitamin premix with corn oil as the carrier may be manufactured with commodity corn oil ... Vitamin premixes contain vitamin D3 and/or vitamin A palmitate in a carrier generally consisting of a combination of any of the following: sunflower oil, corn oil, water, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, and glycerol monooleate. ... The addition of vitamins usually occur after separation and fat standardization, and before pasteurization. Homogenization will then take place after pasteurization to allow the vitamins to be distributed evenly throughout the milk.*  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>*Retinyl palmitate is the ester of retinol and palmitic acid. The stability of added retinyl palmitate may be affected by heat, light, or the presence of acids which may cause degradation or conversion of 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal, resulting in lowered biological activity (Mousseron-Cadet 1971). Ultraviolet light causes isomerization and degradation of retinoid compounds in solution. Under more intense light, other transformations can take place such as dimerization or chemical reaction between 2 monomers of retinyl esters (Mousseron-Cadet 1971). In addition, large losses of vitamin A activity can occur during processing, transportation and storage of fortified foods (Dary and Mora 2002). ... prolonged heating of milk, butter, or butterfat at high temperatures in the presence of oxygen can decrease vitamin A activity.*  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>*Natural vitamin A in whole milk was more stable to light than added vitamin A due to natural vitamin A is found in milk fat globules whereas added retinyl palmitate is dispersed in the water phase of milk, which was more prone to oxidation due to greater contact with oxygen*   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>*The cascade of oxidation reactions \\[from exposure to light\\] lead to significant losses of vitamins (vitamin A, B2, C, D, and E)*  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>*light at wavelengths of 400 to 500 nm penetrated 40% to 50% deeper into skim milk than into whole milk. Measureable vitamin A losses occurred at 2, 4, and 16 hours at 2000 1× fluorescent light for nonfat, reduced fat, and whole milk, respectively (Whited and others 2002). Vitamin A losses were also distinct between fluorescent light and LED light exposure (Brotherson and others 2016).*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**To sum up:** when they remove fat from the milk, the milk becomes more watery. But, vitamin A -- which is toxic at too high a dose -- is fat-soluble. So, in order to add in the vitamin A, it is first mixed in -- you guessed it -- seed oils (corn or sunflower) and then mixed with the rest of the reduced fat milk. Next the milk is heated to kill bacteria (which is not good for either the seed oil or the vitamin A) and then the final milk product is usually stored in containers that allow light to pass through, which enables more oxidation (breakdown) reactions.\n\nAlso, the form of vitamin A used is retinyl palmitate -- a form that is (as I understand it) predisposed for storage. So, you've got the double-whammy of seed oil PUFAs that oxidize cell membranes carrying an easily stored form of vitamin A -- or, after heating and reacting to light, the vitamin A could be in the more dangerous form of retinoic acid.\n\nThere are dairy products that are usually not fortified, such as full-fat, plain varieties of milk, yogurt, heavy cream, and cheese. However, in North America, there are also other fortified foods, including many breads, flours, and breakfast cereals -- and, subsequently, any other products made from these items.\n\nInteresting, no?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the introduction of seed oils to food production and the fortification of foods like milk -- as well as other aspects of milk processing -- may be key factors in the rise of chronic conditions.

They are widely used in the food industry, for their gelling, thickening, and stabilizing properties.  It appears to be particularly destructive to the digestive system, triggering an immune response similar to that your body has when invaded by pathogens like Salmonella. The result: Carrageenan predictably causes inflammation, which can lead to ulcerations and bleeding. [Source](http://wellnessmama.com/2925/what-is-carrageenan/)\n\nPolysorbate 80 helps bind ingredients like oil and water to each other. It is made from polyethoxylated sorbitan (chemical compounds derived from the dehydration of sugar alcohol). There are studies showing that it has been linked to infertility in mice, accelerated the maturation of female rats and resulted in severe ovary deformities, and an increased risk of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, heart failure, and of tumor growth or recurrence in patients with certain types of cancer. A PubMed article studying polysorbate 80 said that it was a causative agent of a pregnant woman going into anaphylactic shock. In addition, studies have shown that it could be especially harmful to patients with Crohn’s disease. [Source](http://thegoodhuman.com/2012/05/31/what-is-polysorbate-80/)",

    "body": "[**The original post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/vaxxhappened/comments/a2jarw/ultimate_guide_to_provaxx_resources/) **got too large to actually be saved as a post, so I'm putting part of it into this post.**\n\n# Rebuttals\n\n***Here, I will make an argument against this article:*** [***thinkingmomsrevolution.com/scientific-proof-vaccines-cause-autism***](https://thinkingmomsrevolution.com/scientific-proof-vaccines-cause-autism/)\n\n>If vaccines *were* a truly  “free” way to avoid illness, there would be no controversy, plain and simple. Everyone would be on board.\n\nHow is that evidence? A lack of unanimity doesn't prove that one side is right.\n\n>The problem is that, as the number of recommended vaccines and vaccine doses has climbed in the last 30 years along with their concomitant serious adverse events...\n\nDo you have any trustworthy evidence about this? Show me an article from a trustworthy source (like a government website, organization website, or trusted news site) that shows this is happening.\n\n>So I’m just going to say this baldly:  \n>  \n>Vaccines do cause autism.\n\nUh, no they don't.\n\n>...there can be no other explanation for why the  “myth” has persisted.\n\nAre you forgetting the possibility that some people (you guys) are just idiots?\n\n>...justifying themselves with  “you can’t handle the truth.”\n\nI think they're trying to say here that the only evidence that pro-vaxxers have against anti-vaxxers are insults. This is extremely false, as pro-vaxxers actually have heaps of information to support their claims.\n\n>Those of us who think that vaccines come with some very serious risks that mean that everyone should be thinking long and deeply before taking *any* vaccine, on the other hand, actively share as much scientific and factual information as possible, while at the same time encouraging you to do further independent study on the subject.\n\nWow, this is ironic. Anti-vaxxers complaining pro-vaxxers don't do research. Pro-vaxxers do research. And it doesn't matter if you research little or lots, you'll get the same answer: VACCINES ARE GOOD FOR YOU.\n\n>Vaccines contain neurotoxic amounts of aluminum, which can cause brain damage.\n\nJust by eating, you consume 30-50 milligrams of aluminum every day. That is more aluminum than you get from a single shot.\n\n>A developing brain can be damaged when the immune system is activated by a vaccine. Immune activation has been researched extensively and is proven to cause autism and other brain damage.\n\nNone of this has any proof or evidence like it says it does. Plus, autism isn't something you can  “get\".\n\n>While it has long been known that acute infections such as prenatal rubella can cause autism...\n\nIt hasn't been “long known\" that infections of any kind can cause autism.\n\n>“Coincidentally,” the number of vaccine doses received by infants’ rapidly developing neurological systems has been increasing concomitantly with the autism rate.\n\nUh, yeah. It *is* a coincidence. The number of pirates has been drastically decreasing over the years, but that doesn't mean pirates prevent autism.\n\n>...this anonymous blogger has compiled scientific *proof* that vaccines can – and do – cause autism. That is huge so I’m going to say it again: ***scientific proof that vaccines do cause autism***.\n\nHonestly, an anonymous blogger doesn't seem like the best source of scientific information. Even if the information they have to present is valid, one blog or even ten can't disprove centuries of research and testing and thousands (and possibly millions) of papers and news articles.\n\n>Yours in anticipation,  \n>  \n>\\~Professor\n\nWow, this was written by a professor? Strange, because professors are supposed to be smart.\n\nIn conclusion, this article and honestly the entire website itself is completely wrong on the matters of vaccines. It shouldn't have the name of “The Thinking Mom's Revolution\" because it implies they're doing something they're not, which is thinking.\n\n***Here, I will make an argument against this post:*** [***redd.it/9sh1c4***](https://redd.it/9sh1c4)\n\nAll (if not a good portion) of the articles listed say there *may* be a link. Nothing definitive. Plus, there are few sources compared to the many in this post. Also, how could vaccines cause autism? It's a developmental disability, there's no way to catch it. Correlation also doesn't equal causation.\n\n***Here, I will make an argument (sort of) against this video:*** [***youtu.be/8rk7PM1uuqQ***](https://youtu.be/8rk7PM1uuqQ)\n\nHonestly, I don't need to say anything. Just watch [this video](https://youtu.be/5oU9WRuZvyU).\n\n***Here, I will make an argument (sort of) against this article:*** [***www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763***](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763)\n\nHonestly, [this article](https://respectfulinsolence.com/2017/11/29/christopher-exley-using-bad-science-to-demonize-aluminum-adjuvants-in-vaccines/) says it all.\n\n***Here, I will make an argument (sort of) against this video:*** [***youtu.be/\\_lo3Zny7WGE***](https://youtu.be/_lo3Zny7WGE)\n\nThis video isn't specifically about vaccines, it's about autism. But this video is from an anti-vaxx group who wants to say that autism is a bad thing. While it's pretty bad, it's not as bad as they portray it. Throughout the video, it's just low-functioning autistic people. This is an inaccurate autistic representation, as over half (two thirds) of autistic people are high-functioning. Also, I must say the video is rather disturbing and contains suggestive content involving minors.\n\n***Here, I will make an argument against this video:*** [**youtu.be/QsZbVg6vmVs**](https://youtu.be/QsZbVg6vmVs)\n\n>\"...are these safe?\"  \n>  \n>\"No, next question.\"\n\nYes, they are safe. There are mountains of evidence to prove it. Even if anti-vaxxers do have evidence, pro-vaxxers have 100× more.\n\n>\"Let's talk about the age there for a second, because that really is a big deal, because parents will say, 'Well, I don't remember getting a lot of vaccines when I was a kid.' and the truth of the matter is: you didn't. As recently as 1985 (so anyone born before only had three vaccines) there was DPT, which is diphtheria tetanus pertussis; MMR, which is measles-rubella and...uh...measles mumps and rubella and polio; that was it. There were three vaccines, now there’s sixteen, and there's multiple doses of all of those. So the difference is that at back then if you added up all those vaccine antigens (like MMR is three vaccine antigens with one shot, DPT is three vaccine antigens in one shot, polio actually has three viruses in it, so it's really three viruses in one shot) well, each one of those individual viruses are called 'antigens', and if you added up all the sum total of antigens that children got before 1985 if they got all thirty-three of those all of those vaccines, they got vaccine antigens injected into them by the time they started kindergarten up through 2010 they got 156 vaccine antigens and now there's been more vaccines added since then and so, it just goes on and on...\"\n\n(sorry about how long that was)\n\nShe's trying to make the argument that more antigens in vaccines are harmful. This is untrue, as the antigens are either:\n\n* killed\n* injured\n* dismantled\n\nThis renders them practically harmless, but they're still strong enough to conjure up an immune response. This is how vaccination works.\n\n>\"...there are milligram amounts of gelatin and the MMR, and in the chickenpox vaccine, there are 63 different types of chemicals in these vaccines. Now, not each vaccine has also 63 chemicals, but if you get all the vaccines, you get doses of 63 different types of chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens. Some are known to cause asthma a summer (note: I don't know what 'a summer' means in this context) that the list is endless...\"\n\nY'know, anti-vaxxers never have evidence of these things being in vaccines. I'd be happy if you showed me some actual evidence instead of spouting unfounded nonsense.\n\n>\"Mercury is mostly out of most of the vaccines, but it's not out of all of them. It's still in the multi-dose flu shots that we start giving infants at six months of age and we give them every year all the way through their life...\"\n\nThe mercury in vaccinations is ethyl mercury, which the body easily disposes of. However, there's another kind of mercury. This is methyl mercury, which is dangerous and can be found in tuna fish! (If you want to know why all the supposedly deadly ingredients in vaccines are there, click [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/vaxxhappened/wiki/basics#wiki_vaccine_ingredients). Click [this one](https://imgur.com/gallery/rbamoJW#VZtESl3) too.)\n\n>\"There's tons of aluminum, when I say tons I mean milligram amounts. I mean that's immeasurable amounts it's not trace little amounts.\"\n\nI'm not sure what this is talking about, but I will comment on aluminum in vaccines. Vaccines work by introducing your body to a weakened virus. This trains your immune system to fight off the real infection later on. Aluminum helps by causing a very minor inflammation in the area. This draws immune cells to the area, making the vaccine more effective. This might seem dangerous, but it really isn't. You consume more aluminum (compared to a single vaccine shot) just by eating food.\n\n(There was a bunch of garbage about mercury in vaccines, which I already talked about. I skipped most of that part.)\n\n>\"...stray viruses that are known to cause cancer...\"\n\n    404 evidence not found\n\n>\"…I think that most parents and even most physicians who've never bothered to read a package insert in their life…\"\n\nThe ingredients in vaccines are practically harmless.\n\n>\"…anybody who wants to debate me, I'm your girl…\"\n\n*OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO*\n\n(The rest was just her wrapping it up and making totally unfounded claims. I skipped it.)\n\n# Other Evidence\n\n**Vaccine Ingredient Information (6)**\n\n|**Ingredient**|**Why it's safe**|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aluminum|The aluminum in vaccines causes a very minor irritation where the vaccine is injected. This causes a stronger immune response, increasing the effectiveness of the vaccine. This amount is safe because you consume more aluminum from eating in an entire day then getting a shot. (things like these are called \" adjuvants\")|\n|Thimerosal (Mercury)|The mercury in vaccines (ethyl mercury) is safe and is easily passed through the body. Methyl mercury, however, is dangerous. It can be found in tuna. Thimerosal is also a preservative. u/EndMeetsEnd says: Under Thimerosal (Mercury) the following clarification may be beneficial: \"Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines do not and never did contain thimerosal. Varicella (chickenpox), inactivated polio (IPV), and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have also never contained thimerosal. Influenza (flu) vaccines are currently available in both thimerosal-containing (for multi-dose vaccine vials) and thimerosal-free versions.\" From CDC website: [www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html)|\n|Formaldehyde|Formaldehyde is used to weaken viruses in vaccines. The amount used is less than the amount a normal body processes in an entire day.|\n|Beta-Propiolactone ([u/TomHitchy](https://www.reddit.com/user/TomHitchy))|BP is an organic compound, colorless, highly reactive and is highly soluble in water. It's vapor form is irritating but the liquid form is carcinogenic. It is used to treat influenza and is dosed in 2-1000 micrometers (1000 micrometers = 1mm). For the lowest dose to have an effect was 5ppm (0.005g/kg) via the inhalation of rat which had turmorgenic effect. The other tests showed the next one being 40mg/kg to have an effect. So the low dose would not have an effect on the individual. **Sources:** [**pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Oxetanone#section=Top**](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Oxetanone#section=Top)**;** [**www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24140008**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24140008)**;** [**pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Oxetanone#section=NIOSH-Toxicity-Data&fullscreen=true**](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Oxetanone#section=NIOSH-Toxicity-Data&fullscreen=true)|\n|Gentamicin Sulfate & Polymyxin B ([u/TomHitchy](https://www.reddit.com/user/TomHitchy))|This can easily be avoided already by consulting on doctor to see if you child is allergic to these. Both these chemicals are antibiotics used in vaccinations and other things like surgical equipment. Gentamicin is only used in one vaccine, influenza, at a mega dose of <0.00015 mg. Polymyxin B is used in 5 vaccines: Influenza (<0.011 mg), Polio (0.00025 mg), Diptheria, tetanus, pretussis, polio (<0.00000001 mg, <0.00000004 mg, <0.00000001 mg). **Source:** [**www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/antibiotics**](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/antibiotics)|\n|Viral DNA ([u/TomHitchy](https://www.reddit.com/user/TomHitchy))|From what I've found, they are not a common ingredient inside vaccines like polio, measles etc. It is a developing vaccine which could be potentially used for chronic infections. There should be no issue at all for the individuals' DNA. **Source:**  [**www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15906276**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15906276)|\n|Glutaraldehyde ([u/TomHitchy](https://www.reddit.com/user/TomHitchy))|Glutaraldehyde is a disinfectant used to sterilize hospital equipment. Found in the diptheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine in doses of <50ng (nanograms). If you are exposed to <1ppm = 1mg/L through inhalation or skin contact irritation and mucus. Higher dosages would be required to be needed to be considered dangerous.|\n|Latex Rubber ([u/TomHitchy](https://www.reddit.com/user/TomHitchy))|It ain't an ingredient but they include it. Latex rubber is used for the tip of syringes. Regarding with if you're allergic to latex it can be administered if the benefits outweighs the risks. Also there was a study of 28 people regarding with the reactions, only 2 needed to be hospitalized. **Source:** [**vaxopedia.org/2016/09/25/latex-allergies-and-vaccines**](https://vaxopedia.org/2016/09/25/latex-allergies-and-vaccines/)|\n|Peanut & Soybean Oil ([u/TomHitchy](https://www.reddit.com/user/TomHitchy))|Anti-vaxxers say it's linked to nut and soy allergies, so they say that vaccines cause allergies. The only way you are at risk of allergies are if your family has had a history of allergies, are a child or have asthma or other similar conditions. Foods can be a trigger for allergies but are not a cause. **Source:** [**www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/allergies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351497**](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/allergies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351497) (though I have heard peanut oil isn't in vaccines at all)|\n|Human & Animal Cells ([u/TomHitchy](https://www.reddit.com/user/TomHitchy))|Anti-vaxxers say how vaccines have aborted babies' DNA, pig and horse blood, dog kidneys, cow hearts, monkey kidneys, chick embryos, calf serum, sheep blood. They also say it causes leukemia and diabetes. These aborted fetal cells are from elective termination of pregnancies in the 1960s. They are not inside the vaccine, but are used to help create the viruses. These two embryonic cells have been kept in a laboratory for years, so we won't need new sources. Most of the animal DNA is used to help grow viruses and are not used in a vaccine. Diabetes has no known cause and they won't cause leukemia. **Sources:** [**www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/fetal-tissues**](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/fetal-tissues)**;** [**vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients#human-cell-strains**](http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients#human-cell-strains)|\n|Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) ([u/TomHitchy](https://www.reddit.com/user/TomHitchy))|Anti-vaxxers say that it is linked to birth defects, developmental delays, and infertility. As well as being banned in Europe. Regarding being banned, it's a gray area. The FDA says it can be included just has to be included on the label. MSG is the sodium salt for glutamic acid. Glutamic acid naturally occurs in tomatoes, grapes, cheese, mushrooms, and other foods. There have been anecdotal reactions from MSG in food including headaches, flushing, sweating, facial pressure, numbness in face and neck, heart palpitations, chest pain, nausea, and weakness although studies have found that there is no link between MSG and those issues. Although a small percentage of people may experience a small reaction. It is found in only two vaccines: adenovirus and influenza. **Source:** [**www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/monosodium-glutamate/faq-20058196**](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/monosodium-glutamate/faq-20058196)**;** [**www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/goes-vaccine**](https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/goes-vaccine/)|\n|Neomycin Sulphate ([u/TomHitchy](https://www.reddit.com/user/TomHitchy))|Anti-vaxxers say it interferes with B6 absorption which leads to epilepsy and brain damage. Allergic reactions which can be mild to life threatening. Neomycin is an antibiotic used to reduce the risk of infection during surgeries on the bowel. Neomycin is used to prevent germs from growing and are usually removed from the final vaccine. B6 is found in many foods and helps with protein metabolism along with other body functions. Vitamin B6 deficiency leads to dermatitis and glossitis, depression, confusion and weakened immune system. No signs of epilepsy or brain damage. Babies only need 0.1 mg from birth to 6 months. This can be easily achieved from any food, as they supply the recommended amount or more. **Sources:** [**vaxopedia.org/2016/09/11/neomycin-in-vaccines**](https://vaxopedia.org/2016/09/11/neomycin-in-vaccines/)**;** [**ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-HealthProfessional**](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-HealthProfessional/)|\n|Phenol ([u/TomHitchy](https://www.reddit.com/user/TomHitchy))|Anti-vaxxers say it is used as anti-freeze, toxic to all cells, and can destroy the immune system. Phenol is an organic compound used in household items like disinfectants and mouthwash. It was also the first antiseptic used in surgery in 1865. When it was used, the mortality rate dropped from 45% to 15%. Phenol is also used for explosives like picric acid, drugs like aspirin. It also found naturally in tyrosine (an amino acid in proteins), adrenaline, a hormone, serotonin in a neurotransmitter and urushiol. **Source:** [**www.britannica.com/science/phenol**](https://www.britannica.com/science/phenol)|\n|Polysorbate 80 ([u/TomHitchy](https://www.reddit.com/user/TomHitchy))|Anti-vaxxers say it causes cancer in animals, many autoimmune diseases, and infertility. Polysorbate 80 is an emulsifier used in foods and cosmetic products. There are only 50 micrograms inside of a typical vaccine, in comparison to an ice cream scoop (1/2 cup) which has 170,000 micrograms. The effects of polysorbate are irritations in the skin and other places. It is found to cause cancer in animals, but not humans. **Sources:** [**www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients**](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients)**;** [**toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+4359**](https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+4359)|\n|Tributyl Phosphate ([u/TomHitchy](https://www.reddit.com/user/TomHitchy))|Anti-vaxxers say it is potentially toxic to the kidneys and nervous system. Breathing TDP causes irritation and mucus. If its prolonged there, it can poison and paralyze. If it comes into contact with skin, then it can cause irritation. It may also cause irritation on the eyes, nose, and throat. The low doses in vaccines would not be dangerous. **Source:** [**toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+1678**](https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+1678)|\n\n**Rebuttals to Common Anti-Vaxx Arguments (4)**\n\n|**Anti-Vaxx Argument**|**Pro-Vaxx Rebuttal**|\n|:-|:-|\n|I don't want vaccines because they're not natural! Natural remedies are always better. *(The Natural Argument)*|While some natural things are good and some artificial things are bad, not everything's that way. Poison oak and tornadoes are bad, and computers and modern medicine are good. This logical fallacy is [appeal to nature](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-nature).|\n|God and Jesus will protect my baby, no vaccines needed.|While I'm not saying you should never pray for your baby and their health, you'll need more than prayer to cure disease. God isn't going to make your baby perfectly healthy every time they get sick. Heck, God doesn't make everything perfect right after or soon after things go wrong. Humans need to actually help the situation in order for it to get better.|\n|VACCINES ARE EVIL! THEY'RE FROM THE DEVIL AND THEY'RE PLAYING GOD!|Vaccines are actually something God would support. Vaccines prevent many deaths, and refusing to give your child life-saving medication (like vaccines) would be killing if they died. Even if they don't die, it's still making a decision that might not kill, but almost certainly harm. God doesn't want people to die, as we can see in not one, but two verses:  \"Do not commit murder.\" (Exodus 20:13 NIRV); \"Do not commit murder.\" (Deuteronomy 5:17 NIRV)  The Bible is also against harming people: \"Don't eat meat if it will cause your brothers and sisters to fall. Don't drink wine or do anything else that will make them fall.\" (Romans 14:21 NIRV)|\n|What's so bad about measles anyway? It's just a week of rashes!|Measles can kill. According to [www.vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/diseases/measles/index.html), serious cases of measles can lead to brain damage and death. Also, the [World Health Organization's Website](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles) states, \"...in 2017, there were 110 000 measles deaths globally, mostly among children under the age of five.\" So, measles is much more than a week of rashes.|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thank you to the people who contributed:**\n\n* [u/Abandon](https://www.reddit.com/user/Abandon)\n* [u/brswitzer](https://www.reddit.com/user/brswitzer)\n* [u/chickensauce843](https://www.reddit.com/user/chickensauce843)\n* u/EndMeetsEnd\n\n**A special mention to** [**u/TomHitchy**](https://www.reddit.com/user/TomHitchy)**, who is responsible for most of the table** \"**Vaccine Ingredient Information**\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt will grow and grow until the pro-vaxxers have enough evidence to convince even the most stubborn of anti-vaxxers.

They literally give that stuff to lab rats to make IBD rats so that they can do experiments on them.  I'm going on 4 years of medication free remission from Crohn's fwiw. \n\nI just had a friend quit carnivore after giving it a try for a couple months but the entire time she was eating a bunch of chemical laced meats, sauces etc, and then when \"carnivore didn't work\" for her she gave up on it.  I'm not even a carnivore purist and have no problem with people eating fruit, macadamia nuts, coffee etc, but those chemicals have to go.  I'd rather eat an organic backyard blueberry than a Costco chicken full of emulsifiers. \n\nGet these poisons out of your diet. \n\nHere is an AI summary of carrageenan studies for reference:\n\nYes, animal studies have shown that carrageenan, a common food additive, can promote inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in rodents. Carrageenan can have harmful effects on the intestines, including: \n\n* Intestinal microflora: Carrageenan can change the gut microbiota, reduce bacterial diversity, and increase intestinal permeability, which can contribute to \"leaky gut\" syndrome. \n* Mucous barrier: Carrageenan can degrade the mucous barrier. \n* NF-kB pathway: Carrageenan can activate the pro-inflammatory nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) pathway. \n* Intestinal inflammation: Carrageenan can trigger intestinal ulceration and inflammation",

    "body": "One of the reasons I got into DIY is that I want to make a hydrating gel. I have enjoyed using products like [Nature Republic Aloe Vera 92% Soothing gel](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8362108069.html) and [SNP Bird's Nest 90% Soothing gel](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_81ee197906.html) and want to make my own customised version. \n\nI chose Carbomer (and related products) because it is used in both these products and many other gels in the market. I know there is also [AVC](http://www.lotioncrafter.com/aristoflex-avc.html) but I don't see it used quite as much. The main advantage of carbomer over other thickeners like xanthan gum and cellulose derivatives is that it can form very viscous gels at very low concentrations and give a clean feel with no stickiness at all. For example, the recipe below with 0.4% carbomer is much thicker than a 1.0% HEC gel and feels much better on my skin. A 1.0% carbomer gel is so thick that it becomes difficult to mix in other ingredients.\n\nI used 940 because it is the cheapest, the other varieties are at least double the price. I have seen 940 used in various commercial aloe gels so I thought it *might* work with aloe 100x powder since I already had success gelling the aloe powder up with [Sepigel 305](http://www.personalformulator.com/wvss/product_info.php?cPath=27&products_id=1273), which has similar ingredient limitations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBear in mind this is a test batch recipe that I half expected to fail but ended up being quite satisfactory, so some of the procedures are a bit mixed up and the total is not 100%. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Phase A**\n\nwater 40%\n\ncarbomer 940 0.4%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Phase B**\n\nwater qs to 95-100%\\*\n\nPropylene glycol 5%\n\nNiacinamide 5%\n\nAloe 100x powder 0.4%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Phase C**\n\nLicorice Extract (alcohol based) 5%\n\nLiquid Germall Plus 0.5%\n\nTriethanolamine 0.4 - 0.6%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\\* Leave some room for pH adjustment and fragrance addition.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Hydrating carbomer**\n\nFor this part I didn't heat and hold but boiled the water beforehand and let it cool down to room temperature. I added a light layer of carbomer powder, let it wet and stirred it in, as described [here](http://skinchakra.eu/blog/archives/236-Working-with-Carbomer-Part-II.html). I did't use a hot water bath because that was too unwieldily. \n\nThe carbomer will take 1-4 hours to hydrate, stir occasionally during this period. The final solution should be somewhat cloudy with no visible particles/lumps in it. From what I read on Chemist Corner, if you don't disperse the carbomer properly, you can have what is called a fish-eye problem: lumps of unneutralised carbomer (which is acidic and irritant) in the final product. This is probably more of a problem when you scale up production, but just be careful anyway.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHeat and hold B at 70C for 20 minutes. Mix with A. Let cool to 40C, add in licorice extract, preservative and mix well. I added other ingredients before neutralising to ensure more even distribution. \n\nAdd the TEA in a few stages. I've seen recommendations of 1:1.5 carbomer:TEA but my supplier says 1:1 so thats where I started. Mix well and test the pH. Add more TEA if necessary, and have some citric acid solution handy. If you over neutralize and end up with a pH too high(>8), the gel structure will collapse. Here I used 0.4% TEA and my final pH was about 6.\n\nYou can use 18% KOH or NaOH solution to neutralise as long as you don't have too much alcohol in your recipe. Ratio of carbomer:base should be 1:2.7 and 1:2.3 respectively, as given by the manufacturer. Handle all alkalis with care and wear appropriate protective gear.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Optional Phase D: Solubilizer + Fragrance*\n\nThis is one where I need more experimentation. In this batch, after I made everything up to 100%, I found the product surprisingly usable apart from [the smell](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/4sbc4l/the_no_question_is_stupid_chat_thread/d5epjhb). I ended up adding a few drops of Polysorbate 80 and tea tree oil to mask the smell, but stupidly didn't measure the weight so I can't give the exact percentage. I think if you stick to a low percentage (not more than 3-5% total), you shouldn't have problems with separation as the gel will help stabilise the suspension. For more information about solubilisers, please read [Susan's blog](http://swiftcraftymonkey.blogspot.hk/search/label/solubilizers).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The product**\n\nA [photo](http://imgur.com/sAi66PQ) of the gel next to a plant extract toner thickened with 0.5% HEC. The gel is thick enough to suspend air bubbles, but not so thick that it cannot be pumped. It is cloudy due to the addition of polysorbate 80 and tea tree oil. On the skin it feels lightweight just like the two gels I mentioned above. I am satisfied with the consistency and skin feel of this product, but I will try to improve the smell and cloudiness next time I make it. I would also probably add some more humectants to make it more hydrating.\n\n*Edited 24/08*: I read [from the manufacturer](https://www.lubrizol.com/Life-Science/Documents/Pharmaceutical/Bulletins/Bulletin-21---Formulating-Semisolid-Products.pdf) that you should neutralise before you add PEG compounds.\n\n>Complexation with Other Ingredients — Proteins, povidone, polyethylene glycol and\npolyethoxylated surfactants might form a complex with unneutralized Carbopol® polymers. In order to prevent the complexation, these ingredients should be added to the partially neutralized dispersion.",

    "body": "# Introduction\n\nWelcome to the pharmacology research guide.\n\nI frequently get asked if I went to college to become adept in neuroscience and pharmacology (even by med students at times) and the answer is no. In this day and age, *almost* everything you could hope to know is at the touch of your fingertips.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, college is great for some people, but everyone is different. I'd say it's a prerequisite for those looking to discover *new* knowledge, but for those whom it does not concern, dedication will dictate their value as a researcher and not title.\n\nThis guide is tailored towards research outside of an academy, however some of this is very esoteric and may benefit anyone. If you have anything to add to this guide, please make a comment. Otherwise, enjoy.\n\nNote: This is a repost of the [original ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/138hous/a_fast_track_to_learning_pharmacology/)guide that was written two years ago. I'm posting this again as people tend to gloss over the pinned posts in the subreddit.\n\n# Table of contents\n\nBeginners research/ basics\n\n**I - Building the foundation for an idea**\n\n* Sparking curiosity\n* Wanting to learn\n\n**II - Filling in the gaps (the rabbit hole, sci-hub)**\n\n* Understand what it is you're reading\n* Finding the data you want\n* Comparing data\n\n**III - Knowing what to trust**\n\n* Understanding research bias\n* Statistics on research misconduct\n* Exaggeration of results\n* The hierarchy of scientific evidence\n* International data manipulation\n\n**IV - Separating fact from idea**\n\n* Challenge your own ideas\n* Endless dynamics of human biology\n* Importance of the placebo effect\n* Do not base everything on chemical structure\n* Untested drugs are very risky, even peptides\n* \"Natural\" compounds are not inherently safe\n* Be wary of grandeur claims without knowing the full context\n\nAdvanced research\n\n**I - Principles of pharmacology (pharmacokinetics)**\n\n* Basics of pharmacokinetics I (drug metabolism, oral bioavailability)\n* Basics of pharmacokinetics II (alternative routes of administration)\n\n**II - Principles of pharmacology (pharmacodynamics)**\n\n* Basics of pharmacodynamics I (agonist, antagonist, receptors, allosteric modulators, etc.)\n* Basics of pharmacodynamics II (competitive vs. noncompetitive inhibition)\n* Basics of pharmacodynamics III (receptor affinity)\n* Basics of pharmacodynamics IV (phosphorylation and heteromers)\n\n# Beginners research I: Building the foundation for an idea\n\n**Sparking curiosity:**\n\nCommunities such as this one are excellent for sparking conversation about new ideas. There's so much we could stand to improve about ourselves, or the world at large, and taking a research-based approach is the most accurate way to go about it.\n\nSome of the most engaging and productive moments I've had were when others disagreed with me, and attempted to do so with research. I would say wanting to be right is essential to how I learn, but I find similar traits among others I view as knowledgeable. Of course, not everyone is callus enough to withstand such conflict, but it's just a side effect of honesty.\n\n**Wanting to learn:**\n\nWhen you're just starting out, Wikipedia is a great entry point for developing early opinions on something. Think of it as a foundation for your research, but not the goal.\n\nWhen challenged by a new idea, I first search \"\\[term\\] Wikipedia\", and from there I gather what I can before moving on.\n\nWikipedia articles are people's summaries of other sources, and since there's no peer review like in scientific journals, it isn't always accurate. Not everything can be found on Wikipedia, but to get the gist of things I'd say it serves its purpose. Of course there's more to why its legitimacy is questionable, but I'll cover that in later sections.\n\n# Beginners research II: Filling in the gaps (the rabbit hole, sci-hub)\n\n**Understand what it is you're reading:**\n\nGoogle, google, google! Do not read something you don't understand and then keep going. Trust me, this will do more harm than good, and you might come out having the wrong idea about something.\n\nIn your research you will encounter terms you don't understand, so make sure to open up a new tab to get to the bottom of it before progressing. I find trying to prove something goes a long way towards driving my curiosity on a subject. Having 50 tabs open at once is a sign you're doing something right, so long as you don't get too sidetracked and forget the focus of what you're trying to understand.\n\n**Finding the data you want:**\n\nFirst, you can use Wikipedia as mentioned to get an idea about something. This may leave you with some questions, or perhaps you want to validate what they said. From here you can either click on the citations they used which will direct you to links, or do a search query yourself.\n\nGenerally what I do is google \"\\[topic\\] pubmed\", as pubmed compiles information from multiple journals. But what if I'm still not getting the results I want? Well, you can put quotations around subjects you explicitly want mentioned, or put \"-\" before subjects you do not want mentioned.\n\nSo, say I read [a source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2882689/) talking about how CB1 (cannabinoid receptor) hypo- and hyperactivation impairs faucets of working memory, but when I google \"CBD working memory\", all I see are studies showing a positive result in healthy people (which is quite impressive). In general, it is always best to hold scientific findings above your own opinions, but given how CBD activates CB1 by inhibiting FAAH, an enzyme that degrades cannabinoids, and in some studies [dampens AMPA signaling](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32805354/), and [inhibits LTP formation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10061329/), we have a valid line of reasoning to cast doubt on its ability to improve cognition.\n\nSo by altering the keywords, I get the following result:\n\n[Example 1 of using google to your advantage](https://preview.redd.it/cixm9y0ts41f1.jpg?width=320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ba8a67ecd08261e90f1f4ad39d44e55c4667693)\n\nIn this study, CBD actually impaired cognition. But this is just the abstract, what if I wanted to read the full thing and it's behind a paywall? Well, now I will introduce sci-hub, which lets you unlock almost every scientific study. There are multiple sci-hub domains, as they keep getting delisted (like sci-hub.do), but for this example we will use sci-hub.se/\\[insert DOI link here\\]. Side note, I strongly suggest using your browser's \"find\" tool, as it makes finding things so much easier.\n\n[Example of where to find a DOI link](https://preview.redd.it/h83i81bus41f1.jpg?width=320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aafea56333fcdb66775a79c64dd03acbcbedb7e2)\n\nSo putting [sci-hub.se/10.1038/s41598-018-25846-2](https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/s41598-018-25846-2) in our browser will give us the full study. But since positive data was conducted in healthy people and this was in cigarette users, it's not good enough. However, changing the key words again I get this:\n\n[Example 2 of using google to your advantage](https://preview.redd.it/oirh7l10t41f1.jpg?width=320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86635dfd7bd72f2caf17efb915d098bdd88560b1)\n\n**Comparing data:**\n\nNow, does this completely invalidate the studies where CBD improved cognition? No. What it does prove, however, is that CBD isn't *necessarily* cognition enhancing, which is an important distinction to make. Your goal as a researcher should always to be as right as possible, and this demands flexibility and sometimes putting your ego aside. My standing on things has changed many times over the course of the last few years, as I was presented new knowledge.\n\nBut going back to the discussion around CBD, there's a number of reasons as to why we're seeing conflicting results, some of the biggest being:\n\n1. Financial incentive (covered more extensively in the next section)\n2. Population type (varying characteristics due to either sample size, unique participants, etc.)\n3. Methodology (drug exposure at different doses or route of administration, age of the study, mistakes by the scientists, etc.)\n\nOf course, the list does not end there. One could make the argument that the healthy subjects had different endogenous levels of cannabinoids or metabolized CBD differently, or perhaps the different methods used yielded different results. It's good to be as precise as possible, because the slightest change to parameters between two studies could mean a world of difference in terms of outcome. This leaves out the obvious, which is financial incentive, so let's segue to the next section.\n\n# Beginners research III: Knowing what to trust\n\n**Understanding research bias:**\n\nStudies are not cheap, so who funds them, and why? Well, to put it simply, practically everything scientific is motivated by the idea that it will acquire wealth, by either directly receiving money from people, or indirectly by how much they have accomplished.\n\nThere is a positive to this, in that it can incentivize innovation/ new concepts, as well as creative destruction (dismantling an old idea with your even better idea). However the negatives progressively outweigh the positives, as scientists have a strong incentive to prove their ideas right at the expense of the full truth, maybe by outright lying about the results, or even more damning - seeking only the reward of accomplishment and using readers' ignorance as justification for not positing negative results.\n\n**Statistics on research misconduct:**\n\nTo give perspective, I'll quote from [this](https://www.biochemia-medica.com/en/journal/27/3/10.11613/BM.2017.030201) source:\n\n>The proportion of positive results in scientific literature increased between 1990/1991 reaching 70.2% and 85.9% in 2007, respectively.\n\nWhile on one hand the progression of science can lead to more accurate predictions, on the other there is significant evidence of corruption in literature. As stated [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167876019302818?via%3Dihub), many studies fail to replicate old findings, with psychology for instance only having a 40% success rate.\n\n[One scientist](https://retractionwatch.com/2018/04/10/caught-our-notice-researcher-who-once-threatened-to-sue-retraction-watch-now-up-to-19-retractions/) had as many as 19 retractions on his work regarding Curcumin, which is an example of a high demand nutraceutical that would reward data manipulation.\n\nBy being either blinded by their self image, or fearing the consequence of their actions, scientists even skew their own self-reported misconduct, as demonstrated [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685008/):\n\n>1.97% of scientists admitted to have fabricated, falsified or modified data or results at least once –a serious form of misconduct by any standard– and up to 33.7% admitted other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about the behavior of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12% for falsification, and up to 72% for other questionable research practices. Meta-regression showed that self reports surveys, surveys using the words “falsification” or “fabrication”, and mailed surveys yielded lower percentages of misconduct. When these factors were controlled for, misconduct was reported more frequently by medical/pharmacological researchers than others.\n\n**Exaggeration of results:**\n\nLying aside, there are other ways to manipulate the reader, with one example being the [study in a patented form of Shilajit](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/and.12482), where it purportedly increased testosterone levels in healthy volunteers. Their claim is that after 90 days, it increased testosterone. But looking at the data itself, it isn't so clear:\n\n[Data used as evidence for Shilajit increasing testosterone](https://preview.redd.it/v9r100c4t41f1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3217ed4622dee0f7d7ff10e91ba9267de60e5ec7)\n\nAs you can see above, in the first and second months, free testosterone in the Shilajit group had actually decreased, and then the study was conveniently stopped at 90 days. This way they can market it as a \"testosterone enhancer\" and say it \"increased free testosterone after 90 days\", when it's more likely that testosterone just happened to be higher on that day. Even still, total testosterone in the 90 days Shilajit group matched placebo's baseline, and free testosterone was still lower.\n\nThis is an obvious conflict of interest, but conflict of interest is rarely obvious. For instance, pharmaceutical or nutraceutical companies often conduct a study in their own facility, and then approach college professors or students and offer them payment in exchange for *them* taking credit for the experiment. Those who accept gain not only the authority for having been credited with the study's results, but also the money given. It's a serious problem.\n\n**The hierarchy of scientific evidence:**\n\nA semi-solution to this is simply tallying the results of multiple studies. Generally speaking, one should defer to this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/orsahg96t41f1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=974c0efd49d56a57bd59a9e82548a8ae6d67fb26\n\nWhile the above is usually true, it's highly context dependent: meta-analyses can have huge limitations, which they sometimes state. Additionally, animal studies are crucial to understanding how a drug works, and put tremendous weight behind human results. This is because, well... You can't kill humans to observe what a drug is doing at a cellular level. Knowing a drug's mechanism of action is important, and rat studies aren't that inaccurate, such in [this](https://sci-hub.se/https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt196235665) analysis:\n\n>68% of the positive predictions and 79% of the negative predictions were right, for an overall score of 74%\n\nFactoring in corruption, the above can only serve as a loose correlation. Of course there are instances where animals possess a different physiology than humans, and thus drugs can produce different results, but it should be approached on a case-by-case basis, rather than dismissing evidence.\n\nAs such, rather than a hierarchy, research is best approached wholistically, as what we know is always changing. Understanding something from the ground up is what separates knowledge from a mere guess.\n\nAlso, while the above graph does not list them, influencers and anecdotes should rank below the pyramid. The placebo effect is more extreme than you'd think, but I will discuss it in a later section.\n\nConsider rat to human dosage conversions as well, which again, aren't to fully best trusted as any drug or substance can be metabolized and have varying degrees of effect despite the estimated human to rat dose conversion. Rat to human dose conversions are mg/kg x (7/37) x human kg (60kg standard). Mouse to human is mg/kg x (3/37) x human kg. For other animal species, revert to this: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804402/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804402/)\n\n**International data manipulation:**\n\nAnother indicator of corruption is the country that published the research. As shown [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3608538/), misconduct is abundant in all countries, but especially in India, South Korea, and historically in China as well. While China has since made an effort to enact laws against it (many undeveloped countries don't even have these laws), [it has persisted](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.341.6145.445) through bribery since then.\n\n# Basic research IV: Separating fact from idea\n\n**Challenge your own ideas:**\n\nImagining new ideas is fun and important, but creating a bulletproof idea that will survive criticism is challenging. The first thing you should do when you construct a new idea, is try to disprove it.\n\nFor example, a common misconception that still lingers to this day is that receptor density, for example dopamine receptors, can be directly extrapolated to mean a substance \"upregulated dopamine\". But such changes in receptor density are found in both drugs that increase dopamine and are known to have tolerance (i.e. meth), or suppress it somehow (i.e. antipsychotics). I explain this in greater detail in [my post on psychostimulants](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/t4r9h1/the_complete_guide_to_dopamine_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\n**Endless dynamics of human biology:**\n\nThe reason why the above premise fails is because the brain is more complicated than a single event in isolation. Again, it must be approached wholistically: there are dynamics within and outside the cell, between cells, different cells, different regions of cells, organs, etc. There are countless neurotransmitters, proteins, enzymes, etc. The list just goes on and on.\n\n**Importance of the placebo effect:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u7oqgmhgt41f1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=adabdfb423348e9e2e17f9fe0642584fba1d5b99\n\nAs you may already know, a placebo is when someone unknowingly experiences a benefit from what is essentially nothing. Despite being conjured from imagination, it can cause statistically significant improvement to a large variety of symptoms, and even induce neurochemical changes such as an increase to dopamine. The fact that these changes are real and measurable is what set the foundation for modern medicine.\n\nIt varies by condition, but clinical trials generally report a 30% response to placebo.\n\nIn supplement spheres you can witness this everywhere, as legacies of debunked substances are perpetuated by outrageous anecdotes, fueling more purchases, thus ultimately more anecdotes. The social dynamics of communities can drive oxytocinergic signaling which makes users even more susceptible to hypnotism, which can magnify the placebo effect. Astroturfing and staged reviews, combined with botted traction, is a common sales tactic that supplement companies employ.\n\nOn the other hand there's nocebo, which is especially common amongst anxious hypochondriacs. Like placebo, it is imagined, but unlike placebo it is a negative reaction. It goes both ways, which is why a control group given a fake drug is always necessary. The most common 'nocebos' are headache, stomach pain, and more, and since anxiety can also manifest physical symptoms, those experiencing nocebo can be fully immersed in the idea that they are being poisoned.\n\n**Do not base everything on chemical structure:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1cw999rht41f1.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe6939f0afb2fc2a4d907edae5415c119205a673\n\nWhile it is true that drug design is based around chemical structure, with derivatives of other drugs (aka analogs) intending to achieve similar properties of, if not surpass the original drug, this is not always the case. The pharmacodynamics, or receptor affinity profile of a drug can dramatically change by even slight modifications to chemical structure.\n\nAn example of this is that Piracetam is an AMPA PAM and calcium channel inhibitor, phenylpiracetam is a nicotinic a4b2 agonist, and methylphenyl-piracetam is a sigma 1 positive allosteric modulator.\n\nHowever, even smaller changes can result in different pharmacodynamics. A prime example of this is that Opipramol is structured like a Tricyclic antidepressant, but behaves as a sigma 1 agonist. There are many examples like this.\n\nI catch people making this mistake all the time, like when generalizing \"racetams\" because of their structure, or thinking adding \"N-Acetyl\" or \"Phenyl\" groups to a compound will just make it a stronger version of itself. That's just not how it works.\n\n**Untested drugs are very risky, even peptides:**\n\nWhile the purpose of pharmacology is to isolate the benefits of a compound from any negatives, and drugs are getting safer with time, predictive analysis is still far behind in terms of reliability and accuracy. Theoretical binding affinity does not hold up to laboratory assays, and software frequently makes radically incorrect assumptions about drugs.\n\nAs stated [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325638/), poor safety or toxicity accounted for 21-54% of failed clinical trials, and 90% of all drugs fail clinical trials. Pharmaceutical companies have access to the best drug prediction technology, yet not even they can know the outcome of a drug in humans. This is why giving drugs human trials to assess safety is necessary before they are put into use.\n\nAlso, I am not sure where the rumor originated from, but there are indeed [toxic peptides](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29468976/). And they are not inherently more selective than small molecules, even if that is their intention. Like with any drug, peptides should be evaluated for their safety and efficacy too.\n\n**\"Natural\" compounds are not inherently safe:**\n\nLack of trust in \"Big Pharma\" is valid, but that is only half of the story. Sometimes when people encounter something they know is wrong, they take the complete opposite approach instead of working towards fixing the problem at hand.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j1fivzejt41f1.png?width=1268&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fc2304f8de361358309ee457826495d5ae89bfa\n\nBut if you thought pharmaceutical research was bad, you would be even more revolted by nutraceutical research. Most pharmaceuticals are derived from herbal constituents, with the intent of increasing the positive effects while decreasing negatives. Naturalism is a regression of this principle, as it leans heavily on the misconception that herbal compounds were \"designed\" to be consumed.\n\nIt's quite the opposite hilariously enough, as most biologically active chemicals in herbs are intended to act as pesticides or antimicrobials. The claimed anti-cancer effects of these herbs are more often than not due to them acting as low grade toxins. There are exceptions to this rule, like Carnosic Acid for instance, which protects healthy cells while damaging cancer cells. But to say this is a normal occurrence is far from the truth.\n\nThere are numerous examples of this, despite there being very little research to verify the safety of herbals before they are marketed. For instance [Cordyceps Militaris](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3595709/) is frequently marketed as an \"anti-cancer\" herb, but runs the risk of nephrotoxicity (kidney toxicity). The damage is mediated by oxidative stress, which ironically is how most herbs act as antioxidants: through a concept called hormesis. In essence, the herb induces a small amount of oxidative stress, resulting in a disproportionate chain reaction of antioxidant enzymes, leading to a net positive.\n\nA major discrepancy here is bioavailability, as miniscule absorption of compounds such as polyphenols limit the oxidative damage they can occur. Most are susceptible to phase II metabolism, where they are detoxified by a process called conjugation (more on that later). Chemicals that aren't as restricted, such as Cordycepin (the sought after constituent of Cordyceps) can therefore put one at risk of damage. While contaminates such as lead and arsenic are a threat with herbal compounds, sometimes the problem lies in the compounds themselves.\n\nAnother argument for herbs is the \"entourage effect\", which catapults purported benefits off of scientific ignorance. Proper methodology would be to isolate what is beneficial, and base other things, such as benefits from supplementation, off of that. In saying \"we don't know how it works yet\", you are basically admitting to not understanding why something is good, or if it is bad. This, compounded with the wide marketability of herbs due to the FDA's lax stance on their use as supplements, is a red flag for deception.\n\nAnd yes, this applies to extracts from food products. Once the water is removed and you're left with powder, this is already a \"megadose\" compared to what you would achieve with diet alone. To then create an extract from it, you are magnifying that disparity further. The misconception is that pharmaceutical companies oppose herbs because they are \"alternative medicine\" and that loses them business. But if that was the case then it would have already been outlawed, or restricted like what they pulled with NAC. In reality what these companies fight over the most is other pharmaceuticals. Creative destruction in the nutraceutical space is welcomed, but the fact that we don't get enough of it is a bad sign.\n\n**Be wary of grandeur claims without knowing the full context:**\n\nMarketing gimmicks by opportunists in literature are painstakingly common. One example of this is Dihexa: it was advertised as being anywhere from 7-10,000,000x stronger than BDNF, but to this day I cannot find anything that so much as directly compares them. Another is Unifiram, which is claimed to be 1,000x \"stronger\" than Piracetam.\n\nThese are egregious overreaches on behalf of the authors, and that is because they cannot be directly compared. Say that the concentration of Dihexa in the brain was comparable to that of BDNF, they don't even bind to the same targets. BDNF is a Trk agonist, and Dihexa is c-Met potentiator. Ignoring that, if Dihexa did share the same mechanism of action as BDNF, and bound with much higher affinity, that doesn't mean it's binding with 7-10,000,000x stronger activation of the enzyme-linked/tyrosine kinase receptor. Ignoring that, and to play devil's advocate we said it did, you would surely develop down syndrome.\n\nLikewise, Unifiram is far from proven to mimic Piracetam's pharmacodynamics, so saying it is \"stronger\" is erroneously reductive. Piracetam is selective at AMPA receptors, acting only as a positive allosteric modulator. This plays a big role in it being a cognitive enhancer, hence my excitement for TAK-653. Noopept is most like Piracetam, but even it isn't the same, as demonstrated in [posts prior](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/123tn9i/a_guide_to_the_novel_nootropics_listed_to/), it has agonist affinity. AMPA PAMs potentiate endogenous BDNF release, which syncs closely with homeostasis; the benefits of BDNF are time and event dependent, which even further cements Dihexa's marketing as awful.\n\n# Advanced research I: Principles of pharmacology (Pharmacokinetics)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tfkd8crkt41f1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b11ba0e2f84fd03271b2a62f99b5197bd3dfa11\n\n**Basics of pharmacokinetics I (drug metabolism, oral bioavailability):**\n\nCompared to injection (commonly referred to as ip or iv), oral administration (abbreviated as po) will lose a fraction before it enters the blood stream (aka plasma, serum). The amount that survives is referred to as absolute bioavailability. From there, it may selectively accumulate in lower organs which will detract from how much reaches the blood brain barrier (BBB). Then the drug may either penetrate, or remain mostly in the plasma. Reductively speaking, fat solubility plays a large role here. If it does penetrate, different amounts will accumulate intracellularly or extracellularly within the brain.\n\nAs demonstrated in [a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/n8s2lq/the_oral_bioavailability_of_every_nootropic_84/), you can roughly predict the bioavailability of a substance by its molecular structure (my results showed a 70% consistency vs. their 85%). While it's no substitute for actual results, it's still useful as a point of reference. The rule goes as follows:\n\n>10 or fewer rotatable bonds (R) or 12 or fewer H-bond donors and acceptors (H) will have a high probability of good oral bioavailability\n\nDrug metabolism follows a few phases. During first pass metabolism, the drug is subjected to a series of enzymes from the stomach, bacteria, liver and intestines. A significant interaction here would be with the liver, and with cytochrome P-450. This enzyme plays a major role in the toxicity and absorption of drugs, and is generally characterized by a basic modification to a drug's structure. Many prodrugs are designed around this process, as it can be utilized to release the desired drug upon contact.\n\nAnother major event is conjugation, or phase II metabolism. Here a drug may be altered by having a glutathione, sulfate, glycine, or glucuronic acid group joined to its chemical structure. This is one way in which the body attempts to detoxify exogenous chemicals. Conjugation increases the molecular weight and complexity of a substance, as well as the water solubility, significantly decreasing its bioavailability and allowing the kidneys to filter it and excrete it through urine.\n\n[Glucuronidation example in the liver.](https://preview.redd.it/xl70eamlt41f1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd5d1ac822a52af170d1e8df24b887a1eeae5d60)\n\nConjugation is known to underlie the poor absorption of polyphenols and flavonoids, but also has interactions with various synthetic drugs. Glucuronidation in particular appears to be significant here. It can adaptively increase with chronic drug exposure and with age, acting almost like a pseudo-tolerance. While it's most recognized for its role in the liver and small intestines, it's also found to occur in the brain. [Nicotine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4752199/) has been shown to selectively increase glucuronidation in the brain, whereas [cigarette smoke](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9498235/) has been shown to increase it in the liver and lungs. Since it's rarely researched, it's likely many drugs have an effect on this process. It is known that bile acids, including beneficial ones such as UDCA and TUDCA stimulate glucuronidation, and while this may play a role in their hepatoprotection, it may also change drug metabolism.\n\nHalf life refers to the time it takes for the concentration of a drug to reduce by half. Different organs will excrete drugs at different rates, thus giving each organ a unique half life. Even this can make or break a drug, such as in the case of [GABA](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11595763/), which is thought to explain its mediocre effects despite crossing the BBB contrary to popular belief.\n\n**Basics of pharmacokinetics II (alternative routes of administration):**\n\nIn the event that not enough of the drug is reaching the BBB, either due to poor oral bioavailability or accumulation in the lower organs, intranasal or intraperitoneal (injection to the abdomen) administration is preferred. Since needles are a time consuming and invasive treatment, huge efforts are made to prevent this from being necessary.\n\nSublingual (below the tongue) or buccal (between the teeth and cheek) administration are alternative routes of administration, with buccal being though to be marginally better. This allows a percentage of the drug to be absorbed through the mouth, without encountering first pass metabolism. However, since a portion of the drug is still swallowed regardless, and it may take a while to absorb, intranasal has a superior pharmacokinetic profile. Through the nasal cavity, drugs may also have a direct route to the brain, allowing for greater psychoactivity than even injection, as well as faster onset, but this ROA is rarely applicable due to the dosage being unachievable in nasal spray formulations.\n\nHowever, due to peptides being biologically active at doses comparatively lower than small molecules, and possessing low oral bioavailability, they may often be used in this way. Examples of this would be drugs such as insulin or semax. The downside to these drugs, however, is their instability and low heat tolerance, making maintenance impractical. However, shelf life can be partially extended by some additives such as [polysorbate 80](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://doi.org/10.1517/17425240903199143).\n\nAnother limitation to nasal sprays are the challenges of concomitant use, as using multiple may cause competition for absorption, as well as leakage.\n\nTransdermal or topical usage of drugs is normally used as an attempt to increase exposure at an exterior part of the body. While sometimes effective, it is worth noting that most molecules to absorb this way will also go systemic and have cascading effects across other organs. Selective targeting of any region of the body or brain is notoriously difficult. The penetration enhancer DMSO may also be used, such as in topical formulations or because of its effectiveness as a solvent, however due to its promiscuity in this regard, it is fundamentally opposed to cellular defense, and as such runs the risk of causing one to contract pathogens or be exposed to toxins. Reductively speaking, of course.\n\n# Advanced research II: Principles of pharmacology (Pharmacodynamics)\n\n**Basics of pharmacodynamics I (agonist, antagonist, allosteric modulators, receptors, etc.):**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ovcxne6vt41f1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c449ac5225feb1eba4ffe11c5fbb0648de96a15d\n\nWhat if I told you that real antagonists are actually agonists? Well, some actually are. To make a sweeping generalization here, traditional antagonists repel the binding of agonists without causing significant activation of the receptor. That being said, they aren't 100% inactive, and don't need to be in order to classify as an antagonist. Practically speaking, however, they pretty much are, and that's what makes them antagonists. Just think of them as hogging up space. More about inhibitors in the next section.\n\nWhen you cause the opposite of what an agonist would normally achieve at a G-coupled protein receptor, you get an inverse agonist. For a while this distinction was not made, and so many drugs were referred to as \"antagonists\" when they were actually inverse agonists, or partial inverse agonists.\n\nA partial agonist is a drug that displays both agonist and antagonist properties. A purposefully weak agonist, if you will. Since it lacks the ability to activate the receptor as much as endogenous ligands, it inhibits them like an antagonist. But since it is also agonizing the receptor when it would otherwise be dormant, it's a partial agonist. An example of a partial agonist in motion would be Tropisetron or GTS-21. While these drugs activate the alpha-7 nicotinic receptor, possibly enhancing memory formation, they can also block activation during an excitotoxic event, lending them neuroprotective effects. So in the case of Alzheimer's, they may show promise.\n\nA partial inverse agonist is like a partial agonist, but... Inverse. Inverse agonists are generally used when simply blocking an effect isn't enough, and the opposite is needed. An example of this would be Pitolisant for the treatment of narcolepsy: while antagonism can help, inverse agonism releases more histamine, giving it a distinct advantage.\n\nA positive allosteric modulator (PAM) is a drug that binds to a subunit of a receptor complex and changes its formation, potentiating the endogenous ligands. Technically it is an agonist of that subunit, and at times it may be referred to as such, but it's best not to get caught up in semantics. PAMs are useful when you want context-specific changes, like potentiation of normal memory formation with AMPA PAMs. As expected, negative allosteric modulators or NAMs are like that, but the opposite.\n\nThere are different types of allosteric modulators. Some just extend the time an agonist is bound, while others cause the agonist to function as stronger agonists. Additionally, different allosteric sites can even modulate different cells, so it's best not to generalize them.\n\nReceptors themselves also possess varying characteristics. The stereotypical receptors that most people know of are the G-coupled variety (metabotropic receptors). Some, but not all of these receptors also possess beta arrestin proteins, which are thought to play a pivotal role in their internalization (or downregulation). They have also been proposed as being responsible for the side effects of opioid drugs, but [some research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898656820303831) casts doubt on that theory.\n\nWith G-coupled protein receptors, there are stimulatory (cAMP-promoting) types referred to as Gs, inhibitory types (Gi) and those that activate phospholipase C and have many downstream effects, referred to as Gq.\n\nThere are also ligand-gated ion channels (ionotropic receptors), tyrosine kinase receptors, enzyme-linked receptors and nuclear receptors. And surely more.\n\n**Basics of pharmacodynamics II (competitive vs. noncompetitive inhibition):**\n\n\"Real\" antagonists (aka silent antagonists) inhibit a receptor via competition at the same binding site, making them mutually exclusive. Noncompetitive antagonists bind at the allosteric site, but instead of decreasing other ligands' affinity, they block the downstream effects of agonists. Agonists can still bind with a noncompetitive antagonist present. Uncompetitive antagonists are noncompetitive antagonists that also act as NAMs to prevent binding.\n\nA reversible antagonist acutely depresses activity of an enzyme or receptor, whereas the irreversible type form a covalent bond that takes much longer to dislodge.\n\n**Basics of pharmacodynamics III (receptor affinity):**\n\nOnce a drug has effectively entered the brain, small amounts will distribute throughout to intracellular and extracellular regions. In most cases, you can't control which region of the brain the drug finds itself in, which is why selective ligands are used instead to activate receptors that interact desirably with certain cells.\n\nAt this stage, the drug is henceforth measured volumetrically, in uMol or nMol units per mL or L as it has distributed across the brain. How the drug's affinity will be presented depends on its mechanism of action.\n\nThe affinity of a ligand is presented as Kd, whereas the actual potency is represented as EC50 - that is, the amount of drug needed to bring a target to 50% of the maximum effect. There is also IC50, which specifically refers to how much is needed to inhibit an enzyme by 50%. That being said, EC50 does not imply \"excitatory\", in case you were confused. Sometimes EC50 is used over IC50 for inhibition because a drug is a partial agonist and thus cannot achieve an inhibition greater than 40%. EC50 can vary by cell type and region.\n\nLow values for Kd indicate higher affinity, because it stands for \"dissociation constant\", which is annoyingly nonintuitive. It assumes how much of a drug must be present to inhibit 50% of the receptor type, in the absence of competing ligands. A low value of dissociation thus represents how associated it is at small amounts.\n\nKi is specifically about inhibition strength, and is less general than Kd. It represents how little of a substance is required to inhibit 50% of the receptor type.\n\nSo broadly speaking, Kd can be used to determine affinity, EC50 potency. For inhibitory drugs specifically, Ki can represent affinity, and IC50 potency.\n\n**Basics of pharmacodynamics IV (phosphorylation and heteromers):**\n\n[Heteromers in the brain](https://preview.redd.it/z83hfhoqt41f1.jpg?width=1300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=236d7b3932fa8b232d44961f623d2c000c5595c4)\n\nSometimes different receptors can exist in the same complex. A heteromer with two receptors would be referred to as a heterodimer, three would be a heterotrimer, four a heterotetramer, and so on. As such, targeting one receptor would result in cross-communication between otherwise distant receptors.\n\nOne such example would be adenosine 2 alpha, of which caffeine is an antagonist. There is an A2a-D2 tetramer, and antagonism at this site [positively modulates D2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6306650/), resulting in a stereotypical dopaminergic effect. Another example would be D1-D2 heteromers, which are [accelerated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6971351/) by chronic THC use and are believed to play an important role in the cognitive impairment it facilitates, as well as motivation impairment.\n\nProtein phosphorylation is an indirect way in which receptors can be activated, occupied or functionally altered. In essence, enzymatic reactions trigger the covalent binding of a phosphate group to a receptor, which can produce similar effects to those described with ligands. One example of this would be Cordycepin [inhibiting hippocampal AMPA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6493540/) by acting as an adenosine 1 receptor agonist, while simultaneously [stimulating prefontal cortex AMPA receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4851261/) by phosphorylating specific subunits.\n\nNote: This is a repost of the [original ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/138hous/a_fast_track_to_learning_pharmacology/)guide that was written two years ago.

Known the vaccines don’t work\n2. Known they cause the diseases they are supposed to prevent\n3. Known they are a hazard to children\n4. Colluded to lie to the public\n5. Worked to prevent safety studies\n\nThose are the same vaccines that are mandated to children in the US.\n\nEducated parents can either get their children out of harm’s way or continue living inside one of the largest most evil lies in history, that vaccines – full of heavy metals, viral diseases, mycoplasma, fecal material, DNA fragments from other species, formaldehyde, polysorbate 80 (a sterilizing agent) – are a miracle of modern medicine.\n\nFreedom of Information Act filed in the US with the CDC by a doctor with an autistic son, seeking information on what the CDC knows about the dangers of vaccines, had by law to be responded to in 20 days. Nearly 7 years later, the doctor went to court and the CDC argued it does not have to turn over documents. A judge ordered the CDC to turn over the documents on September 30th, 2011.\n\nOn October 26, 2011, a Denver Post editorial expressed shock that the Obama administration, after promising to be especially transparent, was proposing changes to the Freedom of Information Act that would allow it to go beyond declaring some documents secret and to actually allow government agencies (such as the CDC) to declare some document “non-existent.”\n\nSimultaneous to this on-going massive CDC cover up involving its primary “health” not recommendation but MANDATE for American children, the CDC is in deep trouble over its decades of covering up the damaging effects of fluoride and affecting the lives of all Americans, especially children and the immune compromised. Lawsuits are being prepared. Children are ingesting 3-4 times more fluoride by body weight as adults and “[t]he sheer number of potentially harmed citizens — persons with dental fluorosis, kidney patients tipped into needing dialysis, diabetics, thyroid patients, etc — numbers in the millions.”\n\n[snip]\n\nThe link has a slow load, let me know if you want me to post the rest.\n\nHow does everyone react to this? I think 99% of us on this sub probably knew or had a very strong hunch that scheduled vaccines were full of unnecessary compounds. But now we have proof? Does this affect any of you? Will you prevent your child from getting 'mandatory' vaccines?\n\nDirect link: http://www.ecomed.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/3-tomljenovic.pdf ////Thanks to InspectorBloor",

There's no white cast and is easily blendable, giving a dewy finish.\n\nEven a while after application, your skin feels damp, as if it's sitting there on your skin. Inspite of that, It never pilled. Never faced any tanning.\n\nI never faced an experience to confirm this, but I doubt it's water resistant. On re-application, it wasn't as smooth as first application, but pretty much decent.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty satisfied with this Sunscreen, and it's something I would recommend to my friends.\n\n\n\n**WRP:** WRP, once I get over my skincare FOMO",

If  you're seeking an incredibly gentle chemical sunscreen then this could  be the one for you! \n\nBiore UV Kids Milk SPF 50 PA++++ is alcohol-free,  fragrance-free, water-proof, sweat-proof, coloring-free, zero white cast, and free of all common irritants/unnecessary ingredients. It's one of the only sunscreens that doesn't annoy my very sensitive,  acne-prone, easily reddened, and (currently) badly dehydrated face. It's never caused me to break out. Despite being water-resistant it washes off easily at the end of the day with a mild cleanser. This sunscreen *does* contain petrolatum, so if that's a  sensitivity of yours or an ingredient that you'd prefer to avoid, you may want to steer clear of this sunscreen. Personally, I don't find that it makes  the sunscreen feel greasy or heavy and it's never cause me to break out.  It leaves a delicate dewy coating on my face that I really like. The addition of petrolatum is invaluable for my dehydrated skin as I feel that it forms a slight occlusive barrier over my morning moisturizer to prevent TEWL as well as protecting my skin from the  sun.\n\nOriginally, I had tried the lauded Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence and while I desperately wanted to love it, sadly it wasn't meant to be. My facial skin loathes alcohol and fragrance, so I ended up re-purposing this sunscreen for my tougher arms and legs. The hunt for my HG sunscreen was on, until I discovered this lovely gem of Biore's.  \nThe Biore Kids Milk is available on Amazon in a cheerful-looking 90g yellow  bottle. It does take a while to arrive because of how far it has to  ship, but it's well worth the wait. I personally adore this sunscreen and will *never* be without it. I never thought I'd be able to say that I  look forward to applying sunscreen every day!\n\nUV filters used:  Octinoxate, Tinosorb S, Uvinul A Plus, and Uvinul T 150\n\nFull ingredients list:   Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, C12-15 Akyl Benzoate,   Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol   Mehtoxyphenyl Triazine, Glyceryl Behenate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl   Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Distearate, Sodium   Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Stearoyl Glutamic   Acid, Paraffin, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Ceresin, Isohexadecane, Arginine,   Lauryl Methacrylate/Sodium Methacrylate Crosspolymer, PEG-12   Dimethicone, Polysorbate 80, Dextrin Palmitate, Disodium EDTA, Agar,   Succinic Acid, BHT, Petrolatum, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol,   Methylparaben, Sodium Dehydroacetate",

I think the issue is I put my trust in the wrong places, but I’m just trying to navigate the world as best I can like everyone else. My sister always said I’m more gullible than I should be at my age - very suggestible is a nicer way to put it I think. My beliefs and convictions are like loose flower petals on a gusty day - they drift in whatever way the wind pushes them. One moment I’m floating east, the wind changes direction, and now I’m floating west. One day, I’ll believe in climate change, then I listen to a certain popular podcast, and now I think it’s a hoax. I know, it’s pathetic. I swear to God I’ll change if I can make it through this year, but I’ve exhausted my savings, and the pills are running out. I can hear them all skittering and slamming all around me, just out of sight, waiting for the effects of the medication to wear off.\n\nIt all started a few weeks ago. My life was unremarkable then, but at least it was normal. I had a cushy job at a local tech company, the same one I’ve had for the last five years. Reasonable hours, good benefits plan, 6 weeks of paid time off - I lived comfortably but noticeably alone. No wife, no girlfriend. I wasn’t born with a lot of charm. I was never very proficient at initiating pleasantries, and even if I did manage to start a conversation with a lady, I couldn’t find the words to maintain it. Of course, that would all be one thing if I was some hulking adonis, smooth and chiseled and all that - maybe then I could have compensated for my lack of a silver tongue. But I was never able to grow any muscle despite my efforts. I bought and tried a lot of different supplements that were supposed to help stimulate growth. Powders with names like “Muscle Matrix” and “Crazy Muscle”. They never did a damn thing, even put me in the hospital one time for kidney damage. Retrospectively, I should have also been working out while on those supplements. I wanted to wait until the supplements started having an effect before I began really working out.\n\nTerrible cystic acne was the icing on top. Red, painful craters had littered my face since I turned 16. Tried everything for that too - bee venom, reiki, power juicing. Nothing I was recommended online seemed to have the desired effect. And it all gave me the impression that I was utterly unworthy in comparison to other guys my age. I could feel myself starting to give up on a life that was more fulfilling than the one I already had, and on companionship in general. Then, I saw the ad pop on my Facebook page. It promised to fix me, and I fell for it. Hook, line, and sinker. \n\nIt read something like this:\n\n*Do you have trouble attracting women? Unable to catch a vixen’s eye from all the way at the other end of the bar? Does your mere presence in a room inspire overwhelming, knee-buckling repulsion from any potential mates? Before the modern age, there were no solutions. Lonely devils would go to their doctors, looking for salvation, only instead to be told there was nothing else to be done - Western Medicine cursing them to die alone. But we don’t live in the past, do we, dear friends? With major advancements in natural attraction technology, Lucius Bartleby, Ph.D., is proud to announce: Zygentra Ultimate, the miracle medication for the misbegotten common man. With Zygentra Ultimate, even the lowliest bachelor has hope for a happy ending. One pill is all it takes to change everything about you.* \n\nIn big, confident words, the bottom said:\n\n*One payment, one pill - one solution to the problem of you. Email* [*zygentraNOW@gmail.com*](mailto:zygentraNOW@gmail.com) *for details.*\n\nEven though the advertisement didn’t even mention what it would fix about me, I was intrigued. The ad had all the buzz words - “miracle”, “technology”, “happy ending”. Their distrust of Western Medicine hit close to home, too. As far as I was concerned, doctors were pill pushers controlled by pharmaceutical companies that pulled their marionette strings from the shadows. I mean, what was in the pills they recommended anyway? And for that matter, why can’t I pronounce half the compounds that make up vaccines? Thiomersal, Polysorbate 80 - I mean formaldehyde, for Christ’s sake. It all felt so artificial and unsafe. But this advertisement seemed to promote something more “of the earth” and \"organic\", the so-called “natural attraction technology”. Tired of being lonely and unworthy, I emailed the company. \n\nLike I said, hook, line, and sinker. Biggest mistake of my life.\n\nIn my message to the company, I tried to perform my due diligence in vetting the supplement. What was in it? How much was the supplement? Would it interact with the Chinese muscle-enhancing herbs I ordered the week before? \n\nThis was their response, copy-pasted from my Gmail:\n\n*Greetings Zach,*\n\n*Thank you for your interest in Zygentra Ultimate. One pill, one payment, one solution to the problem of you.* \n\n*To clarify, Zygentra is a medication, not a supplement - though no matter what you call it, it is a miracle. Through a proprietary mechanism of action that utilizes the wonders of CRISPR technology, Zygentra enables the human body to naturally self-regulate the hormonal disequilibriums that are to blame for a variety of male inequities: it can resolve poor muscle growth, weak libidos, erectile dysfunction, and a bevy of disfiguring skin conditions including but not limited to: seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, lichen planus simplex, and cystic acne.* \n\n*Unfortunately, the future is not always affordable, and it is rarely covered by insurance. Thankfully, this one-time cost can last upwards of a year, if not much longer. Zygentra essentially teaches your body to produce life-changing pheromones that are genetically transplanted from the naturally occurring Lepisma saccharium species. In short - one pill is all you need.* \n\n*Zygentra Ultimate can solve the problem of you with a one-time payment of 30,000 US dollars. We do not accept payment plans. Also, for obvious reasons, we recommend all of our clients relocate prior to taking their dose; Antarctica is preferable, but Northern Canada is a reasonable alternative.* \n\n*Please let us know if you are planning to pursue a happy ending. If so, we can help set up a wire transfer.* \n\n*Amy,*\n\n*Senior Sales Associate and Miracleworker at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals* \n\n\n\nI had to pick my jaw off the floor after I finished quickly scanning the email, skipping over the scientific mumbo-jumbo to find the price point. They seriously wanted me to pay 30,000 dollars, one lump sum, for this supplement. It wasn’t that I couldn’t afford the payment - I could, but barely, utilizing a nest egg my mom left for me after she passed. It was just an obscene amount of money. But it certainly was alluring - one pill that would fix my body, or I guess teach it to fix itself, naturally? Was that even possible? When I thought about it more, the exorbitant fee made it feel more legitimate, like I was paying for cutting-edge technology that actually could work. Wouldn’t the Better Business Bureau prevent a company from selling a product for much more than it was worth? Wasn’t that illegal? \n\nTo speed things up, I’ll skip the part where I contemplated my options, did a lot of online research, and signed a waiver that Amy mailed to me. Two weeks later, the singular pill arrived in an icebox as an overnight shipment from the Delfoy Pharmaceuticals headquarters. Amy told me they needed to keep it cold. \n\nIt wasn’t like any pill I had taken before. The supplement more resembled an extra-large piece of caviar - gelatinous and orb-shaped. The box had no instructions, so I shrugged my shoulders and ingested it, using a swig of the nearest open Mountain Dew to wash it down. Initially, I had some regrets about the purchase. But with it now in my system, that regret morphed into excitement.\n\nI was ready not to be alone anymore. \n\nNo big change the first few days. Maybe I really was a sap, I thought. But one morning, while looking in the mirror, I noticed it - my skin was clearing up like it never had before. More than that, I felt virile and confident, seemingly out of the blue. My muscles even began to look more toned. It was a state of being entirely new to me, and at first, it was incredible. I finally felt confident and like I was worthy of affection. Riding that sensation for all it was worth, I asked Stacy, an attractive coworker, on a dinner date. I had fantasized about asking her out for what seemed like my entire life. She said yes. The ecstasy I experienced after that moment was unparalleled. It was like some heavy, invisible weights had been taken off my shoulders. We planned a dinner date at a local Italian place later that week. With the supplement coursing through my veins, I felt unstoppable and was pleasantly surprised about the lack of side effects. I had experienced some new floaters in my peripheral vision and mild armpit pain, but that was it.\n\nAt first, the date was everything I could have hoped for. Stacy always had an aura of kindness about her - she was angelic, honestly. It’s what drew me towards her in the first place. Even though I secured the date, I was still nervous about my ability to keep up a conversation through the meal. To my surprise, it wasn’t difficult. Because I was different, improved by the supplement, I guess I just wasn’t as fearful of rejection anymore. As the date progressed, I was shocked to find out that Stacy had also been stockpiling the courage to ask me on a date:\n\n*“Over the last week? Since I started my new skin regimen, I mean.”* I said, choking on the last few words because I was never very good at lying. I didn’t want to scare Stacy off by volunteering the information that I had recently purged my bank accounts to pay for Zygentra. \n\nShe giggled, a cute and tiny laugh that made my heart swell with affection. I think she was under the impression that the part about the skin regimen was a playful joke. Then she said something that made my head spin:\n\n*“No, nothing to do with whatever new moisturizer you invested in. And a lot longer than just this week. For at least a year, I think. I always found you handsome, and you were always respectful and polite to me and everyone else in the office - a good sign of character. You were just quiet and reserved. I couldn’t tell if you’d say yes if I asked, so I never did. A bit childish and cowardly, I know, but sometimes I just feel small and out of place in the world, if that makes any sense.”* remarked Stacy, eyes diverting from mine while she made this confession.  \n\nHer words felt familiar - or maybe not her words; it was the way she put the words together. The underlying self-deprecation, I mean. She had some venomous monologue playing on loop in her head, just like I did. Broke my heart at first, and I wasn’t sure how to respond. But I noticed at that moment that I felt a little less lonely for the first time in my adult life. I smiled, met her eyes, and came up with the most ornate, reverent statement I could to comfort her and let her know I understood:\n\n*“You’re an absolute vision, Stacy. Like, you’re radiant. I’m sorry it’s hard for you to see it sometimes, but I really get that pain.”*\n\nThe expression on her face changed, now warm and relaxed, and I could tell I actually did manage to console her. I got lost in that moment then, in the beautiful comfort of it. Even as I type it up, I find myself getting lost in the memory of it. But something abruptly pulled me out of the moment then, and it’s the same thing that’s pulling me out of its memory now: terrible, skittering things on the outskirts of my vision. \n\nIn the restaurant, I was experiencing worsening floaters in my periphery, but I was too transfixed on Stacy to notice something was off - that maybe they weren’t just floaters. As our dessert arrived, I felt something vibrating in the sole of my dress shoe. It really gave me a start, and I reflexively stomped my right foot into the floor, surprising Stacy in turn. I took off my shoe to examine its contents, only to find the crushed body of a silverfish. Its greyish carapace was split into three asymmetric pieces from the force of my stomp. Each piece was still wriggling a little bit, and I felt nausea rise in my stomach. \n\nIt was bigger than any silverfish I’d ever seen before, too. In my experience, they never grew larger than an inch. This silverfish was easily 5 inches long, if not more. I could count at least 20 other, equally large silverfish crawling around in a wobbly circle, with me as the center. Before I killed the insect in my shoe, the other dinnergoers had noticed the bugs and were flagging down restaurant staff to complain. At first, I was with them - what kind of restaurant serves food with this type of infestation? It took the tickling, wriggling feeling of something crawling up my left pant leg to cause me to re-evaluate the situation. \n\nWildly, I made a circle with my thumb and index finger and tightened it around my knee, pushing down the length of my calf in an attempt to expel what I knew were more silverfish before they found their way higher up into my pants. When my palm first connected with my knee, I felt a sickening crunch under the tip of my index finger. The maneuver pushed out three silverfish in total, one headless from being caught in the crossfire of my hand meeting my knee. When I looked up, the restaurant was in a state of pandemonium. At that point, there were definitely more than 20, maybe 100 or 200, silverfish radiating in a circle around me. It finally registered - whatever was happening, I was the cause, and I hadn’t been experiencing floaters before - I was seeing silverfish skittering quickly around in my peripheral vision. \n\nI shot up from my chair, frightening Stacy again, accompanied by the sensation of another crunch in the shoe I hadn’t yet taken off. I said something to my date, couldn’t tell you what, and I excused myself from the table while moving towards the door. Outside in the parking lot, I began sprinting to my car with only one shoe on; but then I remembered that I had driven Stacy here. I briefly turned around to get her, but I could see gleaming silver little bullets racing to catch up to me on the asphalt, lit up by the sparkle of parking lot lights. I U-turned and sprinted even faster to my car, got in, and just started driving. After 15 minutes, I pulled over and urgently emailed Delfoy Pharmaceuticals from my phone. I wanted to know how to reverse the effects of Zygentra Ultimate.\n\nNot long after I parked, I began to see silverfish on the front windshield, leaking into the car through whatever cracks they could find. I floored it, but it was in a park, so I went nowhere. For the third time that night, I again felt the snap of their brittle bodies against my foot, having just crushed another two silverfish. A moment later, I felt one making its way up my left earlobe. I whipped my head to the right so hard that my neck would later be painfully sore, but the force managed to launch a silverfish off my ear to somewhere in the back of my Sudan. Putting the car in drive, I exploded down the country road I had parked on. I kept driving, killing silverfish as I went, till I heard the sound of an inbox notification come from my iphone, which was about two hours after I had sent the email:\n\n*Hello Zach,*\n\n*I am sorry to hear you are disappointed with our product. Unfortunately, there is no reversal agent for Zygentra Ultimate. I thought I made this very clear in our introductory email, and you did sign a release saying you understood the risk-benefit profile of the medication.* \n\n*To re-explain, Zygentra Ultimate utilizes CRISPR technology to give the human body the ability to produce pheromones from Lepisma saccharium, the most common species of silverfish in America. Laboratory studies have shown that these pheromones can help with male sexual dysfunction and certain skin conditions due to an anti-inflammatory effect. As you must know, pheromones are designed to attract members of the opposite sex of the species producing them. It is basically a big sign around an animal’s neck saying: “I am ready to mate”. This is why we recommend relocation to Northern Canada or Antarctica in conjunction with Zygentra Ultimate - these are some of the few areas in the world that Lepisma saccharium do not naturally inhabit.* \n\n*The medication is not reversible, however, because CRISPR is gene-editing technology - the reason your body “learns” to create the foreign hormones is because Zygentra Ultimate inserts the pheromone-producing silverfish DNA into your genetic code. How else would one pill cause an effect lasting a year or more? Additionally, the armpit pain you are experiencing is most likely the rapid growth of modified glandular tissue responsible for producing the silverfish pheromones.* \n\n*I still recommend considering physical relocation, I hear the Yukon is wonderful this time of year! The alternate solution would be to invest in Zygentra Plus, which can help mitigate some of the silverfish-attracting side effects of Zygentra Ultimate. We recognize that this is an emergency situation, and Defloy Pharmaceuticals is always willing to help where we can! We have urgently shipped a 48-hour trial supply of Zygentra Plus to your home, for free.* \n\n*Please consider your options and get back to us. If you would like to purchase additional Zygentra Plus, a week’s supply costs $750, with a 5 percent discount if you purchase the medication in bulk.*\n\n*Amy,*\n\n*Senior Sales Associate and Miracleworker at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals* \n\n\n\nWhen I received this email, I had a grand total of 3,500 dollars to my name. Desperation hit me like an avalanche, I felt like I was buried in an instant. A little under 4 grand was nowhere near the funds I would need to move from Miami to Northern Canada. Relocating would also force me to quit my job, and I didn’t want to leave Stacy behind. Retrospectively, I should have just used that money to move myself and my shitty car as far north as it would take me. \n\nWhen Zygentra Plus finally arrived five days later, I was beyond sleep-deprived. I had called out of work that week, as I certainly couldn’t come in and work on code as the fucking pied piper of silverfish. I spent that time driving around, stopping only when I felt myself drifting into sleep at the wheel. I would pull over to wherever I could and close my eyes, but before long, the sensation of silverfish crawling into my mouth or between my armpits would wake me up with a start, like I had jabbed myself with an adrenaline shot - at which point I would resume driving. No amount of insect repellant spray or mouse traps seemed to prevent the legion from getting to me. \n\nI hastily unpackaged the box containing the pro bono Zygentra Plus. The instructions on the supplement were: *take four pills by mouth every two hours*. Every two fucking hours. It did work at keeping the bugs away, but only if I religiously took the medication as instructed, which only served to minimally improve my sleep deprivation. I needed to return to work, but that ended up being a mistake, too. I had ditched Stacy on our first date without explanation and then proceeded not to talk to her for a week while I was driving around in circles, waiting for the Zygentra Plus to arrive. When she saw me again at work, I had dark circles around my bloodshot eyes the size of trash bags, and I nervously scanned my surroundings for silverfish. She said hello to me, and I don’t think I said hello back. Instead, I opted to launch into a minute-by-minute retelling of my last week. What I told her was an incoherent mess. Stacy nodded along politely to my tale, but I could see fear and concern rising in her eyes. Eventually, I gave her mercy, excused myself in the middle of a sentence, and pitifully returned to my desk. I dragged my body through about half of a workday before the side effects of Zygentra Plus started.\n\nOut of nowhere, I felt my mouth fill uncomfortably with saliva. When I tried to sip my morning coffee, dribble would involuntarily spill out of my mouth, down my chin and onto my shirt collar. Before long, I had a half-crescent of soaked fabric around my neck despite my efforts to keep my mouth closed at all times. Next, my eyes began watering uncontrollably, making it look like I was quietly sobbing all through the morning. The final straw was when I took my hand off my coffee cup, only to have a thin layer of palm skin remain stuck to the grip, peeling from my hand and causing immense and immediate pain. I screamed. And then, of course, there was a lot of bleeding. In a panic, I hastily left my desk without saying a word, no doubt leaving behind plenty of tears, saliva, skin and blood. My boss caught up and confronted me about my behavior before I could leave the building. I tried to say something, but saliva just erupted from my mouth instead. I probably looked rabid.\n\nI didn't come back to work the next day, or the following day. A few days after that, a message on my cellphone answering machine told me I was fired.\n\nAmy, resident miracle worker at Defloy Pharmaceuticals, wasn’t much help with the situation. I let her know that, although Zygentra Plus was helping keep the insects away, the side effects from it weren’t much more bearable. The excess saliva and tears were one thing, but pieces of my skin were sloughing off with the slightest manipulation like I was some human danish. And I still wasn’t sleeping - I needed to set multiple alarms to get myself up every two hours to take the new medication; otherwise, the silverfish would be back. She explained to me that this was expected, as Zygentra Plus acted as a low-dose insecticide that I was digesting and releasing into the air around me from my pores or what was left of them. At the brink of insanity, I demanded to speak with “Lucius Bartleby”, the supposed genius creator and mind behind the Zygentra line of products mentioned in the original advertisement. I thought maybe he would have an elegant solution to all of this. In response, Amy said, and I quote:\n\n*“Well, that will be impossible. Lucius Bartleby is more of an idea than a person. Here at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals, we all aspire to achieve the goals that Dr. Bartleby represents. Also, it seems to help with sales.”*\n\nBut don’t worry, she said, there was still something to be done - Amy theorized that drastically increasing my zinc levels might mitigate some of the symptoms from Zygentra Plus. I spent my last 500 dollars on that supplement, unsure of what I would do next, even if it did help. But I needed relief. Moreover, I needed to keep taking the pills because I was terrified of what would happen to me when I ran out, and the silverfish came back. My car was out of gas, my skin was breaking down, I was jobless and nearly out of money. If they returned, I would have limited defenses and nowhere to hide. I'm not particularly eager to think about what would happen to me.\n\nThe zinc supplement was a purple-reddish liquid that I was instructed to drink once a day. I voraciously gulped it down, immediately experiencing excruciating pain from my lips to deep in my chest. I would come to learn that the compound I drank, Zinc Hydrosulfide, is a very strong acid. I stared at the words “strong acid” in the email, dumbfounded, with blood and saliva dripping from my scalded mouth onto the screen. Amy then offered a subdermal injection to help me tolerate the Zinc Hydrosulfide, and I just started laughing. Must have been laughing for a while, because when my laughing slowed down I started to see silver floaters in my periphery again, meaning I was due for my next dose of Zygentra Plus.\n\nI could barely swallow the pills after what the liquid had done to my mouth and esophagus, almost passing out from the pain. Even if I had the money to pay for the 2,000-dollar subdermal injection, which I do not, I have no idea where I would even inject it into. Didn’t have much of a “dermis” left after the effects of Zygentra Plus, which had liberated me from a good portion of my skin. \n\nEffectively, I am now stuck. The acidic liquid that was supposed to help with the side effects from the pills has now prevented me from taking *any* pills, or at least has made it a great deal harder and more painful. The medication that would help me to tolerate the acidic liquid was no good either - the pills had dissolved the skin that it was supposed to be injected under. Perhaps most critically of all, I am now broke. \n\nThought about going to the hospital - some combination of fear and shame prevented me from doing that. Calling an ambulance may be my next move, but I’m not sure they can do anything for me now. The silverfish will find me no matter where I am, I’m sure there are plenty lurking unseen in the cracks and crevices of the hospital. Plus, who knows if the medications they'd give me would interact with the supplements.\n\nSo, with about 12 hours of my oral insecticide left, I have decided to throw a bit of a Hail Mary. Has anyone else taken Zygentra Ultimate before and knows how to reverse it? Or at least have a homeopathic remedy to help stop the bugs?\n\n  \nMore stories: [https://linktr.ee/unalloyedsainttrina](https://linktr.ee/unalloyedsainttrina)",

    "body": "TL;DR Foaming cleanser with Coco-Glucoside was too stripping. Started experimenting with the emulsion-cream formula (Sodium Polyacrylate, oils, Glycerin, surfactants/solubilizers) – better but still too strong. Got some random papules. Need help with a cleansing formula to make it less stripping but without residue that might contribute to acne. A simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe left a residue, got some papules and one nodule because of it.\n\nDetailed version:\n\nSince simple foaming cleanser with just 2.7% Coco-Glucoside (and less=no foam) was too stripping to my combo (oily-normal-dry) skin I started experimenting with non-foaming emulsion-cream formula.\n\nI used Sodium Polyacrylate (Cosmedia SP) as an emulsifier and thickener. 1-2%, then found that 2 was too much.\n\nI used some surfactants/solubilizers with it, usually Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate at 0.5-5%. 2-5% was too strong. Every time I tried to add Coco-Glucoside (with an additional thickener, like Xanthan Gum), it was too strong, usually, 4 uses and my skin was crying for help. Even with oils, which I describe below.\n\nThen I added some oils, usually caprylic/capric triglyceride or grapeseed oil. 2-5%. Anything below 5% was too strong. I wonder, maybe Cosmedia is just too good at emulsifying sebum on the face. I still want to use it because it feels great at distributing it on a wet face and it's easy to rinse off.\n\nSo it mostly looked something like this:\n\n* 4-5% Oils\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 0.5-2% Surfactants/solubilizers\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* Lactic acid to pH about 6.\n* Then I tried something simple like:\n* 4% Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n\nIt was still a little too strong, but sebum production lowered and my skin calmed down a little.\n\nNext, I tried something like this:\n\n* 2% Grapeseed oil\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 1.1% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 0.85% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 0.5% Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate\n\nToo strong. Added more oils to 5% total. It's better, but my dry areas are still tight (cheeks) and normal areas a little tight. And now I have a problem with 2-5 papules on oily areas (forehead).\n\nSo I'm not sure what could I change and what's causing inflamed pimples – maybe it's still too stripping or it's because of some PEG-7 residue? I read that it's a surfactant AND a refatener.\n\nSpeaking of residues – I tried to make a simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe:\n\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% BTMS-50\n* 2% Cetyl Alcohol\n* 0.5% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* 0.5% Glyceryl Stearate Citrate\n* 0.5% Hydroxyethylcellulose\n\nI used it like 4 times and didn't like it as it left a powdery residue (I think it's a BTMS and/or Cetyl Alcohol?) and I got some papules and one nodule. It was 16 days ago. I read that BTMS can break some people out badly, I wonder if maybe these papules that I've been getting lately was still because of a cleanser with BTMS that I used 4 times 2 weeks ago.\n\nI know it's not a place for acne, but I think it was important to mention it. I think most of my acne is because of just using too stripping cleansers and/or a residue of product.\n\nI am open to suggestions, I can replace Sodium Polyacrylate with something else, but it's hard to get some emulsifiers/solubilizers here in Poland so I'd like to use it.\n\nI use a simple cream after cleansing:\n\n* 5% Dimethicone 350 CST\n* 4% Betaine\n* 2% Sodium Polyacrylate - I think I'll lower it to 1-1.5% because it's a little too thick and it dries too quickly. Or maybe add something like Sorbitol?\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n\nHere's a list of emulsifiers/surfactants/solubilizers (except ingredients which I described above) which I can buy here I Poland:\n\n* Olivem 1000 - I'm afraid a little that it'll contribute to acne, even in a rinse-off product.\n* Creamy Base 1-1-3 *(Aqua, Glycerin, Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate, Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Trilaureth-4 phosphate, Lauryl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin)*\n* Self-emulsifying creamy base *(Glyceryl Stearate Citrate (and) Sucrose Stearate (and) Sucrose Distearate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Cocoate (and) Cetyl Alcohol (and) Sodium Ricinoleate)* \\- it contains Fatty Alcohol and I'm not sure if it contributed to acne or it was just BTMS.\n* Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate - the description says it needs to have 15-40% of oils to be stable, so I think it's not a good idea for a cleansing formula.\n* Glyceryl Monostearate - it needs to have pH >6.8\n* SLP *(Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate)*\n* Polysorbate 20, 80, 85\n* *Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate* \\- Again, Fatty Alcohol\n* Simulgel Thickener (Sodium Acrylate / Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer & Isohexadecane & Polysorbate 80) - maybe it would be a better option than just Sodium Polyacrylate\n   * Or this: Emulcold Extra (Sodium Acrylate; Acryloyldimethyl Taurate; Dimethylacrylamide Crosspolymer; Isohexadecane; Polysorbate 60)\n* Polawax (Emulsifying Wax NF)\n* Gosulin IL *(Isoamyl Laurate & Isoamyl Cocoate) -* not an emulsifier, but I read it can be used to wash off dimethicone easily.\n* Carbomer - I think it can't be used alone to emulsify, but it works well with Sodium Polyacrylamide, so I can use less Cosmedia and lower pH >6 without loss of a viscosity \n* Surfactants:\n   * Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside (O110) - I read that it's harsher than Coco-Glucoside.\n   * Decyl Glucoside (O10) - same concerns as above.\n   * Lauryl Glucoside\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids - it's a new ingredient in a shop, I haven't made a research about it yet.\n   * Cocamidopropyl Betaine - I think I'm allergic to amphoteric surfactants or it's because of some of it binds to the skin? My skin is itchy after I use it a couple of days in a row.\n   * Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate - same as above.\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate - a product with it made my hands very dry, so I think I don't want to use it on my face. Which is sad because studies have shown that it's one of the mildest anionics...",

Not sure if you’d be able to find that ingredient in your area. \n\nThe product I got has 25% active surfactant matter, and I use it at 4% in my formula, so the surfactant in the end-product is 1%. \n\nI just used distilled water, a thickener (could be some kind of gum), 0.2% Hyaluronic Acid (instead of glycerin), the SCG (surfactant), and preservative.\n\nIt’s obviously more a gel cleanser than a cream. It doesn’t foam. I just gently massage the gel around my face. It’s enough to get my pores clear. Doesn’t leave any residue. \n\nIf you needed it a bit stronger you could try 5% sodium cococyl glycinate (that’s calculating for a product with 25% active surfactant matter). \n\nAnother thing-  if you want to try a different oil in your formulas, you could try Neossance Squalane (from sugar cane). It is non-irritating and non-acnegenic. Doesn’t have any astringent qualities. Very lightweight but conditioning oil.",

Commercial cleansers utilises a mix of surfactants to increase the micelle size and gentleness.

Despite almost 90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science's understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor. There is also a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and pharmacokinetics of these compounds. In spite of this, the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted. Experimental research, however, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences. In our opinion, the possibility that vaccine benefits may have been overrated and the risk of potential adverse effects underestimated, has not been rigorously evaluated in the medical and scientific community.\n\n>*Neural Dynamics Research Group, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L8, Canada.*\n\n>https://www.ubc.ca/about/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21568886/\n\nAdditionally, aluminum is carcinogenic, likely causing or contributing to the formation of cancer.\n\n>Aluminium is present in the human brain and it accumulates with age.\n\n>...we know that **aluminium is a potent pro-oxidant**, its interaction with the superoxide radical anion establishing, fuelling and sustaining redox cycles.\n\n>*The Birchall Centre, Lennard-Jones Laboratories, Keele University, Staffordshire, UK.*\n\n>https://www.keele.ac.uk/scps/chemistry/ourfacilitiesandequipment/laboratories/\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1586/14737175.2014.915745\n\nPro-oxidant's cause cancer.\n\n>Under normal conditions, anti-oxidants outbalance pro-oxidants, but under oxidative conditions, pro-oxidants prevail over anti-oxidants, which can lead to many inflammatory diseases including cancer.\n\n>*Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA*\n\n>https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/departments-divisions/experimental-therapeutics.html\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990475/\n\nHere is a general summary on aluminum from the CDC.\n\nhttps://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=190&toxid=34\n\nI would like to point out here that environmental aluminum exposure is something to avoid, only a very small amount will make its way to your blood. From past reading, ~99% ingested aluminum passes through via ingestion. Nonetheless, the CDC urges you to reduce environmental exposure. So why aren't they nearly as concerned about directly injected highly ionized aluminum?\n\n>Only very small amounts of aluminum that you may inhale, ingest, or have skin contact with will enter the bloodstream.\n\nThe CDC or it's agent doesn't have a position on carcinogenicity.\n\n>How likely is aluminum to cause cancer?\n>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the EPA have not evaluated the carcinogenic potential of aluminum in humans. Aluminum has not been shown to cause cancer in animals.\n\nThe CDC published document advises avoiding giving aluminum to kids with kidney problems. Do we regularly test children for kidney problems before administering aluminum injections?\n\n>Children with kidney problems who were given aluminum in their medical treatments developed bone diseases. It does not appear that children are more sensitive to aluminum than adults.\n\nThe CDC published document says birth defects in humans hasn't been tested, and in animals is at least not obvious.\n\n>We do not know if aluminum will cause birth defects in people. Birth defects have not been seen in animals. \n\nThe CDC published document then advises that certain amounts of aluminum causes skeletal and neurological development disorders. But... the CDC document just stated that they haven't seen birth defects? Am I misunderstanding these two statements? Do smaller amounts also cause issues, but less noticeably?\n\n>Aluminum in large amounts has been shown to be harmful to unborn and developing animals because it can cause delays in skeletal and neurological development.\n\nAluminum is being transferred from parent to nursing undeveloped infant.\n\n>Aluminum is found in breast milk, but only a small amount of this aluminum will enter the infant's body through breastfeeding.\n\n\nAluminum is everywhere. In the air, in your water, in your hygiene products, as a regular ingredient used in your food.\n\n>How can families reduce the risks of exposure to aluminum?\n>Since aluminum is so common and widespread in the environment, families cannot avoid exposure to aluminum.\n>Avoid taking large quantities of aluminum-containing antacids and buffered aspirin and take these medications as directed.\n\nAluminum accumulates long term in your bones. It doesn't simply \"flush out\".\n\n>Is there a medical test to determine whether I've been exposed to aluminum?\n>All people have small amounts of aluminum in their bodies. Aluminum can be measured in blood, bones, feces, or urine. Urine and blood aluminum measurements can tell you whether you have been exposed to larger-than-normal amounts of aluminum.

    "body": "I saw someone ask about reviews for products that don’t work for us, lying around in our drawers. This cleanser is one of those cult favorites that just didn’t work for me, so I wanted to give it a review. \n\n—\n\nLast month, I spent a week in New York City. While there, I visited the beautiful showroom for Glossier.\n\nEvery product is laid out neatly for visitors to test, organized roughly by function. Moisturizers, primers, serums, and balms at one; powder, foundation, and concealer at another; and lip, cheek, and eye products at another.\n\nAt the back of the showroom, there is a washbasin, surrounded by their skincare products. One such product is the infamous Milky Jelly Cleanser.\n\nOf course, by the time I got a chance to test out the cleanser, I had quite a collection of swatches on my hand.\n\n**First Impressions**\n\nFirst, the ingredients:\n\n>Water/Aqua/Eau, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Propanediol, Isohexadecane, Poloxamer 184, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Xylitylglucoside, Betaine, Allantoin, Glycerin, Panthenol, Symphytum Officinale Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Xylitol, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Isopropyl Myristate, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\nRight off the bat, you'll notice that there is no fragrance added. It does smell faintly of roses due to the inclusion of the rose water (Rosa Damascena Flower Water), so be aware of that if you are very sensitive to fragrance or just really dislike the scent of roses.\n\nThe cleansing aspect of it is performed by the addition of a polymer (Poloxamer 184), which helps water to mix with oils and other products on the skin, letting them be rinsed away.\n\nThe product feels... well... very jelly-like. It's a really unique-feeling cleanser in that way. I can't think of any other cleanser that has its texture. It is more viscous than typical cleansers, which are more runny, but spreads easily and feels very \"clean.\" In that way, it's more like a silicone makeup primer, but without the powderiness that usually accompanies primers due to the addition of silica (for oil-absorption).\n\nI used it for about a week in place of my normal makeup remover, and I must say -- it lives up to the claim of being a pretty effective remover. It spread easily and worked just like all of the videos that Glossier has posted on their social media, removing my concealer, eye makeup, lipstick, and most of my mascara with ease. I did not try it with more waterproof formulas, like MAC Face & Body or a waterproof mascara.\n\nAfter use, it left my skin smooth, soft, and clean-feeling. It did not feel stripped, even after multiple days of usage. It also did not bother my rosacea or make me pinker than usual.\n\n**Consensus**\n\nThe Milky Jelly Cleanser has been a bit of a cult favorite for awhile now, and with good reason. It removes makeup pretty well (though I'd still use a makeup remover for any makeup beyond the light, concealer/mascara/lipstick days), cleanses great, and doesn't leave skin stripped. Bonus: it lacks fragrance and typical surfactants that can leave skin stripped and tight.\n\nUnfortunately, it broke my skin out after a couple of days usage, but I am also incredibly acne-prone. After just a couple days, my skin had closed comedones all over. Paula's Choice 2% BHA cleared this up within just 2-3 days of nightly usage.\n\nThis doesn't make me less likely to recommend it however, as it is a great, no frills cleanser and I imagine that a bottle would last about 2-3 months of daily usage.\n\nYou can purchase Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser [on their website for $18 USD + tax and shipping](https://www.glossier.com/products/milky-jelly-cleanser).\n\n---\n\n*Note on Glossier's returns: Glossier's customer service is amazing. After I contacted them to let them know that I purchased this product in store, but was back home in LA without a way to return it, they responded with a friendly note to let me know that they had passed my feedback along and issued me a full refund, no returning of the product needed.*\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Background: I am actually a big fan of the peel off mask. It makes my pores smaller and skin softer. Other than that it doesn't do much else. But i still love it. The price? I hate. I hate the price. And with how April skins site works, you can't just buy one product without having to pay a lot for shipping. And they trap you into saving money if you buy more than one product with bundle deals (tbh i loved this bundle deal when I was actually using April skin and I did in fact love their entire calendula line) or promises for free shipping if you spent enough. Which is the same for every site, but for someone like me who only came to love the calendula mask after almost a year, it was a bit difficult to drop the cash to buy another tube. \n\nSo I feel like for  the longest time a lot of us have been tempted by those Facebook or Insta ads from, primarily, medicube and April skin. I was in particular when I first started. They, along with other brands such as glow recipe, peach & lily, and a few others, as well as stores such as soko glam, have been known to be sort of \"beginner k beauty\" as there's nothing really special about them, yet they have the audacity to charge $30-$40 per non special product. Some brands have been trying to put an end to this, my current favorite being Missha. \n\nI got an email via the Missha newsletter and saw they too had released a calendula line. I thought to myself, there's no way. Theres no way they'd have a peel off mask too. Well, click on the link to not only see they have the entire line (minus those toner filled pads) but that EVERYTHING is half the price of April Skins line, but they also have the famous calendula peel off mask that im sure populates your insta feed. \n\nI actually posted about it here and got asked to compare it, but was broke at the time. Unfortunately, like most other sites missha says they'll include free shipping if you spend a certain amount. I didn't have the cash at the time to spend that amount. Thankfully a while back they had a free shipping day, so I bought that and another clay mask I was looking at. \n\nWell I used it today and have a first impressions review. \n\nFirst off the April Skin Peel Off Mask:\n\nThis one claims that the floating pieces of flower are a feature rather than a gimmick. Nope. They are just a gimmick. And tbh they run out after a few uses if you don't tilt the bottle upside down a few times before use. Theres literally no purpose to them. It also claims to unclog pores and pick up any dead skin on your face. Ehhh....\n\nIt has a very light color. In fact its almost clear. Its a bit runny which makes it very easy to spread. The downside to this? It doesn't pick up dead skin or clear pores. AT ALL. It claims it's for people who want to exfoliate their skin but have skin thats too sensitive to those other peel off masks. Gonna have to give a hard nope to that. In fact, me being with sensitive skin, use this after exfoliating (peeling gel) to add a bit of moisture to my skin. NOT to exfoliate. \n\nIt makes my skin soft and pores smaller after peeling off. I like to use it just to reset my skin sorta after exfoliating. I use it once a week. It takes about a half hour to dry, which is a long time. But its relaxing. \n\nFrom what I remember, they charge you so much but don't even include the damn jelly brush, and then have the audacity to try and sell it to you for $7, or include it free if you bundle with something else. They say you should apply with the jelly brush too. Like really? So fking dirty April skin. I actually just went through the checkout process to see the costs, and they actually include some freebies with purchase. So not as bad as I initially thought. \n\n\n\nPros: \n\n\nEasy to spread\n\nSmells ok\n\nEasy to peel off\n\nMakes skin soft\n\nShrinks pores\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n\nExpensive ($27.99 including shipping for me)\n\nDoesn't do what it says\n\nClaims gimmick is in fact a feature \n\nDoesn't include jelly brush (this might've changed)\n\n\nNow to the Missha Calendula Peel Off Mask\n\nSo basically, let's take everything that April Skins mask claimed to do, and actually apply it to Missha's mask. Missha, unlike April skin, actually lived up to these claims. \n\nNo more flower chunks. Yay. \n\nIts actually thicker than the AS one and a bit more golden too. Its not as clear, which I get the feeling means they have more extract in there. This also means its not as easy to spread on your face. But another pro is it only takes 20 minutes to dry as opposed to AS. \n\nIt smells slightly, stronger? I guess? Its definitely a different scent, but it's not an assault on my nose or anything. \n\nThis is actually strong enough to pull of dead skin and possibly get black heads and filaments. Don't ask me if it worked, nothing works on my filaments except extracting them by hand. \n\nThe only downside to this? I don't recommend for people with sensitive skin. It pulls off HARD like those other peel off mask. It kinda stung, ngl, the upside? My skin felt SO SOFT afterward. Heck I'm even going to claim this one made my skin feel softer than the AS one. Its probably due to it actually doing what it claims to do. \n\nI kinda do and don't blame AS for this. They claimed it was a peel off mask alternative for people with sensitive skin and that it wasn't as harsh as others, but they shouldn't have said it for sure picked up dead skin. It was definitely a good peel off mask for my slightly sensitive skin. But it didn't do what they claimed, while this one did. \n\n\nPros:\n\n\nDoes everything AS claimed to do and actually did it\n\nMade skin softer\n\nPossibly has more extract in it\n\nQuicker to dry \n\nGets rid of dead skin \n\nDoesn't have flower chunks \n\n\nCons:\n\n\nAlso doesn't include a jelly brush \n\nA bit tough on skin to pull off\n\nNot as easy to spread \n\n\n\n\nPrice break down:\n\n\n\nApril Skin:\n\n\nMask: $20 \n\nShipping: $6 (for me living in California) \n\nIncludes: 2 sheet masks as freebies \n\n\n\n\nMissha:\n\n\nMask: $16\n\nShipping: $6 (again, california) but they do have free shipping days \n\nIncludes: hand sanitizer \n\n\nTbh, since I bought a clay mask with it, I got the next tier of free gifts, and free shipping i got a nice eye cream with it, which, I love. I love this eye cream lol  \n\nIngredient list:\n\n\nApril skin: \n\nWater, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polysorbate 80, Calendula Officinalis Flower, Xanthan Gum, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Juniperus Mexicana Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Calendula Officinalis Flower Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Borago Officinalis Extract, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower/Leaf Extract\n\n\nMissha:\n\nWater, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat., PVP, Propanediol, Methylpropanediol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydroxyacetophenone, Acrylates/Palmeth-25 Acrylate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum, Calendula Officinalis Flower, Coptis Japonica Root Extract, Tromethamine, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Pyrus Communis (Pear) Fruit Extract, Rose Extract, Cucumis Melo (Melon) Fruit Extract, Vetiveria Zizanoides Root Oil, Hedera Helix (Ivy) Leaf/Stem Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Bambusa Textilis Stem Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Luffa Cylindrica Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, Dextrin, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water\n\n\nMissha appears to have more ingredients.

Turns out Mcdonald’s is one of the only fast food places that does not use that product in their ice cream. tried that one again and no issues.

Hormonal acne, working on diagnosis with doctors for probable PCOS.\n\n**Age:** 30\n\n**Climate:** Hot and humid summers, cold and dry winters. Northeast USA.\n\n**TL;DR: Will not repurchase.** Irritates my skin, leaves it feeling tight and shiny, doesn't play well with other routine steps.\n\n**Background Info:** I absolutely LOVE my LRP Cicaplaste Baume B5, and was on the hunt for a source to purchase the 100ml tube that would ship to the US when I came across LRP Cicaplast Baume B5 SPF50. It was like the heavens parted and I could hear angels singing. A product that would soothe my redness and irritation, protect me from the sun, and possibly let me skip a step in my morning routine? Hallelujah! I found a seller on eBay with good reviews and bought it for about $20. The seller ships from Greece.\n\n**Ingredients:** [CosDNA Link](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_1ca9231503.html); ([From Website](http://www.laroche-posay.com/products-treatments/Cicaplast/CICAPLAST-BAUME-B5-spf50-p23991.aspx)):  AQUA / WATER; HOMOSALATE; PANTHENOL; ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE; BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE; OCTOCRYLENE; ALCOHOL DENAT.; BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE; STYRENE/ACRYLATES COPOLYMER; ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE; TRIETHANOLAMINE; DIMETHICONE; PHENYLBENZIMIDAZOLE SULFONIC ACID; PEG-8 LAURATE; SORBITAN OLEATE; ZINC GLUCONATE; MADECASSOSIDE; MANGANESE GLUCONATE; ISOHEXADECANE; SODIUM ACRYLATES CROSSPOLYMER-2; SILICA; 2-OLEAMIDO-1,3-OCTADECANEDIOL; PERLITE; DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE; POLOXAMER 338; DISODIUM EDTA; COPPER GLUCONATE; CAPRYLYL GLYCOL; POLYSORBATE 80; ACRYLAMIDE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE COPOLYMER; ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER; BHT; TOCOPHEROL; PHENOXYETHANOL\n\n**Packaging:** Same as the non-SPF Cicaplast Baume. Stiff white tube with a cap that cannot be twisted off. It's pretty difficult to get the last bits of product out, but the tube can be cut or you could probably leverage a butter knife or flat head screwdriver under the cap to pop it off. \n\n**Smell:** This is fragrance free (yay!) which I expected, but it is **not** unscented. This has a strong sunscreen smell that takes quite a while to dissipate. I grew up in South Florida and am used to the smell, so it's not a deal-breaker for me, personally.\n\n**Texture:** This is pretty thick. Not quite as thick as, say, Aveeno Baby, but a little thicker than LRP Anthelios 60 Melt In Suncreen Milk for Face and Body. If you're already using LRP Cicaplast Baume B5 I would say the texture is nearly the same, but this is slightly more difficult to spread and apply evenly. \n\n**Whitecast:** Hard to say, as I am quite pale. The lightest shades in most foundations are a little too dark for me. My best match so far is BareMinerals BarePro in Fair01. \n\n**How it felt on my skin:** I'm pretty disappointed in this suncreen, sadly. One of the sunscreen filters is just not sitting well with my skin. It consistently leaves my skin feeling like it's slightly burning and this lasts for hours after application. My face gets red and hot immediately. I generally try to stick with mineral sunscreens as I know it's a safer bet for my sensitive skin, but was really hoping this might be gentle enough to work for me. It does not. It leaves my face feeling tight after, despite having many of the same ingredients as the non-SPF Cicaplast Baume, and leaves a weird shine all over my face. Not dewey, moisturized, or chok chok, but SHINY. It also didn't really play well with anything else in my routine. I tried putting on a little bit of my non-SPF Cicaplast Baume before applying this, but it manages to somehow pill? My primer doesn't sit well on top of it at all. If it weren't somewhat drying I could see getting away with a little powder on top and it looking okay, but it's just not working for me. :( **I will not repurchase.** \n\n**My Routine:**\n\nAM:\n\nWash with water. Occasionally cleanse with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser as needed.\n\nStratia Liquid Gold\n\nLRP Cicaplast Baume B5\n\nSPF\n\nPrimer and makeup\n\nPM:\n\nEtude House Real Art Moisture Oil Cleanser\n\nCetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n\nActives - Currently using 10&#37; Mandelic Acid serum, not sure if I like it. Was using Melazepam pretty religiously for almost a year but it's not playing well with my skin right now and I'm not sure why (probably hormones, honestly. They're all out of whack and my skin is not happy with it.). Vitamin C every other day. Just starting to add 2&#37; granactive retinoid once a week.    \n\nStratia Liquid Gold\n\nLRP Cicaplast Baume B5 \n\nOn occasion: vaseline, as needed; Sulwhasoo Ginseng Cream if I'm feeling extra fancy (recent purchase from momomango going out of business sale)",

Serious adverse reactions  reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in  relation to Gardasil include but are not limited to:4\n\n \n\n* Anaphylaxis\n* Guillain-Barre Syndrome\n* [Transverse myelitis](https://articles.mercola.com/shingles.aspx) (inflammation of the spinal cord)\n* [Pancreatitis](https://articles.mercola.com/pancreatitis.aspx)\n* Venous thromboembolic events (blood clots)\n* Autoimmune initiated motor neuron disease (a neurodegenerative disease that causes rapidly progressive muscle weakness)\n* [Multiple sclerosis](https://articles.mercola.com/multiple-sclerosis.aspx)\n* Sudden death\n\n \n\nPostmarketing experiences and adverse events reported during post-approval use listed on the Gardasil vaccine insert5  include blood and lymphatic system disorders such as autoimmune  hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and  lymphadenopathy; pulmonary embolus; pancreatitis; autoimmune diseases;  anaphylactic reactions; arthralgia and myalgia (musculoskeletal and  connective tissue disorders); nervous system disorders such as acute  disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, motor neuron  disease, paralysis, seizures and transverse myelitis; and deep venous  thrombosis, a vascular disorder.\n\nAccording to \"Manufactured Crisis — HPV, Hype and Horror,\" a film6  by The Alliance for Natural Health, there have also been cases of  16-year-old girls developing ovarian dysfunction, meaning they're going  into menopause, which in turn means they will not be able to have  children.\n\nDespite such serious effects, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) and FDA allege the vast majority, or even all, of  these tragic cases are unrelated to the vaccine, and that Gardasil is  safe.\n\nThe Plaintiff's Science Day Presentation on Gardasil video features  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel for Children's  Health Defense,7  an organization originally founded in 2016 as World Mercury Project and  renamed in 2018 to focus on exposing and eliminating multiple harmful  exposures contributing to the epidemic of chronic ill health among  children. The video details the many safety problems associated with  Merck's HPV vaccine, Gardasil.\n\nThe information presented is based on publicly available government documents. Kennedy notes that, if what he says about [Merck](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/05/14/mercks-adhd-drugs-unsafe.aspx) in this video presentation were untrue, they would be considered slanderous.\n\nHowever, Kennedy says he is not concerned about being sued for  slander. He says he knows Merck won't sue, \"because in the U.S., truth  is an absolute defense against slander\" and Merck knows that, were the  company to sue for slander, Kennedy would file discovery requests that  would unearth even more documents detailing Merck's fraudulent  activities.\n\nKennedy's presentation does not go into the biological mechanisms by  which Gardasil causes harm. He directs parents and pediatricians to the  Children's Health Defense website8 to read peer reviewed medical literature sources for that information.\n\nInstead, Kennedy's presentation focuses on what he describes as  Merck's fraudulent clinical trials of Gardasil vaccine, which were used  to gain FDA approval. While this article provides you with a summary of  the key points, I urge you to watch Kennedy's presentation in in its  entirety, as this information may well save you or your child a lifetime  of heartache and exorbitant medical expenses.\n\n \n\n## How Merck committed fraud in its Gardasil safety testing \n\nKennedy says the fraud Merck committed in its safety testing is (a)  testing Gardasil against a toxic placebo, and (b) hiding a 2.3%  incidence of autoimmune disease occurring within seven months of  vaccination.\n\nIn his presentation, Kennedy shows Table 1 from the package insert9  for Gardasil, which looks at vaccine injuries at the site of injection.  It shows that Gardasil was administered to 5,088 girls; another 3,470  received the control, amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate (AAAH)  — a neurotoxic aluminum vaccine adjuvant that has been associated with  many serious vaccine injuries in the medical literature.\n\nA third group, consisting of 320 individuals, received a proper [placebo](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/02/20/placebo-effect.aspx)  (saline). In the Gardasil and AAAH control groups, the number of  injuries were fairly close; 83.9% in the Gardasil group and 75.4% in the  AAAH control group. Meanwhile, the rate of injury (again, relating to  injuries at the injection site only), was significantly lower at 48.6%.\n\nNext, he shows Table 9 from the vaccine insert, which is the \"Summary  of girls and women 9 through 26 years of age who reported an incident  condition potentially indicative of a systemic autoimmune disorder after  enrollment in clinical trials of Gardasil, regardless of causality.\"  These conditions include serious systemic reactions, chronic and  debilitating disorders and autoimmune diseases.\n\nNow all of a sudden, there are only two columns, not three as shown  for the injection site injuries. The column left out is that of the  saline placebo group. Kennedy points out that Merck cleverly hides the  hazards of Gardasil by combining the saline group with the aluminum  control, thereby watering down the side effects reported in the  controls. \"They hide the saline group as a way of fooling you, your  pediatrician and the regulatory agency,\" Kennedy says.\n\nLooking at the effects reported in the two groups, 2.3% of those  receiving Gardasil reported an effect of this nature, as did 2.3% of  those receiving the AAAH (aluminum) control or saline placebo. The same  exact ratio of harm is reported in both groups, which makes it appear as  though Gardasil is harmless.\n\nIn reality, we know very little about Gardasil vaccine safety from  the data as presented, since the vast majority of the controls were  given a toxic substance, and they don't tell us how many of those  receiving a truly inert substance developed these systemic injuries.  Still, we can draw some educated guesses, seeing how the injection site  injury ratios between Gardasil and the aluminum group were similar.\n\nMerck's use of AAAH, a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant instead of a  biologically inactive placebo, effectively nullifies its prelicensure  Gardasil safety testing.\n\nAs noted by Peter Gotzche with the Cochrane Center in 2016, when he  co-filed an unofficial complaint against the European Medical Agency for  bias in its assessment of the HPV vaccine, \"The use of active  comparators probably increased the occurrence of harms in the comparator  group, thereby masking harms caused by the HPV vaccine.\"\n\n## Risk evaluation\n\nWhen making an informed decision, you need to know both sides of the  equation — the risk you're trying to avoid, and the risk you're taking  on. Recall that, on average, 1 in 43,478 women will die from cervical  cancer.\n\nIf 2.3% of girls develop an autoimmune disease from Gardasil, then  that translates into 1,000 per 43,500. Even if a 1 in 43,478 chance of  dying from cancer is gone, does it makes sense to trade that for a 1 in  43 chance of getting an autoimmune disease?\n\nAnd how many parents are comfortable giving a child a substance  knowing there's a 1 in 43 chance that this substance will cause a  lifelong disability? Yet that's the choice parents have been fooled into  making.\n\n## Protocol 18\n\nMerck has not disclosed how many clinical safety trials (also called  protocols) it conducted for Gardasil. A slide in Kennedy's presentation  shows a listing of several of the ones known, including protocol 18.  Kennedy says this clinical trial is critical because that was the one  that FDA used as its basis for giving Merck a license to market the  vaccine for use in children as young as 9 years old.\n\nProtocol 18 is the only trial in which the target audience, 9-  through 15-year-old girls and boys, was tested prelicensure. The other  trials looked at the vaccine's safety in 16- through 26-year-olds.  Protocol 18 included just 939 children — \"a very, very tiny group of  people,\" Kennedy says, \"for a product that is going to be marketed to  millions of children around the world.\"\n\nAside from its small cohort size, protocol 18 is also filled with  \"fraud and flimflam,\" according to Kennedy. Merck presented protocol 18  to the FDA and HHS as the only safety trial that used a true  nonbioactive inert placebo. This, however, was a misrepresentation.\n\nInstead of pure saline, the placebo used in protocol 18 contained a carrier solution composed of [polysorbate 80](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2019/02/07/processed-food-emulsifiers-health-risks.aspx),  sodium borate (borax, which is banned for food products in the U.S. and  Europe), genetically modified yeast, L-histidine and DNA fragments. In  essence, the \"placebo\" was all of the vaccine components with the  exception of the aluminum adjuvant and the antigen (viral portion).\n\nVery little if any safety testing has been done on these ingredients,  so their biological effects in the body are largely unknown. What we  can say for sure is that these are not inert substances like saline.  Still, the 596 children given the carrier solution control \"fared much  better than any other cohort in the study,\" Kennedy says.\n\nNone of them had any serious adverse events in the first 15 days.  Now, here's where Merck committed fraud yet again. As Kennedy points  out, Table 20 in protocol 18 shows that Merck cut the amount of aluminum  used in the Gardasil vaccine by half.\n\n>*\"They tested a completely different formulation,\"* he says*.  \"And, obviously, they took the amount of aluminum out to reduce the  amount of injuries and mask the really bad safety profile of this  vaccine …*  \n>  \n>*Since Merck deceptively cut the amount of aluminum — Gardasil's  most toxic component — in half, the data from that study does not  support the safety of the standard Gardasil formulation. Since protocol  18 data are not based on the Gardasil vaccine formulation, the trial  constitutes scientific fraud.\"*  \n \n\n## Exclusion criteria — Another bag of tricks\n\nKennedy also describes another trick used by Merck to skew results:  exclusion criteria. By selecting trial participants that do not reflect  the general population, they mask potentially injurious effects on  vulnerable subgroups.\n\nFor example, individuals with severe allergies and prior genital  infections were excluded, as were those who'd had more than four sex  partners, those with a history of immunological or nervous system  disorders, chronic illnesses, seizure disorders, other medical  conditions, reactions to vaccine ingredients such as aluminum, yeast and  benzonase, and anyone with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.\n\nYet Merck recommends Gardasil for all of these unstudied groups.  Merck's investigators also had unlimited discretion to exclude anyone  with \"any condition which in the opinion of the investigator might  interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.\"\n\nMerck also used \"sloppy protocols to suppress reports of vaccine  injury,\" Kennedy says. For example, only 10% of participants were given  daily report cards to fill out, and they were only to be filled out for  14 days post-vaccination. What's more, these report cards only collected  information about vaccination site effects, such as redness, itching  and bruising.\n\nAlso ignored were autoimmune problems, seizures and menstrual cycle  disruptions experienced by many of the girls. They also did not follow  up with those who reported serious side effects. Merck also granted  broad discretionary powers to its paid investigators to determine what  they thought constituted a reportable adverse event and to dismiss  potential vaccine reactions.\n\nThe researchers did not systematically collect adverse event data,  which is the whole point of doing a safety study in the first place, and  by not paying for the additional time required by investigators to fill  out time-consuming adverse event reports, Merck effectively  incentivized the dismissal of side effects.\n\nMany of the illnesses and injuries reported were also classified as  \"new medical conditions\" rather than adverse events, and no rigorous  investigation of these new conditions were performed.\n\nAccording to Kennedy, at the time of the vaccine's approval, 49.5% of  the Gardasil group and 52% of the controls (who received either the  aluminum adjuvant or the vaccine carrier solution) had \"new medical  history\" after the seventh month (Table 303, which included protocols 7,  13, 15 and 18), many of which were serious, chronic diseases.\n\n## Risk evaluation, take 2\n\n**Taking all of this into account, here's how the risk-benefit equation  looks now: The 1 in 43,478 chance of dying from cervical cancer may  have been removed (assuming the vaccine actually works), but by taking  the vaccine there is now a 1 in 43 chance of getting an autoimmune  disease, and a 1 in 2 chance of developing some form of serious medical  condition.**\n\n## More lies \n\nAccording to Kennedy, Merck also submitted fraudulent information to its Worldwide Adverse Experience System and the federal Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS) about the death of Christina Tarsell, one of its study participants.\n\n>*\"Merck claimed that Chris' gynecologist had told the company that her death was due to viral infection. Chris' gynecologist denies that she ever gave this information to Merck. To this day, Merck has refused to change its false entry on its own reporting system,\"* Kennedy says.  \n>  \n>*\"Furthermore, Merck lied to the girls participating in these studies, telling them that the placebo was saline and contained no other ingredients. And No. 2, that the study in which they were participating was not a safety study. They were told that there had already been safety studies and that the vaccine had been proven safe …*   \n>  \n>*They made it so that the girls were less likely to report injuries associated with the vaccine, because they believed the vaccine they were receiving had already been proven safe and that any injuries did experience, maybe a month, two months or three months after the vaccine must just be coincidental and had nothing to do with the  vaccine.\"*\n\n \n\nBut it gets worse, because there's a possibility Gardasil could cause cancer. The Gardasil insert13  admits it has never been evaluated for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity,  yet its ingredients \"include potential carcinogens and mutagens,  including aluminum and human DNA,\" Kennedy says.\n\nHe goes on to show the results of Merck's study protocol 13 (Table  17: Applicant's analysis of efficacy against vaccine-relevant HPV types  CIN 2/3 or worse among subjects who were PCR positive and seropositive  for relevant HPV types at day 1.)\n\nWhat this protocol showed is that women who had previous exposure to  the HPV strains used in the vaccine had a 44.6% increased risk of  developing CIN2 and CIN3 lesions after vaccination. Taking the dubious  efficacy of Gardasil into account, and the fact that it may only impact  one-third of cervical cancer cases, the risk-benefit lineup when taking  the vaccine now looks like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* There is still a chance of dying from cervical cancer unrelated to HPV \n* There is a 1 in 43 chance of getting an autoimmune disease\n* There is a 1 in 2 chance of developing a serious medical condition\n* If someone has ever been exposed to any of the nine HPV strains  included in the vaccine prior to getting Gardasil the risk of developing  CIN2 and CIN3 cervical lesions is raised by 44.6%, which may raise the  risk of cervical cancer\n\n## Widespread Gardasil use may trigger more virulent HPV infections \n\n\"To make things even worse, there are recent scientific studies that  suggest a phenomenon known as type replacement,\" Kennedy says. \"Type  replacement\" refers to when the elimination or suppression of one viral  strain allows a more virulent strain to colonize. \n\nThe study,14  \"Shift in Prevalence of HPV Types in Cervical Cytology Specimens in the  Era of HPV Vaccination,\" published in the journal Oncology Letters in  2016 — which analyzed the association between the prevalence of 32 types  of HPV virus in 615 women who had abnormal cervical cytopathology —  reported that:\n\n>*\"… HPV16, which is recognized as the main HR-HPV type responsible  for the development of cervical cancer, was observed in 32.98% of HPV  participants, followed by HPV42 (18.09%), HPV31 (17.66%), HPV51  (13.83%), HPV56 (10.00%), HPV53 (8.72%) and HPV66 (8.72%).*   \n>  \n>*The prevalence of HR-HPV types, which may be suppressed directly  (in the case of HPV16 and 18), or possibly via cross-protection (in the  case of HPV31) following vaccination, was considerably lower in  participants ≤22 years of age (HPV16, 28.57%; HPV18, 2.04%; HPV31,  6.12%), compared with participants 23–29 years of age (HPV16, 45.71%;  HPV18, 7.86%; HPV31, 22.86%), who were less likely to be vaccinated.*   \n>  \n>*Consequently, the present study hypothesizes that there may be a  continuous shift in the prevalence of HPV types as a result of  vaccination. Furthermore, the percentage of non-vaccine HR-HPV types was  higher than expected, considering that eight HPV types formerly  classified as 'low-risk' or 'probably high-risk' are in fact HR-HPV  types.*   \n>  \n>*Therefore, it may be important to monitor non-vaccine HPV types  in future studies, and an investigation concerning several HR-HPV types  as risk factors for the development of cervical cancer is required.\"*\n\n*Sources*\n\n   \n\n* 1 [The Pharma Letter February 10, 2006 ](https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/sanofi-pasteur-msd-s-gardasil-becomes-first-hpv-vaccine-approved-in-europe)\n* 2 [FDA.gov, Gardasil Vaccine ](https://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/safetyavailability/vaccinesafety/ucm179549.htm)\n* 3 [NVIC.

Plus it's pregnancy safe where tret is not. \n\nHowever, it contains Polysorbate 80 (or maybe 20? Either way, one of the polysorbates) and it was alright for a bit but isn't doing much to help with my Malessezia prone skin. My skin is probably more along the seb derm side than fungal acne, but following an FA safe routine (skincare + makeup) has been helping a lot. \n\nAnyway I wanted to share a few FA Safe Azelaic Acid Serum products that I've come across:\n\n1. KisoCare Azelaic Topical Acid Serum - 15% AzA with Niacinamide and Vit C. Both the AzA and Vit C are derivatives, and it's made in Japan. I just purchased this and will test it once it arrives. I've found it on Amazon and YesStyle. They also have a 15% cream but that one is not FA safe. 1oz/30ml for approx $15.\n\n2. CocoKind Vitamin C Glow Serum - Uses a Vit C derivative and regular AzA, however I believe the concentration of both ingredients combined is only 4% total. You can find this at Target or Amazon. 1oz/30ml for approx $15.\n\n3. Q+A Azelaic Balancing Serum - 8% AzA with Zinc PCA so this might be pretty gentle and soothing. Made in the UK. Available on their own website and Amazon. 1oz/30ml for approx $13. If KisoCare doesn't work for me, I'll probably try this next.\n\n4. Naturium Azelaic Topical Acid Serum 10% - This one uses 10% glycinated AzA so it's a derivative, and it has Ethyl Ascorbic Acid for Vitamin C. Also contains niacinamide. You can find this on their own website, Target and Amazon. 1oz/30ml for approx $19. \n\n5. Typology L35 Mattifying Serum with 10% Azelaic Acid - So this is not a derivative type of AzA, and has Zinc PCA. It's made in France and you can find it on their website. On the more expensive side at .50oz/15ml for $25.20 or 1oz/30ml for $46.90.\n\n6. Of Other Worlds Light Beams Barrier Treatment - Not sure the % of AzA in this one, but it does have Urea, Ceramides and antioxidants/extracts. It does have ONE trigger, which is Leuconostoc Ferment Filtrate. Everyone reacts differently to ferments so thought I would include it here anyway. I do react to ferments so this one is not for me. Found on their website. The priciest option at 1oz/30ml for $68.\n\n7. Azclear Medicated Lotion - 20% concentration, but I've read that it goes on like glue and you have to order it from an Australian pharmacy like MyChemist.com.au. It's 0.88oz/25g for $18.99 + international shipping.\n\nI used Sezia to check ingredients for all.\n\nHave you tried any other FA Safe Azelaic Acid products? I would love to add to my list and keep an eye on them!",

    "body": "**How are vaccines tested ?**\n\nMost drugs are tested in double blind placebo studies. It means that both the patients and the doctors do not know if the drug administered is a placebo or not. This protocol was chosen because it removes the possibility for the doctors to inadvertently alter the results of the study. If the doctor doesn't know which patient has taken the medicine, he may not amplify the effects of the drug or ignore recoveries from patients under the placebo.\n \nBut vaccines are often not tested in a double blind placebo studies. It's assumed that the risks are often too important. So in order to have some kind of study, they compare the health hazard of one vaccine relatively to another. The result is that we may never know if some vaccines are dangerous or not, or if that they prevent any disease. The only thing that we know is that this vaccine \"A\" isn't more harmful than that other vaccine \"B\" of the same type.\n\n**Should vaccines be tested the same way as any other drug ?**\n \nSorry but we will do some maths here. Vaccines can be better understood if we know what is behind a decision to make a drug or vaccine available to the public. \n \nLet's assume that we have one pandemic like the flu and we wonder if we should chose a drug \"A\" or a vaccine \"B\". Here is the data of the problem : 3.7% of the population is hit by the flu each year. Over those 3.7%, 0.1% of them or 0.0037% of the world population will die.\n \nWe have a hypothetic medicine \"A\" that has a 90% chance to cure anyone before they die and has 0.01% chance to produce some complication that will kill the person. We assume thant 33.3% of the sick population is asymptomatic and will not require any medication.\n \nWith a wolrd population of 10 billion people (to round numbers), the number of persons killed by the medecine will be around : 24 640 person.\n \nBut the numbers of persons saved by the medicine will be : 333 000.\n \nNow let's take a vaccine \"B\" with a 100% succes rate and only a 0.001% chance of complications that leads to death. (So ten times less deadly than taking the medicine).\n \nThe number of persons killed by the vaccines will be around : 100 000 person.\n \nThe number of persons saved by the vaccines will be around : 370 000 person.\n \nIn that case we see that the vaccine B needs to be a lot safer than the drug to produce comparable results (around 40 times safer). That's because the vaccine is administred to everyone while a drug is only administred to the sick. Prevention is not the same as curation!\n \nWhat doest it tell us? In the case of a disease curable with conventional drugs, vaccines should comply to the highest standards before they are introduced.\n \n**Are vaccines manufacturer accountable for vaccines ?**\n \nAny vaccine related injury needs to make a petition to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation program. This program pays on average 200 millions dollars each year in reparations. Paid by the government. It means that vaccine manufacturers don't have one very important incentive to make sure vaccines are safe.\n \nIt's not much compared to the 40 billions in revenue or the 2.2 billions in profit the industry made of selling vacinnes. But there is one thing to be discussed, for each vaccine that is studied there is a list of potential second effects that is made. Any injury that do not fall in this list can't be considered as a vaccination related injury.\n \nIn phase three trials, the number of tested persons range from several hundreds to about 3000 people. Compare this number to the \"0.001%\" mortality rate of vaccine B. To make sure the vaccine doesn't kill more people than it saves you would need for the \"flu\" to test it in about 100 000 people. If we assume the effective protection of the vaccine B is less than 100% but only 50%. You would need to test it in about 200 000 people. The flu vaccines have an estimated protection ranging from 40 to 70%...\n \nHopefully once a vaccine is given to the population it's monitored and if there are any concerns about the safety of people taking it, then it's removed from the circulation, like the hepathitis B vaccine or the MMR vaccines with mercury adjuvants.\n \n**What are in vaccines ? (not by me)**\n\n- Thimerosal\n \nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) claims thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines as a precautionary measure in 2001, but the last batches of routine childhood vaccines with thimerosal did not actually expire until January 2003. We were led to believe thimerosal was eliminated from all vaccines, but it wasn’t. It’s in some flu shots—including some given to infants and pregnant women—the tetanus toxoid vaccine (Tt), and meningococcal vaccines. More than 80 studies compiled by the Children’s Health Defense show that the health effects of human exposure to mercury include cognitive difficulties (such as autism), memory and vision loss, coordination issues, tremors, skin rashes and mood instability. Mercury is a known neurotoxin, yet it’s still injected into people of all ages with alarming regularity.\n \n- Aluminum\n \nThe CDC explains that aluminum gels or salts are added as adjuvants to help the vaccine stimulate a better immune response, i.e. be more effective. Without aluminum, more doses of a vaccine might be required to provide adequate protection, according to the AAP. Aluminum is a toxic metal, and one to which we are already routinely exposed through food, air, and water, given its natural occurrence in the earth’s crust. While most in mainstream medicine insist it poses no problems, many independent researchers are suspicious of aluminum’s supposed safety.  The National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), a nonprofit founded in 1982 to prevent vaccine injuries and deaths through public education, highlights on its website the shocking lack of scientific evidence that injected aluminum is safe. And parents need to be aware that the amount of aluminum babies and young children are exposed to via vaccines has risen substantially in recent years. According to medical research journalist Neil Z. Miller, “Vaccines containing aluminum were added to the childhood immunization schedule when some vaccines containing mercury were removed. Prior to the mercury phase-out (pre-2000), babies received 3,925 mcg of aluminum by 18 months of age. After pneumococcal and hepatitis A vaccines were added to the schedule, babies began receiving 4,925 mcg of aluminum during the same age period—a 25% increase.”\n \n- Antibiotics\n \nThe antibiotics added to vaccines are there to prevent the growth of germs during production and storage of the vaccine. There has been much debate lately over the risks of exposing children to antibiotics too early in life. One recent study in particular found that multiple antibiotic use in early childhood may lead to weight gain, increased bone growth, and altered gut bacteria.\n \n- Egg Protein\n \nFlu vaccines are most commonly made using an egg-based manufacturing process, which is used to make both the inactivated vaccine (the flu shot) and the live attenuated vaccine (usually called the “nasal spray”), according to the CDC.  The yellow fever vaccine is also made this way, putting anyone with an egg allergy at risk if they receive either of these vaccinations, regardless of how low the level of actual egg protein is.\n \n- Formaldehyde\n \nFormaldehyde is added to vaccines to kill unwanted bacteria and viruses that might contaminate the vaccine during production. The CDC insists most formaldehyde is removed from the vaccine before it is packaged, which is just another way of saying that all of it is not removed. Formaldehyde is a human carcinogen according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\n \n- Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)\n \nMore commonly known as a food additive, MSG is also used as a stabilizer to help vaccines remain unchanged when exposed to heat, light, acidity or humidity, according to the CDC. MSG consumption is notorious for causing headaches in some people. It can also cause fatigue, disorientation and heart palpitation, per the Mayo Clinic. MSG has been called an “excitotoxin,” which is a term used to describe a class of chemicals (usually amino acids) that over-stimulate neuron receptors in the brain, causing them to die.\n \n- Squalene\n \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) describes squalene as “a component of some adjuvants that is added to vaccines to enhance the immune response.” It’s a naturally-occurring substance derived primarily from shark liver oil, found in foods, cosmetics, over-the-counter medications, and supplements. When combined with other ingredients it becomes an adjuvant, which, like aluminum, is added to vaccines to elicit a stronger immune response from the body.  The WHO notes that most people who have received squalene-containing vaccines are in older age groups, and that we don’t really know how this component might impact younger people. A 2000 study found that a single injection of squalene adjuvant produced arthritis in rats, and, although more research is needed, many believe squalene-containing anthrax vaccine to be the main culprit in triggering Gulf War Syndrome among American troops who served in the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s.\n \n- Gelatin\n \nThis commonly used vaccine ingredient is made by boiling skin or connective tissue, typically from a pig. Gelatin is used as a stabilizer to protect the viruses in vaccines from adverse conditions. It is a concerning additive because some people have gelatin allergies, and receiving a vaccine with gelatin can provoke an allergic response, possibly even triggering anaphylaxis. Depending on its source, gelatin may also be a religious concern for Jews and Muslims.\n \n- Polysorbate 80 \n \nThe HPV vaccine is administered mainly to teenagers to protect against the human papilloma virus (HPV), which has been strongly linked to cervical cancer, anal cancer, and even some mouth cancers. This vaccine and a few others contain a stabilizer known as polysorbate 80, an emulsifier used in some foods and cosmetics. While there have been reports of the HPV vaccine causing premature ovarian failure in girls, research is needed to determine if there is a link between this phenomenon and polysorbate 80 and/or other HPV vaccine ingredients such as aluminum. The safety of using this chemical in vaccines has been poorly studied, and according to the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for Polysorbate 80, it may cause adverse reproductive effects and cancer based on animal testing data. The MSDS also indicates that no safety testing has been done in humans.\n \n- Aborted Human Fetal Tissue\n \nA number of vaccines—including varicella, rubella, hepatitis A, shingles, and rabies—are made using fetal embryo cells, and have been for decades. The reason given is that the viruses tend to grow better in these cells, and fetal cells can divide for a long time before dying.  However, the use of actual human fetal cells poses the question of how the fetal DNA will interact with the virus and, eventually, the human into which it is injected. It remains unclear what kind of dangerous immune response this has been provoking, but according to the Sound Choice Pharmaceutical Institute, a biomedical research organization, there have been distinct spikes in autism rates in the years when vaccines grown in human fetal cells were introduced. In my opinion, the moral implications here are huge.\n\n**But are vaccines safe, what do researchers tell ?**\n\nHere are articles about : \n \n- [seizures](https://learntherisk.org/seizures/)\n \n- [autism](https://learntherisk.org/autism/)\n \n- [childhood cancer](https://learntherisk.org/childhood-cancer/)\n\nSome statistics :\n \n- 606 880 estimated deaths from a cancer in the US.\n \n- 23.5 million Americans suffer from an auto immune disease.\n \n- No real data about autism is available since they broadened the definition of autism to include very mild case. However autism was something unheard of a hundred years ago. One may wonder why there is no data available at all about severe cases, have they got something to hide ?\n \n**The media coverup**\n \nIt's no mystery that the media does not report on every subject. Google has been caught red handed extensively filtering anything negative about vaccines. They used their advance in deep learning algorithms to preemptively detect any website that would be critical of vaccines and remove it from search results. The google whistle blower mentions it in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msXkupMrkZw).\n \nThe CDC whistleblower William Thompson explains how he and other scientists ommited data in his article that proved that vaccines caused autism. He wrote the following letter : “My name is William Thompson. I am a Senior Scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where I have worked since 1998. I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.”. [More info on this here.](http://www.truthwiki.org/dr-william-thompson/).\n \n[Bill Gates explained in a ted talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaF-fq2Zn7I) that vaccines, health care and reproductive services could reduce the world population by 10% or 15%. Since reproductive services is often used as an euphemism for abortion clinics and contraception, it's clear how it could reduce world population. What did he mean by vaccines ? And health care ?\n  \n**More info on vaccines**\n   \n[Conference by Del Bigtree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJh3TiCFJH4)\n  \n[Vaxxed the movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5562652). Don't mind the ratings, they use weighted averages to make it look worse than it is. 60% gave it a 10/10 and 29% gave it a 1//10. If you used a simple average it would be 7.1/10, if they used a median they would give it a 10.\n \n[Learn the risk](https://learntherisk.org)\n  \n[Children's Health Defense by Robert F.

    "body": "**Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\nWell, I think it has finally happened…I’m officially out of my sunscreen rut LOL! I had such a good experience with the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence last month…and this product from Troiareuke is another really nice chemical (and a bit of physical) sunscreen.\n\nIf I thought the lightweight feel of the Soft Airy UV Essence was special…this sunscreen from Troiareuke goes a step further. This formula is one of the thinnest and most lightweight feeling sunscreens I have used! And, considering this is a denatured/drying alcohol free formula…it’s kind of incredible. I’ve only felt this type of watery consistency with some Japanese sunscreens that are usually heavy on the Alcohol Denat. \n\nInactive ingredients include various texturizes, stabilizers, and silicones followed by fragrance (yeah…we will get there). Aloe Leaf Juice, Sodium Hyaluronate, and Centella Asiatica can also be found in this formula. Active ingredients include some fairly common chemical sunscreen filters (at least for K-Beauty)…but Titanium Dioxide in a rather small 1.49% makes an appearance as well. To be honest, the extracts and ingredients following fragrance were kind of lost on me. I didn’t see any soothing or exceptionally hydrating result from this product. But, I was really here for the feel and protection…so no hard feelings there. \n\nOkay, going back to the scent LOL! This product has a rather strong and slightly lingering clean/floral/powdery scent…and I do not like it. Similar to my one complaint about the Troiareuke ACSEN Pore Control Mask…I have no idea why the brand chose to add fragrance to a line geared towards acne prone/sensitive skin. Because of the texture and result this sunscreen still falls into my “love it” category. But, it would have been so much more amazing to me had Troiareuke omitted the scent.\n\nApplication of this product is pretty straightforward…just slather it on LOL! But, the silicones really help this sunscreen to spread around and distribute super evenly. I was never left worried that I missed a spot as everything glides and smoothes around the nose and chin. The little bit of Titanium Dioxide does leave behind the slightest of white-cast…but it absorbs/disappears within seconds and was actually helpful to see where I might need a bit more product. I never thought I would refer to physical filters in a sunscreen as being “beneficial” (at least for my darker skin tone)…but here we are LOL!\n\nOnce absorbed, this product leaves a VERY dewy and slightly shiny look behind. I know a lot of people (including my oily/combination skin peeps) might not like this “nearly greasy” feel/look…but I really love the ultra-dewy result. It might not be something I appreciate as much in the hotter months. The high amount of silicones helped to create this effect without the literal “grease” feeling though. Plus, they are a decent occlusives and help to hold in the hydration from toners/essences/lotions. I’ve used this product multiple times a day for the past couple fo weeks with no breakouts or excessively clogged pores.\n\nIn fact…this sunscreen provided a slight “pore blurring” effect (thanks silicones) much like the ACSEN Pore Control Mask. In it’s ability to mask larger pores and create a more even looking texture…the ACSEN line from Troiareuke has really wowed me so far. \n\nProtection was just fine when using the Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence. Even though I am used to using products with a PA Rating of “++++”…I didn’t see any increase in redness or darkening of my skin with this PA+++ product. I feel like the Titanium Dioxide in this product helped to “reflect” and dissipate a bit more rays causing me to feel slightly more cool/comfortable in the sun. This benefit was really minimal to be honest but it was something I did notice.\n\nSo, overall…a really good sunscreen. Aside, from the fragrance this product was a total win. But, it is most likely something I won’t be coming back to and would probably NEVER be a sunscreen I would recommend. GASP…such a change of heart. Here’s why…\n\nThe Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence…in all of it’s 50ml…is priced at $55.00 USD on Soko Glam as well as the majority of sellers I looked up. Rarely does this sunscreen go on sale and if so the discounts are minimal. To me, this is simply too expensive for a sunscreen of this size. \n\nIt honestly frustrates and saddens me to see a sunscreen product this good be priced at such a prohibitive price point. I am a firm believer that sunscreen is the number one most important step in an effective skincare routine…but something at this cost excludes so many potential buyers. I would hate for someone to take a look at this product and say “Nope! I guess a good sunscreen is just too much for me…and the less expensive ones don’t work for me…so no sunscreen I guess!”\n\nI absolutely appreciate the elegant and super dewy finish as well as finally finding a part physical product that doesn’t make me look like a ghost (LOL)…I just cant see myself burning through 2 bottles a month (which is my current rate for 50ml sunscreens) and dropping $110 USD for them. IT MAKES NO SENSE LOL! I was lucky enough to find this sunscreen on Amazon for Buy 1 Get 1 Free…but it was a promotion that they forgot to remove from the site so I had to fight to get the deal. Outside of that (like I said earlier), I haven’t found them for much less than full price.\n\nRecently…I’ve taken to calling products that have exceptionally potentially irritating ingredients lists and/or unreasonably high prices (in my opinion) “irresponsible” for me to recommend. This sunscreen from Troiareuke falls into that category…I just cant LOL!\n\nMaybe, just maybe…this could be a “special occasion” sunscreen that you wear when that intense glow is super important. With the high amount of silicones in the formula…I could also see this product being excellent to wear under makeup as a primer/for that high sheen “show off that glow at the wedding” look. \n\nBut, for those that want the same protection, lack of white-cast, and a really nice dewy finish (although more watery and less shiny)…the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence is your new BFF. I love that product for all the same reasons as the Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence. However, the fragrance is so much more bearable and it comes in at less than half the cost. If purchasing at Wishtrend…you can get 160ml of the Klairs sunscreen and still have $9.00 USD in your pocket for the price of one ACSEN U.V Protector Essence. I mean…come on.\n\nIf you have the extra cash and want to go “all out” with a sunscreen purchase…this is a worthy choice.

Of course I brought this up this time, but Emend isn’t a premed for T/C chemo so we thought we were in the clear.\n\nI arrived yesterday and my oncologist and nurses were all talking in the hall for a long time about my case. Finally my doctor came in and told me that Taxotere is mixed using a chemical compound called Polysorbate 80 that is also in Emend. So they were concerned about me having a reaction, but wanted to try giving it with lots of Benadryl and steroid premeds. \n\nAbout 3 minutes into the Taxotere infusion I had a reaction. It started with a heavy, squeezing sensation in my chest. I got pins and needles all over my body and my throat started to swell. My vision went blurry, I spiked a fever, and my blood pressure tanked. The nurse was observing me for a reaction and immediately stopped the drug and called in my doctor. They pushed some other things and I almost had to have an epi pen but didn’t. It was pretty clear at this point that the Taxotere was not going to work for me. \n\nSo, the alternative to Taxotere that does not contain Polysorbate 80 is Abraxane, and now my doctor wants to switch me to that. BUT it’s every week, which means my 4-6 infusions of T/C every 3 weeks just became 12-18 weekly infusions of Abraxane with Cytoxan added every 3 weeks. It really feels like things escalated. The other complication is that Abraxane is much more expensive and my insurance is making my doctor jump through hoops in order to approve it. She tried to get it cleared yesterday but they want her to have a 1-on-1 convo with one of their doctors and couldn’t do that until today. So current plan is that my start of chemo is delayed until Tuesday. \n\nI am frustrated and wondering if anyone else has experienced allergic reactions and subsequent delays or increased infusions like this. I felt like I kind of had a handle on things and was starting to plan my life around the next few months of chemo, and now we are back to square one. And this is in the midst of a recurrence that’s been anything but straightforward with multiple surgeries, unable to get clear margins, dealing with lymphedema, needing to get re-radiated, and being told that I probably wouldn’t need chemo, then 4 infusions, and now 12-18 every single week. \n\nWhyyyy is cancer such a bitch sometimes.",

It needed insurance authorization, which CareFirst gave within 24 hours due to documented anaphylaxis and lack of success with a re-challenge--even on double dose Benadryl and two different steroids and at 1/6th the rate I was still getting hives and tachycardia. Then they had to track down some, because abraxane was rationed at that time (late 2021) due to manufacturer shortage. Somehow it all came together. I didn't have further problems and hopefully it will be the same for you! I think the weekly dose can be more annoying logistically but the side effects may actually be less since it's not dose-dense, and abraxane doesn't need steroids so you'll get rid of those effects too. For me it actually saved time because we were not having to constantly stop and start infusions and fiddle with the rate.",

    "body": "A few years ago, I went from having decent skin (almost no acne in high school) to having a god-awful cystic breakout all over my jawline & cheeks.  I blame stress and dehydration from the onset of the California drought.  Anyway, I sought a holistic method for years because I was too stubborn to see a doctor.  Eventually I did and they gave me an 8% BP face wash + retinol + antibiotic face cream.  After I developed my own mask, I only use the retinol every few days.\n\nThe short version is, I create a very basic liquid AHA peel that I put in a roller bottle and use once a day.  I also create a transparent-ish gel using hyaluronic acid, water-based botanical extracts, dead sea salt, & some other ingredients.  The AHA + the Retinol work in a pinch, but the gel exfoliates unlike anything I've ever bought in a store.  I smear it on and a few minutes later I am literally rolling dead skin off my face.  My pimples are visibly smaller after I've used it, I'm guessing because I've removed so many layers of dead skin that they literally have less substance.  \n\nI order my ingredients from three suppliers, [Brambleberry](http://www.brambleberry.com), [Making Cosmetics](http://www.makingcosmetics.com), and Amazon.  \n\nAHA peel:\n\n[4.5 tsp aloe vera liquid](http://www.brambleberry.com/Search.aspx?k=aloe+vera+liquid)\n\n[0.5 tsp fine grained dead sea salt](http://www.brambleberry.com/Fine-Grained-Dead-Sea-Salt-P4085.aspx)\n\n[0.9 tsp alpha hydroxy fruit acids](http://www.makingcosmetics.com/AHA-Fruit-Acids_p_50.html) (lower to 0.6 or 0.3 tsp if you have sensitive skin)\n\n[0.3 tsp fractionated coconut oil](http://www.amazon.com/Coconut-Fractionated-Carrier-Aromatherapy-Essential/dp/B00BFZFVW6/ref=sr_1_3?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1432449514&sr=1-3&keywords=fractionated+coconut+oil)\n\n[A few drops Polysorbate 80 to emulsify](http://www.brambleberry.com/Polysorbate-80-P4438.aspx)\n\n[Optiphen ND]\n(http://www.brambleberry.com/Optiphen-ND-P5714.aspx)\n\n[Triethanolamine](http://www.makingcosmetics.com/Triethanolamine_p_280.html) (pH adjuster)\n\n[Glass roll-on bottle](http://www.makingcosmetics.com/Glass-Roll-On-Sila_p_410.html)\n\n[pH indicator roll](http://www.makingcosmetics.com/pH-Indicator-Roll-0-6_p_338.html)\n\n[Plastic eye droppers](http://www.brambleberry.com/Droppers-With-Suction-Bulb-P3802.aspx)\n\nInstructions: in a small-ish bowl, mix dead sea salt into aloe vera liquid.  Add alpha hydroxy fruit acids.  In a separate, even smaller bowl, mix coconut oil with polysorbate 80.  It only needs a few drops; add a few more if the oil and the water keep separating.  After you've successfully emulsified, add a drop of Optiphen ND.  It's a preservative for water-based products and a little goes a long way.  Use the pH indicator paper to test acidity.  Add triethanolamine (TEA) drop by drop until the pH reaches 3.5.  Use a clean, disinfected eye dropper to transfer the completed peel into the roller bottle.\n\n\n\n\nNow for the hyaluronic gel.  This is going to be based on rough estimations because I've gotten so used to making it I rarely measure anything anymore.  I don't have any official container for this; I just keep it in the bowl I made it in and cover it with plastic wrap to keep it from thickening due to drying out.  I'll do my best to provide clear instructions, and if you have any questions feel free to ask!\n\nTake a small-ish bowl, maybe a few ounces, and fill it 1/2 - 3/4 full of aloe vera liquid.  Eyeball about 10% dead sea salt.  I also add \n\n[about 10% papain powder](http://www.amazon.com/Star-West-Papain-Powder/dp/B002DXZIUE), \n\n[10% DL-Panthenol](http://www.brambleberry.com/Search.aspx?k=DL+panthenol), \n\nand [10% Niacinamide](http://www.makingcosmetics.com/Vitamin-B3-Niacinamide_p_317.html).  \n\nI mix it with [hyaluronic acid](http://www.makingcosmetics.com/Hyaluronic-Acid_p_161.html) until it's got a syrupy consistency.  This step can be tricky and takes patience because hyaluronic acid is EXTREMELY hydrophilic and will form gelatinous clumps with a powdery center that take a lot of stirring to dissolve.  I have the best results when I dust the surface of the aloe liquid, creating a film, and mix it in.  The more even the consistency, the better the results on your skin.\n\nNext step -- oil!  I put 1/2 oz fractionated coconut oil into a tiny container and add\n\n[vitamin c](http://www.makingcosmetics.com/Vitamin-C-sodium-ascorbyl-phosphate_p_1040.html) in a water-stable form; I add as much as will dissolve in the coconut oil.\n\n[retinol palmitate](http://www.makingcosmetics.com/Vitamin-A-retinol-palmitate_p_319.html).  5-7 drops should do it.\n\nThen add a couple drops polysorbate 80.  I would use about 5-10% as much oil as you have hyaluronic gel.  The consistency is very important -- to much oil and you'll get a greasy face with hard little pellets of skin coming off -- super irritating, no bueno for skin.  Too much salt and you'll get a dry face with larger but crumbly clumps.  Too little hyaluronic acid and you'll just have a wet face.  Do it just right and you'll have fluffy, almost sticky clumps skin practically sloughing themselves off.  The best part is the even-toned skin that's dewy to the touch.  Fine-tune the proportions to your own needs; the ingredients come in small portions, but the amount you need them in is even smaller.\n\nWait 20 minutes between applying the AHA peel and any antioxidants including vitamin A & C.  Also, this applies all the time, but especially if you're exfoliating -- use a high SPF sunscreen if you do this during the daytime.  Or better yet, just do it at night.\n\nI hope this helps you as much as it helped me!",

    "body": "The Great Divide: spanning the chasm between truth and egregious lies. ~by Shawn Siegel\n\nThere’s not a mother alive who, once having ALL the available information, would allow anyone to vaccinate her child. A primary function of the bulk of the immune system, virtually always bypassed by injecting vaccines, is precisely to preclude such intrusions into the bloodstream.\n\nEvery vaccine is dangerous. Look at any picture of a child – in his or her nose, mouth, throat, the entire digestive tract, the respiratory and urogenital tracts and on the surface of the skin, there is an elegant, highly evolved immune system, designed to greet virtually all toxins and potentially pathogenic organisms – to eliminate them directly (1), or biochemically alter or change them (2), before they gain access to the bloodstream. Food proteins are broken down by the digestive process into their short-chain amino acids before entering the bloodstream, or food allergies and progressively much worse, chronic disorders can result (3). In its wildest imagination, medical science couldn’t hope to duplicate that process, and intramuscular injection of vaccines, which contain all of the above – disease antigens, neurotoxins and food proteins (4), not to mention unknown contaminants – assaults it. To vaccine proponents, it’s as though the biological reality, all that biochemical, metabolic immune busywork that kicks into gear upon natural exposure, to extract everything beneficial and eliminate or mitigate toxic intrusion into the circulatory system, can simply be overlooked, with no consequence. It’s as though there would be no consequence if air were injected directly into the bloodstream, instead of going through the respiratory process, where the oxygen is biologically extracted and passed on to blood cells.\n\nIronically, the only reason the paradigm continues is because the insult is so egregious. If after a vaccination your arm immediately atrophied, folks would get the point. Instead, many of the most often realized immediate and, in reality, alarming adverse effects are temporary, thus relatively easy to pass off simply as commonplace, and not worrisome, while the bulk of vaccine injury is autoimmune or neurological in nature, and typically well delayed from the fact of the vaccination. That delay is a weapon in the hands of the vaccine industry. It’s difficult for a lay parent, uneducated in the nature of vaccine adversity, to relate a reaction that displays even a few days after a vaccination, let alone a few weeks, to the vaccine itself, especially when, despite reams of information in available medical literature to the contrary, doctors themselves discount the connection. Meanwhile, immunologists tell us that it can take months, and even years, for adjuvant-induced autoimmune diseases to display (5); lupus, epilepsy, diabetes, asthma, blood disorders, arthritis, Guillain-Barré, encephalitis; autistic encephalitis (6).\n\nThat delay is the Great Divide, the temporal chasm separating the harsh reality of vaccination – the intentionally aberrant stimulation and defiance of such innate, embedded, essential capabilities as the natural mucosal immune system and the cauldron of digestive process – from widespread awareness of its consequences.\n\nLook around, however, and the consequences are obvious, for what we have is herd autoimmunity. The incidence of autoimmune and neurological disorders in the U.S., many of them seriously debilitating, some of them ultimately fatal, dwarfs the incidence of mortality or injury from infectious disease. The aluminum salt adjuvants in vaccines, by the current vaccination schedule administered sixteen times to a child before the age of two (7), have been tied in various studies to both autoimmune and neurological disorders (8)(9). Toxicologist Dr. Victor Vaughn testified to the FTC that aluminum salts are poisonous when injected (10). Adjuvants are used by researchers to study autoimmunity, because when injected into lab animals they trigger rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases (11). Mercury is still present and accounted for in multi-dose vials of flu vaccine (4), in full, preservative concentration, and most of the shots administered are from those vials – they’re cheaper per shot, thus more likely to be stocked by doctors, and the majority of vaccine recipients simply aren’t aware of the tremendous difference in mercury concentration, single dose versus multi. In TV coverage of a flu shot clinic held at an elementary school last winter, every kid was given a shot from a multi-dose vial. No doubt, the parents were denied any notification or meaningful warning of the mercury content. Mercury is present in trace amounts in several other vaccines, but while the CDC characterizes a trace as a…biologically unpersuasive…amount, there truly are no known lower safety limits for injected toxins. Nor could there be, since every child is individual, with unique genetics, unique metabolism, unique exposure history and diet – there’s absolutely no way to accurately predict what any child’s reaction will be, so the precautionary principle alone precludes injecting it. Moreover, at one point some years ago, a public health advocate website sent four vaccine samples to a lab for analysis; two of the samples were labeled as containing a trace of thimerosal, two as containing none, but mercury was detected in all four samples (12). While there was a significantly lower concentration in the samples ostensibly containing no thimerosal, again: there are no known lower safety limits for injected toxins.\n\nAluminum and mercury work in synergy – their combined neurotoxicity is many times greater than the sum of their individual threats (13) – and at six months of age there are literally millions of babies given both in essence simultaneously, at a vaccination schedule compliance surveillance session, euphemistically labeled a wellness visit, which includes both the flu shot and several other vaccines. At eighteen months, it’s repeated (7).\n\nIn the U.S., mortality from infectious disease was down in the single digits per 100,000 in the general population well before the vaccines were introduced (14). Given good nutrition and healthy living condition, the vast majority of people who develop infectious diseases come out unscathed, recovered to normal health (15).\n\nMeanwhile, 1 in 6 kids has a learning disorder, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile diabetes, asthma, potentially life-threatening allergies, are all skyrocketing when compared with the incidence only a few decades ago. The recent official announcement of the autism rate was 1 in 68, but the database used to calculate that number was from several years ago, already outdated. There’s been no sign of a plateau, and if the current rate of annual increase continues unabated, in only three years 1 in 10 boys will be diagnosed on the autism spectrum(16). Five years later it’ll be 1 in 5 boys, and about 1 in 25 girls. The CDC is well aware of the apparently uncontrollable tide, yet each time the number is updated feigns surprise, or apparent lack of concern, or we see yet another spate of research, such as a recent study linking autism to environmental factors in the womb – but always with careful, deliberate avoidance of any mention of vaccines as even a possible causal factor.\n\nWhen you consider the possible outcome only two generations down the line, the effect in every way imaginable of the inexorable degradation of the nation’s physical health and mental acuity is beyond description. Tsunami doesn’t even do it justice. If a nation’s very ability to achieve degrades, it ultimately cannot survive. There are undoubtedly many factors, from the psychotropics dripping from us into our water supply, to genetically modified foods that have then had the nutrients processed out of them. But there’s only one direct injury to the natural function of the immune system, and that’s vaccination – intramuscular injection – with its accompanying mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, cell cultures from human fetuses, polysorbate 80, neomycin, MSG, ethanol, food proteins and unknown contaminants. There’s an ingredient in three of the available flu vaccines (4), Triton X-100, the information for which on the manufacturer’s website (17) includes the following hazard statement (18):\n\nH302: Harmful if swallowed / Acute toxicity, oral\n\nThis is madness, to routinely inject a substance acutely toxic when ingested, bypassing the very reactions designed to protect the bloodstream from such a threat. Were the toxin ingested, the most immediate immune reaction would likely be elimination, from the stomach or the bowels, possibly through rash, and the like. Other metabolic processes would continue, including at least partial detoxification by the liver, before the substance entered the circulatory system. Vaccination deposits vaccine ingredients directly into the capillary beds of the muscles, from which they’re quickly absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\nThe now routine vaccination of pregnant women with both the flu and Tdap vaccines is a relatively recent but definitive muddying of the waters. As likely as not that those women are receiving flu shots from multidose vials, which contain 25 mcg of mercury per dose, and the Tdap carries its own toxic load; aluminum, formaldehyde and more. It’s well known that the fetus can be catastrophically affected by maternal toxins passed to the umbilical cord, through the placenta. This was demonstrated fifty years ago by Minamata disease; mercury poisoning from fish heavily contaminated by waste water from a chemical plant in Minamata, Japan. Some infants were born with it – and, in a bizarre twist of fate, the pregnant mothers were less affected, having passed the toxic mercury on to their babies. (19)(20). It’s obfuscatory enough when vaccines are administered within hours of birth, precluding a before and after picture; precluding a memory of the normal child when things go wrong. We are now fostering neurological damage in the unborn, as well.\n\nThe immune system functions on a molecular level, but I liken it to an automobile engine: vaccination’s like sifting a handful of detritus into the carburetor, on the wrong side of the fuel filter, and expecting the car to run better as a result – and when later that day or the next morning the engine sputters, or stalls, or dies, your mechanic, who not only advised but insisted on the procedure in the first place, tells you assuredly that there’s no connection; to bring the car back in, for additional repair – for this unexpected, new problem. As a realistic mechanical scenario, it’s obviously preposterous, but as it relates to vaccination, it’s an all too accurate analogy. Where there should be discernment and recognition of the possibility of causative relation between the procedure and its consequences, there is instead that divide, that chasm, that erosion, that space created by the delay in display of vaccine-induced autoimmune and neurological disorders, the constant mainstream of misinformation and the withholding of so much critical information, now littered, like some macabre landfill, with the unwarranted fear of disease, the ceaseless falsity of the myth of vaccine safety and efficacy, and the social coercion of the absurdity that is the idea of herd immunity through vaccination.\n\nAbout the author: Shawn Siegel has enough common sense to recognize a con game when he sees one, thus was compelled to begin researching after discovering that immediately following the release of the polio vaccine the CDC radically changed the definition of the disease.

    "body": "In my country we don't have anybody selling Cromollient SCE, Polyglyceryl 4-oleate or CreamMaker Fluid. I do have access to Polysorbate 80 , but that stings my eyes so much! The emulsifier I have available are: Polysorbate (20,60,80), Emulsifying wax (NF,BP),BTMS-50,Olivem 1000. That means imo,  that fluid oil cleanser is not doable ( if anyone has suggestions please let me know)\n\nSo, I am going to be using the list of [this](https://www.earthrhythm.com/collections/cleansing-balms/products/healing-cleansing-balm-with-propolis) that washes off well as my guide:\n\nCetearyl Olivate (and) Sorbitan Olivate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Diheptyl Succinate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic, Ricinus communis (Castor) Seed Oil , Propolis Extract, Stearic Acid, Water\\Aqua\\Eau , Tocopherol, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Water (aqua), Benzyl Alcohol (and) Salicylic Acid (and) Glycerin (and) Sorbic Acid & Grapefruit & Lemon Oil\n\nSo what I deduced from the list:\nCetearyl Olivate (and) Sorbitan Olivate = Olivem 1000\n\nDiheptyl Succinate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic = LuxGlide N350(natural Dimethicone alternative)\n\nBenzyl Alcohol (and) Salicylic Acid (and) Glycerin (and) Sorbic Acid = Preservative\n\nMy plan is to formulate without any of the extracts and Dimethicone so: Olivem 1000, Sunflower and Castor oil, Stearic acid, Tocopherol and Liquid Germall.\n\nI haven't worked out the percentages yet  but I am thinking 15% Olivem 1000 should work maybe?\nAlso do you'll think leaving out the Dimethicone is a good idea? I am leaving out the extracts because I don't think they do much in a wash-off product, but if there are any ingredients that do work, I am open trying it out.\n\nIn the end all I want is an oil cleanser that completly washes off. I have seen so many cleansing balm recipes that call for using a muslin cloth to remove the oil and I hate the idea of washing so many cloths(I am lazy, sue me!) \n\nSorry for the long post:-)",

The commenters recommend replacing the total percentage of polawax/polysorbate 80 with olivem 1000, so 11%, if you wanted to do that. Maybe this post will help you decide on your percentages as well.\n\nThe dimethicone is probably unnecessary, just there to increase spreadability, and I would agree that extracts probably aren't on the skin long enough in a wash off product to have any real benfit.\n\n(Also I want to add I really appreciate the amount of detail in your post and the research you've already put into it!)",

    "body": "I’ve made a few mistakes in my life. Hell, maybe more than a few. Somewhere between a handful and a fuck-ton is probably a good estimation. I think the issue is I put my trust in the wrong places, but I’m just trying to navigate the world as best I can like everyone else. My sister always said I’m more gullible than I should be at my age - very suggestible is a nicer way to put it I think. My beliefs and convictions are like loose flower petals on a gusty day - they drift in whatever way the wind pushes them. One moment I’m floating east, the wind changes direction, and now I’m floating west. One day, I’ll believe in climate change, then I listen to a certain popular podcast, and now I think it’s a hoax. I know, it’s pathetic. I swear to God I’ll change if I can make it through this year, but I’ve exhausted my savings, and the pills are running out. I can hear them all skittering and slamming all around me, just out of sight, waiting for the effects of the medication to wear off.\n\nIt all started a few weeks ago. My life was unremarkable then, but at least it was normal. I had a cushy job at a local tech company, the same one I’ve had for the last five years. Reasonable hours, good benefits plan, 6 weeks of paid time off - I lived comfortably but noticeably alone. No wife, no girlfriend. I wasn’t born with a lot of charm. I was never very proficient at initiating pleasantries, and even if I did manage to start a conversation with a lady, I couldn’t find the words to maintain it. Of course, that would all be one thing if I was some hulking adonis, smooth and chiseled and all that - maybe then I could have compensated for my lack of a silver tongue. But I was never able to grow any muscle despite my efforts. I bought and tried a lot of different supplements that were supposed to help stimulate growth. Powders with names like “Muscle Matrix” and “Crazy Muscle”. They never did a damn thing, even put me in the hospital one time for kidney damage. Retrospectively, I should have also been working out while on those supplements. I wanted to wait until the supplements started having an effect before I began really working out.\n\nTerrible cystic acne was the icing on top. Red, painful craters had littered my face since I turned 16. Tried everything for that too - bee venom, reiki, power juicing. Nothing I was recommended online seemed to have the desired effect. And it all gave me the impression that I was utterly unworthy in comparison to other guys my age. I could feel myself starting to give up on a life that was more fulfilling than the one I already had, and on companionship in general. Then, I saw the ad pop on my Facebook page. It promised to fix me, and I fell for it. Hook, line, and sinker. \n\nIt read something like this:\n\n*Do you have trouble attracting women? Unable to catch a vixen’s eye from all the way at the other end of the bar? Does your mere presence in a room inspire overwhelming, knee-buckling repulsion from any potential mates? Before the modern age, there were no solutions. Lonely devils would go to their doctors, looking for salvation, only instead to be told there was nothing else to be done - Western Medicine cursing them to die alone. But we don’t live in the past, do we, dear friends? With major advancements in natural attraction technology, Lucius Bartleby, Ph.D., is proud to announce: Zygentra Ultimate, the miracle medication for the misbegotten common man. With Zygentra Ultimate, even the lowliest bachelor has hope for a happy ending. One pill is all it takes to change everything about you.* \n\nIn big, confident words, the bottom said:\n\n*One payment, one pill - one solution to the problem of you. Email* [*zygentraNOW@gmail.com*](mailto:zygentraNOW@gmail.com) *for details.*\n\nEven though the advertisement didn’t even mention what it would fix about me, I was intrigued. The ad had all the buzz words - “miracle”, “technology”, “happy ending”. Their distrust of Western Medicine hit close to home, too. As far as I was concerned, doctors were pill pushers controlled by pharmaceutical companies that pulled their marionette strings from the shadows. I mean, what was in the pills they recommended anyway? And for that matter, why can’t I pronounce half the compounds that make up vaccines? Thiomersal, Polysorbate 80 - I mean formaldehyde, for Christ’s sake. It all felt so artificial and unsafe. But this advertisement seemed to promote something more “of the earth” and \"organic\", the so-called “natural attraction technology”. Tired of being lonely and unworthy, I emailed the company. \n\nLike I said, hook, line, and sinker. Biggest mistake of my life.\n\nIn my message to the company, I tried to perform my due diligence in vetting the supplement. What was in it? How much was the supplement? Would it interact with the Chinese muscle-enhancing herbs I ordered the week before? \n\nThis was their response, copy-pasted from my Gmail:\n\n*Greetings Zach,*\n\n*Thank you for your interest in Zygentra Ultimate. One pill, one payment, one solution to the problem of you.* \n\n*To clarify, Zygentra is a medication, not a supplement - though no matter what you call it, it is a miracle. Through a proprietary mechanism of action that utilizes the wonders of CRISPR technology, Zygentra enables the human body to naturally self-regulate the hormonal disequilibriums that are to blame for a variety of male inequities: it can resolve poor muscle growth, weak libidos, erectile dysfunction, and a bevy of disfiguring skin conditions including but not limited to: seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, lichen planus simplex, and cystic acne.* \n\n*Unfortunately, the future is not always affordable, and it is rarely covered by insurance. Thankfully, this one-time cost can last upwards of a year, if not much longer. Zygentra essentially teaches your body to produce life-changing pheromones that are genetically transplanted from the naturally occurring Lepisma saccharium species. In short - one pill is all you need.* \n\n*Zygentra Ultimate can solve the problem of you with a one-time payment of 30,000 US dollars. We do not accept payment plans. Also, for obvious reasons, we recommend all of our clients relocate prior to taking their dose; Antarctica is preferable, but Northern Canada is a reasonable alternative.* \n\n*Please let us know if you are planning to pursue a happy ending. If so, we can help set up a wire transfer.* \n\n*Amy,*\n\n*Senior Sales Associate and Miracleworker at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals* \n\n\n\nI had to pick my jaw off the floor after I finished quickly scanning the email, skipping over the scientific mumbo-jumbo to find the price point. They seriously wanted me to pay 30,000 dollars, one lump sum, for this supplement. It wasn’t that I couldn’t afford the payment - I could, but barely, utilizing a nest egg my mom left for me after she passed. It was just an obscene amount of money. But it certainly was alluring - one pill that would fix my body, or I guess teach it to fix itself, naturally? Was that even possible? When I thought about it more, the exorbitant fee made it feel more legitimate, like I was paying for cutting-edge technology that actually could work. Wouldn’t the Better Business Bureau prevent a company from selling a product for much more than it was worth? Wasn’t that illegal? \n\nTo speed things up, I’ll skip the part where I contemplated my options, did a lot of online research, and signed a waiver that Amy mailed to me. Two weeks later, the singular pill arrived in an icebox as an overnight shipment from the Delfoy Pharmaceuticals headquarters. Amy told me they needed to keep it cold. \n\nIt wasn’t like any pill I had taken before. The supplement more resembled an extra-large piece of caviar - gelatinous and orb-shaped. The box had no instructions, so I shrugged my shoulders and ingested it, using a swig of the nearest open Mountain Dew to wash it down. Initially, I had some regrets about the purchase. But with it now in my system, that regret morphed into excitement.\n\nI was ready not to be alone anymore. \n\nNo big change the first few days. Maybe I really was a sap, I thought. But one morning, while looking in the mirror, I noticed it - my skin was clearing up like it never had before. More than that, I felt virile and confident, seemingly out of the blue. My muscles even began to look more toned. It was a state of being entirely new to me, and at first, it was incredible. I finally felt confident and like I was worthy of affection. Riding that sensation for all it was worth, I asked Stacy, an attractive coworker, on a dinner date. I had fantasized about asking her out for what seemed like my entire life. She said yes. The ecstasy I experienced after that moment was unparalleled. It was like some heavy, invisible weights had been taken off my shoulders. We planned a dinner date at a local Italian place later that week. With the supplement coursing through my veins, I felt unstoppable and was pleasantly surprised about the lack of side effects. I had experienced some new floaters in my peripheral vision and mild armpit pain, but that was it.\n\nAt first, the date was everything I could have hoped for. Stacy always had an aura of kindness about her - she was angelic, honestly. It’s what drew me towards her in the first place. Even though I secured the date, I was still nervous about my ability to keep up a conversation through the meal. To my surprise, it wasn’t difficult. Because I was different, improved by the supplement, I guess I just wasn’t as fearful of rejection anymore. As the date progressed, I was shocked to find out that Stacy had also been stockpiling the courage to ask me on a date:\n\n*“Over the last week? Since I started my new skin regimen, I mean.”* I said, choking on the last few words because I was never very good at lying. I didn’t want to scare Stacy off by volunteering the information that I had recently purged my bank accounts to pay for Zygentra. \n\nShe giggled, a cute and tiny laugh that made my heart swell with affection. I think she was under the impression that the part about the skin regimen was a playful joke. Then she said something that made my head spin:\n\n*“No, nothing to do with whatever new moisturizer you invested in. And a lot longer than just this week. For at least a year, I think. I always found you handsome, and you were always respectful and polite to me and everyone else in the office - a good sign of character. You were just quiet and reserved. I couldn’t tell if you’d say yes if I asked, so I never did. A bit childish and cowardly, I know, but sometimes I just feel small and out of place in the world, if that makes any sense.”* remarked Stacy, eyes diverting from mine while she made this confession.  \n\nHer words felt familiar - or maybe not her words; it was the way she put the words together. The underlying self-deprecation, I mean. She had some venomous monologue playing on loop in her head, just like I did. Broke my heart at first, and I wasn’t sure how to respond. But I noticed at that moment that I felt a little less lonely for the first time in my adult life. I smiled, met her eyes, and came up with the most ornate, reverent statement I could to comfort her and let her know I understood:\n\n*“You’re an absolute vision, Stacy. Like, you’re radiant. I’m sorry it’s hard for you to see it sometimes, but I really get that pain.”*\n\nThe expression on her face changed, now warm and relaxed, and I could tell I actually did manage to console her. I got lost in that moment then, in the beautiful comfort of it. Even as I type it up, I find myself getting lost in the memory of it. But something abruptly pulled me out of the moment then, and it’s the same thing that’s pulling me out of its memory now: terrible, skittering things on the outskirts of my vision. \n\nIn the restaurant, I was experiencing worsening floaters in my periphery, but I was too transfixed on Stacy to notice something was off - that maybe they weren’t just floaters. As our dessert arrived, I felt something vibrating in the sole of my dress shoe. It really gave me a start, and I reflexively stomped my right foot into the floor, surprising Stacy in turn. I took off my shoe to examine its contents, only to find the crushed body of a silverfish. Its greyish carapace was split into three asymmetric pieces from the force of my stomp. Each piece was still wriggling a little bit, and I felt nausea rise in my stomach. \n\nIt was bigger than any silverfish I’d ever seen before, too. In my experience, they never grew larger than an inch. This silverfish was easily 5 inches long, if not more. I could count at least 20 other, equally large silverfish crawling around in a wobbly circle, with me as the center. Before I killed the insect in my shoe, the other dinnergoers had noticed the bugs and were flagging down restaurant staff to complain. At first, I was with them - what kind of restaurant serves food with this type of infestation? It took the tickling, wriggling feeling of something crawling up my left pant leg to cause me to re-evaluate the situation. \n\nWildly, I made a circle with my thumb and index finger and tightened it around my knee, pushing down the length of my calf in an attempt to expel what I knew were more silverfish before they found their way higher up into my pants. When my palm first connected with my knee, I felt a sickening crunch under the tip of my index finger. The maneuver pushed out three silverfish in total, one headless from being caught in the crossfire of my hand meeting my knee. When I looked up, the restaurant was in a state of pandemonium. At that point, there were definitely more than 20, maybe 100 or 200, silverfish radiating in a circle around me. It finally registered - whatever was happening, I was the cause, and I hadn’t been experiencing floaters before - I was seeing silverfish skittering quickly around in my peripheral vision. \n\nI shot up from my chair, frightening Stacy again, accompanied by the sensation of another crunch in the shoe I hadn’t yet taken off. I said something to my date, couldn’t tell you what, and I excused myself from the table while moving towards the door. Outside in the parking lot, I began sprinting to my car with only one shoe on; but then I remembered that I had driven Stacy here. I briefly turned around to get her, but I could see gleaming silver little bullets racing to catch up to me on the asphalt, lit up by the sparkle of parking lot lights. I U-turned and sprinted even faster to my car, got in, and just started driving. After 15 minutes, I pulled over and urgently emailed Delfoy Pharmaceuticals from my phone. I wanted to know how to reverse the effects of Zygentra Ultimate.\n\nNot long after I parked, I began to see silverfish on the front windshield, leaking into the car through whatever cracks they could find. I floored it, but it was in a park, so I went nowhere. For the third time that night, I again felt the snap of their brittle bodies against my foot, having just crushed another two silverfish. A moment later, I felt one making its way up my left earlobe. I whipped my head to the right so hard that my neck would later be painfully sore, but the force managed to launch a silverfish off my ear to somewhere in the back of my Sudan. Putting the car in drive, I exploded down the country road I had parked on. I kept driving, killing silverfish as I went, till I heard the sound of an inbox notification come from my iphone, which was about two hours after I had sent the email:\n\n*Hello Zach,*\n\n*I am sorry to hear you are disappointed with our product. Unfortunately, there is no reversal agent for Zygentra Ultimate. I thought I made this very clear in our introductory email, and you did sign a release saying you understood the risk-benefit profile of the medication.* \n\n*To re-explain, Zygentra Ultimate utilizes CRISPR technology to give the human body the ability to produce pheromones from Lepisma saccharium, the most common species of silverfish in America. Laboratory studies have shown that these pheromones can help with male sexual dysfunction and certain skin conditions due to an anti-inflammatory effect. As you must know, pheromones are designed to attract members of the opposite sex of the species producing them. It is basically a big sign around an animal’s neck saying: “I am ready to mate”. This is why we recommend relocation to Northern Canada or Antarctica in conjunction with Zygentra Ultimate - these are some of the few areas in the world that Lepisma saccharium do not naturally inhabit.* \n\n*The medication is not reversible, however, because CRISPR is gene-editing technology - the reason your body “learns” to create the foreign hormones is because Zygentra Ultimate inserts the pheromone-producing silverfish DNA into your genetic code. How else would one pill cause an effect lasting a year or more? Additionally, the armpit pain you are experiencing is most likely the rapid growth of modified glandular tissue responsible for producing the silverfish pheromones.* \n\n*I still recommend considering physical relocation, I hear the Yukon is wonderful this time of year! The alternate solution would be to invest in Zygentra Plus, which can help mitigate some of the silverfish-attracting side effects of Zygentra Ultimate. We recognize that this is an emergency situation, and Defloy Pharmaceuticals is always willing to help where we can! We have urgently shipped a 48-hour trial supply of Zygentra Plus to your home, for free.* \n\n*Please consider your options and get back to us. If you would like to purchase additional Zygentra Plus, a week’s supply costs $750, with a 5 percent discount if you purchase the medication in bulk.*\n\n*Amy,*\n\n*Senior Sales Associate and Miracleworker at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals* \n\n\n\nWhen I received this email, I had a grand total of 3,500 dollars to my name. Desperation hit me like an avalanche, I felt like I was buried in an instant. A little under 4 grand was nowhere near the funds I would need to move from Miami to Northern Canada. Relocating would also force me to quit my job, and I didn’t want to leave Stacy behind. Retrospectively, I should have just used that money to move myself and my shitty car as far north as it would take me. \n\nWhen Zygentra Plus finally arrived five days later, I was beyond sleep-deprived. I had called out of work that week, as I certainly couldn’t come in and work on code as the fucking pied piper of silverfish. I spent that time driving around, stopping only when I felt myself drifting into sleep at the wheel. I would pull over to wherever I could and close my eyes, but before long, the sensation of silverfish crawling into my mouth or between my armpits would wake me up with a start, like I had jabbed myself with an adrenaline shot - at which point I would resume driving. No amount of insect repellant spray or mouse traps seemed to prevent the legion from getting to me. \n\nI hastily unpackaged the box containing the pro bono Zygentra Plus. The instructions on the supplement were: *take four pills by mouth every two hours*. Every two fucking hours. It did work at keeping the bugs away, but only if I religiously took the medication as instructed, which only served to minimally improve my sleep deprivation. I needed to return to work, but that ended up being a mistake, too. I had ditched Stacy on our first date without explanation and then proceeded not to talk to her for a week while I was driving around in circles, waiting for the Zygentra Plus to arrive. When she saw me again at work, I had dark circles around my bloodshot eyes the size of trash bags, and I nervously scanned my surroundings for silverfish. She said hello to me, and I don’t think I said hello back. Instead, I opted to launch into a minute-by-minute retelling of my last week. What I told her was an incoherent mess. Stacy nodded along politely to my tale, but I could see fear and concern rising in her eyes. Eventually, I gave her mercy, excused myself in the middle of a sentence, and pitifully returned to my desk. I dragged my body through about half of a workday before the side effects of Zygentra Plus started.\n\nOut of nowhere, I felt my mouth fill uncomfortably with saliva. When I tried to sip my morning coffee, dribble would involuntarily spill out of my mouth, down my chin and onto my shirt collar. Before long, I had a half-crescent of soaked fabric around my neck despite my efforts to keep my mouth closed at all times. Next, my eyes began watering uncontrollably, making it look like I was quietly sobbing all through the morning. The final straw was when I took my hand off my coffee cup, only to have a thin layer of palm skin remain stuck to the grip, peeling from my hand and causing immense and immediate pain. I screamed. And then, of course, there was a lot of bleeding. In a panic, I hastily left my desk without saying a word, no doubt leaving behind plenty of tears, saliva, skin and blood. My boss caught up and confronted me about my behavior before I could leave the building. I tried to say something, but saliva just erupted from my mouth instead. I probably looked rabid.\n\nI didn't come back to work the next day, or the following day. A few days after that, a message on my cellphone answering machine told me I was fired.\n\nAmy, resident miracle worker at Defloy Pharmaceuticals, wasn’t much help with the situation. I let her know that, although Zygentra Plus was helping keep the insects away, the side effects from it weren’t much more bearable. The excess saliva and tears were one thing, but pieces of my skin were sloughing off with the slightest manipulation like I was some human danish. And I still wasn’t sleeping - I needed to set multiple alarms to get myself up every two hours to take the new medication; otherwise, the silverfish would be back. She explained to me that this was expected, as Zygentra Plus acted as a low-dose insecticide that I was digesting and releasing into the air around me from my pores or what was left of them. At the brink of insanity, I demanded to speak with “Lucius Bartleby”, the supposed genius creator and mind behind the Zygentra line of products mentioned in the original advertisement. I thought maybe he would have an elegant solution to all of this. In response, Amy said, and I quote:\n\n*“Well, that will be impossible. Lucius Bartleby is more of an idea than a person. Here at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals, we all aspire to achieve the goals that Dr. Bartleby represents. Also, it seems to help with sales.”*\n\nBut don’t worry, she said, there was still something to be done - Amy theorized that drastically increasing my zinc levels might mitigate some of the symptoms from Zygentra Plus. I spent my last 500 dollars on that supplement, unsure of what I would do next, even if it did help. But I needed relief. Moreover, I needed to keep taking the pills because I was terrified of what would happen to me when I ran out, and the silverfish came back. My car was out of gas, my skin was breaking down, I was jobless and nearly out of money. If they returned, I would have limited defenses and nowhere to hide. I'm not particularly eager to think about what would happen to me.\n\nThe zinc supplement was a purple-reddish liquid that I was instructed to drink once a day. I voraciously gulped it down, immediately experiencing excruciating pain from my lips to deep in my chest. I would come to learn that the compound I drank, Zinc Hydrosulfide, is a very strong acid. I stared at the words “strong acid” in the email, dumbfounded, with blood and saliva dripping from my scalded mouth onto the screen. Amy then offered a subdermal injection to help me tolerate the Zinc Hydrosulfide, and I just started laughing. Must have been laughing for a while, because when my laughing slowed down I started to see silver floaters in my periphery again, meaning I was due for my next dose of Zygentra Plus.\n\nI could barely swallow the pills after what the liquid had done to my mouth and esophagus, almost passing out from the pain. Even if I had the money to pay for the 2,000-dollar subdermal injection, which I do not, I have no idea where I would even inject it into. Didn’t have much of a “dermis” left after the effects of Zygentra Plus, which had liberated me from a good portion of my skin. \n\nEffectively, I am now stuck. The acidic liquid that was supposed to help with the side effects from the pills has now prevented me from taking *any* pills, or at least has made it a great deal harder and more painful. The medication that would help me to tolerate the acidic liquid was no good either - the pills had dissolved the skin that it was supposed to be injected under. Perhaps most critically of all, I am now broke. \n\nThought about going to the hospital - some combination of fear and shame prevented me from doing that. Calling an ambulance may be my next move, but I’m not sure they can do anything for me now. The silverfish will find me no matter where I am, I’m sure there are plenty lurking unseen in the cracks and crevices of the hospital. Plus, who knows if the medications they'd give me would interact with the supplements.\n\nSo, with about 12 hours of my oral insecticide left, I have decided to throw a bit of a Hail Mary. Has anyone else taken Zygentra Ultimate before and knows how to reverse it? Or at least have a homeopathic remedy to help stop the bugs?\n\n  \nMore stories: [https://linktr.ee/unalloyedsainttrina](https://linktr.ee/unalloyedsainttrina)",

When choosing an emulsifier for a oil cleanser does it need to be an oil in water emulsifier?\n\nCan I add in gentle surfacants like coco betaine so that it starts to bubble up a little when water is added and rinses easier? Or would it be useless in an oil cleanser?\n\nIf I were to add more wetting agents to the oil cleanser like glycerin would it help with seperation?\n\nWould sepiplus 400 work in an oil cleanser?\n\nHas anyone made an oil cleanser with different emulsifiers and if so what do you think worked best?

It's a very gentle exfoliation when I massage the oil on my face; after I add water the oats & clay seem to help gently cleanse my skin without any irritation I can get from foaming cleansers.\n\nI also made a cleansing oil with Cromollient SCE and BTMS-50 based on this [Humblebee & me formula](https://www.humblebeeandme.com/green-tea-cleansing-oil/). Instead of the extracts I used colloidal oats and kaolin clay. It was kind of a pain in the ass, and I don't think the payoff was worth it for a regular cleansing oil but it did work really nicely as a scalp cleansing oil. I'm trying to decide if it's worth making another batch, I wind up using way more than I do on my face so it's more of an occasional scalp treatment.",

Understanding what type of exfoliating ingredients your skin might need, at what percentage, and how often can be an exhausting process.\n\nEven after playing with different products for a couple of years...I still find myself accidentally over-exfoliating. That ended up being the case with the Krave Beauty Kale-Lalu-yAHA. \n\nFIrst things first, this exfoliating fluid is a lovely thin and watery texture which makes it easy to apply/swipe on using a cotton pad. While a watery acid based toner isn’t that hard to come by...it’s the Kale-Lalu-yAHA’s lack of stickiness or residue that impressed me.\n\nFrom there...5.25% glycolic acid goes to work in removing dead skin cells, reducing dark spots, and all of the other wonderful benefits that AHA products provide. Krave takes it a bit further by including aloe for hydration/soothing, plus a farmers market worth of antioxidant rich greens.\n\nMy first application of this product did include a slight tingling, but it faded rather quickly. The next morning I was stunned to see skin that was noticeably brighter and refined...Kale-Lalu-yAHA works quickly! All of this without irritation...so I made the mistake so many of us make by adding it to my routine every other day.\n\nThis turned out to be way too much for my skin and after that first week or so my skin was feeling raw, looking red, and generally pissed. Luckily I had some great soothing products to turn to and was able to regain control fairly quickly (Beauty of Joseon Calming Serum and Centella Sheet Masks).\n\nEven though this amazing AHA product is fairly gentle and packed with skin supporting ingredients...it is still potent enough to approach with a bit of caution and ease. Once a week or even once every other week might be just fine for some, while others will want to bump the frequency up as they go.\n\nFor me, I’ll be sticking to twice a week with a couple/few days off in between. The last few weeks with this toner have been amazing now that I have a rhythm down and it really has become one of my favorite AHA toners/fluids.\n\nI don’t know why I assumed Krave/Liah Yoo would release an exfoliation product that might be less powerful than some others I have used/geared towards ultra-sensitive skin...but it seems they aren't playing around lol! \n\nFull Ingredients List: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Water, Butylene Glycol, Brassica Oleracea Acephala Leaf (Kale) Extract, Glycolic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Spinacia Oleracea (Spinach) Leaf Extract, Carum Petroselinum (Parsley) Extract, Chlorella Minutissima Extract, Malus Domestica Fruit (Green Apple) Extract, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Betaine Salicylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Pseudozyma Epicola/Camellia Sinensis Seed Oil/Glucose/Yeast Extract Ferment Filtrate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Bacillus/Folic Acid/Soybean Ferment Extract, Coptis Japonica Root Extract, Malachite Extract, Polysorbate 80, Disodium EDT\n\nWhere To Buy (Krave Beauty Site - $25.00 USD - 200ml): [https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/kale-lalu-yaha](https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/kale-lalu-yaha) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8oh8gu7gyxv51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19e15d18ac50ee113ab8c397e95dec25501d190e",

I have sensitive skin that is easily inflamed and am using tretinoin. I still have some texture and wanted to incorporate gentle exfoliation for once a week use. Thanks for this review - looks like I'll be adding this to my regimen.",

    "body": "Thanks so much for your support! Now that we have legislators in multiple states thoroughly in our pockets, we can focus more intently on our next target: YOU!!!\n\nWe need to make sure you are up-to-date on ALL of the vaccines in the CDC's Childhood Vaccination Schedule. If there's a vaccine for it, and it's required for children, that must mean it's necessary for adults who come in contact with children, too.\n\nForget that \"Adult Schedule.\" Fair is fair.\n\nRoll up your sleeves, America. You adults will all need to be vaccinated on exactly the same schedule as infants and children. That means in the next 15 months you will be receiving 37 doses of 16 vaccines. At some of your \"well-adult visits\" you will receive 10-11 vaccines at the same time. They haven't been studied that way for synergistic effects, but you don't have to worry. Unlike all other medications, vaccines are so safe that we just know there couldn't possibly be any interactions between them or their ingredients. \n\nWe don't need to study that scientifically.\nWe believe in vaccines.\nWe insist you believe in them, too.\n\nOh... and pay no attention to those pesky vaccine manufacturers' inserts. You know... the ones that list all the ingredients... things like thimerosal, aluminum, formaldehyde, polysorbate 80 and those other things the MSDS says are \"carcinogenic\" and \"mutagenic.\" And the stuff about not being tested for effects on fertility? You weren't planning to have more children anyway, right?\n\nOh, and in the interest of disclosure.... we have to tell you... on the off-chance that you suffer a stroke, or lose your ability to walk, or talk, or feed yourself, or use a toilet... We need to let you know now that none of those things will be related to the vaccines. Coincidence happens and you need to be prepared for it.\n\nThere won't be any use in you trying to sue. We're protected from liability by the U.S. Government, so when \"coincidence\" happens, don't waste your time trying to find a lawyer. Even if you could still work and were able to afford one, there's nothing they can do. We're untouchable.\n\nSincerely, The CDC, your doctor, your local health department, the pharmacist at CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, and the grocery store, the people in China and India working in the filthy factories where vaccines and their components are made. Oh, and all the guys making the big bucks at your friendly pharmaceutical companies.\n\n#VaxTruth #VaxXed #DidYouKnow #InformedConsent",
