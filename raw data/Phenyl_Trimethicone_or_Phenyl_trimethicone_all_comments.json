    "body": "I think it’s a good idea to list all of the newly reformulated sunscreens of the failed Korean sunscreens. The new formulas look promising and many of the brands are being extra careful this time with independent testing, so we can be 100% confident that these sunscreens are the labeled SPF. I will list the sunscreens that I have came across that have been reformulated. If I missed any, leave them in the comments below.\n\n1.) ***Round Lab Birch Juice Sun Cream***\n\n* **Old version:**\n\n1. Manufacturer: Green Cos\n2. UV Filters (2):  Uvinal A Plus, Tinosorb S\n3.

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M.

Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

    "body": "I have **combination skin with an oily T-zone and dry acne prone cheeks laden with PIH**, an aftermath of 2020 and some wrong skincare choices. Since I am acne prone, I try to avoid perfume/fragrance, alcohol and essential oils in my products. \n\n*Processing img thx4k3izjnf61...*\n\nI have tried a bunch of sunscreens and these are the **best ones** I have settled on after a long 2 years of trial and error and time/money/effort invested. I have tried to include the swatches of all the four sunscreens and the white cast whereever it was possible (suncros) for the camera to capture. Lets begin.\n\nProduct Name: **Suncros Soft Matte Finish Gel, SPF 50, PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave\n\nAvailability in India: Easily Available in India, offline and online.\n\nIngredient list: Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nSunscreen type: Physical / Mineral \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zgtf9w6knf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0796b78286edcc7126df7421f34ae34c3ae1c7c8\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using this sunscreen since almost one year. I used to use UV Doux before this for as long as I can remember, but had to stop using it as my skin got really sensitive and I had damaged my skin barrier. \n\nYou definitely cannot use the recommended two fingers of sunscreen with this one as it gets really heavy and suffocating. I tried layering it in small amounts (maybe just one fingertip at a time), let that settle and then apply another fingertip. I could only do two fingertips with this one. It did work for my extremely sensitive skin at that time and miraculously it was even calming and healing for my active acne and the PIH post acne was really minimal. The texture is in between a cream and a gel as can be seen in the picture. I totally understand why people detest it so much, the heavy suffocating feeling is a put off. I am not going to lie, it is heavy, feels like a suffocating layer on your face and is uncomfortable but you get used to the feeling once you see that its actually working for your extremely sensitive skin when nothing else does. You have to properly blend it in, take a minute or two to actually spread it on the skin. I have tried to photograph the white cast this one gives immediately post application. but once it settles in 30 minutes or so, the white cast is almost negligible and gives a primer finish (I am NC 43-45 for reference). I don't use makeup so I don't know how it would perform under makeup. The reapplication is difficult. I blot my face a lil before I apply this and again it takes a while to settle which is irritating if you are out and about. I could never reapply this more than once. It is sweat proof, tested it in peak of summer. This is the only zinc oxide based sunscreen that did not dry out my cheeks. \n\nAll said and done, I can't seem to make it work as my stand alone sunscreen as two fingertip amount is just not going to cut it when you are on all sorts of actives. Hence, since I have healed my skin barrier now and can use chemical sunscreens again, I use it over my cheeks (an area where my PIH is the worst) layered over my chemical sunscreen, after it completely dries. It's the perfect sweet spot for me and helps with PIH.\n\nRepurchase Status: Holy Grail (HG). Already repurchased twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Bello Photostable Emugel Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Easily available offline and online.\n\nIngredient list:\n\nKey Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, Ethylhexyltriazone Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyltriazine, Diethyl amino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate.\n\nOther ingredients: Purified water, Dimethicone and Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl phosphate, Ceteth-10 phosphate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Myristyl Myristate, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic Triglyceride, Pentaerythirtyl distearate, Phenyl trimethicone, Vitamin E acetate, Carbomer copolymer, Disodium Edetate, Trolamine, Sodium polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Methyparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr24pvoaknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f726d323339bee404855990ab043e2a3b051acc2\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using it everyday since approximately 4 months. The texture is creamy and you have to work it in for like 2 minutes into the skin. Immediately post-application, the sunscreen feels greasy to touch and looks oily but it gets absorbed into the skin in about 10 minutes and leaves a dewy finish which never goes away. I really like the dewy healthy glow it gives me. I can actually use 2 finger amount of sunscreen and it doesn't leave a white cast on my dark skin tone. If it gets into your eyes, it does sting. I can assume that dry skinned people would loooooove this in the winters. If you are combination or oily, I feel you can completely skip the moisturiser step when using this in summers. Would be perfect for inclusion in a minimal routine in the AM. On reapplication, it does leave a little bit of white cast on the sides of the face where we tend to have the peach-fuzz which will go away with a little bit of rubbing. Overall, this is the best budget sunscreen easily available in India which doesn't make us look like we have dressed up for a meme.\n\nRepurchase Status: HG, WRP. Already repurchased thrice. I will be trying out Photostable Gold SPF 55 in the summer, maybe it will replace this one. If not, I will always come back to this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Biore UV Smooth Kids Milk Spf 50 PA++++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Availability is a serious issue. Used to get it from Dokodemo pre-pandemic. Haven't been able to source since.\n\nIngredient list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Glyceryl Behenate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Distearate, Sodium Acrylate/​Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Paraffin, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Ceresin, Isohexadecane, Arginine, Lauryl Methacrylate/​Sodium Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 80, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Dextrin Palmitate, Agar, Petrolatum, Succinic Acid, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, BHT.\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjsnx8acknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e3e74e3ba70e6471b63c4d83bd3d41c2e876eab\n\nExperience & opinion: I had been using it everyday in dry summer days. Where I live is not very humid and that's why I think this one works so well for me. The texture is very aptly described as milk since it feels like a thick emulsion and spreads into nothingness into the skin. I can use the recommended amount of sunscreen with this one and it doesn't leave a white cast at all. It gets absorbed into the skin within 2 minutes and leaves behind a comfortable breathable layer of moisture on your skin. It does not dry down matte. It doesn't irritate my eyes. Its just so perfect for my combination skin even on my oily T-zone in peak summer days.  Reapplication is such a breeze. I have reapplied it in a taxi, in my office, before a meeting without any downtime. I just absolutely love everything about this sunscreen except that I think it has been discontinued and I am crying over the loss of my only true HG sunscreen. If anyone from Biore is reading this, please accept my plea and bring this back into production!!!!!\n\nRepurchase Status: HG forever. Although on the look out yet again for something that would match this one's status!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **The Blessing Tree Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rant\n\nAvailability in India: Available on Amazon.\n\nIngredient list: \n\nKey Ingredients: Octyl Methoxy Cinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide.\n\nOther ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1, 3, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates /​ C10-30 Alkyl Acrylare Cross Polymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Sryngylidene Melonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside (and) Anhydroxylitol (and) Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume.  That was a task to type!!!!!\n\nSunscreen type: Hybrid\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52ec0gwdknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8dd848f71d4a3939aa1b3ea6f13df4428170a9b\n\nExperience & opinion: I have had this for around 1 1/2 years now. But I never had the courage to put it on my face due to the infamous \"perfume\" in the inci list as I had a compromised barrier and could tolerate only physical sunscreens. All said and done, this has served well as an excellent body sunscreen which doesn't break the bank and provides me excellent protection. It is non-greasy unlike the other body sunscreens on the market. The white cast disappears within 5-10 minutes and you are good to get dressed and head out of the house. I apply it on all the exposed areas of my body - neck, upper shoulders, arms, hands (I don't feel guilty reapplying it even with the frequent hand washing as its relatively affordable + acts as a moisturiser for me) and feet. \n\nHowever for the sake of this review, I mustered all the courage I had to try it on the face but alas it did not suit me and caused me CC's by evening. It spreads well, leaves a white cast on skin which disappears in about 5-10 minutes, although the white residue along the hairline just doesn't disappear. I had to rub it excessively, almost rubbed it out to get it out of my peach fuzz! The finish on this sunscreen is not ultra matte and nor is it dewy to touch, its almost in between which is comfortable for combination and oily skin types. I was worried that this might get drying on my cheeks as the day progressed due to the zinc oxide content but it did not get dried at all. While I was typing the inci list, I realised it has Niacinamide in it!!! Yet another amazing ingredient to be present in this sunscreen. All in all, I would say if you don't have sensitive/sensitized skin and are okay with the \"O\" sunscreen filters, this is an excellent sunscreen.  \n\nRepurchase Status: Might repurchase for body. Not suitable for my face.\n\nThis review took me almost a month to write and photograph, but I am ultimately happy with the final write-up. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this! I have tried to include everything based on the rules of this sub, but still if you have any questions, do hit me up.\n\nI will make another post of the sunscreens which didn't work for me and would include the likes of Cipla Rivela tint sunscreen, Hada Labo UV Perfect Gel, Skin Aqua UV Moisture Gel, Photostable Insta,  Aroma Magic Mineral Sunscreen and The Mom's Co. Mineral Based Sunscreen.",

All of these do not have fragrance. Both Isntree creams are great for daytime use (gel cream in the summer and moist cream in the winter). The Illiyoon Ato Lotion is for the body and even face if you prefer a little more occlusivity with a balanced moisture and has been a great all-arounder and extremely economical. Innisfree Ato Cream is a great choice is you really want to lock it all in overnight.***\n\n**My Skin: c-c-c-c-c-COMBO. My skin is drier in the winter and oily in the summer.**\n\nThe hyperlinked ingredients will take you to CosDNA analysis of each product.\n\n***PRODUCTS: ALL DO NOT HAVE FRAGRANCE ❤***\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_fe18517608.html) Water, Methylpropanediol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Betaine, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Trehalose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium PCA, Phytosqualane, Isostearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethylcellulose, Propanediol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Pentylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n* **Review:** *I have used this for the past 6 months, and I can say this gel-cream really shines in the summer for daytime use. It is extremely hydrating, but  in the winter, it really lacks in the 'locking in water' department. I'd say this texture and performance is really similar to the cult-fave Belif Aqua Bomb and is a lot cheaper. It gives a burst of hydration with a hint of moisture, does not have any stickiness, and does not pill with sun protection layer. Has not caused any breakouts for me, but of course, avoid if you have a HA sensitivity or live in dry climate. People with pure oily skin will have more longevity in using this throughout the year. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills gel-cream.*\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Moist Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d36c550998.html) Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Betaine, Behenyl Alcohol, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Pteris Multifida Extract, Beta-Glucan, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methylpropanediol, Fructooligosaccharides, Raffinose, Ceramide NP, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Cholesterol, Folic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Polyquaternium-51, Tromethamine, Ammonium-Acryloyldimethyltaurate-Vp-Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I also used this cream for 6 months, and this is a great daytime cream for the winter. The texture here is more reminescent of Belif Moisturizing Bomb and is even more economical! This cream gives alot of moisture and balances a little bit of hydration and emollience. It takes in a bit more time to rub in and it is slightly sticky after application but that feeling goes away fast especailly when layering with sun protection. I have had zero breakouts using this cream and I recomend this for combination skin that gets drier in the winter. I have also used this at night, but I prefer a little more occlusiveness. It may be good for oily or combo skin at night if you prefer a lighter cream. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have also enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills moisturizer and I look forward to try other products from Isntree.*\n\n***Illiyoon Ato Ceramide Lotion***\n\n* Store: Olive Young\n* Price: $37 (1+1 deal)\n* Size: 2x 528 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2f20551004.html) Purified Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Shea Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hydrogenated Poly (C6-14 Olefin), Clohexasiloxane, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Perilla Frutescens Sprout Extract, Magnolia Kobus Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA (Ceramide PC-104 32.75ppm), Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Lauric Acid, Myristic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Propanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I have used this for a month on both my body and my face, and I think out of all of these this is my favorite. I think some may not like that it leaves thin film of occlusiveness, but for me that is a plus. Locking in moisture is critical for me. It truly excels as a body cream because it does not feel sticky. This lotion is filled with so much goodness such as ferments, ginseng (korean antiaging plant), shea butter, and a bit of ceramide. It melts in to your skin and moisturizes it well. In the winter, I also enjoy it as a both a day and night face cream too since it is more emmolient and occlusive than the Isntree HA Moist Cream. Out of all the purchases, this has been a must purchase forever for my body and has an added bonus that I can use it on my face when I want to mix up routine.* \n\n***Innisfree Ato Soothing Cream***\n\n* Store: Jolse \n* Price: $23 (sale)\n* Size: 150 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_bdc7551007.html) Purified Water, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Panthenol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, C14-22 Alcohols, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bislauramide MEA, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Arachidyl Alcohol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Cholesterol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Xanthan Gum, Sorbitan Isostearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Glucose, Arachidic Acid, Myristic Acid, Acorus Calamus Extract, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol.\n* **Review:** *I have also been using this cream for a month, and it is a very impressive barrier cream. It is buttery and harder to rub in, but this will 100% lock in your routine. Judging by its formulations and comparing to Innisfree Derma Formula Green Tea Probiotics Cream, I can guess that it is about 3% cermamide. This cream does not give much moisturzation, but if you are using a layering a routine it will seal all of the steps in, especially layering an emulsion before it. I feel like with this cream, it has an antiaging effect because my fine lines has redued probably due to its effectiveness as a barrier cream formulated with the ceramide and centella antioxidants! This one will be loved by those with dry, sensitive, or combo skin that loves a good barrier cream. I will probably repurchase, but I know there are other products to try in a similar catagory!*\n\nEdit: Added details addressing fragrance :)",

    "body": "As the title suggests, this is my current sunscreen collection, and I'll be reviewing the products and mentioning the ones I love and the ones I don't ! (This post might be half cooked, not very organised and all over the place, but it's my first time, so bear with me :P) \n\nSo as I mentioned, this is my first post here (eeep! :D) and initially I thought of sharing my entire shelfie, but I realised that being the junkie/hoarder I am, it'd end up being a terribly long post , hence after much deliberation I decided to post different categories of products separately  (sunscreens, moisturisers, serums etc) and after I'm done with that, I shall be making a post with only the products I use in my  current skincare routine!\n\nWithout further adieu let's get started! Please do like, share,  subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell icon!... lmao jk\n\n**Skin Type** : Oily - Combination, Comedonal Acne Prone, Rosacea Prone,\n\n**Major skin concerns** : Hypersensitivity, Non inflammatory acne, Sebum Production. \n\n**Age** : Early - Mid 20s, F\n\n**Current Climatic Conditions** : Semi- Arid, Dry winter \n\nSpecie : Homo Sapien\n\nHeight : wait.. I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

    "body": "Today's random TJ Maxx haul at a new TJ Maxx I randomly stopped by. Prices are in USA\n\nPhotos 2, 3, 4 are from today's TJ Maxx in Long Beach, CA. Photos 5 and 6 are from an Orang County, CA TJ Maxx. Stores are clean and organized.\n\nHAUL and mini review: (dry/dehydrating/30/Socal)\n\n**Laneige cica sleeping mask $20 60 mL**. My ride or die cica cream that I always need to have in stock. I ran out in March and was gonna buy more on my Japan trip, but couldnt find it in Japan. I didnt really wanna deal with the shipping and tariffs mess with online retailers so I intended to buy it whenever theres a sale at my local Amorepacific/Aritaum store. Regular price is $34, I was hoping to snag it on a 30% sale for \\~ $25, but TJ Maxx selling it for $20 is fantastic. Even Stylevana only has it on sale for $24 right now. I was devastated that this TJ only has 1 in stock. \n\nMini review: Nothing soothes my skin the way this cica cream does it, especially on hotter days. Its my fall back whenever my skin acts up. 10/10. Have been repurchasing for 5 years I think.\n\nIngredients: Water, Propanediol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Squalane, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Glycerin, Panthenol, Cetearylalcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, 1,2-hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Hydroxyethylacrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Tauratecopolymer, Butylene Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Caprylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Sorbitan Isostearate, Asiatic Acid, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**Parnell  cicamanu cotton clear pad $5 90 pads.** This was a clearance item. I didnt even know Parnell sells skincare. I thought they're a makeup company that focuses on cushions. Just checked Stylevana, its being sold for $18.\n\nIngredients: Water, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, C12-14 Pareth-12, Glycereth-26, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glyceryl Caprylate, Betaine, Allantoin, Trehalose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Leptospermum Scoparium Leaf Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Honey Extract, Gluconolactone, Ceramide NP, Anastatica Hierochuntica Extract, Lactobacillus Ferment, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Madecassoside, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Dr. Jart Ceramidin cream $25 30mL + 50mL**. Have not tried. The Dr. Jart cica cream is a thin gel that was too thin for my dry skin so Im hoping this ceramidin cream is thicker. Currently $30 for 50 ML on Yesstyle.\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Methyl Trimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dicaprylyl Ether, Cetearyl Olivate, Panthenol, Glyceryl Stearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Olivate, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, 2,3-Butanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Ceramide NP(2,070ppm), Ceramide NG(2,070ppm), Ceramide NS(2,070ppm), Ceramide AS(2,070ppm), Ceramide AP(529ppm), Cholesterol, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cellulose Gum, Dextrin, Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Citronellol, Tocopherol, Tartrazine\n\n**S.Nature Aqua Squalane Moisturzing Cream $10 60 mL.** Have not tried. Currently $20 on Yesstyle. Interested in trying because the ingredients look good for this price. New brand to me.\n\nIngredients: Water, Squalane (150,000ppm), Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Adenosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Arginine, Allantoin, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n**Sulwhasoo Perfecting Cushion $25 for 2.** Crazy good deal. Its usually $65 for 2. I know its on sale because this is the old version and the new version in store is that ugly boring orange packaging. Got it for my aunt.\n\nAt this point, Im going to TJ Maxx every other day. Its my form of stress release. Thank goodness the deals are reasonable. ",

Usually, lotions mean light emulsions. Sometimes it can mean something between \"emulsions\" and creams, I think, in terms of texture/thickness. \"Lotion\" in Japanese however, are toners from what I understand. Oops!!

Since I have acne-prone skin, the ingredient list scared me a little at first. The texture of the product is definitely very, very light, you don't even feel it on your face. The product is absorbed into the face very quickly, but after a while there is a slight oily feeling when you touch your skin. That's why I don't know if someone with very oily skin can like this product. I think that moisturizing is not enough for dry skin. When I started using Differin, I had to apply this product in several layers because differin dried out my skin, and I was still getting flaky places on my face. There are too many extracts on the ingredient list, some of which can cause fungal acne and clogged pores. \n\nAs a result, I think combination skins would like this product. If you have oily skin, I think you can use it in winter. Its performance under makeup, on the other hand, was not very good. That greasy feeling if you use a shiny bb cream or foundation, it reduces its concealing and creates an oily appearance rather than a glowy appearance. I don't think I will buy the product again. The size is 110ml and I think it's too big to finish in 6-12 months. I don't think it provides an extra benefit to my skin. It was an ordinary moisturizer for me. If you have also used it, please write down your reviews!!",

    "body": "I recently had yet another Bobbi Brown Gel Eyeliner dry out on me and in my frustration, began the google search for how to rehydrate it. I found a lot of suggestions, which I will review below, but none of them involved replacing the ingredient that had actually evaporated. Here is the ingredients list:\n\n\nIsododecane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Polyethylene, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Propylene Carbonate, Lecithin, Phenyl Trimethicone, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Methicone, Barium Sulfate, BHT, Phenoxyethanol. May contain: Iron Oxides, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Blue 1 Lake, Carmine, Chromium Oxide Greens, Manganese Violet, Yellow 5 Lake, Chromium Hydroxide Green, Bismuth Oxychloride, Ultramarines, Ferric Ferrocyanide\n\n\nRestoration Methods:\n\n* Visine: Safe around the eyes, but uses water to rehydrate. As you can see, this product does not contain water, so adding water to reliquify it, while functional, does not actually recreate the formula. Of the recommendations I encountered, I think this (or another uncontaminated water-based product, like distilled water, saline solution -- do not use tap water, as it might contain microorganisms you really don't want near your eye!) is the best if you're not going to use cyclomethicones.\n* Glycerin: Similar to the water suggestion (glycerin is a humectant which absorbs water) this will be somewhat functional, but actually is less preferable to visine because glycerin may add a bit of a sticky/tacky sensation because it does not evaporate... rather it retains water :)\n* Microwave: This softens the product in a similar way that the microwave softens bread, but ultimately the formula is never the same and will be more drying long term by causing further evaporation.\n* Oil: This will remove the long-wear and stay in place aspects, making it smudgy and will never set... because oil does not evaporate.\n\n\nThe real magic is in the first two ingredients: Isododecane and Cyclopentasiloxane. The former is a solvent, while the latter is a volatile silicone that evaporates. While they sound obscure, you stand a good chance of already owning something that is composed of these ingredients!\n\n\nMakeup removers are good bet. Neutrogena's Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover and Walmart Equate's dupe are great budget options, especially as the cyclomethicone layer is floating on the top and separate from the water-based formula. /u/QualityLeaf wrote a [wonderful comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/3vm4v5/psa_restore_your_driedout_gel_eye_liner_or_eye/cxqtr30) with a photo demonstration -- thank you so much for that!\n\n\nYou might also have a silicone serum that is mainly composed of this product. For example, Peter Thomas Roth Retinol Fusion PM. Ingredients: Cyclopentasiloxane, Squalane, Retinol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Water (Aqua), Pentylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Lechitin, Bisabolol, Alcohol. This is what I used, and it works like a dream, but some may be sensitive to retinol.\n\nYou could also source a cyclomethicone in its pure form -- might come in handy for DIY!\n\nHow to actually apply the cyclomethicone to the product? Because the product I use comes in a dropper bottle, I literally just applied one drop to the top and let it sink in by itself. No mixing, easy as pie!\n\nHope this was helpful to someone :)",

I wanted a shampoo that would cleanse without making my hair dry . So that’s when BA ultra smoothening shampoo came into play & it’s been the only one I have been using since back then . The ultra smoothening hair mask is also my HG if u have ultra rough + fine hair . Probably not the best for thicker hair types . I have seen considerable improvement in my scalp health cz the shampoo would cleanse without stripping moisture . Also , if you sweat a lot or use lot of products & theres buildup on ur scalp , this won’t be enough. You might have to add a clarifying shampoo once in 2 weeks or a month . I have used their smoothening hair serum but unfortunately that didn’t work . Their hair growth serum seemed promising cz it did reduce my hair fall considerably. Their anti-dandruff range is bad , my brother used it & got more dandruff instead .",

    "body": "**Skin** : Dehydrated + Oily + Dry Patches + Acne. My skin feels easily suffocated. I have Sahara Desert around Mouth and Oil tankers on Cheeks.\n\n**Cost**: 950Rs for 500ml (I got it for cheaper price in Nykaa Summer sale : \\~560Rs )\n\n The opening of the bottle is a tiny hole which is provided with a cap that can be removed and set again. It helps in preventing any leakage from bottle. I am basically very lazy to hold that big bottle, so I transferred some toner to TO Serum bottle and using it. \n\n**The Feel:**\n\nIt has watery flowy consistency. The cloudy milky color gives the feeling of moisture in my head. It doesn't have any strong fragrance. It gives a very light healthy dewy glow finish to the skin post application. I didn't get any irritation / itching particularly from this toner.\n\n**My experiments:** \n\nI initially used it alone and my dehydrated skin just drank up all the toner and it gave smooth texture and the hydrated glow to my oily skin. It definitely worked for me and I could see the difference by 2nd time of use itself. However, I felt that the toner alone was not enough to prevent TEWL. I felt dehydrated again after 3 times of using this toner alone.\n\nI then started using the toner for sometime in the hot and humid climate and topping it with thick moisturizer and heavy sunscreen. I broke out. I realized that my skin is feeling too much moisturization and oily. So, I had to stop using this toner and sunscreen (I stayed away from sun) and switched to a light moisturizer until my breakouts calmed down. But, deep down I badly needed that hydration that the toner gives. \n\n**How I ended up using it:**\n\nCurrently, I'm mixing 4-5 drops of the toner to my moisturizer (Nivea Soft) and woahhh I love it. I feel like I can make the right consistency of the mixture for my skin. It feels hydrated and moisturized at the same time now. My skin looks very much normal and nice instead of being too oily or too dry. I'm surprised the way my crazy skin has finally found the balance.\n\n I also tried adding few drops of the toner to Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion and it didn't go well at all. Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion has this different consistency that doesn't go well with this toner when mixed up. However, I like it well with Nivea Soft. I get more lighter version of Nivea Soft by mixing with this toner.  Also, my skin never felt dehydrated again with this toner + moisturizer mixing technique. This is the way I'm going to use this or any other toner for the rest of my life. \n\nI definitely like to repurchase this toner considering the discount and the quantity we get for it. \n\n**Full Ingredients List:**\n\n Water Dipropylene Glycol Glycerin Water Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate Glycereth-26 1,2-Hexanediol Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil Water Phenyl Trimethicone Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer Styrene/VP Copolymer Centella Asiatica Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Glycerin Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer Tromethamine Disodium EDTA Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil Citrus Limon (Lemon) Seed Oil Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride Water Allantoin Hydrogenated Lecithin Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate Panthenol Ceramide NP Sodium Hyaluronate Linalool Limonene",

    "body": "Hi everyone! Today I'd love to share with you my review on the Sana Namerakahonpo 6 in 1 Moisture Gel. I thought about just adding a small mini review on the weekly Monday thread but honestly, I think this product deserves a post of its own. This gel cream has quickly made its way onto my list of HG's and let me explain why.\n\n\nMy skin type: oily + with hormonal acne but not really sensitive\n\nAge: 24\n\nClimate I'm in: cold Europe\n\n\nSo last week I *finally* finished my Innisfree Orchid Enriched Cream and even though it smelled amazing and felt really velvety on my skin, it was way too heavy for my skin type. I think this cream is more suitable for people with dry skin who are looking for a medium-to-heavy cream but who don't mind fragrances. I, however, prefer light, gel moisturizers that immediately sink into the skin without leaving an oily residue but still provide moisture (unfortunately the Innisfree cream did leave a bit of an oily feeling on the skin).\n\n\nAnyways, a couple of weeks ago I was lucky enough to travel to Japan and let me just tell ya, I am so happy I asked the sales lady of Ainz & Tulpe to help me choose a moisturizer for oily skin, because if I hadn't I might not have bought this amazing Sana gel cream.\n\n\n\nThis was the [product description](http://www.qoo10.sg/item/%EF%BC%B3%EF%BC%A1%EF%BC%AE%EF%BC%A1-SANA-NAMERAKAHONPO-ALL-IN-ONE-MOISTURE-JELLY-GEL-6-IN-1-NATURAL/514050405?css_mode=preview&title_id=title_popup) I found online (since the packaging of the cream has absolutely no English writing on it):\n\n\n\nJelly extra moisture gel that melts at skin temperature!\n\n6 in 1:\n\n1) Emulsion\n\n2) Mask\n\n3) Skin Toner\n\n4) Cream\n\n5) Serum\n\n6) Make up primer\n\n\n\nJapan's No.1 Brand for Soya Skin Care Series!\n\n\n\n❌ No color\n\n❌ No fragrance\n\n❌ No mineral oil\n\n\nContains isoflavone and collagen which help to whiten your skin and improve the absorption of skin for supple and beautiful skin!\n\n\nSome of the benefits of this cream include: moisturizing, anti-aging, brightening, antioxidants, anti- inflammation, sebum control and it enhances the production of collagen and hyaluronic acid!\n\n\nIngredients list:\n\nWATER, DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL, GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXANOATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, DIPHENYLSILOXY PHENYL TRIMETHICONE,TRIETHYLHEXANOIN,PEG-60 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL,PEG-240/HDI COPOLYMER BIS-DECYLTETRADECETH-20 ETHER,TREHALOSE,PHENOXYETHANOL,BEHENYL ALCOHOL,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE,ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, TOCOPHEROL, LACTOBACILLUS/SOYMILK FERMENT FILTRATE,PENTASODIUM PENTETATE,SODIUM HYDROXIDE,  BUTYLENE GLYCOL,ALCOHOL,GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) PROTEIN, GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) SEED EXTRACT\n\n\n\n\nAmazing right? Talk about a multifunctional product! So, for the past couple of days, I've been applying this cream in the morning as my daytime moisturizer and I have to admit I am completely amazed by how light, yet moisturizing it is. Right now where I live it's winter and to leave my house and enter the cold weather, I usually prepare my face with at least 1 layer of hydrating toner, 1 essence and 1 serum but this morning all I did was cleanse with the Skinfood Egg White Pore Foam, then I applied eye cream, then this Sana gel cream and finally sunscreen. Final result? I haven't noticed a single flake on my somewhat dry winter skin. My skin just feels so incredibly soft and moisturized. Also, the redness on my cheeks was less visible today.\n\nHonestly, I would highly recommend this product for people who have oily skin and are looking for a lightweight moisturizer/emulsion, people who are looking for deep moisture or for those of you who love all-in-one products.\n\n\nRating: 5/5\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed this compact review. If you feel that this review was unnecessary or irrelevant, please let me know and I can gladly delete it.\n",

Sadly im also super prone to hyperpigmentation. My main Goals are barrier health, hydration, acne & Hyperpigmentation management and getting rid of the damn stubborn CC\\`s... I also follow a kinda skincycling routine wich includes a non AB Retinal product.\n\nIn **Bold** will be the product name + how long i have been using it\n\nin *italic* will be the ingredients i liked\n\n\n\n**Axis-Y Sunday morning cleanser: (using for a month now)** *green tea extract, centella extract, allatonin*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Coco-Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-67, Xylitylglucoside, Citric Acid, Anhydroxylitol, Propanediol, Xylitol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Glucose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium EDTA, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Agrimonia Eupatoria Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Allantoin, Perilla Frutescens Leaf Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Extract, Sodium Acetate, Pentylene Glycol, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Natto Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\nTexture:\n\na balmy texture, foams up to a dense and soft foam\n\nExpirience:\n\nI picked this up because I wanted to change from my old clenaser to something that felt like it had a bit more cleansing power, yet was not stripping. As far as i can tell it seems to accomplish that. It foams up nicely, cleans well and doesent seem to strip my Skin. After washing it off it feels almost as if there is a slight layer on my Skin, but i dont mind it/ think that it contributes to the non stripping?\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Cosrx Propolis Toner: (about a month 1/2 of use)** *propolis, honey extract, panthenol*\n\nIngredients:\n\nPropolis Extract, Honey Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Panthenol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n\nTexture:\n\na waterlike texture, thats just a bit thicker\n\nExpirience:\n\nTo be honest im not overly impressed... its a nice hydrating toner for sure but i didnt notice anything outstanding that would have me choose it again. But it gets a pluspoint for being reasonably priced so i migth pick it up again to reach free shipping...\n\n(3/5)\n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Waterproof Sungel (3 Months of use)** *Aloe*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Juice, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, T-butyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Ceramide Np, Phytosphingosine, Parfum\n\nTexture:\n\na thin cream Texture, not runny but almost there\n\nExpirience:\n\nIt comes in quite a big size for a Sunscreen, you can find 80 - 100 ml Tubes online for around 15-17 Euros! Wich honestly was the sole reason why i bougth it xD i figured my skin would be fine with the Ingredients and i just hate tiny sunscreens! And well... that was exactly what it is like, its decently moisturizing and doesnt irritate my Skin. But if you have sensitive Skin be careful, it does have Fragrance, smells kinda like very artificial Aloe. You can smell it but only upon first apllication, it doesnt linger. I have been using 1 bottle for 3 months and still have enough for another month at min. so a win!\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Mask: (3 months of use)** *Squalane, Centella Extract, Jojoba oil, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Ceramide*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract(250,000Ppm), Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Panthenol, Ceramide NP(3,000Ppm), Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sodium Carbomer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract\n\nTexture:\n\nA thick Cream, feels quite emmolient\n\nExpirience:\n\nI love, love, loe this! Its the first moisturizer that i found that feels like it actually does its job well on my Skin. As a nigthtime moisturizer it keeps my Skin hydrated all through the Night and has my wake up nicely glowy. I love to use this when my Skin is irritated, it really soothes it quickly. Always have this on my Shelf, you would have to pry it out of my dead cold hands, to seperate me from it. One Bottle last me about 2 months.\n\nHG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Mary & May Blackberry Cream Essence: (4 months of use)** *Jojoba oil, ceramides, lotus water, centella*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Nymphaea Caerulea Flower Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-hexanediol, Methlypropanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Gardenia Florida Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Trilaureth-4 Phoshate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Pvm/Ma Copolymer, Cyanocobalamin, Ceramide Np, Maltodextrin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol\n\nTexture:\n\nthin, watery but creamy? (just realized i suck at describing textures haha)\n\nExpirience:\n\nA really nice hydrating and moisturizing Toner, feels like a great balance of the two. Acts nicely as a layer with other Skincare because it absorbs really well. I like it, a bottle lasts me about 2 months.\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Abib Quick Sunstick Protection Bar: ( 3 months of use)** *Aloe, Centella, Ceramides*\n\nIngredients:\n\nOctyldodecanol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Dibutyl Ethylhexanoyl Glutamide, Dibutyl Lauroyl Glutamide, Diisostearyl Malate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dextrin Palmitate, Octocrylene, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Maltodextrin, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol\n\nTexture:\n\nA translucent stick, glides on smooth, feels a bit occlusive on skin\n\nExpirience:\n\nNicely moisturizing Sunstick, feels good on my Skin and well... does its Job xD I really like the curved shape of it, it relly helps with the application. I just use it for reapplication of my sunscreen, but also sometimes when my Skin gets really dry during the day ( tho its not the best for that)\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Numbuzin No.2 Protein 43% creamy Serum: ( 4 months of use)** *Oat protein, Ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids, ferments, Rice protein*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAvena Sativa Protein Extract, Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Erythritol, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao Extract, Pantolactone, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Oryza Sativa Seed Protein Extract, Stearic Acid, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Lactobacillus Ferment, Glycine Soja Protein, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein, Glucose, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Sweet Almond Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Myristic Acid, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Arachidic Acid, Lauric Acid, Sodium Succinate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance\n\nTexture:\n\nVery thick serum, really is creamy like the name says\n\nExpirience:\n\nSooo repairing and soothing, does wonders for my barrier. It really helps keep my Skin moisturized and helps keep my transepidermal waterloss in check. Love it so much! HG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Purito Aha Bha Refreshing Solution: (1 month of use)** *Glycolic acid, Salcylic Acid*\n\nIngredients:\n\nSalix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid (7%), Tromethamine, Water, Salicylic Acid(2%), 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Citrate, Arginine, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid(0.28%), Hydroxyacetophenone, Pentylene Glycol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA\n\nTexture:\n\nlike water, it put 2-3 drops on a thin cotton pad and swipe over my Face with it\n\nExpirience:\n\nSince it has only been a month i cannot say too much about how it has worked (and i feel its hard to tell what effects on my skin is retinal and whats from this product) but my comedones are reducing in size and developing into breakouts. But the effects of these ingredients are well studied in these concentrations so i would say its save to say it works. Its my first time using glycolic acid and i can say it packs a punch for sure! So be careful, its intense, so far im using it once a week on my exfoliation day and i dont think ill be moving up.... Might also be the fact that its a combo product, but i have been using salcylic acid and mandelic acid in combo before, and that felt less sensitizing. So im attributing that factor to the 7 percent glycolic acid, since it is the smallest molecule size of all Aha\\`s.\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow lets move to quick first impressions of a few products i just started trying, wich i have seperated from the review portion because i just havent been using them long enough to really speak about the effects on my Skin: (these will also be shorter impressions with less info)\n\n\n\n**Neo:labs liquid enhancer Pycogenol:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Propanediol, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, 1.2-Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum Extract, Jojoba Esters, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Salvia Sclarea Oil, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Theobroma Cacao Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, Coprylyl Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-18 Acid Triglyceride, Squalene, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tromethamine, Albatreus Contuena Extract, Paimitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Phytasteryl Macadamiate, Citric Acid, Phytosterol, Dextrin, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, 4-Terpineol, Pentylene Glycol, Octonediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nExpirience:\n\nBougth this because of the tea tree extract, oil and 4- terpineol for the antimicrobial and antiinflammatory benefits , plus it also promised balancing the water-oil contend of the skin. So far i have been using it for a week and it feels nicely moisturizing, but i cannot say if it has helped with my breakouts. Smells strongly like tea tree, wich i dont mind.\n\n**Isntree Spotsaver Mugwort Ampoule:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nArtemisia Princeps Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Erythritol, Betaine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Panthenol, Propanediol, Beta-Glucan, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Allantoin, Carbomer, Tromethamine, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nExpirience:\n\nThis i got because i heard amazing things about mugwort and it was on a 50 % Sale, so i got it for a steal! So far i like the simple ingredient list an it seems soothing and hydrating.\n\n**RNW Der.Ceramide Cream:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Ceramide NP, Panthenol, Caprylyl Methicone, Glycerin, C12-16 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Ceramide NS, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Oligopeptide-1, Ceramide EOP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Betaine, Arginine, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Carbomer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Arachidyl Glucoside, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium EDTA\n\nExpirience:\n\nIm really intriged by this brand an was debating between this and the Ceramide serum, but got this Cream. At first i was intimitaded by the essential oils and the strong smell it has (herbal, but to my nose very pleasant) so i patchtested it on my cheek. The Patchtests went fine and i have been using it on my whole face for 4 days now and i must say im impressed.\n\nIf you have oily skin i feel you could hate it but for my dry skin... the texture is amazing. Its a THIIICK cream, like an ointment, very balmy. Upon apllication it feels nice to spread it and it sinks in so well for the thick texture. The cream surprisingly dries down velvety and leaving a protective shield over the Skin. I also love that it has 3 % Panthenol, 3% ceramides and cholesterol and fatty acids.... so perfect ingrdients for skin barrier repair! Really a potential HG...\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "This is my first review, hope it helps, specially because I haven’t heard many reviews from these specifically.\n\nFirst just a bit about my skin and usage context\n\nSkin type: Combination (oily T-zone)\n\nSkin tone: medium-tan\n\nClimate: Hot desert\n\nAM: e.l.f. Holy hidration! Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm, Cerave Hydrating Cleanser, The Ordinary Caffeine 5% + EGCG Depuffing Eye Serum, The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% Oil Control Serum, Sunscreen\n\nPM: The same as AM but I replace sunscreen with Adapalene 0.001, Pond Fruity Hydra Fresh Gel and either Vaseline or/and The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + PhytoCeramides\n\n*mixsoon Centella Sun Cream SPF 50+ PA++++*\n\nIngredients: Purified Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Methylpropanediol, Denatured Alcohol, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Glycerin, Polysilicone-15, Tromethamine, Polyglyceryl -3 Distearate, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dipropylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Glyceryl Stearate, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Polyether-1, Carbomer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate/​VP Copolymer, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Cross Polymer, Lavender Oil, Centella Asiatica Extract (970 Ppm), Linalool, Ethylhexyl-Glycerin, Geraniol\n\nTexture: like a moisturizing cream of medium density, like TOs NMF + PhytoCeramides but fresher, not runny\n\nApplication:  has a chilly feeling when applied and leaves no white cast, will make your skin feeling very moisturizer, takes a while to settle before you can go on with your routine (15-20 min). After absorbed, skins feels healthy, plump and with a glowish finish. Had only the cica smell, which is nice and very mild. It didn’t tingle when near my eyes, even when I sweated\n\nWould recommend: it’s bothersome to wait so much for it to absorb, plus on hot days it can feel a bit suffocating. Would be more fitting for winter or cold climates, specially people with sensitive or dry skin. I liked the way my skin felt after absorbed, but it pilled on some days, even on days when I only did skincare (maybe it doesn’t play well with my niacinamide serum)\n\nOverall rating: 8/10\n\n*Celimax Oil Control Light Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA++++*\n\nIngredients: Purified water *Jinxoxide Calcium aluminum borosilicate, Polyglyceryl-3 polydimethylsiloxyethyldimetikone, Polymethylsilesquioxein, Evening Primrose Flower Extract, Sugar elm root Extract, Great pine leaf extract, Arrowroot Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, *Titanium dioxide, diasteadaimonium hextorite, Magnesium sulfate, triethoxycaprylylsilane, 1,2-hexanediol, phenyl trimethicone, Acrylate/dimethicone copolymer, Polyglyceryl-6 polysinolyate, Glyceryl caprylate, caprylyl glycol, ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, 4-turpineol, Silica, Tocopherol\n(I struggled to find the list, and I’m not 100% it’s correct but the claims is that it is a silicone-based mineral and chemical sunscreen and that it has 10,000ppm of anti-sebum P and the 4-Tyrineol complex)\n\nTexture: dense but compact, does not feel moisturizing, more like powdery when applied. Has not fragrance at all. Once settled it will keep a matte finish and basically act as a barrier that reduces sebum and shine \n\nApplication: Will leave a white cast while applying but it turns transparent after 5 seconds if you distribute it with your hands. Has a silicone silky finish and settles in 3-5 minutes.\n\nWould recommend: if you have oily or normal with oily spots or you sweat but hate getting shiny, this is GREAT, probably holy grail status. I’ve tried Avène and anthelios, but this one is cheaper and definitely clears the park in oil control. Keep it mind that it will also accentuate any dry spots (in my case due to my retinoid, which I just changed), but I’ve found that using some hydrating gels and my occlusive cream before the sunscreen helps, and you can use a really occlusive cream and this thing will just sit above and eat all of the stickyness out and just keep the silky barrier. With this thing I can go to the gym, sweat buckets, and my skin will still be matte once the sweat evaporates, it’s nuts. You kinda need to make up for all of the moisture it absorbs, and it might require that you use a primer to keep your makeup from falling out, as I’ve found that this kinda makes makeup not stay in place\n\nOverall rating: 9/10 but only if you have oily-normal combination skin\n\nLet me know if you have any questions in the comments!",

    "body": "Hello again, AB! Two weeks ago I made a post on my old account (whyisthissolong) about Missha's new cushion, as there was no reviews on it, so here I am with mine! So, lets get to it!\n\nI ordered it from BeautyNetKorea on the 3rd of March, and it arrived today, so 13 days which is great! I got it in shade 21, and was worried that it may be too light based on the photos that were being posted on Instagram the past two weeks. The packaging is [nice](http://i.imgur.com/PIayJkS.jpg). Like, [really](http://i.imgur.com/iUlX41C.jpg) [nice](http://i.imgur.com/nspIKVj.jpg). I was not expecting such sturdy plastic from a pact that was 13USD/16CAD. It's simple, light, and shiny, all things that I like. The sponge is super soft and squishy, in the typical blue and white that I've seen in every other bb cushion.\n\nUpon first swatch, I was frustrated. It was so [much](http://i.imgur.com/GEAoJFV.jpg) more [orange](http://i.imgur.com/xWZzsza.jpg) than I was expecting! Not to be dissuaded, I tried putting it on my face. I don't have photos of that, but it was a mess. While applying, I realised that I was simply using way too much. A light hand is needed for this, it cakes up pretty easily with heavy application. Lesson learned. I'll update the post tomorrow with face swatches, if wanted. Here are some photos of product itself, [unblended](http://i.imgur.com/tkB9RIU.jpg) as well as [sort of blended](http://i.imgur.com/ESwgnQp.jpg). It dries pretty quick. \n\nNow, while it's got decent coverage, don't expect it to cover up every imperfection. I have some moles/freckles on my hands, and used those as a comparison. [Without](http://i.imgur.com/oWuijJE.jpg) and [with](http://i.imgur.com/3nQiAzJ.jpg). It helped some, but definitely doesn't make them disappear. \n\nI would describe the finish as somewhere between [matte and dewey](http://i.imgur.com/bBNhnpi.jpg) (product on left hand), which personally I like, while others may not. When it dries, it is really *soft*. Not the finish, but the feel. As I'm typing this I keep rubbing my hand because it feels so nice. I'm not sure how long for sure it stays, but I had it on for 4 hours tonight and did not get oily, or have much slide around (aside from my nose, but that's because I kept rubbing it).\n\nOverall, I think it's a pretty good product. It does have a bit of a scent to it, but it's not as strong as other Missha products have been described. It may be a little dark for those NW15-20 and unless used with a light hand could potentially cake quite a lot. \n\n*Ingredients*\nWater (aqua), titanium dioxide (CI 77891), cyclopentasilicone, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, ethylhexyl salicylate, trimethylsiloxysilicate, glycerin, PEG-8 dimethicone, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, niacinimide, diphenylsiloxy phenyl trimethicone, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, cyclohexasiloxane, iron oxides (CI 77492), rosa canina fruit oil, persea gratissima (avocado) oil, olea europea (olive) fruit oil, xylitol, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, calophyllum inophyllum inophyllum seed oil, bambusa vulgaris water, cereus grandiflorus (cactus) flower extract, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) extract, adansonia digita fruit extract, oxygen, neopentyl glycol diheptanoate, butylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate, cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 dimethicone, PEG-8, magnesium sulfate, methyl methacrylate crosspolymer, dimethicone, vinyl dimethicone/methicone silsesquioxane triethoxycaprylylsilane, dimethicone crosspolymer, ethylhexylglycerin, adenosine, silica, boron nitride, PEG-32, dipropylene glycol, tocopherol, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, fragrance, iron oxides (CI 77491), iron oxides (CI 77499).\n\nAnd that concludes that! Thanks for reading, and if you have any questions, shoot 'em my way and I'll try my best to answer them for you! ",

I have oily skin in a humid climate. \n\nIt is very lightly hydrating imo, and other than that I didn’t see any particular benefits. \n\nThe texture has its pros and cons. It’s gel texture is almost aloe-like. This means that if you apply just the right amount, it sinks in without any residue on top of the skin. But if you apply too much, it just feels like a slab of aloe on the skin. Since it’s not moisturising or occlusive in any way, this just made it hard to apply a large amount to get maximum hydration.\n\nI ended up using most of it on my body since it kinda has a cooling effect from it’s gel texture.",

It looks like I have a light foundation on\n\n**Scent:** Light citrus\n\n**Break out:** No\n\n**Under Make up:** Made my foundation look slightly cakey at the end of the day\n\n**General thoughts:** First of all, this is a huge whopping bottle for an Asian sunscreen and I think well worth the price (\\~$30 CAD) compared to buying many mini bottles of the Etude House Sunprise Airy Finish. It's safe to say, it is also meant for the body as well. They also have a spot where you can write the open date for the bottle. So far, this is an amazing sunscreen for my oily t-zone. At first, I was really worried that this would leave me really greasy when I was applying it. It felt extremely \"wet\" and \"oily\" due to the silicones, but after I let it dry down, it felt amazingly matte, but not tight and had good oil control throughout the day (my glasses never really slipped down). Regarding the white cast, I didn't find myself looking ghostly/ashy, but more of a subtle blurring effect and almost brightening the face, however I don't think this would be good for anyone with a darker complexion. I rarely wear foundation on a daily basis unless I'm going out to a party so having it act like a BB cream is pretty helpful for me and the makeup problem isn't horrible.\n\nI cannot say anything about their claims of \"cooling down the skin temperature\" as it's winter in Canada and honestly, I'm not sure if I believe that claim. Overall, I highly recommend this sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "**First things first, about me and my skin:**\n\nI have combination skin - super oily forehead and nose, super dry cheeks. I also have extremely sensitive skin and eczema, so I avoid chemical sunscreens. They're usually a trigger for me. I don't have much acne, usually, but I just started new birth control and I have hormonal acne below my nose/above my lip right now. I tried this after nearly finishing off an Equate dupe of the Olay Complete Defense Daily Moisturizing Lotion SPF 15, which I wasn't super fond of. I wanted a higher SPF for summer. Also, I'm white with a fair complexion, which will be relevant. \n\n**Second things second, the product.**\n\n* Active ingredient - Zinc Oxide 21.6%,\n\n* Other ingredients - Water, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Octyldodecyl Citrate Crosspolymer, Phenyl Trimethicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Glycerin, Ethyl Methicone, Cetyl Dimethicone, Silica, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Flower/Leaf/Stem Juice, Glyceryl Behenate, Phenethyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Cetyl Dimethicone/Bis-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer, Acrylates/Dimethicone Copolymer, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.\n\n**And now, my review.**\n\n**Cons: smell, texture, white cast**\n\nI have to start with the smell. It smells like diesel and I don't know why. The smell doesn't linger once you put it on, but it does stink when it comes out. I suppose that's a side effect of a product for sensitive skin - no added fragrance means it smells like chemicals.\n\nThe texture is awful. It's a thick, chalky paste, roughly the consistency of toothpaste. It feels goopy. And on that note, \"Dry Touch\" is a damned lie. I have to put powder over it to not look like a grease monster, and my face still feels greasy literally all day.\n\nAnd finally, the white cast. This is always a problem with physical sunscreens, especially one with so much zinc oxide. It goes on chalk white. It takes about 20 minutes to fully absorb, and once it is absorbed, the white cast is mostly gone. For nearly 22% zinc oxide, I suppose it's not that bad, and I doubt that anyone else would notice the white cast, especially since I apply it all the way down my neck, too. Powder helps. That said, I'm pretty pale. On darker skin, it might be very noticeable. \n\n**Pros: doesn't clog pores, doesn't irritate eczema, doesn't pill, high SPF**\n\nFor such a thick product, it doesn't seem to be clogging my pores. I don't have any new CCs or blemishes and it's not worsening my hormonal acne. In fact, my forehead texture is improving. I'm not using any actives right now, so I suspect it's either that the Olay dupe was causing that texture, or that something in this sunscreen is helping them clear up. Maybe the zinc?\n\nIt also doesn't irritate my eczema, which is a massive plus in my book. My facial eczema is temperamental.\n\nI usually don't wear makeup. I've only started wearing powder because of the greasy look that sunscreens give me. But it definitely doesn't pill under powder, at least. \n\nFinally, it's SPF 50 and broad spectrum. I live in Texas, so as we approach summer, I really needed something stronger. I'm not outside that much, but it definitely feels like it protects me all day without having to reapply at lunch or anything. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAt ~$5/oz, it's pretty expensive for the flaws it has. If your skin isn't as sensitive, I'd say to skip this. However, if more cosmetically elegant sunscreens like chemical sunscreens with high alcohol content irritate your skin, and you're breakout-prone, this might be a good choice. I probably won't repurchase this, but I'm not dreading using up the bottle, at least.",

        "body": "I totally agree with your assessment. Thank you for taking the time to review this product - we need more reviews! I have it as well and am trying to use it up, among other neutrogena sunscreens I unfortunately bought...I have been getting away with the white cast by waiting for it to form a film and then adding on a titanium dioxide based foundation but it's still annoying to have to do that. After I finally use up all my Neutrogena sunscreens I'm permanently switching to either CeraVe or Elta MD (the big bottles, not the tiny 48 g ones). I've only tried the CeraVe but I can wear that without needing any tint correction and it's completely mattifying on my oily skin. I'm going to try the Elta MD just for kicks. It's a bummer though, because Neutrogena is cheaper per oz than both of those.\n\nOh, p.s. don't try the helioplex formulations if you think the sheer Zinc greasy look is bad. The helioplex ones blend in better but they do have a tiny white cast AND grease up your face like no other. I don't know how they get away with calling them sheer and matte.",

    "body": "Hello Ladies! I thought I would create this post as I haven’t seen a very detailed thread about hair care yet. We often talk about skincare and beneficial or terrible ingredients here and on the wider web, however I always think hair care is never as thoroughly investigated. I’m a total newbie at hair styling, however I will blow my own trumpet and say after years of research and trial and error I’m pretty good at hair care. This will probably be very long even without me going into lots of detail, but feel free to ask in comments for more detail on specific things that interest you and I will expand. Also chime in with any extra info, especially if you’re curly haired! My experience and knowledge is more based in straight and slightly wavy hair. \n\nA disclaimer – proper hair care can be time consuming and require lots of trial and error at first, it did for me and everyone who I know is really into it too, but in my opinion it is worth it. It doesn’t have to be pricy though, there are lots of great cheap products! Once you find what works for you though, you will really reap the benefits for life. \n\n\nSo, let’s start!\n\n\n**Finding out the true state of your hair**\n\nMost likely you use silicones on your hair (a lot of products contain them), and silicones coat your hair, make it soft, sometimes weigh it down. They cover a lot of hair care sins. To find out the true condition of your hair, you will need to strip it of silicones. To do this, you will need to use a shampoo with a fairly strong detergent, sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), or sodium coco-sulfate are often shunned, however they are great for removing silicones from hair. You can then apply a non-silicone conditioner, and then wait for your hair to dry naturally. At this stage, you will see how good (or bad) a condition your hair is really like. It may still be looking great, but you may get quite a shock and decide you need quite the chop. I know I did the first time I cleansed my hair properly. It went from being fairly soft albeit a bit flat with just some split ends, to dry, tangled, and extremely brittle on the bottom 10cm. It looked matted. I took off a third of my length immediately and then a few months later another 5cm or so. I will edit this later once I find some before photos of my hair, and I will also do a current photo with my hair free of silicones.\n\n**Figuring out your hair porosity**\nHair porosity is your hair’s ability to absorb moisture. There is theoretically a simple test [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/40/3d/62/403d621b14f0c8c63e04ec9b61c02508.png) you can do, however over time you may find the result of it wasn’t 100%. I have medium porosity, meaning my hair absorbs moisture okay and keeps it for a decent amount of time. Low porosity hair doesn’t absorb moisture easily, however once it does, the moisture stays for a very long time. This can lead to product build up which will need to be cleansed regularly. Low porosity often requires using heat to absorb moisture (such as putting on a hair mask, a plastic shower cap and blowing hot air at it). High porosity hair absorbs moisture quickly, but it also lets it out quickly. Often requires good conditioning, but may also require cleansing from time to time. It will often feel frizzy, and humidity will have a big impact on high porosity hair. Unfortunately, you can’t really change the porosity of your hair, but you can definitely care for it! \n\n\n**Ingredients and Products**\n\nI have to say, compared to the east, the west has actually rather limited hair care options. Most high street and even salon brands are really not fantastic. I live in the UK, but I source most of my products from Eastern Europe, so for those of you in the US my specific recommendations might not be too much help, but you might be able to find some or find alternatives by looking at the ingredients list. \n\n**Ingredients**\n\nThere isn’t really a super easy way to go about this. After a year or so I learnt the names of ingredients that really work or don’t work for me and I look for or avoid them. [Here]( http://www.tightlycurly.com/ingredients/) is a good ingredients list which tells you what the ingredient is and what it is used for. It does also have a ‘good’ ‘okay’ ‘avoid’ rating system, however I wouldn’t necessarily take it into consideration, as how a lot of ingredients affect you is personal (for example some people’s hair responds well to sulfates or paraffin, others not so much). \n\nThe order of the ingredients list is not accidental. The further from the top, the less of that ingredient there is. Any beneficial ingredient listed after ‘parfum’ is not going to bring you any results, as it is basically a trace, however something that you are sensitive to can still have a negative effect on your scalp even at such trace amounts. \n\n*Things to look for*: \n\n*Oils* – any ingredient name that ends with oil (except mineral oil which is paraffin, more on this later!) is beneficial for hair. The more and the closer to the top of the list, the better, especially in masks and conditioners.\n\n*Extracts* – again any name that ends with extracts. These are extracts of naturally occurring plants, herbs, or even legumes which have different beneficial effects such as smoothing, adding shine, protecting or strengthening. \n\n*Emolients* – lanolin, anything with ‘butter’ (e.g. shea butter), cera alba (beeswax), pafarrinum liquidum (paraffin, more on this later)\n\n*Humectants* – glycerin, urea, mel (honey), aloe vera, fructose (sugars).\n\n*Antioxidants* – ascorbic acid (vit C), tocopherol (vit E), Ubiquinone (Q10), retinol/retinyl acelate/palmiatate (vit A), niacinamide (vit B3). \n\n*Proteins* – hydrolysed silk, hydrolysed keratin, hydrolysed wheat protein, hydrolysed oat protein. Proteins help to strengthen hair. \n\n*Soothing ingredients* – allantoin, arnica montana, calendula officinalis, panthenol. Particularly useful if you have a sensitive scalp.\n\n\n*What to avoid (generally speaking):*\n\n*Sulfates* – Sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, although if anything in the ingredients list of your shampoo ends with sulfate, check on the list for strength. Sulfates don’t always need to be avoided.  They are cleansers and foaming agents used in a large majority of shampoos. They can strip your hair of oils and humectants and dry the skin on your scalp, however they are also useful in the removal of silicones.  They shouldn’t be used every day, but once a week to every 2 weeks is recommended if you use silicones on your hair. If your scalp and roots respond well to sulfates, you can protect the lengths of your hair by applying an oil or conditioner pre-washing, thoroughly washing your scalp and roots with a sulfate shampoo and only using the leftover foam on the length, then conditioning again. There are more and less harsh versions, and the gentler ones can be used more frequently, please refer to ingredient list! Not recommended for curly hair.\n\n*Parabens and preservatives* – Ones I found particularly harmful to me personally: DMDM Hydantoin, 5-Bromo-5-Nitro-1,3-Dioxane, 2-Bromo-2-Nitropropane-1,3-Diol, Diazolidynyl Urea, Imidiazolidynyl Urea, Phenyl Benzoate, Phenyl Dimethicone, Formaldehyde, Methylchloroisothiazolinone. Parabens are used to prevent products from going off. They’re not the only preservatives used in hair care and by no means the worst ones, but they can affect your scalp and hair. Eco-shampoos and conditioners are often filled with alcohol instead of parabens which can really dry out your scalp and hair. I don’t find parabens to be bad for my hair at all, but this is personal and you will have to eliminate and reintroduce (see that thing I said about time consuming at the start?) to really find out. You will not be able to find a preservative free product, therefore it is worth checking which work for you. \n\n*Alcohol* – alcohol denat and isopropyl alcohol, most others are fatty alcohols which are moisturising. The only time harsh alcohols are useful is when using hair ‘rubs’, where they help with product absorption. \n\n*Scents* – most scenting ingredients are listed under parfum, however some particularly harsh ones are required to be listed separately. These are: limonene, linalool, citronellol, geraniol, coumarin, citral, benzyl benzoate and eugenol. They’re usually at the very end of the list and in the trace amounts will not usually do any harm unless you have a sensitivity. \n\n*Silicones* – similarly to sulfates, silicones are not always bad. I personally like silicones. They work with my hair without concealing its true condition much or weighing it down. If your hair is thin you may find it better to only use the more soluble ones or none at all.\nI avoid shampoos with silicones at all cost though. The job of a shampoo is to cleanse your hair and prepare it for absorption of beneficial ingredients. I allow water soluble and gentle shampoo soluble silicones in conditioners and hair masks, and I use SLS requiring silicones in leave in conditioners that I only put on the ends of my hair. \n\nWater soluble silicones are: dimethicone copolyol, lauryl methicone copolyol, hydrolyzed wheat protein hydroxypropyl polysiloxane and silicones with PEG and a number at the start. The higher the number (especially above 10), the more water soluble the silicone. \n\nSilicones soluble in mild shampoo: amodimethicone, dimethicone, dimethiconol, beheonoxy dimethicone, phenyl trimethicone.\n\nNeed sulfates: simethicone, trimethicone, trimethylsilylamodimethicone, trimethylsiloxysilicates.\n\nEvaporate from hair (only washing with a conditioner to become soluble): cyclometicone, cyclopentasiloxane, cyclotetrasiloxane, octamethyl cyclotetrasiloxane, cyclohexasiloxane.\n\nI would advise completely removing silicones from your hair care routine for a week (you might find out your hair curls when it never did before), and then slowly reintroducing them one by one from the mildest to the heaviest ones to see how your hair reacts.  \n\n*Paraffin*  - Mineral Oil, Paraffinum Liquidum, Paraffin Oil, white oil are most common names of Paraffin. Paraffin has made a bad name for itself, it is known to be comedogenic to skin, however this does not happen to everybody, and even then you don’t have to put it on your scalp. Paraffin can be found in conditioners, masks and hair oils, and I’ve never had problems with it as an ingredient. It is also found in a lot of baby products, as near enough no one is allergic to it. You will have to experiment to see how it works for you. If it agrees with your hair, it works much quicker than natural oils – you will see results from first use, rather than after months of regular use. Products containing paraffin can be used after washing and conditioning to protect your hair from split ends. Paraffin requires stronger cleansing agents such as SLS for removal, and therefore not recommended for curly hair. \n\n\n**Products**\n\nNow, let’s look at specific products and how to get the most of them. \n\n*Hair Oils*\nI cannot recommend hair oils enough. This is probably the number one thing that changed my hair. I have been using hair oils for 6+ years and have never looked back. I’ve tried A LOT of oils, and my favourite one is [khadi]( https://www.essentialslondon.com/products/hair-care/khadi-vitalising-hair-oil-100ml?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuOPxmKHw1QIVCrftCh1njgn9EAQYAyABEgIwGPD_BwE#fo_c=762&fo_k=e4b0478aa27161be9771ad687e8f656d&fo_s=gplauk). It promotes hair growth and keeps my hair healthy and shiny, but some people don’t like the scent. Pure argan oil and rosehip oil are also great for me, as is pure coconut oil or the coconut hair oil from [vatika]( https://www.amazon.com/Dabur-Vatika-Enriched-Coconut-150ml/dp/B006BA3BAY/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_121_bs_t_1/136-1463637-2732606?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=B8H7QG82QJF78X98V78D). There are a lot of oils on the market, just make sure what you’re using is pure oil, not stuff like the brand ‘moroccan oil’ because even your cooking olive oil is better than that. You can find a lot of indian hair oils on amazon. Apply by taking a few droplets and warming them up in your palms, then rubbing into the scalp and the lengths of the hair. When I first started my hair care and my hair was quite damaged, I would apply oils overnight every other night (before washing), and sleep with a cotton hair cap on to prevent transfer onto my pillow, then wash it off and condition in the morning. I now wash my hair in the evenings, so I apply it for about an hour before washing and I find that’s enough, but my hair is not particularly damaged.\n\n*Shampoos*\n\nFor day to day cleansing I try to find as simple a shampoo as possible, such as this [Babydream]( https://www.codecheck.info/kosmetik_koerperpflege/babypflege/babyshampoo/ean_4305615272467/id_792172/Babydream_Shampoo_mit_Kamille.pro). I’ve tried other ones over the years, but always come back to this one as it’s super cheap and gentle. I also like [Equilibria aloe vera shampoo]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,51609,equilibra-aloe-shampoo.html). Other products that I’ve used as a shampoo that aren’t a shampoo: [Facelle intimate wash]( http://www.rossmann.pl/Produkt/Facelle-intim-plyn-do-higieny-intymnej-Sensitive-300-ml,101735,7210), [Johnson’s Baby 3in1 Wash]( http://www.johnsonsbaby.com.pl/johnsons-baby-%C5%82agodny-p%C5%82yn-do-mycia-cia%C5%82a-i-w%C5%82os%C3%B3w-3w1). At the start I found my hair a bit tangled after use, but I think that was partly due to the damage. For heavier cleansing I use [Avalon organics rosemary]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/Avalon-Organics-Rosemary-Volumizing-Shampoo/dp/B001ET78QU) or any of the herbal [Barwa Natura]( https://www.barwa.com.pl/seria/barwa-naturalna/) shampoos. I do this every 10-14 days depending on how my hair feels regarding silicones and paraffin that I’ve used. A special mention goes to [Babuszka Agafia Black Soap]( https://bioika.pl/pl/p/Naturalne-Syberyjskie-Czarne-Mydlo-Agafii-na-bazie-37-ziol/659) which is just amazing. \n\n*Conditioners*\n\nI like to go rich here. I look for alllll of the extracts, oils, humectants, anything and everything. My everyday conditioner is the [Garnier avocado and shea butter]( https://www.fragrancedirect.co.uk/garnier-ultimate-blends-the-nourishing-repairer-conditioner-0083190.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=merchant&utm_keyword=foo&istCompanyId=17773c4e-a26f-4631-9b91-73e6422dbe77&istItemId=xiqwpwpqil&istBid=tztx&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9Oud06Lw1QIVxbztCh0PbQzcEAkYASABEgI4UfD_BwE) and it’s been with me for years. I also like the [seboradin ginseng conditioner]( https://seboradin.pl/en/seboradin-revitalizing/29-lotion-seboradin-revitalizing.html), Nivea Long Repair, [Balea Coconut and Milk](http://lepotica.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/balea-mleko-za-telo-lepotica.jpg) and [Timotei Precious Oils]( https://www.amazon.com/Timotei-Precious-Oil-Hair-Conditioner/dp/B00UGHRW6M). Currently I apply in-shower for however long it takes me to shave and wash, then rinse off. When my hair was damaged, I would put a cap on and leave them on for 30 mins, then rinse.\n\n*Masks*\n\nAs with conditioners, as many of the goodies as possible. This is probably the product I’ve switched up the most, as there are not very many BAD hair masks, usually they’re between average and amazing. My favourites over the years have been [Alterra]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,43114,haarkur-granatapfel-aloe-vera.html), [Natur Vital aloe vera]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,40836,naturvital-sensitive-hair-mask-aloe-vera-juniper-zimbro.html) mask, [biovax masks such as this]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/LBiotica-Biovax-Damaged-Hair-250ml/dp/B00N42XUL2), [Babuszka Agafia yeast mask]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,51660,pervoe-reshenie-przepisy-babci-agafii-maska-do-wlosow-drozdzowa-na-pobudzenie-wzrostu.html) and [Kallos Latte]( https://www.notino.co.uk/kallos/serical-mask-for-damaged-chemically-treated-hair/?item=78561&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqp7vxKPw1QIVbb7tCh2u0QGcEAQYASABEgKtzPD_BwE) mask. I used to apply masks twice a week, but now I do it weekly or even every 10 days. Usually I will apply a mask instead of conditioner, throw on a shower cap, and keep it on for anywhere between 1 and 3 hours before rinsing. Sometimes I will blow warm air from the hairdryer to help the ingredients absorb better.\n\n*Rinses*\n\nThere are many rinses you can make at home, not really available as products to buy. I like a chamomile rinse the best as I’m blonde, I also like a dissolved aloe one, but you can experiment with ingredients recommended for your hair type. They can strengthen your hair, add shine, reduce frizz, make it sleeker.\n\n*Rubs*\n\nThese are products that you rub into your scalp and roots (and sometimes hair length) without rinsing off. My favourite is from [Jantar]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,69415,jantar-odzywka-do-wlosow-i-skory-glowy-nowa-wersja.html), I also like [Joanna Rzepa]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,17640,rzepa-kuracja-wzmacniajaca.html). There are also placenta capsules after which I got an insane amount of baby hair. Rubs help with growth and strength of hair!\n\n*Hair protection*\n\nI use something with silicones and proteins in to protect my end, usually the silk from [biovax]( http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/like/112353278842?chn=ps&dispItem=1&adgroupid=44158024220&rlsatarget=pla-324287136906&abcId=1128926&adtype=pla&merchantid=115212699&poi=&googleloc=1007281&device=c&campaignid=856227250&crdt=0), but some hair oils (especially coconut) will also do. I do this once my hair is at least half dry and leave it in. If I’m not washing my hair for longer than 2 days, I will reapply. \n\n*Vitamins, Supplements etc.*\n\nThere are a lot of supplements you can try to help your hair growth or its condition. Vitamin E is obviously a staple. Biotin is fantastic for hair growth. Pregnancy vitamins strengthen hair. Drinking nettle and horsetail tea will do wonders. If you are really, really adventurous and can stomach a lot, drinking yeast (fresh is best, but dry will do) is the best for hair growth. You need to drink it every day for a prolonged period of time though, and it is incredibly unpleasant so requires a lot of commitment.\n\n*Hair styling and others*\n\nAs you might have seen from my previous post, I don’t often style my hair, and have never done. I do hairdry on cold or lukewarm settings, but I only use heat stylers for events and I chuck in a lot of hair protection. I’m gonna experiment a little with styling after my most recent post, but after looking for styling products, I’ve found very few that are not harmful to hair. I don’t brush my hair wet unless using the wet brush, I have a cotton tshirt I use to absorb water from it with instead of a towel, I don’t sleep with it wet, I keep it in a loose twisted bun overnight mostly to avoid rubbing. I have 3 different hair brushes (sable and synthetic) and a tangle teezer. If it’s very windy, I plait my hair, and I wear a hat in the sun. I wear a cap to go swimming. \n\n\nWell done if you got to the end, you are a hero. I hope you find these tips useful and can pick and mix as you please! Give most products 3-4 weeks to do their work before you deem them useless though. Looking forward to any tips you ladies might have on hair care, discussion, and what you found works for you and if you’re as obsessive as I am about it! \n\n\nEdit: link with some [hair photos](https://imgur.com/a/CQU90), 6 year difference",

The product and tin is holographic words and drawings on black, it shines beautifully in the light.

    "body": "So I was the Clinique counter a little bit ago for some BIY drops, and was given a bottle free because they’ve been discontinued. I felt obliged to buy something for some reason, so I bought this cleanser. \n\nI normally use plain plant oil only to cleanse, sometimes Simlple foaming gel cleanser. My dry skin cannot tolerate harsh surfactant cleansers of any kind, even micellar water can dry it out. So I stick with oils and my skin loves it. (I have dry and dehydrated skin, no acne). \n\n**THE PRODUCT:** It’s soap and surfactant free. It’s a cleansing lotion, made mostly of oils and emollients. It’s white, and unscented, has a thin lotion consistency. Pump bottle, which I like. It’s 14 $ or £ for 6.7 oz. I guess that’s a bit expensive, I don’t know. \n\n**PERFORMANCE:** I’m surprised, I really liked this a lot initially. My first test run was washing off a face full of thick Neutrogena Sheer Zinc 22% zinc oxide sunscreen and Clinique Even Better foundation. I wasn’t expecting it to get my face clean. Alas, I had to double cleanse with it, and give myself a nice little massage, but my face was completely clean afterwards. I removed it with warm water and went over my face with a wet flannel. I had only done my face an hour or so beforehand, so impressed. Every time I’ve used it since, I’ve had the same performance. The rinse-ability is awesome, it flushes with warm water so much easier than plain oils, and even easier somehow than the Simple, even though the Simple contains mild surfactants. \n\nThe afterfeel is both clean, but not stripped. My skin feels cleaner than when I wash with oil or the Simple. There’s less of a soft coating. But not nearly as stripped or tight/dry as when I use, for example, Neutrogena gentle foaming cleanser or Cetaphil foaming cleanser. So it’s somewhere in the middle between cleansing with a foaming cleanser and cleaning with say, Grapeseed oil. I’ve tried it just for fun as a moisturizer and it’s not bad. I prefer oils to moisturize but this does the trick as a light moisturizer. And for its price/size, it’s a good deal. \n\nOverall I’m glad I bought it. It travels much easier than coconut oil or the soft tube of Simple. I may repurchase for that days that I need a bit more of a cleanse than my oils can offer me. I couldn’t use it every day, I need something more gentle, but a few times a week would be fine. \n\n**CAVEATS:**\n**Eventually I noticed my skin getting dryer and tighter with continued use. It’s just too much for me. **  I don’t know how this would perform with a full face of make up, esp. water proof eye make up. I don’t wear anything like that. (Although that sunscreen I use is super thick and full of silicones) I don’t think this would work well for a really dry skin, despite its name, it might clean a little *too* well. I actually think, without being certain, that an oily skin may benefit from this. \nI don’t know if any of the ingredients would proliferate acne or other skin issues. I’ve put the ingredients below. \n\n*Water / Aqua / Eau, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butylene Glycol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract / Extrait D'Orge, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seedcake, Dimethicone, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Cholesterol, Sucrose Stearate, Sucrose, Caffeine, PPG-20 Methyl Glucose Ether, Urea, Sodium PCA, Linoleic Acid, Propylene Glycol Dicaprate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria), Pentylene Glycol, Polyquaternium-51, Trehalose, Caprylyl Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate / VP Copolymer, Phenoxyethanol.*\n",

    "body": "Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum\n\nI’ve been using the Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum for just about a month now and boy has it been a ride.\n\nFirst things first, this is a very unique and interesting product. Even though it is called a serum...it is to be used at the start of your routine just after cleansing and actives. So, it really is more like a first essence in serum form.\n\nThis lightweight/jelly-like serum features mondo grass, licorice root, honey, walnut seed, lotus, and green tea...as well as other herbal extracts for a formulation that covers a lot of bases. Brightening, soothing, balancing, and antioxidant benefits can all be found here.\n\nAlcohol makes it pretty high on the ingredients list which surprised me initially. But, it makes sense because the main purpose of this serum is to facilitate the absorption of other products in your routine. \n\nMy first few applications of this product left me quite impressed. The Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum absorbs beautifully into the skin without any stickiness or residue. I typically used three pumps of product to gently pat into my skin. Although the alcohol scent is pretty apparent...there is a bit of sweet/hanbang fragrance that comes through.\n\nAfter use I noticed that my skin was looking more bright/illuminated and had a more bouncy look as well. Honestly, I felt like my skin was as close to that “dewy/honey-skin” look than it has ever been before.\n\nHaving said that...I really did not want this to be some kind of placebo or my mind trying to justify the rather high cost of this product. So, after three weeks I pulled the Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum from my routine to see if there would be a difference. It only took a couple of days for me to notice that my layers of toner weren’t sinking in as quickly. Plus, my skin was just lacking that bounce and feeling of deeper hydration (with no other changes to my routine).\n\nSo it seems that this product really does deliver on its promises. My skin has really seen an almost immediate improvement since working the First Care Activating Serum into my routine. But, I still don’t know if I would come back to it. I feel like if I started working in a really nice first treatment essence packed with fermented ingredients (and a bit of alcohol) I might see a similar result...and could probably find something much more affordable per oz.\n\nFor now, I’ll probably finish my bottle up and move back to other more “typical” serums that I have in my stash. If I do end up missing the benefits that I found in the Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum...you may see it pop back up in my routine next year.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water / Aqua / Eau, Butylene Glycol, Alcohol, Glycerin, Betaine, Peg/Ppg-17/6 Copolymer, Glyceryl Polyme-Thacrylate, Ophiopogon Japonicus Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Peg-60 Hyd-Rogenated Castor Oil, Carbomer, Tromethamine, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Fragrance / Parfum, Honey / Mel / Miel, Juglans Regia (Walnut) Seed Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Dextrin, Lilium Candidum Bulb Extract, Paeonia Albiflora Root Extract, Rehmannia Glutinosa Root Extract, Polygonatum Officinale Rhizome/Root Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Lim-Onene, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium Edta, Phenyl Trimethicone, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan), Linalool, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Zizyphus Jujuba Fruit Extract, Natto Gum, Citronellol, Citral, Propylene Glycol, Geraniol, Chlor-Phenesin, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Bht, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Sorbic Acid, Tocopherol\n\nWhere To Buy (Sephora - $84.00 USD - 60ml): [https://www.sephora.com/product/first-care-activating-serum-P448915?skuId=2291102&icid2=products%20grid:p448915:product](https://www.sephora.com/product/first-care-activating-serum-P448915?skuId=2291102&icid2=products%20grid:p448915:product) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rucvd6ywi3x51.jpg?width=3232&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7545190b935f956f295c85796c107ee805edf9dc",

I also noticed the Honeysuckle extract is now at the bottom, and Ceramide NP is a bit lower on the list. The Ethylhexyl palmitate scares me a bit since it may be comedogenic (but I don't take these lists seriously anymore, canola oil is a 5 on the scale and doesn't break me out, whereas jojoba oil is 0-2 but it breaks me out). \n\nSo yeah I was just asking if anyone has used both versions and if the new one is as good as the old one. I jusy tried it on my hands so far I love the texture :D Plus side is that it's probably even better for sensitive skin without the Myrtus extract.",

    "body": "I just picked up my package - a much-anticipated restock of my daily bb cream which I ordered from Missha's US website - only to discover the ingredients have been altered from my last haul. A lot of the good stuff that I loved for the skin benefits has been moved down the list considerably. I've always loved this bb cream because the #13 shade fits my skin pretty perfectly, and I'm generally demanding of my makeup in that I want it to be making me look better in the long run as well as the short run. Missha's ingredient list seemed to have some pretty great additions to do just that; It had a decent Pa protection rating and some ingredients I valued such as arbutin, squalane, adenosine, and ceramide.  Now... I think I might start looking for a new daily bb cream. Something with a similar shade, equal or better sun protection, but more potent anti-aging and completion-improving ingredients. If anyone has suggestions, I'd love to hear them! \n\nFor the curious - I've included the ingredient lists for comparison. While the old list can be found on various old reviews (such as one I grabbed from [here](http://nouveaucheap.blogspot.com/2012/09/review-missha-perfect-cover-bb-cream.html), the latest rendition on [missha's site](http://www.misshaus.com/m-perfect-cover-bb-cream-spf-42-pa.html) has some considerable changes, at least IMHO. Maybe it's less a big deal to others, idk.\n\nOld Ingredients:\n> Water(Aqua), Cyclomethicone, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Zinc Oxide, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mineral Oil, Phenyl Trimethicone, Talc, Arbutin, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Dimethicone, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Squalane, Adenosine, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, PEG-10 Dimethicone, Polyethylene, Beeswax(Cera Alba), Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Caviar Extract, Algae Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Fagus Sylvatica Bud Extract, Ceramide 3, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Chloride, Fragrance(Parfum), Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Salicylate, Hydroxycitronellal, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Citronellol\nMAY CONTAIN[+/-; Titanium Dioxide(CI 77891), Iron Oxides(CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499)]\n\nLatest Rendition:\n>Water (aqua), cyclomethicone, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, zinc oxide, propylene glycol, titanium dioxide, caprylic/capric triglyceride, peg-10 dimethicone, cetyl peg/ppg-10/1 dimethicone, arbutin, mineral oil, glycerin, polyethylene, talc, phenyl trimethicone, beeswax (cera alba), iron oxides (ci 77492), sodium chloride, iron oxides (ci 77491 ), iron oxides (ci 77499), methylparaben, dimethicone, propylparaben, rosa canina fruit oil, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, squalane, hydrolyzed collagen, macadamia ternifolia seed oil, disodium edta, adenosine, caviar extract, algae extract, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, sodium hyaluronate, fagus sylvatica bud extract, ceramide 3, fragrance (parfum), hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, butylphenyl methylpropional, benzyl salicylate, hydroxycitronellal, alpha-isomethyl ionone, hexyl cinnamal, linalool, citronellol\n\n**EDIT**: Just fixed a link and some formating :P",

You can see the image of a jar spilling out the the cream to make the shape of a face or a face mask.\nThe back packaging has some some of its instructions printed in both Korean and also English with pictures on how to use the mask properly.\nThe ingredients were also stated at the back along with the expiration date.\n\nREVIEW:\nThe sheet itself was protected between two layers of film and divided into two parts, the upper part and lower part which was quite convenient to use.\nInstead of the clear essence/serum, it has a white gel-like cream with a thicker consistency than the typical essence in sheet masks.\nThis mask felt cooling on my skin and it did indeed soothe the redness and calming those zits on my face.\nThe after effect left my skin looking clear and moisturized. It gives me that healthy and radiant glow to my skin. I almost resisted putting on a moisturizer and night cream due to the moistness it provided to my face.\nHowever, the effect only lasted for 2-3 days but I'm sure with constant use, my skin will continue to improve.\n\nOVERALL:\nThis mask evened out my skin tone and made my face look plump. It also deeply moisturized my skin and provides a cooling sensation to it. The mask is good for pampering yourself after having a hectic day, preferably during night time. I recommend this mask to anyone with dry skin and also to those looking for a 2-in-1 mask (soothing+hydrating).\n\nRATING:\n8/10",

Ranging from most to least expensive i’d say your best options r aestura atobarrier 365 cream, zeroid intensive cream, and illiyoon ceramide ato concentrate cream (this one is popular around here but i find the aestura one to be a direct upgrade if you’re able to afford it bc the texture is better and less waxy). And i saw rice near the top of the ingredients list so if you want more of that i’d look into smth like the i’m from rice cream. Hope this helps",

    "body": "Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum\n\nI’ve been using the Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum for just about a month now and boy has it been a ride.\n\nFirst things first, this is a very unique and interesting product. Even though it is called a serum...it is to be used at the start of your routine just after cleansing and actives. So, it really is more like a first essence in serum form.\n\nThis lightweight/jelly-like serum features mondo grass, licorice root, honey, walnut seed, lotus, and green tea...as well as other herbal extracts for a formulation that covers a lot of bases. Brightening, soothing, balancing, and antioxidant benefits can all be found here.\n\nAlcohol makes it pretty high on the ingredients list which surprised me initially. But, it makes sense because the main purpose of this serum is to facilitate the absorption of other products in your routine. \n\nMy first few applications of this product left me quite impressed. The Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum absorbs beautifully into the skin without any stickiness or residue. I typically used three pumps of product to gently pat into my skin. Although the alcohol scent is pretty apparent...there is a bit of sweet/hanbang fragrance that comes through.\n\nAfter use I noticed that my skin was looking more bright/illuminated and had a more bouncy look as well. Honestly, I felt like my skin was as close to that “dewy/honey-skin” look than it has ever been before.\n\nHaving said that...I really did not want this to be some kind of placebo or my mind trying to justify the rather high cost of this product. So, after three weeks I pulled the Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum from my routine to see if there would be a difference. It only took a couple of days for me to notice that my layers of toner weren’t sinking in as quickly. Plus, my skin was just lacking that bounce and feeling of deeper hydration (with no other changes to my routine).\n\nSo it seems that this product really does deliver on its promises. My skin has really seen an almost immediate improvement since working the First Care Activating Serum into my routine. But, I still don’t know if I would come back to it. I feel like if I started working in a really nice first treatment essence packed with fermented ingredients (and a bit of alcohol) I might see a similar result...and could probably find something much more affordable per oz.\n\nFor now, I’ll probably finish my bottle up and move back to other more “typical” serums that I have in my stash. If I do end up missing the benefits that I found in the Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum...you may see it pop back up in my routine next year.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water / Aqua / Eau, Butylene Glycol, Alcohol, Glycerin, Betaine, Peg/Ppg-17/6 Copolymer, Glyceryl Polyme-Thacrylate, Ophiopogon Japonicus Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Peg-60 Hyd-Rogenated Castor Oil, Carbomer, Tromethamine, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Fragrance / Parfum, Honey / Mel / Miel, Juglans Regia (Walnut) Seed Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Dextrin, Lilium Candidum Bulb Extract, Paeonia Albiflora Root Extract, Rehmannia Glutinosa Root Extract, Polygonatum Officinale Rhizome/Root Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Lim-Onene, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium Edta, Phenyl Trimethicone, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan), Linalool, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Zizyphus Jujuba Fruit Extract, Natto Gum, Citronellol, Citral, Propylene Glycol, Geraniol, Chlor-Phenesin, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Bht, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Sorbic Acid, Tocopherol\n\nWhere To Buy (Sephora - $84.00 USD - 60ml): [https://www.sephora.com/product/first-care-activating-serum-P448915?skuId=2291102&icid2=products%20grid:p448915:product](https://www.sephora.com/product/first-care-activating-serum-P448915?skuId=2291102&icid2=products%20grid:p448915:product) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a62myzhoi3x51.jpg?width=3232&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3979ebe68a1de952d3d4007ecc1140f55c08662",

I've tried supposedly non-comedogenic chemical sunscreens and chemical sunscreens where I know the non-sunscreen ingredients have not broken me out in the past, but they all still made me break out.  My other option was a mineral/physical sunscreen, but a lot of them are not cosmetically elegant -- often leaving a whitecast and/or a heavy, greasy feeling on top of my face.  This sunscreen is 100% brown skin-friendly, acne-prone skin approved!  It leaves no whitecast and it actually goes on like a chemical sunscreen.  It reapplies on top of make-up beautifully.  Best of all, it has not broken me out! Usually, within 4 days of using a sunscreen, I'll start to break out daily, but I have not had a new pimple since using this.  I wish the SPF was higher and had a PA rating of 4 +'s, but for now, this will have to do!  I will forever buy this sunscreen until I find something with a higher SPF and PA rating that ticks all the same boxes: does not cause breakouts, does not leave a whitecast, not heavy/greasy on face, and under $20 for 1.7 oz.",

I'm an oily girl too and this actually dried me out to an extreme so I did not like it, but I can definitely see the appeal for people with skin more oily than mine. \n\n\nSo, you're basically looking for a mineral sunscreen with lots of silicones. The silicones were helping control your oil. Here are some similar formulations I found on Olive Young:\n\n\n-Mary & May Cica Soothing Sun Cream\n\n-Etude Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk (I do personally recommend this one for oil control and have gone through probably a dozen bottles)\n\n-Beplain Sun Muse Mineral Sunscreen \n\n-Innisfree UV Active Poreless Sunscreen (this one is tinted)\n\n-Real Barrier Cica Green Tone-Up Sun Cream \n\n-The Saem UV Perfection Poreless Tone Up Sun Cream\n\n\nThose are just to name a few similar to your HG, and again, this was just from Olive Young. I know it's always sad when a product we love gets discontinued. If I might add, if you're looking for oil control, perhaps look into Japanese sunscreens. A lot of them contain alcohol and dry down less oily and more matte, and they have some more matte formulations overall that are better for oily skin. \n\n\nGood luck!!",

    "body": "E Nature Iroul E Rice Essential Tone Starter\n\nWhen I was first introduced to K-Beauty the hardest thing for me to grasp/understand was the difference between an essence and a toner. \n\nI ended up discovering that toners, essences, and first treatment essences are all steps that serve a specific role in a skincare routine...but the actual products representing these steps can be used in multiple ways depending on skin needs/formulations. \n\nWhile I typically use both a toner AND essence in my routine...it’s more about understanding the intent of the specific product you are holding more than anything else. Also, texture and consistency can help you decide where to place a product in your routine. \n\nThe E Nature Rice Essential Tone-Starter is called a “toner”...but the ingredients list is packed with fermented ingredients often found in first treatment essences.\n\nLactobacillus Ferment is the main ingredient followed by Rice Germ Extract and Niacinamide. The formulation is lightweight, watery, and centered around brightening. \n\nIn essence...it reads more like an essence.\n\nI ended up using this in my toner step however, just after the Iope Bio Essence. That product is something that really is intended to be used right after cleansing.\n\nRegardless, I enjoyed using the E Nature Rice Essential Toner for the most part. It provides a nice burst of hydration to the skin...and it really helped to amplify the brightening power of other fermented ingredient/Niacinamide pack products in my routine (I can never have enough).\n\nThe fresh/clean scent of this product is pleasant and not overwhelming. Plus, the pump style bottle allows for a more consistent application and less mess. \n\nHowever, there is a bit of sheen/residue that this product leaves behind making it something I didn't feel comfortable layering and layering on (like I tend to do with my toners). \n\nThis is more of a “just a couple of layers and we are done” situation. So for me, this wasn't a total winner or something that I would come back to. \n\nThose that like to combine steps may like this product as it technically does the work of a toner and essence. But, if you like to layer and layer watery toners on until your skin is dewy and plump...this might not be the best fit.\n\nFull Ingredients List: LACTOBACILLUS/RICE FERMENT, WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, GLYCERIN, ORYZA SATIVA (RICE) BRAN EXTRACT, ORYZA SATIVA (RICE) GERM EXTRACT, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCERETH-26, ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, POLYGLYCERYL-4 CAPRATE, BETAINE, C12-14 PARETH-12, PHENYL TRIMETHICONE, SQUALANE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, CETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, NEOPENTYL GLYCOL DIHEPTANOATE, PANTHENOL, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYLACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, HYDROGENATED PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, POLYGLYCERYL-10 MYRISTATE, TROMETHAMINE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, DISODIUM EDTA, POLYGLYCERYL-2 STEARATE, STEARIC ACID, SOLUABLE PROTEOGLYCAN, CITRUS AURANTIUM BERGAMIA (BERGAMOT) FRUIT OIL, CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS (SAFFLOWER) SEED OIL, OENOTHERA BIENNIS (EVENING PRIMROSE) OIL, PELAGONIUM GRAVEOLENS FLOWER OIL, POLYQUATERNIUM-51 BETA-GLUCAN, DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL, ROSA DAMASCENA FLOWER OIL\n\nWhere To Buy ($18.90 USD on Style Korean): [https://www.stylekorean.com/shop/enature-iroul-e-rice-essential-tone-starter-150ml/1582260707/](https://www.stylekorean.com/shop/enature-iroul-e-rice-essential-tone-starter-150ml/1582260707/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prlt3z3rrmh51.jpg?width=3952&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91c5791f6bcc2555e7db5aeb68cf2b4bc52a35fe",

It’s like a wheaty scent, which I like.\n\nTexture: Very thick texture, like a balm that doesn’t really spread well on the skin. It’s a bit too “solid”\n\nReason for purchase: I really liked the ingredient list as it contained a lot of nutrients my skin needs such as peptides, ceramide, niacinamide, squalene… etc. Reviews were also encouraging.\n\nSeason for intended use: Winter\n\nFrequency & place in routine: Daily in the PM moisturizer step\n\nLength of use: several months\n\nExperience: I’ll start off by saying that this is not the best product out there. It was on sale when I bought it, so I wanted to take a chance. It’s not worth it. It’s too difficult to spread on the skin, requires a lot of pulling and if you warm it up in your hands, it doesn’t transfer well, but just kinds of clings to your hands. It does NOT absorb. Like at all. It is so incredibly sticky and greasy, and I have dry skin. That is why I could not use it in the AM, and I even ruined a couple of pillowcases because of it. Of note, it did absolutely nothing for dehydration. The only one small redeeming point is that when using it immediately after an AHA exfoliator, it does help to soften the skin and restore nutrition.

It’s a bit too much packaging for a small amount of product, though. \n\nScent: Yuzu scent (surprise!)\n\nTexture: Complex, lol! It has this nice gel-like texture that actually looks like yuzu jello, with PULP inside it. It has these little particles that are reminiscent of Yuzu peel. They disappear upon application.\n\nReason for purchase: I wanted to try a sleeping mask and really liked that this one had Vitamin C, retinol and ceramides. Seemed like it would help with both dehydration and hyperpigmentation.\n\nSeason for use: Year-round\n\nFrequency & place in routine: Sleep mask to replace PM moisturizer, once or twice a week.\n\nLength of use: several months\n\nExperience: The scent, packaging and texture of this product make it a very pleasurable experience to use! It’s so refreshing and I enjoyed using it. However, it was not hydrating enough, despite the gel-like texture – it does not protect from dehydration overnight unfortunately. Although it does make my skin a bit more supple the day after. Perhaps I needed to use it daily to see effects? One thing I did not like was that it does leave a sticky and tacky feeling after application. I’m giving 3/5 because I think it might be very good for oily, combination and normal skin types.\n\nRepurchase: No\n\nOverall Score (1 lowest, 5 highest): 3/5",

That might be why you didn't find it hydrating, but also of course, it might just not work for you! I use it over the dynasty cream 1-3 times a week and I can always notice a difference when I wake up, but it is one of my favourite products so again, everyone's different!",

    "body": "My skin type: Combination \nConcerns: Redness, acne, aging\n\nWhat it’s supposed to do: Multi-tasking, targeted lactic acid treatment rapidly exfoliates and boosts naturally youthful radiance, while visibly reducing the look of lines, wrinkles and dark spots.\n\nWhat it actually does: Jack shit for me. Always get trial sizes of expensive products!\n\nSo I think Sunday Riley shot themselves in the foot with posting fake product reviews, not only in terms of PR, but also by creating false expectations. I knew about the fake reviews, but I was still intrigued, so I bought  three samples from eBay. \n\nI decided to use it every night until I finished it, which really streamlined my routine. GG is a gel cream that never seems to fully absorb, so I’d wash my face, put on eye moisturizer and GG, and follow it up with some marula oil. Although it’s technically an active, it feels moisturizing.  \n\nAfter a couple of days, I was like: when does the magic happen? My skin felt and looked fine, but it was in no way transformed. I thought perhaps I wasn’t using it enough, so I stepped it up to morning and night. Still no noticeable improvement.\n\nIt’s possible I got bad/fake/expired samples, so I ordered two more from a different vendor. Just confirmed for me that GG is nothing more than an insanely overpriced moisturizer. \n\nVerdict: Definitely would not repurchase. I have a little bit left, and I’ll probably use it up in the next week or two. \n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua, Opuntia Tuna Fruit Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris Leaf Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Leuconostoc/ Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Caprylic/ Capric Triglyceride, Squalane, Lactic Acid, PPG-12/ Smdi Copolymer, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Disiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Stearyl Glycyrrhetinate, Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Chlorphenesin, Sodium Phytate",

I let the company know several times that it’s the only spf I can use and how grateful I was that it existed and to please not change the ingredients. I’ve recommended Paula’s Choice to so many people… I still have a bit left but have no idea what I’m going to do when it runs out - I burn really easily and the dermatologist said I can’t go out without spf because it will make my skin problems even worse. It took a lot of experimentation and wasted money before I found the old version Calm spf. Even the hospital-prescribed “sensitive skin” spf felt like I had put burning hot oil on my face and I had to remove it straight away. I explained to PC that every time I have a bad reaction it makes my skin more sensitive so it’s really difficult to try a new spf knowing that it will almost definitely set off a painful inflammatory reaction and make my skin permanently worse. The thing is for those of us who have really intolerant skin, we don’t have the choice to easily switch brands. Some people didn’t like how it looked on their skin - I’m not bothered about this - it’s a medical necessity for me to wear spf if I want to go out - but actually it looked fine. I was holed up in my house for months before I found the old calm spf. It’s so upsetting that the company ignored feedback. The new formulation has had terrible reviews and a lot of their existing customers have stopped buying from them. I wish they would just bring the old formulation back. It’s comforting to know I’m not alone in this.",

    "body": "PICS INCLUDED below, as requested\n\nMy hair is horribly damaged, and was breaking like crazy handful upon handful of hair each time I showered. I know it doesn't look like if from the pictures but I have 2b-c hair, coarse and very thick.  what should I be doing next?\n\n**Processes that have been applied**: Kevin Murphy colour in January\n\n**Routine**: Prose shampoo, conditioner, curl cream--all silicone free (prose is custom made hair line; no specific list on product bottles, but a very long list of possible ingredients online.) Blow dry or flat iron BANGS ONLY. Just started using OKAY Black Jamaican Castor oil conditioner.\n\nJust had my hair trimmed (usually 3-4months, but covid so it was 6 months) and they used Redken Allsoft and extreme for bond repair\n\n**What I bought so far but have not used yet**: Olaplex 0 and 3, AG repair line-vitamin C reconstruct (contains: Dimethicone, Divinyldimethicone/Dimethicone Copolymer, Diphenylsiloxy Phenyl Trimethicone, Perfluorononyl Dimethicone, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate), AG repair line-slip vitamin c dry oil spray\n\n**Other info**: I know the whole CG routine and it's not for me.  I have used devacurl and stopped years ago because it made my scalp a scabby crusty mess, and my hair flat and lifeless--so please don't recommend that line. I believe my porosity is level 4 ([tutorial by manes by mell](https://youtu.be/yT383xYwEpU)). I am not opposed to using silicone, sulphates or even parabens. Because science.\n\n**Questions:**\n\nDo I have enough product going on here to **fortify, moisturize and condition** my hair so all of those crazy breakage leftovers can grow out again?\n\nHow do I make sure I don't end up with \"**moisture lockout**\"?\n\nShould I attempt a **protein treatment**? (at home--I can't go into salons where I live), if so recommendations please.\n\nHow often should I use a **\"clarifying\" shampoo** to remove silicone buildup?\n\nWhere are my curls?\n\n**Bonus round:**\n\nI am unsure if I will continue using my current shampoo and conditioner. Any recommendations for a new ones?\n\nEdit: pics didn't post, forgot my clarifying shampoo question.\n\n[after trim and treatment--still in need of help](https://preview.redd.it/zeef1vaosgg51.jpg?width=360&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9aebe42a33f81411e86a2939aa2efa707eb6a71)\n\n[before trim and treatment--crispy](https://preview.redd.it/wc2pdzaosgg51.jpg?width=360&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4dc6927d36fe546c6d92d46f96932afab2ca90c)",

However, there's no SPF rating. I do use a foundation with atleast SPF 15 when I use this primer, but since I'm using acids for PIH, I want to make sure that I'm well protected.\n\nTIA!\n\n",

She gave the product 6 stars out of 7. The product has a total 5 out of 7 stars on cosme.net with 512 reviews. It's ranked 2nd on cosme.net under the Gel/Cream Eyeshadow category.\n\n>I bought the limited edition color Sheer Apricot.\n>This eyeshadow has 2 colors (2 textures??), a cream and a powder.\n>It's described as a combination of an adhesive gel cream and a fit powder for shading.\n>Maquillage had a similar one a while ago that came with an applicator that I really liked.\n>Looking at it, it stands out because it's small and easy to carry and the packaging is cute ♪\n\n>When you apply the cream, it glides on really easily and has a smooth texture.\n>You can use this as a base too, which saves time.\n>(I always use a base under my eyeshadows)\n>The powder has an interesting consistency! It's really moist when you touch it with your finger.\n>What is this? I wonder if there are a lot of moisturizing ingredients in it.\n>Because usually powders fly all over the place.\n>This isn't like that at all so it can go straight from your fingertip to your eyelid without making a mess.\n>It's wonderful not having any fallout!!\n>Please test out this moist powder for yourself. Lol\n\n>It's a pretty light, yellow-based color so I was worried if it would show up at all. \n>But as you can see from the pictures, it is conservative, but it creates a beautiful nude eye look! (in my opinion lol)\n>And it's sheer. It really has that \"transparency\" that's so trendy right now. LOL\n>Conservative and elegant are the perfect words to describe it. But it's so beautiful when you glance down ♪\n>It's so glossy, as if it's wet.\n>It's perfect for when you want to subtly emphasize your eyes ♪\n>Like when you want your lip color to be the focus.\n\n>Since the base color is a cream, the shadow doesn't crease or fade.\n>Furthermore, this product is waterproof!! I was so surprised!!\n>I really like Integrate products lately.\n>They're reasonably priced and excellent quality.\n>As to be expected from Shiseido.\n\n>This doesn't come with an applicator so I use my finger, but because it's so small I feel like it'll be hard to use up the last of the product. Even if it costs 100 yen more, I think it'd be nice if there was an applicator included for the cream. (Like that Maquillage product I mentioned ♪)\n\n>But it's really an excellent eyeshadow.\n>I want to try the other colors, too!\n\n>PIC [1](http://cdn-cosme.net/media/collection/209/729/4516197_wl.jpg), [2](http://cdn-cosme.net/media/collection/209/729/4516196_wl.jpg)\n\nI also translated the ingredients list from the [official website](http://www.shiseido.co.jp/sw/products/SWFG070410.seam?shohin_pl_c_cd=669901):\nMETHYL TRIMETHICONE, TRIMETHYLSILOXYSILICATE, CERESIN, DIPHENYLSILOXY PHENYL TRIMETHICONE, SILICA, CALCIUM ALUMINUM BOROSILICATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, DIISOSTEARYL MALATE, DISTEARDIMONIUM HECTORITE, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, PEG-10 DIMETHICONE, MACADAMIA INTEGRIFOLIA SEED OIL, TOCOPHEROL, TIN OXIDE, ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE, METHYLPARABEN, MICA, TITANIUM DIOXIDE, SYNTHETIC FLUORPHLOGOPITE, IRON OXIDES\n\nThis color is so pretty!

They discontinued this formula quite a while ago, it seems, and the current formula is free of silicones - I think mostly what I’m getting from this product is the benefit of the silicone-forward formula, combined with the lack of any lingering scent, which I appreciate a lot. Can anyone recommend another styling crème that’s heavy on silicones and doesn’t have much, if any of a smell to it? \n\nThis is the ingredient list for the old formula that works well for me: \n\nIngredients: Water/eau, dimethicone, cyclopentasiloxane, dimethiconol, butylene glycol, phenyl trimethicone, olive glycerides, acrylamide/sodium acryloyldimethyltaurate copolymer, vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract, hydrolyzed concholin protein, panthenol, C13-14 isoparrafin, fragrance/parfum, polysorbate-20, laureth-7, disodium ETA, sodium benzoate, DMDM hydantoin, titanium dioxide, mica, yellow 5",

The Aura masque certainly added some color and does help the roots blend even if it doesn't fully cover grey.

    "body": "E Nature Iroul E Rice Essential Tone Starter\n\nWhen I was first introduced to K-Beauty the hardest thing for me to grasp/understand was the difference between an essence and a toner. \n\nI ended up discovering that toners, essences, and first treatment essences are all steps that serve a specific role in a skincare routine...but the actual products representing these steps can be used in multiple ways depending on skin needs/formulations. \n\nWhile I typically use both a toner AND essence in my routine...it’s more about understanding the intent of the specific product you are holding more than anything else. Also, texture and consistency can help you decide where to place a product in your routine. \n\nThe E Nature Rice Essential Tone-Starter is called a “toner”...but the ingredients list is packed with fermented ingredients often found in first treatment essences.\n\nLactobacillus Ferment is the main ingredient followed by Rice Germ Extract and Niacinamide. The formulation is lightweight, watery, and centered around brightening. \n\nIn essence...it reads more like an essence.\n\nI ended up using this in my toner step however, just after the Iope Bio Essence. That product is something that really is intended to be used right after cleansing.\n\nRegardless, I enjoyed using the E Nature Rice Essential Toner for the most part. It provides a nice burst of hydration to the skin...and it really helped to amplify the brightening power of other fermented ingredient/Niacinamide pack products in my routine (I can never have enough).\n\nThe fresh/clean scent of this product is pleasant and not overwhelming. Plus, the pump style bottle allows for a more consistent application and less mess. \n\nHowever, there is a bit of sheen/residue that this product leaves behind making it something I didn't feel comfortable layering and layering on (like I tend to do with my toners). \n\nThis is more of a “just a couple of layers and we are done” situation. So for me, this wasn't a total winner or something that I would come back to. \n\nThose that like to combine steps may like this product as it technically does the work of a toner and essence. But, if you like to layer and layer watery toners on until your skin is dewy and plump...this might not be the best fit.\n\nFull Ingredients List: LACTOBACILLUS/RICE FERMENT, WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, GLYCERIN, ORYZA SATIVA (RICE) BRAN EXTRACT, ORYZA SATIVA (RICE) GERM EXTRACT, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCERETH-26, ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, POLYGLYCERYL-4 CAPRATE, BETAINE, C12-14 PARETH-12, PHENYL TRIMETHICONE, SQUALANE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, CETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, NEOPENTYL GLYCOL DIHEPTANOATE, PANTHENOL, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYLACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, HYDROGENATED PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, POLYGLYCERYL-10 MYRISTATE, TROMETHAMINE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, DISODIUM EDTA, POLYGLYCERYL-2 STEARATE, STEARIC ACID, SOLUABLE PROTEOGLYCAN, CITRUS AURANTIUM BERGAMIA (BERGAMOT) FRUIT OIL, CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS (SAFFLOWER) SEED OIL, OENOTHERA BIENNIS (EVENING PRIMROSE) OIL, PELAGONIUM GRAVEOLENS FLOWER OIL, POLYQUATERNIUM-51 BETA-GLUCAN, DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL, ROSA DAMASCENA FLOWER OIL\n\nWhere To Buy ($18.90 USD on Style Korean): [https://www.stylekorean.com/shop/enature-iroul-e-rice-essential-tone-starter-150ml/1582260707/](https://www.stylekorean.com/shop/enature-iroul-e-rice-essential-tone-starter-150ml/1582260707/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sbtu2bfqqmh51.jpg?width=3952&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e38dc752d40c9fdbdbfa698f60560cc9b5210bf",

I chose e.l.f. since it was an easily accessible and affordable one to try out (~$14USD) and because someone mentioned it's a dupe for the Shiseido Clear Sunscreen Stick ($32USD).\n\nI compared the ingredients between the e.l.f. stick and the Shiseido stick and the ingredients are very similar. Same four chemical sunscreens with almost exact same percentage. First several inactive ingredients are also the same. I briefly compared it to other popular sunscreen sticks like Haruharu, Isntree, Supergoop, and Tocobo and the others aren't even remotely similar.\n\ne.l.f.: Active Ingredients: \nOctocrylene 10.0% \nHomosalate 7.3% \nOctisalate 5.0% \nAvobenzone 3.0%\n\nInactive Ingredients: Diphenylsiloxy Phenyl Trimethicone, Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Hydroxystearic Acid, Triethylhexanoin, Dibutyl Lauroyl Glutamide, Silica, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polyamide-8, Silica Silylate, Oryzanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Bisabolol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Tocopherol, Water (Aqua), Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract\n\nVs.\n\nShiseido: ACTIVE INGREDIENTS: \nOCTOCRYLENE 10.0% Sunscreen \nHOMOSALATE 10.0% Sunscreen \nOCTISALATE 5.0% Sunscreen \nAVOBENZONE 2.5% Sunscreen\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENTS: DIPHENYLSILOXY PHENYL TRIMETHICONE MINERAL OIL HYDROXYSTEARIC ACID TRIETHYLHEXANOIN PEG/PPG-9/2 DIMETHYL ETHER METHYL METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER DIBUTYL LAUROYL GLUTAMIDE C12-15 ALKYL BENZOATE POLYAMIDE-8 SILICA DIMETHYL SILYLATE TOCOPHERYL ACETATE PEG/PPG-14/7 DIMETHYL ETHER LECITHIN GIYCYRRHIZA GLABRA (LICORICE) ROOT EXTRACT PPG-17CASTOR OIL/IPDI COPOLYMER CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE BHT TOCOPHEROL PEG-6 PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRA-DI-T-BUTYLHYDROXYHYDROCINNAMATE SILICA FRAGRANCE.\n\nI am not chemist and of course the quantities of inactive ingredients vary buttttt they sure look similar lol\n\nBackground: \nI have very oily skin, very acne prone. I wear Estee Lauder DW foundation daily. I applied some at the end of my work day and even though I was oily already and at risk for foundation transfer, surprisingly, there was minimal smearing of makeup. So far, looks matte/soft and feels great. Can't even tell it's on.(Important to note I only did ~3 passes per area). \n\nMy regular sunscreen is the Trader Joe's clear sunscreen ($9USD) which is a dupe for Supergoop unseen sunscreen. It's clear, non greasy, silicone base so serves really well as a primer. \n\n(Currently, the TJ clear body sunscreen is available which is literally the exact same as the one for the face but significantly larger and cheaper so it's even more cost effective.)\n\nWill add updates after I use the stick a little more and how it does on vacation (:",

    "body": "I'm so grateful for AB to have taught me how to take care of my face properly!! Thank you so much guys\n\nBut I have been struggling with a problem recently. I've been living in Korea for 2 years and since then I've tried many new (especially Korean) facial products. In the beginning of 2014, my routine was:\nCleanse: Cetaphil | Toner: Etude House Malgem Smoother | Essence: Innisfree Soybean Energy Essence | Lotion: Cetaphil Lotion | Bb cream: The Face Shop Power Perfection BB Cream. Sometimes the occasional sheet mask or mud mask (usually Innisfree).\n\nThis worked until a certain extent, when I started breaking out some and when I switched products in summer, I started breaking out a lot (using mostly highly fragranced Laneige/Iope products). It worsened dramatically when I started eating a lot of ice cream (anyone knows Korean Bingsoo? I ate that every day in summer...), yoghurt and milk. I have a history of being allergic to milk when I was younger, so cutting that out was the first thing I did. After that, I stopped the usage of any fancy face products, except for an oil cleanser (Body Shop), face cleanser (La Roche Posy Toleriane Dermo Cleanser) and moisturizer (Cetaphil Lotion during the day and Cetaphil Cream during the night), and the occasional usage of BB cream (Hanskin Super Magic BB Cream). \nI should also add that my face is *normal-dry*: mostly normal in summer and dry in winter.\n\nSince then, I have tried introducing many products. I will include a list of products that didn't work for me, including their ingredient lists.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion** (gave me closed comedones and a pimple): *Water, Butylene Glycol,

I'm still looking for a sunscreen that doesn't break me out (I didn't include all) and I just want my face to feel nice. Even though the Cetaphil works, it doesn't make my skin feel the best. I loved the feeling of the Hada Labo, but that didn't work for me in the end. If someone had a certain method of comparing the ingredients in some kind of way, or someone with the same experiences as me, I would love to hear from you!!",

I know it’s a pretty long list but is anyone able to help me figure it out, I’d be so grateful! Thank you. \n",

Or should I not use the butter? I just figured since so many products have it it might be good. \nI also have coconut oil, avocado oil, almond oil, castor oil, olive oil, aloe vera gel, vitamin E, etc. I was thinking of just mixing everything together and seeing what happens lol",

    "body": "Heyyy, first time poster here but longtime lurker!  So...I should have known better...BUT I added multiple products into my routine and now I don't know which one is breaking me out :(\n\nLittle info: I *think* I have combo skin but not totally sure.  My skin is never super dry or super oily.  But very acne prone in my T-zone (and sometimes a little oily) and then sometimes I have dry patches on my cheeks and around my nostrils.\n\nOk, anyway, so these are the products I've recently added:\n\nThe first is **IT Cosmetic's \"Your Skin but Better\" CC cream (SPF 50)**.  I bought this 3 days ago; I have used it 4 times.  I absolutely fell in love with it right away.  Perfect color match, love the coverage, and that it has SPF.\n\n\nHere is the ingredients list:\n\n\n*Water, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Magnesium Sulfate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Laurate, Stearic Acid, Calcium Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium Edta, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Punica Granatum Seed Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Niacinamide, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Cholesterol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Water, Lactobacillus/Honeysuckle Flower/Licorice Root/Morus Alba Root/Pueraria Lobata Root/Schizandra Chinensis Fruit/Scutellaria Baicalensis Root/Sophora Japonica Flower Extract Ferment Filtrate, Perfluorohexane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chrysanthemum Indicum Flower Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Perfluorodecalin, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sprout Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Pentafluoropropane, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Steareth-20, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Colloidal Oatmeal, Hydrolyzed Silk, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Tocopherol, Thiamine Hcl, Riboflavin, Retinyl Palmitate, Pantothenic Acid, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Niacin, Folic Acid, Chrysin, Carnitine Hcl, Biotin, Ascorbic Acid, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Chlorhexidine Digluconate. May Contain: Iron Oxides (Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499).*\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next new product is **Jack Black Epic Moisture MP10 Nourishing Oil**  I've used a sample of this twice now.  2 days ago, I used my DE Babyfacial, which I also recently bought but I've used several samples of this before so I know it's not the culprit.  I do know, however, that the DE Marula Oil that they give you with the babyfacial *does* break me out so I didn't use it after the facial, like they suggest.  Instead, I grabbed the Jack Black sample and I loved it so much! It sunk in right away and just felt so good.  I did this at night then went to bed.  I then used it a second time, yesterday, during the day. BTW, yesterday is the day I noticed my break out.\n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethiconol, Hydrogenated Ethylhexyl Olivate, Jojoba Esters, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Citrillus Ianatus (Watemelon) Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Prunus Insititia Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, Fragrance (Parfum), Ascorbyl Palmitate, Retinyl Palmitate, Schinziophyton Rautanenii (Manketti) Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Citral, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.*\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third product I added is **Marc Jacob's Dew Drops Coconut Gel Highlighter**  I've only used this twice.  I wasn't a big fan.  \n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Water, Mica, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Tromethamine, Parfum/Fragrance, Lecithin, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Dimethiconol, Simethicone, Hexylene Glycol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium Edta, Tocopherol, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Diisostearyl Malate, Butylene Glycol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, Panthenol, Withania Somnifera Root Extract, Silica, Isostearyl Alcohol, Malic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Tin Oxide, Coumarin, Linalool, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Iron Oxides (Ci 77491), Carmine (Ci 75470).*\n\n\n\nSooo, obviously I'm hoping that the MJ Highlighter is the culprit, since it's the most expensive and my least favorite. But, I have a feeling it's one of the first two :(\n\n\nIf you need any additional info, let me know! I'd love to figure out what it is that caused the breakout so I can continue to use the other products that don't break me out.",

FYI when you use Sephora’s filters for ‘silicone-free’ or other, they aren’t very accurate, you really need to search the ingredient list yourself. \n\nFor reference, I have Rosacea skin and closed comodones. I’m trying to get rid of the closed comodones more than trying to improve the Rosacea. \n\nFoundation\n- MILK MAKEUP Blur Liquid Matte Foundation\n\nPrimer:\n- LYS Beauty - Secure Skin Gripping Serum Primer\n-  Milk makeup Hydro grip primer (contains Alcohol Denat, not ideal for sensitive skin)\n  \nBronzer:\n- LYS Beauty No limits matte bronzer (contains fungal acne trigger Magnesium Stearate) \n\nHighlighter:\n- LYS Beauty - Aim High Pressed Highlighter Powder\n  (contains fungal-acne/comedogenic trigger Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate)\n  \nBrow pencil:\n-   MAKEUP BY MARIO - Master Blade Brow Pencil (has no silicones but has vegetable oil)\n  \nBlush:\n- Saie - Dew Blush Liquid Cheek Blush (contains fungal acne trigger Glyceryl Stearate) \n-  NARS Blush (Contains silicone Dimethicone) \n\nSetting powder:\n- Artist Couture - Multi Use Beauty Setting Powder (contains silicone in the form of Phenyl Trimethicone)\n- Saie - Airset Radiant Loose Setting Powder (contains fungal acne trigger Polysorbate 20)\n\nAlso sharing some of the best skincare products I found (not on Sephora) it was so hard to find a sunscreen that fits the criteria but I found three good options.\n\nSunscreens: \n- Purito Comfy Water Sunblock\n- innisfree UV SPF Sunscreen Broad Spectrum\n- Suntegrity Impeccable Skin, Broad Spectrum SPF 30\n\nMoisturizer:\n- COSRX Hydrium Triple Hyaluronic Moisture Ampoule\n- Glass Skin Refining Serum by peach & lilly\n- Glass Skin Water-Gel Moisturizer\n- Madagascar Centella Asiatica 100 Ampoule - Skin 1004\n\nI spent a small fortune to buy almost everything above so I can dump my current makeup. I’ll try to remember to update you guys to let you know if swapping out my makeup had any affect on my skin.",

It feels great on my skin, doesn't dry me out or break me out (I've tried Shiseido's SPF 55, ANESSA, and Biore both the pink and aqua one and they all did that), and most importantly my skin doesn't burn when I use it (I have sun allergies so this is super important to me.) All in all, I love it. \n\n\nHowever, I went to Sephora earlier today to pick up another tube and the SA told me that the ingredients in it aren't good enough and that it was only a physical sunscreen. She then tried pushing me to buy the Peter Thomas Roth powder sunscreen, and I'm pretty sure that using powder sunscreens solely is a no no, but I didn't want to start arguing with her so I just told her I'd think about it and left. xD I was wondering if what she said is right? I tried doing some research on sunscreens but I'm still pretty lost haha.

The amount you would need to use to get the advertised protection is pretty huge, and then with that much powder on your face there is a risk of inhaling it which is a big no no.\n\nAlso the Hadalabo Gokujyun Foaming cleanser is the best thing ever :)",

However, physical sunscreens are not super popular because they mostly leave a white cast and have a more thick formula due to the Titanium Dioxide or Zinc in it.

It's a 'reduxion gel' for preventing acne, and the directions recommend applying the gel twice a day (after cleansing). They're sending out free samples of it to people in return for their feedback on its effectiveness.\n\nI don't understand enough about the ingredients though to make the call on whether I should use it.  Here's the list:\n\n\n\"Besides the active ingredient, Sodium Scymnol Sulphate, here are the other ingredients making up this non-toxic and hypo-allergenic gel:\n\nAqua, Propylene Glycol, Cyclotetrasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Sodium PCA,  Cetearyl Olivate, Glycerin, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Polysorbate 80, Sorbitan Olivate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Serine, Urea, Sorbitol, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Sodium Scymnol Sulfate.\"\n\n\n\nAny advice? I don't have major acne issues, but always seem to have at least one or two pimples at any given time. Pretty noticeable SFs on my nose and chin. My skin is generally on the dry side (especially due to the cold weather here at the moment).\n\nThanks in advance :)\n\n\nEDIT: Thought I should mention I've been trying OCM for the past couple of weeks. Noticed an improvement in the dryness of my skin, but not a real difference as far as breakouts go. Not sure if this gel will negate the moisturising effect of the oil?",

        "body": "A quick search brought up:\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10480321/\n\n\"Abstract\nA series of naturally occurring bile alcohols, bile acids and their conjugates has been investigated as part of our studies to develop unique anticoagulants with a potent prophylactic effect against vascular endothelial cell injury induced by lactic acidosis in vivo and in vitro. In an in vivo rat peripheral arterial occlusion model induced by lactic acid injection, oral administration of a single dose of 3 mg/kg scymnol significantly inhibited edematous swelling and development of lower limb lesions, including gangrene, and reduced changes in clotting system functions and serum lactate dehydrogenase activity. It had no effect on clotting system functions in sham-operated rats. The structure-activity relationship suggests that the [24R-(+)-5beta-cholestane-3alpha,7alpha,24,26-pento l] or [3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholanic acid] structure is important for a potent prophylactic effect following oral administration. Intravenous administration of a single dose of 0.3 mg/kg sodium (25S)-scymnol sulfate or scymnol prevented lesion progression as effectively as oral administration of scymnol. Sodium (25S)-scymnol sulfate and ursodeoxycholic acid showed clear protective effects against cultured vascular endothelial cell damage due to lactic acidosis which were dose-dependent. The above results suggest that bile steroids such as scymnol, sodium (25S)-scymnol sulfate, ursodeoxycholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid may play a role in protecting endothelial cells against injury caused by lactic acidosis. These compounds are candidates for novel anti-ischemic drugs that act by specifically protecting vascular endothelial cells.\"\n\nSo I'm not saying that this study is relevant, but potentially may help you understand what they're attempting with this trial product. \n\n*ischemia is the reduction of blood flow to bodily organs (in this case skin), so anti-ischemic drugs would work to increase blood flow to the organs (your skin).",

I received travel size versions of these from Sephora, and have only used them once (which was an hour ago).\n\n\n**1. Brazilian Bum Bum Cream**\n\n- Texture: Semi-thick. Thicker than a lotion, but thinner than a cream.\n\n- Color: Beige/light tan.\n\n- Smell: Pleasant, but *strong*. Smells a little like cocoa butter and perfume. Made my throat tighten and is currently still giving me a headache. Definitely believe it’s making my cold/allergies worse.\n\n- Effectiveness: I tried a bit on a damp and dry portion of my left arm. Worked similar to the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Body Gel Cream in that it didn’t provide much moisture/hydration, but left a thin film that made skin feel smooth yet dry.\n\n*Note: This product has phenyl trimethicone as its third ingredient, and fragrance as its 6th ingredient.*\n\n**2. Coco Cabana Cream**\n\n- Texture: Gel. Resembles The Body Shop’s body yogurts, but thinner. Similar to a watered-down lotion. Referred to as an “oil-in-water” cream.\n\n- Color: White.\n\n- Smell: Nice, but also very strong. Smells like popcorn. Had the same reaction to this as the bum bum cream.\n\n- Effectiveness: I tried a bit on a damp and dry portion of my right arm. Worked similar to the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Body Gel Cream in that it didn’t provide much moisture/hydration, but left a thin film that made skin feel smooth yet dry.\n\n*Note: Has fragrance as its 8th ingredient.*\n\n**Overall Thoughts**\n\nIn all, I don’t recommend these products unless you’re ok with strong smells. I do believe that my reaction to these creams is because I used both at the same time (on different arms), but seeing as I had such a strong reaction (I rarely have issues with fragrance), I won’t be trying these again. Luckily, I didn’t pay for these, so throwing/giving them away won’t be an issue.",

    "body": "So I'm getting a bunch of mixed answers regarding the initial steps for CGM. I have 3b/3c hair so if anyone can provide some tips that would be great. I've done my research on the Curly Girl Method and I'm interested in starting it. I spent most of today and late last night going through a portion of my products to see if they fit the CGM. My go-to shampoo has amodimethicone and one of my leave-in conditioners has dimethicone and phenyl trimethicone in their ingredients. Sadly, I'm just now finding out that these are in the silicone family and are not CGM-friendly. I would say I'm already doing 80% of what the Curly Girl Method gurus would want. My routine consists of washing my hair with shampoo+a hydrating conditioner that is CGM-approved on Mondays and using As I am Coconut Co-wash on Fridays. Afterwards, I use leave-in conditioners (aside from the one I mentioned above, all my other ones are CGM-approved) and add oil to complete the LOC method. I don't brush my hair aside from using my Denman brush, and that's when my hair is already soaking wet. \n\nWith that said, I wanted to start the CGM on Friday, which is my cowash day. I had read that doing a reset using a clarifying shampoo was essential for starting the CGM. It made sense to me that your hair has had years to build up silicones and wax and needs something to clean them out and start anew. However, when I went to verify this information on a different CGM-supporting website I read the following: \n\n>You have spent years frying your hair, melting silicones into your hair and no final wash is not going to rectify this. Using a shampoo containing sulphates will absolutely remove dirt, build-up and grease from your hair and scalp. After all, it is a cleansing agent. However, it simply cannot ‘reset’ your hair in one wash. If that was the case, why would we need the Curly Girl Method at all? Furthermore, A final wash has never been part of the Curly Girl Method. You won’t find it in Lorraine Massey’s book ‘Curly Girl, The Handbook’ but you may have seen the term in online forums, blogs or Facebook groups. \n\n\nI obviously don't have the Curly Girl Method book, so it's unclear who is right or who is wrong. Is there any way to verify that this reset wash can be skipped? I'd hate to devote 6-8 weeks to cowashing + washing with conditioner only if it means having to restart again because I didn't choose a clarifying shampoo.",

        "body": "Is it very important to you to stick to CGM completely? Many people on here havev had more success with modified routines. One of the most common modifications is to sometimes (or always!) switch out their co-wash for a low-poo (no sulfates, no silicones) or clarifying (sulfates, but no silicones) shampoo. These can help with buildup and scalp health for people whose hair and scalp doesn't thrive with co-washing alone. If they need help from shampoo to prevent build up of the (more often) water-soluble CGM products in their Curly routine, it makes sense that they would want some help from shampoo to get off pre-Curly method silicones.",

The Kinesys Performance Sunscreen SPF 30 has been my go to body sunscreen for a few weeks now. \n\nThis super lightweight sunscreen spray comes in a pump bottle and is specifically developed for active peeps/outdoor activity. Free of alcohol or oils...Kinesys uses a silicone base to provide a product that applies smoothly without verging on greasy.\n\nThere is a bit of slip/glide from the silicone here but I found the spray to absorb really quickly leaving behind a comfortable finish. This is great for those of us that tend to get sweaty or avoid body sunscreen due to the heaviness that is typical with some lotions/sprays.\n\nSeveral of my climbing partners were impressed while on a trip to Moab recently...this is just a really comfortable sunscreen spray that offers decent protection. I plan on coming back to this one again and again but I’d like to give their SPF 50 sunscreen a shot next (so be on the lookout for that review)!\n\nHave you tried Kinesys Sunscreen? If so, let me know your thoughts! \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nActive Avobenzone 2.50%, Octinoxate 7.50%, Octisalate 5.00%, Octocrylene 7.50% \n\nInactive Bisabolol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Diphenylsiloxy Phenyl Trimethicone, Octyl Palmitate, Tocopherols, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer\n\nWhere To Buy (Kinesys Site - $20.99 USD - 120ml): [https://www.kinesysactive.com/collections/sprays/products/spf-30-fragrance-free-spray-sunscreen-120ml](https://www.kinesysactive.com/collections/sprays/products/spf-30-fragrance-free-spray-sunscreen-120ml) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/scy52lutw9v51.jpg?width=3018&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fc1e4faae77b4f9222c192a02210d60ac6bf81a",

        "body": "I was right in the middle of an investigation to find out the culprit who broke me out and had just reached the conclusion that it could actually be butylene glycol. What a coincidence 😊\n\nI went through the ingredient list of every single product that caused me irritation and lo and behold, every single one of them contains butylene glycol among the top ingredients. Certain products would work great for a few months and then one fine day my skin will start getting itchy bumps. In other cases, the irritation will occur right after the first use. This was driving me crazy. Then I found that the products that caused irritation right away contained butylene glycol among the top three ingredients and for the rest, it came towards the bottom of the list. I researched the products that I used to use before I started serious skin care and none of them had butylene glycol. So this has to be the culprit.\n\n Sadly this means finding Asian Beauty products that works for me a hard task since almost all of them contain butylene glycol. Thankfully, my sister is not allergic to BG, so the products won't go to waste. \n\nI have combination skin by the way and I am not using any actives.",

I've heard that gel moisturisers are better suited for people with oily skin and dry to a completely matte finish.\n\nI'm curious about any recommendations for gel moisturisers that won't blow a hole in my budget. \n\nSo far I've found two that look to be not too bad.\n____________________________________________________\nThe first is QV Face Rescue Gel. The ingredients listed: Aqua (water), glycerin, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) water, disodium lauriminodipropionate tocopheryl phosphates, cyclopentasiloxane, paraffinum liquidum, niacinamide, avena sativa (oat) kernel extract, sodium PCA, panthenol, menthol, xanthan gum, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, citric acid, cetearyl alcohol, sodium methylparaben, sodium propylparaben, synthetic fluorphlogopite, tin oxide, ceteth-20, cyclotetrasiloxane, CI 77891 (titanium dioxide). \n\nTo be honest it looks quite basic and I'm afraid it might not be moisturising enough despite the claim that it's \"rescuing\". The niacinamide looks promising. I've never had a moisturiser with that in it and apparently it helps moisturise intensely.\n______________________________________________________\nThe second is Natio Sensitive Skin Calming Moisturising Day Cream Gel. The ingredients listed: Water (Aqua), Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice,Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Trifolium Pratense (Clover) Flower Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Spiraea Ulmaria Flower Extract, Carbomer, Polysorbate-20, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben, Disodium EDTA. \n\nAgain, looks to be quite basic although the addition of aloe vera looks potentially promising (maybe not so much in that dismally small amount)\n_________________________________________\n\n",

My skin is dry, and slightly reactive/sensitive, so I need something that will cleanse thoroughly without stripping my skin.\n\nWhich one would you choose if you were picking between these?\n\n**Kanebo Sensai Ultimate Cleansing Oil ingredients:**  Squalane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isocetyl Myristate, PEG‑20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Octyldodecyl Myristate, Glyceryl Behenate/Eicosadioate, Aqua, Parfum, Glycine Soja Oil, Benzyl Salicylate, Benzyl Benzoate, Limonene, Hydroxycitronellal, Citronellol, Alpha‑Isomethyl Ionone, Tocopherol, Linalool, Daucus Carota Sativa Root Extract, Butylene Glycol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Aminobutyric Acid, Dimethoxy Di‑p‑Cresol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Methylserine, Niacinamide, Oryza Sativa Bran Extract, Glycerin, Pyracantha Fortuneana Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Silk, Prunus Yedoensis Leaf Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Zostera Marina Extract, Cynara Scolymus Leaf Extract, Hydrolyzed Conchiolin Protein.\n\nI use Cle de Eau eye makeup remover and love it, but other skin care products in the line have been hit and miss for me.  I'm also looking at their cleansing oil.\n\n**Cle de Peau Cleansing Oil ingredients:**  ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE･TRIETHYLHEXANOIN･PEG-20 GLYCERYL TRIISOSTEARATE･SORBETH-30 TETRAISOSTEARATE･MINERAL OIL(PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM/HUILE MINERALE)･ISODODECANE･PEG/PPG-36/41 DIMETHYL ETHER･WATER(AQUA/EAU)･GLYCERIN･VITIS VINIFERA (GRAPE) SEED OIL･ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL･BHT･FRAGRANCE (PARFUM)･SCLEROCARYA BIRREA SEED OIL･LIMNANTHES ALBA (MEADOWFOAM) SEED OIL･BUTYLENE GLYCOL･THEANINE･TREHALOSE･PEG/PPG-14/7 DIMETHYL ETHER･GLYCINE･TOCOPHEROL･ANGELICA ACUTILOBA ROOT EXTRACT･HYDROLYZED SILK･HYDROLYZED CONCHIOLIN PROTEIN･PERILLA OCYMOIDES LEAF EXTRACT ･\n\nCarita I used to love and swear by, but they completely reformulated the line and tripled the prices.  I'm not sure I see an improvement in the ingredients, either:\n\n**Carita Youth Cleansing Oil Old formula:**  Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Coco-Caprylade/Caprate, MIPA-Laureth Sulfate, Laureth-3, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, *Prunus amygdalus dulcis* \\[Sweet Almond\\] Oil, *Camellia oleifera* Seed Oil, Laureth-7 Citrate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, **Tocopherol**, *Glycine soja* \\[Soybean\\] Oil, Hexyl Cinnamal, ***Actinidia chinensis*** **\\[Kiwi Fruit\\] Water**, Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Citronellol, Eugenol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Citrate, CI 26100/Red 17\n\n**Carita Youth Cleansing Oil New formula:**  ZEA MAYS GERM OIL / CORN GERM OIL - ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE - ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE - CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE - POLYBUTENE - POLYGLYCERYL-10 DIOLEATE - POLYGLYCERYL-6 DICAPRATE - POLYGLYCERYL-2 OLEATE - PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS OIL / SWEET ALMOND OIL - ISOPROPYL LAUROYL SARCOSINATE - DICAPRYLYL ETHER - DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE - TOCOPHEROL - AQUA / WATER / EAU - GLYCERIN - BENZYL ALCOHOL - GLYCINE SOJA OIL / SOYBEAN OIL - GLYCERYL STEARATE CITRATE - HYDROLYZED PEARL - POTASSIUM SORBATE - SORBIC ACID - MAGNESIUM SULFATE - PARFUM / FRAGRANCE.",

I purchased the 2 face masks, the Priming Moisturizer, and the Soothing Face Mist. I really like all the products and I actually LOVE the Priming Moisturizer and the way it makes my skin feel but I've noticed that when I apply it I notice a strong burning sensation in my eyes like there are strong fumes near them. I don't apply the moisturizer near my eye area, I usually stop application near the top of my cheekbones. It also has no noticeable scent, which is why this is kind of baffling. Neither my skin nor my eyes are sensitive, I don't have any allergies, and I regularly subject them to large amounts of heavy makeup. I've never had a product do this to me before. Here is the full ingredient list from the Glossier website:\n\n\nWater (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate, Stearic Acid, Propanediol, Palmitic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Phenyl Trimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glycerin, Betaine, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Tea) Extract, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Boswellia Serrata Extract, Honey Extract, Tetrapeptide-14, Tropaeolum Majus Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract Retinyl Palmitate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polyacrylamide, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate Phospholipids, Beeswax, Ceteareth-20, Laureth-7, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Cetyl Palmitate, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Butylene Glycol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract\n\nI haven't seen this brand mentioned a ton on this subreddit but has anyone else used this product and either had or not had the same reaction? Does anyone see anything in the ingredient list that could be causing this burning sensation in my eyes? Thank you! ",

    "body": "Last year I used an at-home ash blonde demi-permanent gloss to tone down my faded magenta box dye, and fortunately it worked miracles and my hair to this day, a year later,  my ends blend into my  natural dirty blonde with just the lightest touch of red in the sun. I never bleached my hair, but it was pretty dry with the box dye, and has been much healthier after the gloss treatment (I've been just letting it grow, no heat).\n\nBut I really loved the way the gloss made my hair feel all soft and shiny and healthy. Plus, I like mixing up my hair, I just hate bleach and box dyes. So what do you CG experts think about a clear gloss treatment? I found one at Sally's with these ingredients:\n\nWATER ,CETEARYL ALCOHOL ,PROPYLENE GLYCOL ,CETEARETH-50 ,LAURYL ALCOHOL ,COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE ,LIMNANTHES ALBA (MEADOWFOAM) SEED OIL ,DIMETHICONE PEG-8 MEADOWFOAMATE ,MYRISTYL ALCOHOL ,OLETH-5 PHOSPHATE ,PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL ,DIOLEYL PHOSPHATE ,FRAGRANCE ,SODIUM SULFATE ,SODIUM SULFITE ,PEG-15 COCOPOLYAMINE ,EDTA ,PHENYL TRIMETHICONE ,SILICONE QUATERNIUM-15 ,LAURETH-4 ,ACETIC ACID ,LAURETH-23 ,GLYCERIN ,DIMETHICONE ,GLYCERYL STEARATE ,POLYSORBATE 60 ,TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT) GLUTEN ,CELLULOSE GUM ,SORBITAN LAURATE ,SILICA ,BENZOIC ACID ,ALPHA ISOMETHYL IONONE ,CITRONELLOL ,GERANIOL ,LIMONENE ,LINALOOL\n\nThey all look okay to me except the silicones. I know those build up in shampoo/styling products (and I don't use them in those). Would something demi-permanent like this simulate silicone build-up? Can I continue my sulfate-silicone-free routine after? Has anyone done this? What product did you use? Did your curl pattern survive? ",

I don’t think one time application is enough for a real “build up” problem. Personally I stay away from silicones too, they bring a fake nourishment and shine that can lead to dried out hair on the long run, obviously I prefer a natural real shine that comes from really hydrated hair! but honestly sulfates and other drying ingredients like alcohol is what I avoid the most. I think if you’ll continue to provide your hair with the nourishment they need you’ll be ok. A treatment for aesthetic purposes can help sometimes.\nI’m curious to know the name of the brand you used last year if you don’t mind sharing (I have some white hair to cover and need a little oomph right now!) ;)",
