    "body": "[Shelfie](https://imgur.com/a/oLge8Bq.jpg)\n\nHairType: 1A/1B leaning towards 1A. Fine hair, High Porosity, Waist length. Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml. Max discount 30%.\n\nUsage Timeline: 2 months\n\nConsistency: It's a pink liquid. Normal shampoo consistency\n\nUsage:  I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

The same can't be said for piroctone olamine, but... maybe maybe maybe? 😂 Haircare is half myths and legends, ISTG. Anecdotal evidence seems to be way more of a thing than with skincare. \n\nThe tips are super interesting as well, and your hair looks to be in great condition from this routine! Thanks for sharing. I hope easier times come, and you can peacefully resume your hair oiling ✨️✨️✨️",

You'd want a low pH cleanser; the one I currently use is Cosrx Low pH Cleanser and it works really well to clean my skin without stripping it. Hydrate a lot and really baby your skin for the next 4-5 days. \n\nIt's probably best not to introduce new products until your moisture barrier is repaired because right now it is very vulnerable to irritations and breakouts so you might break out from products that you wouldn't when your barrier is normal. \nIf you have sheet masks, use them! They really help hydrate.\nWhen my moisture barrier was damaged a couple weeks ago, I cleansed, applied an essence, moisturizer and added aquaphor on top to the dry and flaky areas every night and in the morning unless I was going out. My skin was less dry and stingy by the end of the 2nd day. :) good luck!",

    "body": "I'm fairly sure I have seb-derm or something extremely similar, and have been using the Eucerin urea shampoo to deal with this. It not only helps with my scalp, but my hair gets very soft and clean from it. However, after moving to a different state with harder water, it got a little more oily more often, and I ran out of the shampoo. Since I couldn't find it online for a reasonable price, and my hair was getting steadily worse even oily right after the shower, I tried others.\n\nFirst was a hard water shampoo with helped mildly, then Tsal which helped a bit (applied non-optimally), then Flexitol which seemed to make it worse. I then applied Tsal dry to my hair, sectioning it out, applying it twice more in the shower, letting each application sit for 2-3 minutes. This removed the oily feeling, but it takes a LARGE amount, and a few days later my hair felt dry and a bit tangly. So far I've been doing about the same thing but not applying it dry.\n\nMy question is why does the Eucerin Shampoo help so much when others help very little or take so much product to reach the same effectiveness? I've also used the Sebamed shampoo before, but it's also very hard to find now. Is it just the percentage of Urea, and Eucerin has a very high percentage without noting it anywhere on their website? Other ingredients in Flexitol making the urea less effective? Should I just try using the Eucerin Scalp treatment since this is somewhat easy to get? Any other shampoos with urea that may work the same way?\n\nThank you!\n\nEucerin Calming Urea Shampoo: Aqua, Sodium Myreth Sulfate, Urea, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Coco Glucoside, Laureth-9, PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, Glyceryl Oleate, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate\n\nEucerin Calming Urea Scalp Treatment: Aqua, Urea, Methylpropanediol, Sodium Lactate, Laureth-9, Glycyrrhiza Inflata Root Extract, Glycerin, Lactic Acid, Arginine HCL, Hydroxyethylcellulose, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Cetrimonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol\n\nSebamed 5% Urea Calming Shampoo: Aqua, Urea, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Laureth-9, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Parfum, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid, Laureth-2, PEG/PPG-120/10 Trimethylolpropane Trioleate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxypropyl Oxidized Starch PG-Trimonium Chloride, Sodium Citrate, Tetramethyl Acetyloctahydronaphthalenes, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Chloride, Tocopherol, Helianthus annuus seed oil\n\nFlexitol Scalp Relief + Conditioner: Aqua, Sodium C14 -16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamide MEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, (2%) Urea, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Amodimethicone, Acrylates Copolymer, Piroctone Olamine, Allantoin, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-12, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nTsal: 3% Salicylic Acid, Water, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-22, Sodium Citrate, Hexylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid",

    "body": "Hi all. Basically my (very thick, long) hair has been flaky for ages. It is kinda oily, small flakes (I don't think it's dandrufff). I also experience hair loss (could be due to under nutrition). \n\nCurrently I just wash it low poo once a month, and brush it. I don't do much else but I'm happy to wash it more often (if I can find a simple either no poo homemade wash, or low poo shampoo). I don't have much motivation for lots of mechanical cleaning. \n\nAlso - my hair looks kinda lank and mildly greasy most of the time, with dry-ish ends. \n\nI'm in the UK. Should I just wash it more often? I'm considering taking collagen to help with the hair loss, and of course I know that when I eat more it will improve (have not been eating enough this past year). \n\nI just bought Aveeno shampoo (defo SLS free but not sure if it is low poo), would love recommendations for other low / no poo shampoos. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if you can't directly answer me, maybe you have some thoughts on how I could diagnose the actual problem? Like... is it dry scalp, or actually just build up. I think probably a combination. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Shampoo ingredients: Colloidal Oatmeal Extract, Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Seed Extract, PEG-7 Amodimethicone, Polyquaternium-22, Polyquaternium-39, Sodium Hydrolyzed Potato Starch Dodecenylsuccinate, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Laureth-4, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, PPG-2 Hydroxyethyl Cocamide, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Hexylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Benzoate, Formic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Coconut Acid, Disodium Tetrapropenyl Succinate, Sodium Bicarbonate, Parfum/Fragrance)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2fffjxsi5dwb1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e7dd8a1a7a9d1b3785f57bc9704fdc0c6076a75",

        "body": "So... overall I agree with u/shonaich that it's important to focus on your health and not worry as much about finding the perfect hair routine. \n\nThe science is up in the air regarding whether collagen that you eat turns into collagen in your body, or whether it's just broken down by your digestive system into smaller components and then reformed into whatever purposes the body needs it for; for most food it's the latter.  However there are other nutrients in our diet that are critical for hair growth and may cause hair loss if you are deficient in them. Take a look at this science journal article about [nutrition and hair loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315033/).  I think taking a good multivitamin might improve your hair loss and overall health, although depending on why you are undernourished, you might also want to look into Telogen Effluvium and see if that resonates with your situation.  Stress and/or illness can cause TE hair loss a few months after the triggering event.\n\nYour scalp issues also strike me as a possible cause of the hair loss; when the scalp is irritated, it will shed more hair.  The best thing to do is to go to a dermatologist to get it diagnosed and treated.  But I know the healthcare system in the UK is really struggling right now and that might be out of reach for you. With many scalp issues, at least one factor is a fungal overgrowth, because the yeast-like fungus that is part of our skin's microbiome (malassezia) feeds on oil, including our own sebum, and so allowing sebum to accumulate on the scalp instead of shampooing regularly can encourage the population to get out of control and irritate the scalp, cause dandruff, etc.  Using a medicated dandruff shampoo and shampooing more frequently in general to remove the oil from the scalp can help get that under control.  If you want to continue using a low-poo shampoo, you could try Giovanni Tea Tree Oil shampoo, or find another low-poo tea tree oil shampoo.  Tea tree oil is good for fighting dandruff.  You can focus the shampoo on the roots of the hair to prevent the length from drying out from more frequent shampooing if that's a concern.  The r/SebDerm community might be a good resource to help confirm if it's dandruff/Seborrheic Dermatitis, and there's also r/DermatologyQuestions.  [Dermnetnz.org](https://dermnetnz.org/) is another great dermatology resource.\n\nHere's another method that one person discovered through trial and error to resolve their dry scalp issues, however I'll add the caveat that there are numerous scalp conditions that can have similar symptoms; it sounds like this person had a scalp condition that was not diagnosed; yours may be different such that the treatment that worked for them might not work for you.

        "body": "NoPoo is about no silicone at all and LowPoo as well I think. \n\nMay I ask why you wash your hair only once a month? Why just once? Also, what exactly is your goal? Do you want NoPoo or LowPoo? Have you read up on both? It seems you haven’t, due to your questions, but maybe you misunderstood something. NoPoo and LowPoo aren’t about washing as little as possible, though there is an oath in NoPoo that’s called Sebum Only. It’s just needs lots of manual cleaning and that’s not what you want. So my question is, what exactly do you want?",

        "body": "Amodimethicone doesn't build up, but it still coats the hair and can prevent moisture from moving into the shaft. This shampoo is probably fine though, I would imagine a big company like Aveeno would research things that would remove and then redeposit what they put in their products.\n\nIt's far more important for you to focus on becoming a healthy human than fretting about hair care. I'd encourage you to find something easy that works and spend your available energy working on what sounds like serious issues, whether mental or physical. \n\nI highly recommend collagen, especially if you already know that nutrient deficiency is a problem. \n\nMagnesium is usually a big help also, as it's a fundamental resource the body uses in a huge variety of ways. Chelated magnesium glycinate is the most bio-available version.\n\nAshwaganda is an excellent herb that soothes anxiety, calms the body and helps promote healthy sleep.\n\nIf you want to do something that has wide benefits, slow warming scalp massage with your fingertips can help a lot of things. It feels nice, can be soothing, stimulates and warms the scalp, bringing blood flow and nutrients to it, and can be done anywhere you have 5 minutes.",
