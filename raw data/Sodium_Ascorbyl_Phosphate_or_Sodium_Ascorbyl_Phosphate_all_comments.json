I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long üòÇ\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ‚ò∫Ô∏è If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ‚ú®Ô∏èthe search bar‚ú®Ô∏è as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏è First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏è Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\".

Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out üôÉ)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench ‚Äì 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure. Will definitely be purchasing this myself, thank you u/imnumo!)\n\n+ The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane [Edit: may be derived from different sources in different locations, will update if I find out details.

    "body": "#Vitamin C Products: L-AA vs the Derivatives\n\nI feel like lately we‚Äôve been seeing a lot more affordable (and also more expensive!) vitamin C products and options on the market, and there‚Äôs been an increase in questions about which is the right option for you.  Some of the more common options available, and the ones I‚Äôm going to discuss, are the following:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n * L-Ascorbic Acid (L-AA)\n * Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP)\n * Ascorbyl Palmitate (AP)\n * Ascorbyl Tetra-tetraisopalmitoyl (ATIP) *(also known as Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate)*\n * Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (SAP)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nVitamin C is an antioxidant, meaning that it will prevent and remove free radicals from the skin.   This is important, as these cells are damaged, often from pollution, and can age your skin by breaking down skin collagen. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThese vitamin C products have the capability to increase collagen production, help PIH, and treat acne.  It is an active, and while it does provide UV protection by protecting the skin from the above mentioned free radicals, it is important to use it alongside sunscreen.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n\n###L-AA###\n\n\nThis is the preferred version of vitamin C derivatives.  The pros and cons of it have been discussed extensively, especially on this sub.  For in depth information on it, I recommend checking out the [Vitamin C Serum FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2h5n6b/the_more_you_know_vitamin_c_serum_faqs/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nL-AA is *the* best form of vitamin C in terms of collagen production and UV protection.  So why wouldn‚Äôt you just use it?  It has a low pH (of approximately 3.5) that can cause skin irritation for some people.  It can also, in some cases, exacerbate acne. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFurthermore, L-AA is unstable in liquid based solutions.  Some brands have tried to get around the instability by using powder suspended in silicone based solutions.  However, Brandon Truaxe (from DECIEM - the umbrella brand that makes The Ordinary, Hylamide and NIOD among others) has said the following regarding these solutions:\n\n\n> ‚ÄúIn these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.‚Äú\n\n\nThis means that for TO Vitamin C Suspension 23%, your skin is potentially using 2% of the vitamin C.  This is significantly lower than L-AA‚Äôs maximum absorption rates (20%); however, Paula from Paula‚Äôs Choice claims that research has shown that concentrations as low as 0.6% will provide protection against free radicals, and have anti-aging benefits.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe last thing to keep in mind if you choose L-AA - normally these products have wait times (approx. 10-20 mins) and are best used in the mornings.  This will obviously increase your morning routine times.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n\n###MAP###\n\n\nMAP is a water soluble solution similar to L-AA.  Unlike L-AA, however, MAP vitamin C products are stable.  These products will be also effective at significantly lower concentrations than L-AA, and are a better product for those with sensitive skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n10% solutions of MAP are considered to be high.  However, even with these relatively ‚Äúhigh‚Äù concentrations (in comparison to the 10-20% commonly found in L-AA), only about 2-3% vitamin C will come in contact with the skin, as MAP must be effectively converted to L-AA.  Even at the low quantities, studies have found this to be the best derivative for brightening and you only need approximately 5% MAP concentrations to even out skin tones.  Studies have also found that MAP is better than L-AA at penetrating deeper layers of the skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nMAP solutions are not pH dependent, and do not need wait times in your routine.  TO says that their emulsion will absorb in 5-10 seconds.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**If you're interested in the collagen boosting properties of Vitamin C, please keep in mind that this is the only derivative that is proven to be as effective as L-AA.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n\n###AP and ATIP###\n\n\nI‚Äôm going to talk about both AP and ATIP here because they‚Äôre very similar.  Both of these derivatives are fat-soluble.  Because of this, it may penetrate your skin worse than MAP or L-AA depending on the formula.  For these derivatives, it‚Äôs better to choose oil-based solutions (which will penetrate) as opposed to emulsions (which tend to be thicker and more creamy and these will sit on the surface of the skin).  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAP is usually found in low concentrations, but it requires a low pH to perform and has more stability issues than MAP or SAP.  Furthermore, many studies cast doubt on whether AP is capable of improving collagen.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSimilar to AP, ATIP is also found in low concentrations (normally around 3%) and also requires a pH of about 5 to be stable.  ATIP doesn‚Äôt seem to have many benefits in comparison to other derivatives except when it comes to brightening complexions.  It's very mild on your skin, especially since it doesn't have any exfoliation properties. \n For anti aging properties, in comparison to MAP, ATIP is worse at preventing and removing free radicals - even other antioxidants like vitamin E perform better (AP will perform at least as well as vitamin E).  Furthermore, studies have found doubts that this has collagen boosting capabilities.  ATIP is also a relatively new product; there's been very few and conflicting studies into this. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n\n###SAP###\n\n\nIt is more difficult to find studies and documentation on SAP in comparison to the other derivatives of vitamin C.  Similar to MAP, SAP is water soluble and stable at a pH of 7 making it a decent option for sensitive skin.  SAP will also convert to ascorbic acid on your skin, unlike other derivatives such as AP (I could not find any data saying AP converts) and will have very low concentrations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSAP will stimulate collagen production, but it will not perform as well as L-AA or MAP.  It also will prevent the free radicals, but again less than MAP or L-AA. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nEDIT:  Sorry everyone apparently my reading comprehension is poor at 2am.  SAP is very beneficial for acne and can effectively be used  with anti-acne products like salicylic acid as outlined by both u/psithyrstes [here](http://wisderm.com/ingredients/Sodium+Ascorbyl+Phosphate#32-acne-vulgaris-treatment) and u/miclitis.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n###References###\n\n\n1. ‚ÄúAntioxidants and Free radicals‚Äù.

The skincare subs get so many questions about this and admittedly, it's very confusing. \n\nI have a couple of things to add.\n\nOne is about SAP and acne. I'm not sure how to align this with the Paula's Choice claims, but everything I've read about SAP personally indicates it is *good* for acne.\n [Here's a review](http://wisderm.com/ingredients/Sodium+Ascorbyl+Phosphate#32-acne-vulgaris-treatment). Of course it doesn't have a huge amount of research behind it in general, but that still may be good to take into account for people who want an acne-friendly vit c and want to chance the fact it may cause acne in some people. \n\nThe second thing is about L-AA and I actually can't remember where the source is from. I've heard that L-AA \"tops off\" and that you really only need to apply it once every other day to get benefits, because your skin can't really absorb more than that. Can anyone remember where this idea comes from?",

Having tried a couple of L-AA serums (OST C20, Skinceuticals), I felt that the irritation (and the Skinceuticals irritated much less than the OST) negated the positive effects. I was getting more dehydration and overexfoliation and I couldn't use them often enough to see a benefit. I know multiple people who have accidentally overexfoliated with L-AA; it's important to treat it as an acid product, not a regular serum.\n\nOn the other hand, I've tried a few SAP serums and, when they're well-formulated, I find them to work far better for me and my dehydrated skin. A strong SAP serum (Aromatica's vitamin C serum, which is 50% SAP and an undisclosed amount of ATIP) cleared up my pregnancy acne within a month. And I've gone through a couple bottles of Dermapeutics Vital C (which I found at TJMaxx for $7 a bottle) and it helped boost the translucency of my skin and kept breakouts at bay far better than L-AA serums did. Also, no drying my skin out with wait times before and after, and no stability issues. It's a win-win for me.\n\nedit: typo",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¬π. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.¬≤\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¬π n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"¬≤ Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease¬≥. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.‚Å¥  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp‚Åµ.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea‚Å∂.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¬π, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¬π.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.‚Å∑ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA‚Äôs approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¬π¬π \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¬π¬≤ It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¬π¬≥ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR‚Å∏, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.‚Åπ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¬π‚Å∞ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "When I heard about this new product line the other day, I decided to look at all the products and their formulations via SkinCarisma to see whether anything looked worth trying. A few products seemed promising, while others seemed... not so much. I thought since I'd already done all the work, I'd share my findings here!\n\nIn order approximately from most to least promising:\n\nBlemish Control Spot Treatment, 5.5% Benzoyl Peroxide\n\n- **fungal acne safe!**\n- 5.5% is a higher concentration that necessary but shouldn't be too irritating\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both near end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (at end of ingred. list)\n- some nice **moisturizing** ingredients, including a good amount of squalane\n\nVitamin C Moisturizer\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 8th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (14th ingred.)\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane, lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- small amounts of cassia and green tea\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- advertises inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is last ingredient\n\nDark Spot Solution Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: polysorbate 20 (8th ingred.)\n- **niacinimide** is 2nd ingredient! brightening and anti-aging properties\n- advertises its inclusion of plankton extract but is 24th ingredient (also not much evidence that plankton extract does anything for skin besides moisturizing)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract  (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (last ingred.), citric acid (15th ingred.)\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- possible **allergen**: benzoyl alcohol\n- contains a lot of **silicones**\n\nRetinol Vitamin A Refining Moisturizer\n\n- amount of retinol isn't specified, but is placed 25th on ingredient list (you only need small amounts, 0.01% or more, to be effective, but need 0.5% or more for dramatic effects)\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.), polysorbate 20 (24th), cetyl palmitate (26th) \n- **retinol** has anti-acne, brightening, and anti-aging properties\n- other **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.), ceramide 3 (27th ingred.)\n- tons of aloe juice, good amount of squalane\n- small amounts of green tea and cassia\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- specifically advertises its inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is 26th (second last) on ingred. list\n\nOil-Free SPF 50 Moisturizing Sunscreen\n\n- broad spectrum\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl stearate (2nd ingredient), isopropyl palmitate (7th), PEG-100 stearate (8th)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.)\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: isopropyl palmitate (7th ingred.)\n- pretty small tube, only 50 mL\n\nFerulic Acid + Vitamins C and E Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for its vit C so is not a dupe for SkinCeuticals, but should still be effective\n- amounts of main ingredients not specified, however, vit C is the 5th ingredient, ferulic is 10th, vit E is 18th (second to last)\n- **brightening** ingredients: SAP\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E, citric acid, ferulic acid\n- citric acid (8th ingredient) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingredient)\n\nBio-Complex Moisturizer for Dry Skin\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- claim to have a \"high level\" of hyaluronic acid, and contains 2 kinds, but they're only 21st and 22nd on ingredient list\n- also super unclear on what their \"bio-moist complex\" is but if it comprises 20% of the product it must just be like, aloe and water and glycerin\n- but yeah, tons of aloe and glycerin, good amount of squalane, some other **moisturizing** ingredients, moderate amount of green tea extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (14th ingred.), vitamin E (23rd)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n\nVitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 5th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (13th ingred.), citric acid (10th)\n- contains **denatured alcohol** (3rd ingred.)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingred.)\n- HA is in the name and yet it's the last ingredient\n\nCharcoal Balancing Mask\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: PEG-100 stearate (9th ingred.), stearic acid (10th), glyceryl stearate (12th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- not sure how much charcoal is needed to be effective, but there may be a deceptively small amount in this, as it's the 16th ingredient and the product contains as much or more iron oxide as a colouring agent. also it lists \"charcoal powder\" and NOT \"activated charcoal powder\" so it may just be all-around useless.\n- advertises its use of hyaluronic acid yet it's the last ingredient \n- main mask component is **kaolin** clay (3rd ingred.)\n- 2 kinds of vitamin E (17th and 24th ingredients)\n- lots of aloe and some glycerin but not many other soothing or moisturizing ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: stearic acid (10th ingred.)\n\nHydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: contains polysorbate 80\n- claims to have 5 types of HA but I only counted 3: sodium hyaluronate, hydrolized HA, sodium acetylated hyaluronate (and they're all 18th or later in the ingredient list)\n- contains a TON of **silicone**, which seems like a poor choice to me, as HA should generally be applied earlier on in your routine and all that silicone will interfere with absorption of subsequent layers\n- no other notable or helpful ingredients, just a few **moisturizing** things like glycerin\n- more of a gel texture than a serum\n\nTriple-Peptide Eye Cream\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: stearic acid (3rd ingred.), glycol distearate (4th), shea butter (5th), ethylhexyl palmitate (8th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- peptides are last ingredient\n- contains ascorbic acid (vitamin C) but is 18th ingredient and what little benefit that amount gives will deteriorate due to air exposure from jar packaging\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane and caffeine\n- small amounts of green tea and green algae extract\n- 5 potential **comedogens** but this likely won't matter for the eye region\n- if you look up this product on Amazon to examine yourself, note that the copyable list of ingredients in the Important Information section is actually the ingredient list for the Retinol Moisturizer, so use the ingredients listed in the product images\n\nHydrating Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.), pomegranate seed oil (14th), coconut oil (15th), olive fruit oil (16th), argan oil (17th), jojoba oil (18th), babassu seed oil (20th), moringa seed oil (21st), crambe seed oil (23rd)\n- 2 potential **comedogens**: coconut oil (15th ingred.), avocado oil (19th)\n- in addition to above listed plant oils, also contains chia seed oil, the only non-problematic one lol\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin E (12th)\n- citric acid and benzoic acid (6th ingred.) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- **surfectants** used: decyl glucoside and glyceryl oleate\n\nOil-Free Micellar Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.)\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin E (12th)\n- citric acid and benzoic acid (6th ingred.) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- micellar agents (**surfectants**) are decyl glucoside and glycerl oleate\n\nBlemish Control Oil-Free Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- advertises 2% **salicylic acid**, but unsure of the pH\n- **denatured alcohol** is the first ingredient!\n- contains grapefruit extract (3rd ingred.) - some sources say this is a great ingredient for skin, others say it's bad - I personally avoid it like I do all citrus-derived ingredients\n- contains **fragrance** (5th ingred.)\n- contains **sulfate**: sodium xylenesulfonate (13th ingred.)\n \nHope this is helpful! Let me know if I missed or got anything wrong!\n\nEdit: formatting\nEdit 2: butchered the spelling of \"comedogen\" all ten times I used it",

In the US, ingredients in concentrations of 1% or lower can be listed in whatever order the manufacturer wants to use. You can sometimes tell where that <1% begins if the product contains phenoxyethanol, because that's approved for use in concentrations of up to 1% -- meaning things *after* that are either at 1% or under.\n\n(Also, 1% HA isn't unusual, nor is it necessarily ineffective; it's normally used at/in concentrations of 0.2-2%. TO often uses 2% because of their unofficial \"more is **always** better\" philosophy [looking at you, 10% niacinamide serum], but <2% can be beneficial, too!)\n\nThat said, you'd think there'd be little reason for Amazon to list a \"banner\" ingredient at the very end when/if they have the option to list it earlier/higher.",

    "body": "This isn't the post I wanted to write, but it's what I've got so far. I hope this helps with the current wave of acne questions. \n\nNote: I do not include prescription treatments. I do mention retinoids, but Differin is OTC now.\n\n***\n\n**Antibacterial:** aka kills acne bacteria.\n\n+ Benzoyl Peroxide is the biggie. Kills the bacteria, it won't ever become resistant to BP, reduces inflammation, keeps dead skin cells from building up, and can enter pores. *Usage Suggestion:* 2.5% has been shown to work pretty much as well as stronger formulations and works great in short-contact therapy. So, to make BP as gentle as it'll get: apply 2.5% for a few minutes or so and wash off. Yay!\n\n+ Azelaic Acid is surprisingly cool too. 15% has been shown [equally effective](http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/16281587) as BP, and might have [similar results](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11701404) to 0.05% isotretinoin (both studies linked used AA + antibiotic fyi).\n\n+ Other Great Stuff: Sulphur, neem oil, tea tree oil, salicylic acid, and blue light therapy. \n\n**& Antimicrobial** in case you wanna prevent that kind of colonization. Benzoyl peroxide and maybe tea tree oil will help you.\n\n\n**& Antifungal.** Avoid those nasties with neem oil. And probably stuff I'm forgetting. Edit: zinc pyrithione, thank you /u/mastiii!\n\n\n**& Antiseptic:** Wanna reduce the possibility of infection?\n\n+ Neem oil and tea tree oil as above, plus perilla and karanja oil. Be warned, I'm getting most of that info from Garden of Wisdom and not peer-reviewed science.\n\n+ Zinc. An [underrated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120804/) little baby. Zinc sulfate that can prevent acne at 5%. There's a not-very-readable list of products [here](http://cosdna.com/eng/stuff_prod.php?in1=62d146399) but I believe you need to log in first.\n\n\n**Anti-inflammatory** stuff to prevent pores from getting *extra* clogged and icky.\n\n+ Salicylic acid, azelaic acid, neem, tea tree and perilla oil, zinc - we went other these already.\n\n+ Retinoids! Differin is the only one available OTC, but it's less irritating than tretinoin. It works extra well with the addiction of antibacterial agents.\n\n+ Niacinamide is something you should be taking a good, long, hard look at. It's [been](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23786503) [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7657446) to be as effective as 0.1% clindamyacin (prescription antibacterial). It also suppresses [sebum production](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14764170600717704?journalCode=ijcl20) at only two percent and promotes wound healing. Plus a [ton more stuff](https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Review+of+the+Range+of+Effects+of+Niacinamide+in+Human+Skin&oq=A+Review+of+the+Range+of+Effects+of+Niacinamide+in+Human+Skin&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64l3.279j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).\n\n\n\n**Bacteriostatic:** salicylic acid, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide. These prevent bacteria from reproducing so rapidly.\n\n\n**Comedolytic:** benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids. What it sounds like, prevents comodos from forming.\n\n\n**Keratolytic** stuff prevents dead cell build-up and softens keratin (good for dry skin).\n\n+ Urea has been written about [far better](https://simpleskincarescience.com/urea-for-skin/) than I ever could. The tl;dr is it's hydrating, exfoliating, and helps your skin [be better](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3352965/). It also makes people really, really pretty.\n\n+ Sulphur has keratolytic benefits, antibacterial ones, and antiseptic ones. It works for acne (I have a figure of 2% but no idea from where...) as well as psoriasis and eczema.\n\n+ Plus the good ol' standards, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and retinoids.\nsulphur\n\n\n**Sebostatic** is a really cool category. These good 'uns help regulate and/or reduce sebum production. They include: benzoyl peroxide, niacinamide, retinoids, and zinc. Surprise, surprise. \n\n**Other Stuff I Haven't Sorted:**\n\n+ Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (SAP), a vitamin c derivative, helps acne. I didn't write [this post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/sodium-ascorbyl-phosphate/) either.\n\n+ The sebum of people with acne has been shown to have higher than usual levels of oleic acid, which is kind of goopier. Using oils high in linoleic acid (rosehip, borage, evening primrose, and a tooon more) might help to sort of dilute sebum into a freer-flowing substance. \n\n***\n\n**Super TL;DR**\n\n- Antibacterial: neem oil, tea tree oil, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulphur, azelaic acid, blue light therapy\n\n- & Antimicrobial: tea tree oil possibly, benzoyl peroxide\n\n- & Antifungal: neem oil, zinc pyrithione\n\n- & Antiseptic: neem oil, tea tree oil, perilla oil, karanja oil, zinc\n\n- Anti-inflammatory: neem oil, tea tree oil, niacinamide, adapalene/retinoids, salicylic acid, azelaic acid, perilla oil, zinc\n\n- Bacteriostatic: salicylic acid, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide\n\n- Comedolytic: benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids\n\n- Keratolytic: benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulphur, retinoids, urea\n\n- Sebostatic: benzoyl peroxide, niacinamide, retinoids, zinc",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¬π. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.¬≤\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¬π n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"¬≤ Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease¬≥. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.‚Å¥  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp‚Åµ.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea‚Å∂.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¬π, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¬π.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.‚Å∑ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA‚Äôs approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¬π¬π \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¬π¬≤ It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¬π¬≥ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR‚Å∏, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.‚Åπ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¬π‚Å∞ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

I am quoting all the studies I could find, and listing all the benefits as well.\n\nTopical use of Vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid/Ascorbic Acid) has been proven to:\n\n1. *Help with the biosynthesis of collagen. -* Anti - Ageing benefit.\n2. *Help in the repair of damaged skin/ skin wounds with anti-inflammatory properties -* Restore skin health.\n3. *Increase the proliferation rate of fibroblasts. -* Anti - Ageing benefit.\n4. *Provide greater photoprotection against UV induced photoaging, immunosuppression, and even skin cancer. -* Anti - Ageing benefit, - Anti - skin cancer.\n5. *Inhibit the action of tyrosinase in melanocytes thus helps to make skin even-toned.-* Helps with pigmentation.\n6. *Restore structural and functional losses in the skin architecture associated with ageing.* - Anti - Ageing benefit.\n7. *Help to strengthen the lipid barrier (possibly, proven in vitro)*. - Restore skin health.\n\n***There have been A LOT of studies on topical vitamin C.*** *I have extracted and link a few I found relevant that support it benefits at THE END of this post.*\n\n***There is enough evidence to believe that topically applied L-ascorbic acid is beneficial.***\n\n*While most people treat Vitamin C like an acid, it's mechanism isn't exactly similar to AHA's. L-ascorbic acid is a form of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) that is recognisable as vitamin C in the skin.* ***Topical use adds to the existing concentration of Vitamin C in the skin.***\n\n*Thus, once it penetrates into the skin, it* ***cannot be washed off/neutralised***. However, some actives applied together/at the same time can change its performance/form.\n\n*L-ascorbic acid is a hydrophilic charged molecule so it doesn't easily penetrate our lipid (hydrophobic) barrier. For optimal penetration of the epidermal barrier, aqueous formulations of ascorbic acid must be at a pH which is below the pKa (4.2) of ascorbic acid itself. Thus, L-ascorbic acid must be formulated below the PH of AT LEAST 4 for it to penetrate in our skin.*\n\n*Although ideally around* ***3-3.5 increased penetration*** *without excessively compromising the skin barrier.*\n\n*The prime concentration depends on the formulation and associated delivery method. It is a general agreement that concentration needs to be more than 8% to be bio-available and effective. According to* [*this study*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227542100_Topical_L-Ascorbic_Acid_Percutaneous_Absorption_Studies)*, varying concentrations from 5% to 30% were applied to pig skin(similar integumentary system approach).*\n\n*It was observed that vitamin C concentration was maximum at 20% and anything above 20% surprisingly caused depletion in tissue concentration levels.* ***Thus anything below 8% and above 20% is usually seen to be sparse or superfluous.***\n\n*There are many stability issues with L-ascorbic acid solutions. An L-ascorbic acid solution is highly unstable and is prove to oxidation to dehydroascorbic acid(DHAA) and degradation to 2,3-diketogulonate in high temperature, light, heat, high ph, presence of oxygen and catalytic amounts of metal ions. This makes the solution progressively* ***turn*** *in colour* *from clear to* ***yellow, to deeper shades of orange as it continues to degrade.***\n\n* ***Now the question comes: is dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) bad for our skin?***\n\n***The answer is No and Yes.***\n\nAscorbic acid or ascorbate in its ionised form is called L-ascorbic acid. Our skin recognises L-ascorbic as ascorbic acid. Our body (and skin) also contains an oxidised form of ascorbic acid which is Dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA). A high amount of vitamin C found in normal skin is in the form of dehydroascorbic Acid. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225274699_Topical_Dehydroascorbic_Acid_Oxidized_Vitamin_C_Permeates_Stratum_Corneum_More_Rapidly_Than_Ascorbic_Acid) study shows that DHAA penetrated faster than L-ascorbic acid even. DHAA may not necessarily be bad and can be converted back to ascorbic acid in the presence of glutathione & thiol-containing reducing agents such as cysteine, homocysteine, 2-mercaptoethanol, and DTT, already present in our body. However, in the presence of water DHAA may be irreversibly hydrolysed to 2,3-diketogulonate and further degrade to Erythrulose. Erythrulose is a chemical used in fake tanning.\n\nBut **‚ÄúAap Chronology Samajhiye**‚Äù with this representation -\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ipk7xxd87ar51.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=b353acd40e51fbe1a80e72d94f3e4e2a8c771cd7\n\nL-AA is first oxidised to DHAA (which can be reversed in our skin). Oxidation means a reaction with the free form of oxygen molecules. Remember we learnt this in the last post. So oxidation can happen if L-AA is exposed to UV/oxygen in the environment at high temperature. However, DHAA can be reversed to AA in our skin because the presence of network antioxidants like glutathione that's already present in your skin. Check out [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/figure/nutrients-09-00866-f004/) diagram to understand how that works. However, when DHAA comes in contact with water it hydrolyses to 2,3-diketogulonate. Which cannot be turned back into AA due to the 5 hydrogen ring rupture. L-AA will not directly convert to 2,3-diketogulonate. It has to first oxidize then hydrolyse.2,3-diketogulonate may be further converted to other byproducts by other processes.\n\n[Lab muffin](https://labmuffin.com/vitamin-c-can-stain-skin-avoid/) made a post on this.\n\nIt is possible that DHAA may not convert to Erythrulose in our skin.\n\n***In conclusion, there is a lot of ambiguity around oxidised L-ascorbic acid and further processed byproducts.***\n\n***No studies have evaluated the benefits and side effects of these oxidised and degraded compounds.***\n\n***Although, the presence of antioxidants like ferulic acid, glutathione, vitamin e, etc. has been shown to increase the stability and efficiency of L-ascorbic acid serums. These are called network antioxidants because of this reason. Again check out the diagram linked above to understand more.***\n\nTo improve stability, the delivery mechanism also plays an important role. The right delivery mechanism can help prevent oxidation and conversion to other forms. Novel delivery mechanisms may also improve penetration along with stability. New delivery mechanisms to deliver L-AA without oxidizing are bein developed. [This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687614/) advocates using liposomal technology patented by Sesdema to deliver sodium ascorbate deeper into the skin. Many skincare companies are developing new anhydrous bases to disperse L-AA to prevent oxidation. Here is [another study](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dd22/feb6b83ba354a50547c05552e70908f24460.pdf) of a new delivery mechanism.\n\n***However, an independent comparative study comparing different forms and delivery mechanisms of topical ascorbic acid has not been conducted.***\n\n*So in conclusion:*\n\n* *For L-ascorbic acid formulations in an aqueous:*\n   * *Must be formulated to be below PH 3.5 or below.*\n   * *Must be formulated using oxygen-impermeable packaging and stored at low temperature.*\n   * *Must be at a concentration above 5-8% and below 20%.*\n   * *Addition of other antioxidants can help improve the stability of the formulation.*\n   * *Must be stored in a dark/light-proof packaging at a stable temperature of  25 celsius or below.*\n   * *Must be used up quickly once exposed to air/light.*\n   * *Addition of penetration enhancers may help improve results.*\n* *For L-Ascorbic acid in a Non-aqueous solution:*\n   * *Must be formulated using oxygen-impermeable packaging and stored at low temperature.*\n   * *Addition of other antioxidants can help improve the stability of the formulation.*\n   * *Must be stored in a dark/light-proof packaging.*\n   * *Performance varies with the efficiency of delivery mechanisms.*\n\n***Owing to these stability, penetration and delivery issues with L-Ascorbic acid formulas, new derivatives of Ascorbic acid were developed.***\n\nNow my field of experience is not even remotely linked to bio-chemistry so I am not going to go in detail about the biochemical pathways that are hypothesised for their efficiency. I will, however, try to compare popular derivates and their performance/properties in brief based on information available on the internet.\n\n[A comparative analysis of various Vitamin C Derivatives](https://preview.redd.it/e99su3ae7ar51.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=14189617e8871c7968728ad2b907b4a0f7ff99b3)\n\n*Let's be honest picking one among the sea of options is intimidating. It comes down to personal preference and availability.*\n\nWhile choosing though there are certain things you should keep in mind. Only L-ascorbic acid has been studied for over 40 years now and has consistently proven to be advantageous topically.\n\nDue to its highly unstable nature,\n\n* *It is best to keep all your water-based L-AA carefully protected*. \n* *Ideally, they should be stored in a place with a stable temperature (in the fridge) and away from light. The smaller the quantity size the better.*\n* *Once oxygen touches the formula it starts to become unstable and turn yellow, making it very important to screw the lid tightly. The more product you use; the more the leftover product oxidises.* *Some people recommend transferring them in smaller bottles. I, apart, found that it gets tiresome to clear, sanitize bottles and dry old bottles ever. Any remains of LAA will oxidize and adding fresh batch in oxidised bottled can spoil the new batch.*\n\n***Using waterbased L-AA requires some commitment and care.*** *I love the effects though. Personally, I will walk the mile for those benefits.*\n\n***Anhydrous variants are another great option.*** *There are some limitations with anhydrous versions as well though*\\*\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\* ***Since AA is acidic and gritty in itself, these formulas can sting and sensitize your skin.*** *Many people break out while using high-concentration L-AA for the first time.  Its highly acidic nature can compromise the skin barrier. It's best to start with a lower concentration and gradually make your skin acquainted with L-AA. This can also be achieved by using L-AA a few times a week at the start and adding barrier-healing skincare products to your regime.*\n\n*Most people experience a slight stinging when they use L-AA-based products. There is a difference between stinging and burning although.* ***If your skin feels like it's burning, it's best to step back, stop use and choose a diluted version/low-concentration formula.***\n\n* ***The question comes: How to differentiate between stinging and burning?***\n\n*Stinging is a sharp, short-term, tingling sensation associated with low ph. It can last anywhere from a few seconds to a minute. Skin doesn't itch, turn red or feel sensitive to touch post that duration. This sensation may be experienced every time you apply L-AA but the intensity may reduce over the period.*\n\n*Burning is a strong irritation that feels different from tingling. It is a strong discomfort which may be coupled with redness, itching and touch sensitivity. It feels like your skin is on fire. Please immediately wash your face with water to wipe off any remains of the product. Apply some soothing, gentle products containing restorative ingredients like aloe, snail mucin, ceramides etc.*\n\n*It is best to patch test L-AA based products before applying it all over the face to understanding the way it reacts with your skin. Our mod* u/avaale *has made an amazingly detailed guide about* [patch testing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/iyxdqe/guide_how_to_patch_test/) *Please check it out to understand more about patch testing.*\n\nIn conclusion, L-AA may not be the best option for everyone due to its stability and skin sensitizing issues. If that is the case, you can still get some benefits by incorporating vitamin c derivatives. There is a catch though. ***Not all derivates are equal and not enough comparative studies have been conducted to conclude which one is the most superior form.***\n\n*However, by understanding the nature of the ingredient coupled with the anecdotal evidence we can understand a few things:*\n\n* Some derivates are lipophilic/ amphiphilic so they dissolve better in lipid formulations. These formulations may include oils, butter and silicones.\n* While each formulation differs from another due to the ***choice of base ingredients***. Some base lipids may be balanced to reduce the likeliness of comedogenicity and therefore may be less likely to cause breakouts in acne-prone skin type. Others may not suit your skin type.\n* *The* ***concentration*** *of active ingredient plays equally an important role.*\n* ***Pick a formula that works with your skin type, condition and goal.***\n   * Concentrations at which **Ascorbyl palmitate ( AA-PAL)** is used are extremely low. While vitamin C has shown some effects at concentrations as low as 1% but at the benefits of that concentration aren't hugely significant. When using derivatives in those concentrations, keep in mind that the derivative needs to convert to Vitamin C in your skin and some strength may be lost in the conversion. Coupling that with its stability issues, Ascorbyl palmitate doesn't catch my interest.\n   * **Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (SAP)** & **Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP)** are more stable than AA-PAL but face the same roadblocks when it comes to formulating restrictions on concentration. Poor penetration and unreliable conversion don't benefit their case point. However, if acne is a pre-existing condition that you are dealing with, SAP may be an option to consider since there are some studies that support its anti-acne benefits. MAP is generally considered a better option in the industry than SAP from the overall vitamin C benefit perspective.\n   * **Ascorbyl Glucoside** is a better option than the ones I discussed above. It is stable at a variety of pH. Thus, it can comfortably be used by with sensitive skin. It can be incorporated in a liquid water/serum-based or formulated in a cream/gel base. It has been proven to convert into vitamin C in the skin and has been proven to have some anti-ageing benefits. However, potency is still questionable due to concentration restrictions. If you prefer easy of use and elegant- textured cosmetic products, this derivative may be considered.\n   * **Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate** is a newer derivative. It has not been independently researched much. There is this one study in a formula that also contained AA, which advocates it's benefits. In general, this derivative is unique due to its chemical structure and properties. Manufacturer claims suggest that it seeps in deeper into the skin than L-AA and stays in the skin 40-80% longer than L-AA. ( I am not sure if I can link/upload manufacturer documents I found through some sources and digging so if you are curious, watch out for my Instagram stories). Overall this ingredient is popular in Japan for its whitening properties and its lipid solubility puts it in an advantageous position to penetrate through the stratum corneum into the epidermis and the dermis. There is some anecdotal evidence that supports the claim that it may be one of the best derivatives out there. I also found some very expensive luxury skincare brands using this ingredient (will be sharing those insights on Instagram as well; May make a separate post if I am not being lazy).\n   * Last, but not least is **3-O-Ethyl Ascorbate.** It is one of the newest kid in the lot. Experts think it's structurally the closest to AA. It is an Ethylated form of AA so it's both water and lipid-soluble.   Stability tests have shown it's a very stable derivative at a PH of 5. Thus, the shelf life of EAC formulated products should be longer than others. Manufacturers and cosmetic companies claim that it provides similar benefits of L-AA is not better, without the stability issues. None of these claims has been verified although. It has shown to provide some de-pigmenting and antioxidant benefits by manufacturers in vitro trials. It can be formulated using high concentrations thus, it's another derivative to watch out for.\n\n**So, which one is perfect for you?  YOU decide that.**\n\nThis chart may help you come to some conclusion:\n\n[A graphical representation to make your decision easier.](https://preview.redd.it/3vmyn9yh7ar51.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bb6b780c72938114bf4e5d219cc2624e197d54c)\n\n***Another important detail:*** Almost all vitamin C formulations stay in your skin for up to 72 hours. Metals like iron and copper are known to destabilize and cause unwanted biochemical reactions with AA. *Thus is it best not to use copper peptide formulation with vitamin C to maximize their benefit.* By not using Copper peptide, I mean not just applying them together at the same time but also not using them in the same duration. So if you wish to use copper peptide you can rotate by using it for the first 3 months of the year and next three months using vitamin C and so on.\n\n***Some Extracts with Links to Clinical Studies/Research Journals I found relevant that support the benefit of topical application of L-AA:***\n\n23.8% L-ascorbic acid and a chemical penetration enhancer consisting of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and dimethyl isosorbide with iontophoresis to maximize amounts of L‚Äì ascorbic acid delivered were applied once daily, in a split-face study on twenty females (Fitzpatrick type III & IV to study the effect of Vitamin C on photoaged skin.

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as¬†caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as¬†green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "**This was an Adderall fueled post. I‚Äôm about to nerd out big-time here. Scroll down for TL;DR!**\n\n\n**First, why do I care about vitamin c?**\nI recently decided to add a vitamin C serum to my skincare routine because of all the great effects I‚Äôve read about.  Really, it seems as skincare ingredients go, vitamin C is amazeballs, and I‚Äôm not talking anectodtal ‚ÄúOMG it made my skin feel so much better‚Äù shit, I‚Äôm talking legit scientific research showing several skin benefits. It‚Äôs a fucking fabulous antioxidant,  it is photoprotective against UVA and UVB stress, it is an *essential ingredient* for collagen synthesis AND upregulates (causes) collagen synthesis, and it is effective at preventing and lightening dark spots through inhibiting the enzyme Tyrosinase, which is *the* rate limiting enzyme for melanine production^1,2 . AND, do you like Vitamin E? Because Vitamin C regenerates oxidized vitamin E molecules so your body can use them all over again^3 !\n\n\nWe‚Äôve known the much of the details of the dermatic glories of Vitamin C for over fifteen years. Clearly, we all want lots of vitamin C. Some of this can be provided in our diets, but gastric absorption of vitamin C is downregulated by the levels of vitamin C already in your body, which means most of that supplement you have been taking just gets peed out (but I‚Äôm sure the fish appreciate it). So, in order to elevate the levels of vitamin C in our skin, it needs to be applied topically. Problem is, Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a tricky motherfucker. It‚Äôs SO effective *because* it‚Äôs so reactive as an antioxidant, which means it‚Äôs got major stability issues. It oxidizes REAL quick in solution, and this oxidation rate increases along with temperature, air, and light exposure. My guess is this is why vitamin C only recently surged in popularity as an ingredient in skincare products; manufacturers are certainly getting better at formulating (for instance, adding Ferulic acid to stabilize vitamins C and E^4 ), manufacturing and packaging products in a way that maintains their effective shelf life. The problem is, not every manufacturer is actually going to spend the time and money to ensure quality, and many companies may just ride the Vitamin C bandwagon without considering these things or caring if it is actually effective in their product. \n\n\n**Why am I concerned about pH?**\nProblem number two with vitamin C products is their pH. We‚Äôve heard time and time again that it is important for the pH of skincare products to remain low to ensure efficacy. A quick Google Scholar search brought up an article on the effects of pH on Vitamin C absorption in particular^5 .  The researchers showed that in a solution of a pH 4 or above there was no detectable increase in skin vitamin C levels (it wasn‚Äôt absorbed), while [vitamin C levels are elevated at a pH of 3.5 and increase as pH lowers](http://i.imgur.com/seqMDmj.png). This same study also showed that the [best concentration for maximum vitamin C levels is 20%](https://i.imgur.com/LIgBvzl.png) (for some reason there is a decrease in vitamin C at higher percentages) and that even though it is the least stable, [L-ascorbic acid is the best ascorbic acid derivative to use](https://i.imgur.com/jYgAcZg.png).\n\n\n**Choosing a Vitamin C Product**\nGiven all of this fantastic information, I am convinced that pH is a critical factor for an effective vitamin C product. Unfortunately, as a poor graduate student, my choices in skin care products are financially limited. Given that I have science, I decided to also try making my own. I purchased some vitamin C L-ascorbic acid crystals from the Vitamin shoppe and ground them into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. I then used a digital scale to measure out the powder and, using deionized water and glycerol, made a 20% weight by volume solution of L-ascorbic acid serum.  I actually really like how it turned out. I used this first and saw visible improvement in the redness of my skin after a week or two. \n\n\nStill, I wanted to try something ‚Äúreal.‚Äù Much as I‚Äôd love to, I can‚Äôt usually spring for the expensive, already researched and well reviewed products, and so I searched Amazon for a cheap alternative. I settled on [ArtNaturals Enhanced Vitamin C Serum](http://www.amazon.com/ArtNaturals-Enhanced-Vitamin-Serum-Hyaluronic/dp/B012Q4M3DO/ref=sr_1_5_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1461786401&sr=1-5&keywords=vitamin+C+serum) because it was under $15, claimed to contain 20% Vitamin C, and had many positive reviews (4 out of 5 stars from over 9000 reviews). \n\n\nThe first problem I noticed with this serum was in the ingredients list ‚Äì it does not contain the L-ascorbic acid form of vitamin C, but instead what is reportedly an aqueously more stable, while less studied form called Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate. I didn‚Äôt sweat this too much, because it wasn‚Äôt tested in the earlier study^5 I mentioned, and a more recent paper reported good absorption levels^6 .  I wasn‚Äôt impressed. It wasn‚Äôt bad, but it didn‚Äôt seem any better than the serum I made. It was actually a bit sticky, comparatively, and my skin didn‚Äôt tingle like it does with my DIY serum. I decided to test the pH of both serums, and WOAH. \n\n\n**Testing the pH ‚Äì RESULTS!**\nFirst, let me show you how the [pH test strips I used work using vinegar and water as examples/controls](http://i.imgur.com/Aqfxg6L.jpg). The strips are wetted in the solution for 1-2 minutes then compared to the swatch which shows pHs from 0-14 at 0.5 intervals. There are 8 dyes that are affected, and the closest swatch match is used. This example shows, from left to right, vinegar, vegetable glycerin (glycerol), bottled purified water (Dasani), and city tap water. As expected, vinegar was the most acidic, but it fell in at around 1.5-2. That‚Äôs actually more acidic than you‚Äôd expect from white vinegar  (~2.5 pH). Glycerol and bottled water checked in around 6.0 again, a bit lower than expected, and my tap water was ~7.0. I didn‚Äôt have any buffer to check these strips with (I‚Äôll test them tomorrow in my lab), but it looks like might be showing acidity a little low. If so, it looks like it might need about a +1 correction term, but because pH is a logarithmic scale I can‚Äôt be sure. Anyway, we can at least move forward and see our pHs relative to vinegar and water!\n\nNext, I tested my homemade 20% L-ascorbic acid serum. It is about 3-4 weeks old, and is stored in a dark glass dropper bottle (an old Korres serum bottle). I was shocked to see it falling in at a [pH of 1.5, right where the vinegar was.]( http://i.imgur.com/wE9uEC3.jpg) If it IS 1.5, that is stupidly acidic, not to mention virtually impossible to achieve. L-Ascorbic Acid is a diprotic acid with pKas of 4.17 for the first proton dissociation, and 11.57 for the second. This means, given the maximum saturation concentration in water of 33%, I‚Äôd only get a pH of 1.87, which would look closer to 2. Visually, its similar to the vinegar, so my guess is it‚Äôs a pH of 2.5. I‚Äôm actually pretty happy with that. I‚Äôd almost call it *too* acidic, but my skin is responding well to it, so I‚Äôm content. \n\nNow for the shit I bought off of amazon! Are you prepared to be impressed! [Well, sorry to disappoint you, but this shit was basic.](http://i.imgur.com/B7DhUNm.jpg). Okay, not *very* basic, but around or above neutral. Visually, I‚Äôd call it 7.5-8. Even if my strips are showing things as a bit lower in pH, it‚Äôs more basic than the water I used as a control, and not anywhere CLOSE to the necessary effective pH of <3.5. This stuff is absolute shit. \n\nI will concede that this isn‚Äôt the *same type* of vitamin C used to determine pH/absorption profiles. However, the skin has a pH of around 5 and generally a lower pH is considered necessary to maintain effectiveness and to be absorbed into the skin, as shown in studies for other nutrients^7 . I'm probably going to keep making my own serum. I may actually buffer it up to a pH of 3 with some sodium hydroxide once I measure it with a calibrated pH probe in my lab (tomorrow). \n\nMy curiosity also lead me to test a few of other products that I use regularly. \n\n*Alpha Hydrox 12% AHA Souffl√© (glycolic acid): pH 4.0-4.5\n\n*CeraVe Renewing Salasylic Acid Cleanser: pH 4.5\n\n*Retin-A Micro 0.08% Pump: pH 4.5\n\n*Dermapeutics Kyaluronic Lift Serum: pH4.0-4.5\n\n\nI hope you found this somewhat interesting. I certainly did, which is why I just spent 2 hours testing and writing about it! It‚Äôs probably not a bad idea for everyone to test their products for pH ‚Äì test strips are relatively cheap, and it‚Äôs easy to do at home and important information to have!\n\n\nSOURCES CITED:\n\n1.

    "body": "Hello! I just wanted to share my love for panthenol! It has really helped heal my moisture barrier (too much acids!). Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%.

I remember being always kinda blown away by how lightweight it was yet packed a massive punch at calming and rebuilding my skin barrier from tretinoin and overexfoliation. And guess what it works on giant cystic acne that TO's bha being completely useless at treating. From what I know it's not available outside of Apac region, which is a travesty because good skincare should be had by all. \n\nBut I'm in Malaysia and Hada Labo is practically everywhere. So the only products I have repurchased so far are rhe super economical ones like Hada Labo's premium hydrating lotion (gold bottle), rich hydrating lotion (the one with 3 molecular weights of ha), premium whitening lotion (tranexamic acid), inkey list niacinamide serum, Q10 serum, bha serum, and their bha cleanser.\n\nYes, fragrance free advocate here.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here‚Äôs a looong review post of many of the products I‚Äôve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I‚Äôm a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don‚Äôt wear makeup on a daily ‚Äì or even weekly ‚Äì basis. I‚Äôve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I‚Äôm in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I‚Äôm average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I‚Äôve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently‚Ä¶ boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it‚Äôs fine. This is many people‚Äôs holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It‚Äôs affordable, nice pump, doesn‚Äôt try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don‚Äôt love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It‚Äôs standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn‚Äôt remove all makeup, it‚Äôs as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don‚Äôt leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that‚Äôs fine, so I don‚Äôt know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it‚Äôs important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they‚Äôre pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it‚Äôs a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that‚Äôs about it. It doesn‚Äôt contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula‚Äôs Choice wouldn‚Äôt have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don‚Äôt think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It‚Äôs an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don‚Äôt have the data. I hope it is, though. I‚Äôm also worried that it‚Äôll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It‚Äôs one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time‚Ä¶ And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN‚Äôs products, so beware. Just because it says it‚Äôs natural fragrance, doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt mess with your skin. The word ‚Äúnatural‚Äù isn‚Äôt even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we‚Äôve found we‚Äôre all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It‚Äôs a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn‚Äôt use it during the daytime. I‚Äôm not currently using it, because I‚Äôm trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn‚Äôt really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don‚Äôt know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol‚Äô retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn‚Äôt released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it‚Äôs even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don‚Äôt know. I think I‚Äôll wait a while longer to see if there‚Äôs any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn‚Äôt really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it‚Äôs a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn‚Äôt contain any preservatives. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin‚Äô. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You‚Äôve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you‚Äôre from Northern Europe. Anyway, it‚Äôs a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it‚Äôs great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don‚Äôt want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It‚Äôs called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you‚Äôre allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you‚Äôre allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It‚Äôs my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I‚Äôm too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It‚Äôs gel-like, but it doesn‚Äôt melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn‚Äôt seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn‚Äôt sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don‚Äôt buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn‚Äôt all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it‚Äôs called a night mask, it‚Äôs a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this‚Ä¶ right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don‚Äôt know. My skin is normal, so I don‚Äôt really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I‚Äôd appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I‚Äôve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn‚Äôt contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don‚Äôt really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention‚Ä¶ It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it‚Äôs bad for your skin. Anyway, it‚Äôs an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because‚Ä¶ I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I‚Äôll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it‚Äôs 10% glycolic acid it‚Äôs still very gentle, and that‚Äôs probably because it‚Äôs in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven‚Äôt used it recently because I‚Äôm using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn‚Äôt ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I‚Äôm quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don‚Äôt need one, I‚Äôm just so extra. It‚Äôs a HG product for me, because it‚Äôs the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it‚Äôs great if you have sturdy skin, and you‚Äôre lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won‚Äôt oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of‚Ä¶ dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it‚Äôs not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you‚Äôre looking for a vitamin c product. It‚Äôs perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won‚Äôt cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn‚Äôt make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Av√®ne Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: ‚Ä¶why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there‚Äôs that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven‚Äôt seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven‚Äôt been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don‚Äôt particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I‚Äôll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so‚Ä¶\n\n**NAME:** Av√®ne Ysth√©al intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as ‚ÄúAv√®ne RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream‚Äù, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don‚Äôt know what retinaldehyde is, well, it‚Äôs one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol √† retinaldehyde √† retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Av√®ne‚Äôs lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don‚Äôt have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I‚Äôm only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I‚Äôve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you‚Äôre 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn‚Äôt seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They‚Äôve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you‚Äôre pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8‚Äôs retinaldehyde products, plus it was Av√®ne that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I‚Äôll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "I've tried quite a few ab vitamin c stuff. I use it to mostly improve overall brightness, fade hyperpigmentation and their antioxidant benefits. Here are some of the ones I tried most recently.\n\n- Melano cc: \n\nA good place to start, took me a month or so to see some fading, but none of it has dissapeared. Did feel some warm tingling the first few times but nothing major. Vitamin c in here is ascorbic acid and ascorbic palmiate which are both not that stable. \n\nThis serum has a light, slightly oilly texture that gave my dry skin a nice glow too. I used it morning and night until it eventually oxidised 7 months after I bought it. But honestly thats fine cause this isn't that expensive and I noticed more results when I used this generously. \n\nAlso might be my bad though cause I took this travelling a lot and didn't refrigerate it. I've heard their packaging is good though since it limits the contact the serum has with air and sunlight. Its pretty hard to squeeze it out of the tube. \n\nHas a citrus smell so it has fragrance. It dosen't irritate or break me out at all. This also has vitamin e which I heard boosts the effects of the vit c.\n\n- Innisfree brightening pore serum: \n\nDelivered the fastest results. The only caveat with this is that the ingredients contain drying alcohol and fragrance pretty high up. My skin does react to those sometimes but was completely fine with this serum. In just 1-2 weeks it literally lightened my entire face. \n\nThis vit c is in the form of ethyl ascorbic acid which is very stable. The brand also mentions that the hallabong extract here is a good source of vitamin c. \n\nI was using it morning and night at first. The texture is like a light hydrating water type serum. More pleasant to layer other products on it. Theres an artificial orange scent but its honestly pretty pleasant and not too strong and dissapears after a while. I decreased use to night time and eventually stopped since I got a good 2 shades lighter. \n\nThis one also contains arbutin, niacinamide, HA and other nice ingredients. I still use the sleeping mask from this line every few days that is less scary whitening and more just brightening. Really noticed no differnce with my pores with this line but pretty good at moisturizing.\n\n- Ti'am my signature red c serum: \n\nCurrently testing this 20% ascorbic acid. Its unstable and reviews generally say this oxidises quickly. Its been in my fridge for a while and no oxidisation for me. \n\nIts honestly not going that great right now. Just straight up using the serum from the bottle breaks me out. Surprisingly no tingling or warm sensation, although my face will look more red the next day. The only way to prevent it from breaking me out is to mix it with moisturizer, but then I don't notice any brightening with that method. I've tried mixing it with other lighter serums too but it always breaks me out the next day. \n\nThis also contains alcohol and essential oils, so my skin could either be reacting to that or the concentration of vit c is too high. Contains other nice ingredients like glutathione, niacinamide, beta-glucan. \n\nThe texture is like a thicker serum with very sticky finish and it always smells like barbeque chips in a bad way. The worst texture and scent in this list. I think we'll have to breakup soon, I don't see this working out.\n\n- Somebymi yuja niacin 30 days blemish care serum: \n\nThe star ingredients are 5% niacinamide and 82% yuja extract but still contains vit c in the form of sodium ascorbyl phosphate, which is reportedly stable since this comes in a transparent yellow bottle. \n\nThe most pleasant one in terms of texture and scent. Really smelled like yuzu (a type of lemon) and had the lightest watery texture that dosen't leave any residue after I rub it in, just a slight touch of hydration. I layer other hydrating essences/serums with this since its hydration is not enough for my dry skin. This contains essential oils but my skin dosen't react to it though. \n\nThis serum brightened my skin overall but I noticed almost no fading, although I still liked the effect it gave me. Just like the name I really liked this for the first 30 days or so, but then it stopped working halfway through the bottle. Like I noticed no more of that brightening effect.\n\nContains other fun ingredients like licorice extract, green tea extract, arbutin and many more. Really would like it if it just didn't stop working. Also marketed for wrinkle care but I can't say how effective that is. I also found out through their youtube that the vit c concentration in this is low enough to use with chemical exfoliants which can be good for people who want to mix actives, but not so much if you want that vitamin c to really shine.\n\nFinal:\n\nOut of all of these I'd probably repurchase melano again since I mostly miss it as a light hydrating oil. The others probably aren't for me. So far vitamin c is good for overall brightening but it dosen't significantly improve hyperpigmentation for me.\n\nFor fast results I'd go for the innisfree but then again this will probably only work if you got tanned or sunburned since it lightens everyting. It also has a blend of different brightening ingredients, so it might not just be because of vit c.\n\nYuja niacin is pretty good for a daily morning serum if you don't have much hyperpigmentation. I really like the light texture when I want to layer more stuff. Then again its really not a \"miracle\" product. Next I might try the klairs serum, but its not a priority.

    "body": "**I hate buying sunscreen.** Outside of a few gel-like sunscreens which I can never find for a reasonable cost, most just disappoint me. I feel like I often have to choose between having the complexion of a sad day, or looking **so** greasy.\n\nMy skin ranges from light-medium to medium-dark. To visualize: I'm Doja Cat when it's cold out and Kerry Washington once I can get some sun - strong golden tones. I tan fast, with or without SPF (though I am very pro-SPF), and have burned exactly once in my entire lifetime. I'm still not interested in putting myself at risk for skin cancer.\n\nI'm not going to claim that this sunscreen will not leave a white cast on people with deeper and darker skin-tones than my own, though I truly hope it works for you. So... here's my review!\n\n**Banana Boat: Light as Air, 50+ SPF UVA/UVB Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Lotion**\n\n* **Price**: $5.99 on sale at Kroger, regularly $10.99 here.\n* **Size**: 6 oz. ($0.99/oz. on sale, regularly $1.83/oz.)\n* **Scented**? Yes, it's pretty noticeable at first but fades (not completely). I'm VERY sensitive to scents (I can't wear perfumes, they trigger migraines), but it's not the usual *Eau de Banana Boat* I expected.\n* **White cast?** None on my skin tone. Absolutely none. It's decently liquid-y for the SPF, and if you apply it more liberally, it can be rubbed in and absorbs fairly quickly.\n* **Greasy**? NOPE. It's not one of those slick sunscreens. Alcohol is the fifth sunscreen, and I'm no scientist, but I suspect this may contribute to it.\n* **Pilling**? None. I tried applying more and more to dare it to pill, it didn't! Usually, sunscreen will build up and 'highlight' my hair follicles/stubble (I have hairy arms and can't be bothered to shave regularly) - didn't happen!\n* **Ingredients**: Water, Diisopropyl Adipate, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Tapioca Starch, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Coco-Glucoside, Chlorphenesin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice.\n\nI read a lot of reviews on here and think \"Yeah, can't relate!\" since a lot of sunscreens with 50+ SPF have white casts, and many AB sunscreens are either intentionally white cast-y or, worse, pink-tinted, which are both a no for me. \n\nI hope this block of text helps another medium-skinned beaut who has been walking around intermittently looking like a tombstone and/or bacon grease. Feel free to ask any questions, I haven't seen much about this sunscreen before, and I've been trying it out for a while now :).",

I myself am white but obviously not enough because the white cast looks horrible, especially if I haven't shaved. And the tinted sunscreens are great, but then their too dark and it can make for some uncomfortable looks out in public. Plus, they cost more per ounce and require more care in application. But then most chemical sunscreens aren't as safe for sensitive, acne prone skin like myself. Several of the supposedly sensitive ones I saw today at Target still had oxybenzone and other irritating ingredients. But this one didn't. So yeah-thanks for the heads up. I'm hopeful about it now!",

    "body": "***Please share this with anyone in need***\n\nOkay so, a long time ago I discovered a guide that was created to help lonely men with dating issues. \nI was so inspired by it, so transformed...I feel like I need to share things from it so that other's can benefit as I have.\n\nNow listen, this guide will mostly help you if you are about average looking. If you are obese/deformed, then this guide may not help much. If you live in a town of 500 people, it may not help much. If you have toxic views of women, you shouldn't even be reading this guide. \n\nEven below average men can have success if they follow this guide pretty closely. \n\n***Here we go:***\n\nMy entire life I was a loser (age 29 now). Skinny. Pathetic. Shy. I wasn't attractive at all. I was blissfully unaware of how bad I looked, but in my mind I was a normal guy. \n(Fast forward to today, gorgeous women stare at me in public).\nAfter reading the guide that I did, I became obsessed with attraction/dating.\nThere is so much I'm going to try to cover, hopefully this helps at least one lonely man out there.\n\n\n***---->Step 1):*** Do EVERYTHING you can to look as attractive as possible. Some men will say \"I just haven't met the right girl\" or \"it'll happen someday, I'll find someone\".\nGuess what? IT....WILL.......NOT! \nYou will remain single forever unless you actually put in effort. Women won't just show up one day and ask you out. (Very rare, even for hot men).\n\nSo we've identified what to work on, now how do you accomplish this? Many ways.\n\n->(Skip over this step if you absolutely will not lift)<-\n\n***-Lift weights):***\n\n This step is so underappreciated. Guy's will read this and say \"Oh here we go! You gotta be a jock, I knew there was a catch\".\nIt's really not as bad as it sounds. Just go to the gym and lift weights 3+ times a week or so for an hour at a time. Now, if you do this....educate yourself on how to properly exercise.\n\n Exercise shouldn't be random or whatever you think you need. You need to work each muscle group individually and with varying techniques. Good diet is also key.\nYou need to go to Youtube and watch videos from the channel 'Athlean-X'. Guy named Jeff is a beast and a very competent instructor. He teaches NFL players how to get big and strong.\n\nWhen I began lifting, I started lifting milk jugs full of water in place of dumbbells. Simply did pushups for chest. Basic stuff that any guy can do.\nSo if you are intimidated about going to the gym as a non-muscular man, then I suggest you build base muscle at home first.\nYou will eventually need to go to the gym or buy your own equipment as I have. \nYou will see good results in 3 months, after 1 year you will be a completely different person. I've been lifting weights for 2.5 years....I am now a Greek statue in physical appearance. Women love lean buff guys.\n\n***-Skin care):***\n\nIt's just sad how many men don't care about their faces....some of you guys are covered in pimples. Some guys have blotchy faces with large open pores. Ghoulish dark circles under your eyes....I'm talking to you.\nYou only get one face, treat it like gold. It is what women look at when they talk to you. If your face isn't right, dating will be tougher.\n\nSolution?\n\n Listen to me, skin care products actually work. Those products that women spend tons of money on actually work. The types of products I'm going to recommend are all scientifically backed, I wouldn't suggest products that \"may work/may help\". These products produce visible results, and they physically change your skin on a molecular level. My face has been transformed after like 3 days of using these products. Pure complexion. Tighter skin. Invisible pores. Reduction in fine lines. Noticeably brighter face. (Bonus: if you quit consuming processed sugar then your face will be even further enhanced. Sugar damages the collagen in your face, there is actually a term called \"sugar face\").\nDon't be a sugar face.\n\n-Bonus): Look into chemical peels if you have significant skin issues on your face.\nTCA peels might be a good fit for you.\nOnly allow board certified dermatologists to do this to you.\n\n***-Antioxidant serums):*** \n\n They do all kinds of stuff, like brightening your face and protecting your collagen from damage. (Collagen is absurdly important for appearance, protect what you have at all costs).\nThese serums typically contain various kinds of antioxidants such as Vitamin C and Vitamin E.  Hyaluronic acid is another common ingredient. My personal recommendation is a vitamin C serum. I won't suggest specific products because this isn't a sales pitch. This is just solid advice. If you have sensitive skin, look for vitamin C derivatives such as sodium ascorbyl phosphate. L-ascorbic acid is pure vitamin C, it's the strongest but too harsh for sensitive types. \n\n***-AHA's/BHA's):***\n\nThese are facial acids. They chemically exfoliate your skin and do all sorts of wonderful things for your face. Most people use the BHA called Salicylic acid, but that's far too harsh for sensitive skin types. Try Mandelic acid instead, which is an AHA. Other options exist as well.\n\n***-Moisturizer):***\n\nWent my whole life thinking this was just lotion....it's not. After you clean your face and apply your serums or acids, you'll want to moisturize. There is an order to these things, don't just slop on products at random.\n\n~This is the order~\n\nA): Clean your face with a cleanser that your skin can tolerate. A very gentle soap can also work.\nB): Allow 10-15 mins for your face to get super dry.\nC): Apply Acid OR antioxidant serum, not at the same time. Alternate days for safety.\nD): Moisturizer is always the last step after everything else dries.\nDon't overdo things, especially the face acids. Follow instructions on all of these beauty product bottles.\n\nSome face acids/serums need to sit on your skin for 30 mins to really absorb and function best. After 30 mins, apply moisturizer.\n\n***-Sunblock):***\n\n The sun is your enemy. It makes you look old. I won't go on a 15 min walk without sunblock. (These beauty products can cause sensitivity to UV, increasing the importance of sunblock). \n\n\n\n***-Clothing):***\n\n Dress in clean clothes that fit you very well. No loose clothing. No random clothes. Your clothing should make sense. \nColors should match or compliment each other. Buy cool shoes or manly leather boots. Wear stuff like dark wash jeans, not light wash.\nTight shirts for when/if you get muscular.\nAccessories help, just 1 or two though. (Hat, watch, etc). \nYou may need to research this yourself as style is subjective. Google trendy clothes for inspiration. Dress to present masculinity.\n\n\n***-Hair):***\n\nIf you are balding really bad, just shave it. It looks bad if you can't grow a full head of hair. I shaved myself bald and have never gotten more attention from girls.\nHair style and length make a difference too, work on this. Copy someone else with hair you like.\n\nSo that's a lot of it when it comes to looks. It's all about getting as hot as possible. Takes time.\n\nNow on to...\n\n***---->Step 2): Dating profiles:***\n\nThis is the good stuff, the things that most men struggle with on dating apps.\n\nBefore I begin let me just say, I get it....you want to sleep with girls. You probably think about it nonstop. There is no instant gratification here, most women WON'T sleep with a total stranger. You gotta go on dates, develop those social skills first.\n Once you've spent enough time with a woman she will naturally grow closer to you and be more open to such things.\nRelationship first, intimacy later guys.\nWomen (almost always) want \"baby steps\", if you rush things you will fail. Take things slow and don't push if she isn't being receptive.\n\nOkay, now then:\n\n***90%*** of your dating profile is based on your ***PICTURES***. Too many guys think that what your bio says matters most, but that's ridiculous. Bio's matter, but not as much as looking great in pics.\n\n***The thing that sets you apart from successful men is something called juxtaposition. It's when you have images side by side, and each one is STRIKINGLY different than all of the others.\nWhen a woman is looking at your profile and sees 4 pictures of you sitting in your bedroom, she is gonna swipe left buddy.\n\nYou need VARIETY. You need juxtaposition.\n\nHow?\n\nYou need 6 high quality pics. Really solid, great pics.\n5 is a bare minimum, shoot for 6 though. You don't need to pay a photographer. You just gotta get inventive and be able to get those pics. You of course could pay a photographer.\nI own a $400 digital camera and know some decent photography skills. I spent 2 months taking 1000's of photos. I deleted all of them except for the required 6. That's how hard it can be to take amazing pics, but it's 100% worth it. You can use those pics across multiple dating websites. (Don't use multiple dating sites simultaneously, just don't. Quit one after you've been through all of the profiles, then start on a new dating app).\nYou'll get dates if you can pull all of this off. \n\n\n***Let's break it down further:***\n\nThe first pic a woman see's on your profile should be your highest rated pic. Your hottest pic.\n\nYou need (2) pictures where you look sexy. This is undoubtedly the hardest thing to pull off in pics.\nDress manly, don't smile at the camera. You will have other pics where you are smiling. Sexy men aren't smiling in pics. (At least, not an obvious/dopey smile...a mild smirk can be okay).\nLook at the comments below, someone asked me what to do for sexy pics and I explained it clearly.\n\nYou need at least (1) funny picture. It's okay to smile in these. You need (2) funny pictures if you naturally look very masculine/androgynous.\nWarning: Don't look like a total clown. Funny pic doesn't mean make the pic as outrageous as possible. Should be tasteful and legitimately funny.\nGood example, I have a funny pic of myself holding a banana phone. Simplistic but it is an incredible photo that makes me look funny + attractive.\n\nYou will need (1) plain pic, of your blank face looking at the camera. Don't look awkward, just neutral. No dopey smile. Mostly focused on face and upper torso/shoulders. You can tilt your head at a very slight angle. She wants to know what you look like naturally, without alteration. No special effects.\nDon't appear as intense/crazy.\n\nYou will need at least (1) outdoorsy pic. Something physical or sporty maybe. Hiking, kayaking, etc...\nIf you can't pull that off, just be outside near something cool. Women want to know you leave the house.\n\nYou should also have (1-2) 'edgy' pics. \n(1) if you look masculine.\n(2) if you are small and timid looking.\nEdgy is kinda confusing. It's like being a \"bad boy\", but not lame. It's generally darker styles/colors of clothes. \nLots of guys take edgy pics, and then use a black & white filter on them. It creates a dark/mysterious vibe. Google image search 'edgy guys' or 'edgy clothes' for inspiration.\n\n***-Photography Tips):***\n\n***-Best tip ever, use NATURAL lighting. Period.***\n      Don't you dare let light bulbs be your light source.\n\n-FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ARE VITAL, you could end up with an amazing shot...but it's ruined because you have a bad expression. Smiley in fun pics, guilty/edgy in sexy pics.\n\n-Utitlize basic editing for all pics (not photoshop).\n-Shoot from many different angles.\n-Do not shoot in direct sunlight. Use indirect light. (stand in the shade on sunny days, or near an open window when indoors. Don't let direct sunlight come through the window and touch your face, adjust the blinds so that it's just a really bright room).\n-Backgrounds are really important.\n-If it looks posed/lame, delete it.\n-You don't need pics of friends to date.\n\n\n\nYour pictures need to look CANDID. NATURAL. NOT FAKE. With the exception of your blank faced pic/funny pics, your pics shouldn't look posed. \nA picture of your face at one angle can look dramatically different from another angle.....photography is tricky. You need to take many photos at different angles, different light levels, different backgrounds. \nIf I took a random selfie right now, I would look terrible. Good candid photos are in fact actually planned. When you look at a photo that seems like it \"just kinda happened\", you can bet they took that photo 50+ times. \n\n**Another user pointed this out, It's worth repeating:\n-No bathroom selfies, -No pics involving anyone's kids, -No pics of women at all, -No shirtless pics unless you have crazy low body fat/lean, -No sunglasses ideally.\n\nTake your best pics and run them through a safe website called 'photofeeler'. It's a way to get women to rate your pics, this way you know for sure if that 'awesome pic' you just took is actually awesome....or incredibly creepy. Your best pics should ideally be getting ratings of 7/10 out of 40+ women voters.\nThese ratings are more for your unique/cool pics. Women probably won't rate your plain photo as a 7+ unless you are really hot.\n\n***-Bio):***\n\nYour bio/self summary on dating websites is important but not that important.\nWhat you write can definitely kill all of your potential matches.\nIt shouldn't be super crazy long, but it's better to be longer than too short.\nMention hobbies, stuff you're into, values, etc.\n\nWomen want to get to know you IN PERSON. Don't list your flaws in the bio, put your best foot forward. It's not lying if you simply don't mention stuff. I don't condone lying, I'm not suggesting anyone lies. Be honest, but don't write stuff in your profile like....\n\n\"Hi I'm Kevin, I'm an introvert. I like to go on walks and play videos games. 420 friendly. I'm just looking for a nice girl to go out with, I'm a real nice guy.\"\n\nSee what I mean? Don't act/be like Kevin.\n\n***-Tip)***: Being nice isn't special. Most men are nice on dates. Being nice doesn't make you stand out.\nYou should be nice to women, but don't call yourself nice. It's especially important that you never say \"I'm a nice guy\" in person or online.\n\n***-Cool Tip)***: When sending messages to women on any dating app, match her texting style. If she uses proper grammar & punctuation, do the same.\nIf she is sloppy with punctuation, don't you go using proper punctuation....you will look nerdy in a bad way.\n\nDo not \"get to know women online first\".\nDON'T....DO....IT.\nChat with them, get their phone numbers within 5 messages roughly. You shouldn't be sending long messages. Women are on dating apps to give out their phone number, it's not unusual to ask for it. \nInitiate in a funny/clever way, then steer the conversation towards getting her number. \nDiscuss meeting for a coffee or lunch date soon. If she's not chatting anymore then move on, she's not into you. \n\nDating apps are programmed to punish you if they notice patterns. Don't swipe right on every profile. Only swipe right if you know for sure you are physically attracted to them.\nDon't send out too many messages per day, you can be punished this way too.\n\n***-Crucial, Obvious Tip):***  Bathe before a date, smell good.\n\n***-Pro tip):*** Your very first date should just be a casual meetup for 30mins-45mins. Let her know it's a no-pressure date at a cafe for half an hour. This will likely relax her, now she knows you won't be too forward or pushy on the date. It really should be a cafe because it's casual and if you guys don't have chemistry then it's not a big deal. You will feel lame if you take a girl out to fine dining on the 1st date and it doesn't work out. Once it's been 30-45mins, say \"oh look at the time, that went fast. I really should get going, I gotta go do (blank). I had a good time talking to you and I'd like to see you again.\"\n\nDo not try to kiss her goodbye.... save that for the end of the second date. A brief hug is okay (if she seems comfortable). You may want to wait a few days before you contact her again to set up a second date. (Unless she begins texting you, then you should call her up & set up the next date in a day or two).\n\nThis should help lots of guys get much closer to having a girlfriend.\n\n*Keep in mind, failure is inevitable. Say what?!?!\nMost people are not very good when they start something new, including entering the dating scene.\nYou will lose some women during this process, it's almost bound to happen. You will get better though if you keep going on dates.\n\nGive yourself permission to suck at life....\nIt's okay :)\n\n***Warning:*** This guide has been taken down before for reasons unbeknownst to me. Copy it, save it.\nI may post this guide again at times to benefit more men.",

However if you prepped your skin properly/don't have dehydrated skin you probably won't have the an issue.  (i.e was super lazy and didn't put moisturizer underneath)\n\n3) Dries down in 5 min or less to what I could consider a pretty transfer proof finish to the touch. \n\n4) No Scent\n\nHowever, what I don't like is how greasy this sunscreen is on my face (IRL looks greasier than the picture too). To be fair, most sunscreens are greasy for me because I'm oily, and Liah does mention in her intro video for this that this may not be the best sunscreen for oily skin. I'm a bit bummed because I was hoping I could finally find a sunscreen with no shine... But I'm not surprised either. \n\nWith that said, with a matte powder on top (just using a basic Neutrogena matte powder here) it looks like a really nice skin I'm-not-wearing-anything finish. Which I like, as I don't wear any other makeup. Just don't except to skip the powder step if you are normal/oily to oily. \n\nIt also sliiiiiightly irritates my eyes, but it's not that noticeable and it wouldn't bother me majorly on a day to day basis (for reference I have only found 1 other chemical sunscreen among many to irritate my eyes, but that was a much more severe reaction). Interestingly enough a YouTuber who reviewed this said it really irritated her eyes (Genevieve Fields if you want to look it up) so YMMV.\n\nThis does remind me of the Make Prem Blue Ray Defense Me Gel which is also SPF 50+ PA++++ , 0 whitecast. The MP also supposedly protects you from IR and the blue light from screens but... I honestly don't believe that lol. Otherwise, the greasiness is much more pronounced with the MP (I'm pretty sure this would only be non-greasy if you have dry skin), if you use a matte powder on top I'm not sure how much that matters. Price wise, the BS is more expensive, as I paid 26.40 for 50ml (1.89 ml per dollar when you factor shipping), and the MP is 32 for 75ml (2.3 ml per dollar, free shipping for me bc Prime). Although, Krave Beauty does do free shipping for orders over $40, so if you buy 2 at a time, it then makes the BS 2.5 ml per dollar and the cheapest of both! \n\nOverall, while a little expensive I would recommend this to all skin tones and especially dry/normal skin. Oily/combination types, only go for this if you are willing to powder! Oh and if you're sensitive, this is probably a gamble\n\n**4.5/5.0! :)**",

    "body": "In my opinion the only way ascorbic acid may potentially work topically is when it's used fresh, and applied at night in the absence of UV exposure. Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating. From all the research available today, the best efficient way to get ascorbic acid in skin is to just take it orally.\n\nBeneficial actives in bold, potential irritants in italic/stripethrough\n\n**Water based products**: below pH3.5 the ionic charge of AA is removed ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605218/)), improving skin penetration and stability, but water based products remain extremely unstable ([ref](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/7291637/stability-of-vitamin-c-derivatives-in-solution-and-topical-formulations/3),[ref](https://skinelegance.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CSBM_-Skincare-theories-busted-Dec-2014.pdf)), most companies don't store their product in fridges in warehouses, it isn't unlikely products are severely oxidized by the time they arrive at your home\n\n* [‚Ç¨18/50mL - Skinlex 20%](https://www.skinlex.com/product/20-vitamin-c-serum-30ml/)\n  * **pH:** 3-3.3\n  * **Pros:** simple irritant free formula, right pH, pump is convenient compared to pipet, light serum, inexpensive\n  * **Cons:**  pump is not airless, concentration other actives unknown, instability, the look and feel of website and adress of company make me doubt if it's really formulated by a well educated cosmetic chemist\n  * **INCI:** Water, **20% L-Ascorbic Acid**, Butylene Glycol, **Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin**, *Triethanolamine*, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n* [‚Ç¨28/50mL - SkinPep C15](https://skinpep.com/super-c15-serum/)\n * **pH:** 4.3\n  * **Pros:** Great blend of actives, light serum, shared concentrations\n  * **Cons:** pH is too high, dropper, instability, incorrect ingredient order (Propylene Glycol)\n  * **INCI:** Aqua, **15% l- Ascorbic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Panthenol**, Hydrolyzed Collagen, **1% Alpha Tocopherol, 0.5% Ferulic Acid**, Glycerin , *Triethanolamine*, Phenoxyethanol, *2% Propylene Glycol*, Ethoxydiglycol, Laureth-23\n\n* [‚Ç¨34/50mL -Wishtrend 21.5 Advanced Serum](http://www.wishtrend.com/skin-care/1215-pure-vitamin-c215-advanced-serum-by-wishtrend.html)\n * **pH:** unknown\n  * **Pros:** Simple irritant free formula\n  * **Cons:** concentration is a bit high, dropper bottle, lack of stabilizers, not many actives \n  * **INCI:** Hippophae Rhamnoides Water (70%), **Ascorbic Acid** (21.5%), Sodium Lactate, 1,2-Hexanediol, **Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol**, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol\n\n* [‚Ç¨41.60/50mL - SkinActives 15%](http://www.skinactives.com/Vitamin-C-Serum-Ascorbic-Acid-L.html)\n * **pH:** 1.5-2.5\n  * **Pros:** Airless pump!, great blend of actives, not very expensive, no propylene glycol, ph is low enough for penetration, skinactives is busy with a reformulation without the citrus extracts.\n  * **Cons:** ph is irritating, according skinactives not suited for daily use, lack of stabilizers like water reducing agents, recrystalizes quickly.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [‚Ç¨5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [‚Ç¨89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [‚Ç¨9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

I starting layering my vitamin C serums (put one on, wait 20 minutes, put the next one on) bc I know the different types are more effective at different skin issues and I have noticed that my skin texture and PIH are generally improved after these days.\n\nBut, I am wondering if it is effective to layer the Vitamin Cs (especially in terms of PIH) or if I am just wasting product? I know that 20% is the highest effective percentage *in* a serum, but does more than one serum make a difference? Or is the difference in skin I am seeing just because I actually have time to let my actives work? Is there any evidence for or against what I am doing?",

    "body": "Vitamin C has a lot of derivatives and learn everything about them is quite difficult. But let's try :)\n\nCompanies are developing new stable forms of vitamin C that will not only meet the requirements of stability but will also show all three effects of ascorbic acid.  \n\n\n* **MAP**. The first thing I want to note is that it really has excellent stability, **up to pH 7**. The bad news is that MAP **penetrates the skin worse than ascorbic acid**. But for example, microdermabrasion and regular peeling can improve the penetration of all forms of vitamin C. However, penetration into the skin is not the only condition for the effectiveness of the derivative. And the good news again, in vitro studies have proven that MAP is converted well to pure vitamin C. We will be waiting for research performed on real people. As for effectiveness, there are no studies that confirm the photoprotective effect, but it can stimulate collagen synthesis like pure vitamin C (in vitro studies). The most interesting thing is that studies in real people (in vivo) have proved its ability ***to lighten pigmentation***. MAP is a rather promising form of vitamin C. It is not a choice for those who want to enhance skin protection from UV rays, but a good component for those who want to lighten pigmentation, improve skin quality, and reduce wrinkle depth. This form of vitamin C is worthy of attention. But don't forget, it doesn't penetrate well into the skin, so regular peeling is one of the important procedures to improve its effectiveness.\n* **SAP**, as well as MAP, has excellent stability but bad penetration into the skin.  \nUnlike MAP, SAP has good photoprotective activity confirmed in-vivo (on real people), but it is weaker than pure vitamin C. SAP can ***stimulate collagen*** production but weaker than MAP. There is also evidence from the manufacturer that it helps fight hyperpigmentation. It turns out to be worse than MAP and pure ascorbic acid in all its parameters, which may not make it the best option to use. But SAP has a small trump card as it has significant antibacterial activity against bacteria causing acne (P.acne), which was proven in a 2005 study. In a 2009 double-blind study, 5% SAP was proven to be as effective in treating ***acne*** as 0.2% retinol. The combination of these two components showed even greater activity. The study also confirmed that SAP reduces the oxidation of sebum caused by UVA rays.  \nThis form of vitamin C will be of interest to those who struggle with ***acne***. It may not be strong in the fight against ***photoaging***, so it is better to use ascorbic acid and other more promising derivatives. But if we are talking about acne-prone skin, this might be a useful form of vitamin C\n* Ethyl ascorbic acid (**EAC**) is an esterified form of vitamin C, a mixture of ascorbic acid and ethyl group . Such a combination makes this component **very stable**, and most importantly, soluble both in water and oil. This form of vitamin C penetrates well into the skin, which was proved by research from the manufacturer, as well as independent research on animals. And apparently, EAC can penetrate the skin better than ascorbyl glucoside, another promising derivative. So, EAC fulfills the first two requirements for the effectiveness of vitamin C derivatives - it is stable and easily penetrates the skin. What about the third and very important condition: the ability to transform into pure ascorbic acid? Unfortunately, here we have limited research from the manufacturer. Of course, we believe him, but we would still like to see independent research.  \n‚†Ä  \nThe manufacturer claims that EAC transforms into pure ascorbic acid, works as a good photoprotector, and can ***stimulate collagen production***. However, the amount of data is still limited to state this exactly. But there is great news! The ***lighting of pigmentation*** is the most promising effect of EAC. It has been proved not only by the manufacturer‚Äôs research but also by clinical studies in humans (in-vivo), which is very significant. The study showed that 2% EAC can even out skin tone and reduce pigmentation.  \n‚†Ä  \nEAC is little researched, so we would like to see more evidence, especially clinical studies. It is definitely a promising derivative of vitamin C, and it is worth including it in your routine, especially if it aims to reduce hyperpigmentation and protect against UV rays.\n* **Ascorbyl Glucoside**. It is also very promising and is one of the best derivatives of vitamin C; we can even say that it is a bit better studied than EAC.  \nAscorbyl glucoside is a stable form of vitamin C. In-vitro studies have proven its ability to penetrate the skin (although slightly worse than EAC). And this is the first plus. Another very important benefit is that it is converted into pure vitamin C in the skin (in-vitro study). It means that we can expect all three 'magic' effects of vitamin C: *antioxidant protection (photoprotective), stimulation of collagen production, and reduction of melanin production*. The photoprotective effect is proved by studies in humans (in-vivo), even though ascorbyl glucoside was slightly weaker than SAP (sodium ascorbyl phosphate), it is still very good news. In vitro studies have confirmed that ascorbyl glucoside does stimulate collagen production and reduces melanin production. It has all the beneficial effects of ascorbic acid.  \n‚†Ä  \nThat is why this form of vitamin C is one of the most attractive. Yes, it is weaker than pure ascorbic acid, but it is **stable**, and it is much easier to formulate in products. Most studies have been performed in-vitro so far, so we look forward to information about studies on humans to confirm its effectiveness. We think everyone will like this form: those looking for a protective product and those who need an active **anti-aging** component.\n* **Ascorbyl palmitate.** Despite being very common, its activity and usefulness are very different from other derivatives. Studies have shown that its stability is comparable to pure ascorbic acid, which means **it is not stable as an independent component**. Like AA (ascorbic acid), its stability is very dependent on additional components in the product. Ascorbyl palmitate is a very controversial component. The good news is that it penetrates the skin, but there is no evidence that it is *converted* to pure AA in the skin. Research in vitro showed that it could ***stimulate collagen*** production, so we can conclude that a very limited part of palmitate ascorbyl still can be converted to pure AA. And this is the only good thing to say about this form of vitamin C. Well, almost. Ascorbyl palmitate is an antioxidant that provides a photoprotective effect, which is really good, and again there is **BUT**. A 2002 study showed that contrary to its antioxidant effect, probably the lipid component (palmitic acid) of ascorbyl palmitate, promotes the formation of oxidized lipids, toxic to the skin after exposure to UVB rays. In fact, it can become toxic to the skin under sun exposure. This makes it not the best candidate for a daytime product. \n* **Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate** (or Ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate)  \nIt is a stable, fat-soluble form of vitamin C, which means it will actively penetrate deeper layers of the skin, and won‚Äôt just remain on the surface. Research from the manufacturer on human cells (ex-vivo) has proven this. As for another condition of effectiveness for the derivative, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate is converted to pure vitamin C in the skin (in-vitro).  This is good news and means that we can expect all three effects of vitamin C - ***photoprotective effect, collagen stimulation, and lightening of hyperpigmentation***.  It is another very promising form of vitamin C - stable and effective, especially since the lightening effect was proved by a study conducted in humans, a study from the manufacturer. Even though this form has only been tested in vitro, except for the lightening effect, we believe that this is one of the best forms that can seriously compete with pure vitamin C. We hope that more research on real people will help prove this.  \nThis form will appeal to everyone who wants to introduce vitamin C into their routine, especially those looking for a worthy active ingredient to reduce hyperpigmentation and get radiant skin\n* **Aminopropyl Ascorbyl** Phosphate is a very little researched derivative of vitamin C. It is a stable, water-soluble form. The only study from the manufacturer on real people (in-vivo), which is very good, indicates that this derivative is excellent at lightening hyperpigmentation and reducing the depth of wrinkles. That is, we can assume that it is converted into pure vitamin C in the skin. We could say that this derivative is worth a try, but again, independent research is needed to prove its activity in cosmetics when applied to the skin.  \nThere are many other forms of Vitamin C that can be used in the care of your skin, such as Ascorbyl phosphate palmitate, whose ***lightening*** ability has been proven in real people (in-vivo); it is a stable derivative that also penetrates well. It is a really promising derivative, but very rarely found in products.\n\nWell, that's all! I always glad you questions :)",

There are basically no reviews anywhere outside of the official website. There's reviews on Nordstrom's, but they're all *reposted from the company's site*. The positive reviews didn't mention anything specific--\"Really pleasant serum and effects on the skin to suit.\" the few reviews seem fake as FUCK in my opinion. I found one more site that has reviews, but still, few reviews and a little generic. \n\n\n2. Packaging says it's **made in China**. Sorry, what the fuck?? A purportedly $350 cream is *made in China*? A company with very little info, very few reviews, making stuff in China? Alarm bells going off here, esp with regulation of ingredients. Not that China automatically means bad quality, but it's not a great sign for a no-name company. \n\n\n3. The **ingredients don't match the official site**. What the what?!\n\nHere's what the back of my sample said:\n\n\nWater, Sorbitol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Bis - PEG - 18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Diazolidinyl Urea, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Hyaluronate, Disodium EDTA, Niacinimide, Panthenol, Carrageenan Extract, Propylene Glycol, Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Beta-Glucan, Chlorphenesin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Maltodextrin, BHT, Aesculus Hippocastanum Seed Extract, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Atecyl Cysteine, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Soybean Oil, Citric Acid, Calendula Officinalis Extract, Tocopherol, Fragrance. \n\nAnd here's the ingredients list from the official site:\n\n\nGLYCERIN, AQUA / WATER / EAU, SORBITOL, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS (ALOE VERA) EXTRACT, CALENDULA OFFICINALIS EXTRACT, ALCOHOL, CARBOMER, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, AESCULUS HIPPOCASTANUM (HORSE CHESTNUT / MARRON) SEED EXTRACT, SODIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ACETYL CYSTEINE, PANTHENOL, NIACINAMIDE, THIAMINE, RIBOFLAVIN, PYRIDOXINE, CYANOCOBALAMIN, DISODIUM EDTA, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM.\n\n\nCan anyone explain to me why the ingredients themselves would be different, and in the wrong order?? A lot of the ingredients not officially listed, like BHT and Diazolidinyl Urea, don't have great results on CosDNA.... And overall, I don't see any special ingredients beyond a few basic moisturizers, a bunch of preservatives, etc. Like, nothing that would make this worth $$$. \n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nHas anyone tried it? What are your results so far? I guess I'll still give it a try, but the fact that it's made in China (definitely potential ingredient contamination) and the ingredients aren't listed correctly makes me very skeptical... What's your take?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/niANANe.jpg",

That there is no other information on this product online, it‚Äôs only appearance is in this beauty box, indicates a PLM product. Beauty box companies routinely pair with companies who private label their (inexpensively sourced) products and put a high price tag on it to make it seem like an amazing deal. \n\nSome people on this sub HATE any talk of private labeling in beauty boxes, they don‚Äôt want their bubble burst of how ‚Äúgreat a deal!‚Äù their boxes and the products in them seem to be. Some brands seem to only exist in beauty boxes (Doucce, Laritzy, Starlooks, Micabeauty, The Beauty Crop, Be A Bombshell, Mirabella, etc). There are tons more, I‚Äôve only subbed to Play and Allure lately so I‚Äôm a little behind. I suspect most or all of the brands I listed are private label. \n\nYou can usually tell because the brand‚Äôs presence is entirely online (outside of boxes) and the actual website will be a little ‚Äúoff.‚Äù A bit of a DIY template look. Real brands that manufacture their own products will usually sell in retail stores and have a custom website. Private label brands won‚Äôt because that shit costs money and they‚Äôre all about repackaging inexpensively-sourced products that another company made. \n\nIt‚Äôs a huge thing in the beauty industry right now. I‚Äôm not against private labeling, I just think a lot of people are being misled about ‚Äúbox values‚Äù with these inflated prices. Things are ultimately worth what you pay for them I guess but when someone posts how their ‚Äú$20 box has a $300 value!‚Äù I roll my eyes a bit every time lol.\n\nSephora Play has had the fewest amount of PLM products in their boxes, which is why the samples are smaller and less varied-seeming. They seem to only have items in their boxes that they sell in their stores. Ipsy used to have a TON but they seem to send more higher-quality brands lately. Allure seems to be going down that road (Juvia‚Äôs Place, LASplash, etc). Most of the eye palettes in Boxycharm are from private label manufacturers, for example. Brands that just pop up out of nowhere in a beauty box, then just keep showing up in beauty boxes only. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt just true for beauty boxes though, it‚Äôs the case all across the entire beauty industry. I read somewhere that up to 80% or department store products are made by private label manufacturers. It‚Äôs just more obvious in beauty boxes because the same brands repeat over and over. When really, a good chunk of the products are made by the same larger companies and factories overseas, regardless of what brand name it says on the packaging. And the websites of beauty box brands seem more homemade and template-y.",

Sometimes actives are not what your skin is looking for and a good moisturiser can be the game-changer.*\n\n[Just a pic](https://preview.redd.it/p39fzjc4kx661.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=027cc219d95e8947525507a3beec33a9d459f961)\n\nBefore I review the products, these are my expectations from my moisturiser.\n\n1. ***Hydrate:*** Bring water/moisture to my skin\n2. ***Emolliate:*** Thanks to kindofstephen (google his blog or insta if you haven't) for providing a term to my feelings. Make my skin soft and supple by nourishing my stratum corneum with nourishing lipids without clogging my pores.\n3. ***Strengthen my barrier:*** To reduce TEWL by strengthening my barrier so that my skin stays hydrated and supple for longer. This also means I want the moisturiser to have slight occlusive properties.\n4. ***Repair:*** To help my damaged/sensitised skin by repairing my skin barrier.\n5. ***Extras/added benefits:*** Would like if the moisturiser additionally helps to deliver certain ingredients that help with targetted issues like ageing, hyperpigmentation etc. This is not a must though.\n\n\\---\n\n***1. Avene Skin Recover Cream -*** ‚Çπ*1500 (depends on discounts); Cost Per gm: ‚Çπ30/gm*\n\nThis is my go-to skin-emergency product. I do not use it on daily basis. The texture is cloudlike but not mousse-y. It is a lightweight cream. Nevertheless, it packs a punch. I have gone through 8+ tubes of this stuff. It is the only cream that does not aggravate any sensitised areas (burning/redness/dry patches/peeling patches) and absolutely calms my skin. This cream is true to its name. Repairs compromised flaking, sensitised skin in two days with twice/thrice a day usage. The ingredient list is very minimalistic. It is expensive and the sterile patented packaging kind of sucks because you will most definitely have face squirts if you are not careful. However, I can rely on this cream to fix my skin mistakes.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: HG, It is easily available in India but shit is expensive.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types, Sensitive skin***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Squalane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Serine, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water (Aqua)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2. Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream -*** *$10/* ‚Çπ*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ‚Çπ6.5/gm\n\nI tried this product a month back and I am in love. This cream is perfectly balanced. It adequately hydrates and emolliates my skin. My skin feels supple and bouncy without being too greasy and the moisture lasts. I did not see noticeable calming benefits but as a moisturiser it is lovely. The tube is huge and a little goes a long way. This has a slight cooling effect when applied to the skin. Also uses a patented encapsulation delivery mechanism to delivery pseudo-ceramides (lab-made) which help to strengthen your skin barrier. In short, it is a simple no frill moisturiser that is easy to use - not too thick, not too thin, not too heavy, not too light, doesn't sensitize, not too silicone-y, doesn't pill, value for money.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: will repurchase.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Palmitic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide Mea, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Magnolia Biondii Flower Extract, Cholesterol, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Lactobacillus/‚ÄãSoybean Ferment Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethiconol, Mannitol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/‚ÄãAmmonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Propanediol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. Eucerin Q10 Anti Wrinkle Face Cream -*** *$9*\n\nThis is my third tub of this cream. This cream is richer than any cream in the lot. It has a thick emollient texture without being too greasy. It absorbs easily in the skin. It also contains shea butter, SAP and Ubiquinone (Q10). This cream has helped me transition into tretinoin. Do not recommend it for day time use (especially in summers) but for night time/winters it is perfect. It keeps my face moisturised through the night and it has a soft blurring effect on fine lines/skin texture. It did not sensitize peeling skin but helped repair my barrier. I use this regularly at night and it helped to fix the acute dryness that comes with tretinoin. I use it around my eyes and it hasn't given me milia/ clogged my pores. My mom loves and swears by it. She finds it makes her wrinkles look softer.\n\n* Hydrate: 3.5/5\n* Emmoliate: 4.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4/5\n* Extras: 3/5\n* Status: HG but not readily available in India. Will stock up when relatives come post covid.\n\n***Perfect for:*** *Combo-dehydrated/Dry/ Mature skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/‚ÄãCapric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotene, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume -*** ‚Çπ*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ‚Çπ6.5/gm\n\nThis cream is unique. As the name suggests it is a cream-balm hybrid but the texture is surprisingly lightweight. Highly emollient with occlusive properties. It absorbs quickly into the skin as the texture is not too heavy. Sadly, it leaves a greasy feeling/film on my skin. I can not use it the day time and worry that it will clog my pores if I use it on my face. I love it for the body especially my Sahara hands. It seriously brings life to my hands and I do not need to reapply often. I did notice a calming effect. Many of my friends from the community love to use it on their face. It is a little too heavy for my face. If your face is very dry, I think you may like this.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0\n* Status: WNRP at least for my face.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Extremely Dry Skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Aqua/‚ÄãWater/‚ÄãEau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum /‚Äã Mineral Oil /‚Äã Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Behenyl Alcohol, Sucrose Stearate, Canola /‚Äã Canola Oil /‚Äã Huile De Colza, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/‚ÄãSodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Pentylene Glycol, Beta-Sitosterol, Xylitol, Zinc Gluconate, Acrylates/‚ÄãC10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Palmitamide Mea, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Rhamnose, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Mannitol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Ceramide EOP*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***5. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream -*** ‚Çπ2700 *(estimated); Cost per gm* ‚Çπ45/gm\n\nI was sort of disappointed with this product. It is not a bad product but it is not necessarily better. The soft blue colour deceives your mind to think the cream texture may be light. It is actually slightly thick with a silicone-y feel. It has a cooling effect on the skin when you first apply it which tricks the calming feeling. While it is hydrating when you first apply it but compared to others I feel the moisture does not last as long. Also, it makes the sensitised area skin sort of burn. The feeling is not intense but very much against claims. I did not notice any calming/repairing benefits. It may also not be enough moisturisation for the winters. The colour is aesthetically pleasing and silicone-y texture + cooling feel can outwit you into enjoying application but I do not see many real benefits.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 2.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 3/5\n* Repair: 3/5\n* Extras: 1?\n* Status: WNRP, Expensive.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Oily/ Combo Dehydrated Skin?*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/‚ÄãCapric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Bees Wax, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/‚ÄãC10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, SH-Oligopeptide-1, SH-Oligopeptide-2, SH-Polypeptide-1, SH-Polypeptide-9, SH-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/‚ÄãSoybean/‚ÄãFolic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol*\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "Warning this post is a long one:\n\nSo I went to cancel my base box and saw that Boxycharm had already put some spoilers up for the upcoming pop up sale, (someone made a posted already with the items, so you can see it there) obviously the lovely 111SKIN item caught my eyes.  As of right now base on the price of $24, I‚Äôm incline to believe the 111SKIN Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask shown on the picture would be a ‚Äúreal‚Äù 111SKIN item, made in the same factory in UK as the other 111SKIN items that gets sent to Saks, SpaceNK, CultBeauty, their actual website.  So yay no fake ‚Äúmade in China for 111SKIN‚Äù crap, where the ingredients for the same 2 products are miles apart and completely different (see my post on Avant and 111skin, if you‚Äôre interested). \n\nSo is the real 111SKIN made in UK Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask that has a RV of $200 worth it? Let‚Äôs have a look.  \n\nFor people who aren‚Äôt skincare nerds, a moisturizer/night mask (basically the same, especially this one since it tells you to apply on dry skin, I‚Äôm guessing 111SKIN wants you to use this instead of a moisturizer at night) should always contain these 3 different types of ingredients, occlusives, humectants, and emollients. (For more detailed info on these types of ingredients, read the long explanation at the end).  \n\nFor now I‚Äôll get to the short definitions\n\n- Occlusives are ingredients that form a seal around the skin and traps water in order to prevent transepidermal water loss.  Having hydrated skin is very important in age prevention.  Depending on the occlusive ingredient, it can also prevent irritants, pollution, dirt, etc from. coming in contact with the skin.  Common occlusive ingredients: sunflower seed oil, silicones, squalane, beeswax and carnauba wax, Shea, cocoa, mango butters, mineral oil (nothing wrong with mineral oil I go further into details about this later on), lanolin. \n\n- Humectants are ‚Äúcompounds that attract and bind water. They can help hydrate the skin by drawing water from the deeper epidermis and dermis (layers of your skin) or from the air if the humidity is greater than 75%.‚Äù (Definition taken from National Centre for Biotechnology Information).  Common humectants used in moisturizers: glycerin, hyaluronic acid (and its many forms such as sodium hyaluronate, sodium acetylated hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid etc), amino acids, hexylene glycol, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, aloe vera.  \n\n- Finally we have emollient type ingredients, they are used in moisturizers to soften and smooth the skin, also it acts as a lubricating agent, if you have cracked and flaky skin emollients can help fill the the open spaces with fatty acids (lipids) and prevent water loss.  Now many occlusive ingredients are also going to be emollient ingredients as well (like beeswax and carnauba wax) common emollient ingredients used, borage seed oil, Shea butter, almond oil, avocado oil, caprylic/capric, triglyceride, cetyl alcohol, cholesterol. \n\nSo now we‚Äôve listed the 3 types of ingredients that make up moisturizers (obviously other types of ingredients like antioxidants, texture enhancer, preservatives etc are also in moisturizers but these 3 are the building blocks/foundation of any moisturizer).  \n\nIngredients of the 111SKIN Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask (ingredients list taken from 111skin.com):\n\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN (a very good start, glycerin is one of the best humectants, and it‚Äôs the 2nd ingredient which probably means they are going for the gel like texture for this product), PANTHENOL (Vitamin B5, like glycerin it‚Äôs a great humectant.  Draws water from the air and from the deeper layers of the skin to the top layer so that it can plump out the skin thus wrinkles and fine lines look less visible and skin feels smoother.  Its also an excellent soothing ingredient, helping reduce inflammation, redness, irritation.  It helps to repair and strengthen the skin‚Äôs protective barrier and its a great antioxidant.), XANTHAN GUM (and here‚Äôs where the good for skin ingredients end, xanthan gum excellent thickening agent and texture enhancer It‚Äôll make formulas that‚Äôs too watery more gel like.  However the typical concentration of xanthan gum in products are between 0.1% to 0.5%, now this being the 4th ingredient means again 111SKIN wants a gel texture for this overnight mask, cos this is most likely 2 or 1%.  Xanthan gum is perfectly safe and natural it‚Äôs just a chain of sugar molecules), ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER (another ingredient used to thicken products/viscosity control.  Now the presence of xanthan gum in high concentrations, and now this ingredient makes me think the Meso Overnight Mask is mostly made of water hence why there‚Äôs all these thickening agents, even glycerin has a syrup like texture, so not watery), SODIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE (a vitamin c derivative that‚Äôs very stable and is used in Olehenriksen‚Äôs Truth Serum, it‚Äôs an antioxidant and an active ingredient that should be the 2nd or 3rd on the list, as the 6th ingredient I‚Äôm guessing the concentration is below 1%, what is the point of having below 1% vitamin c derivative especially since they are less effective than vitamin c (Ascorbic acid) plus I don‚Äôt see any other powerful antioxidants in this product, yes there‚Äôs panthenol but that doesn‚Äôt require vitamin c derivative to boost its effectiveness, unlike having vitamin e will increase the effectiveness of vitamin c), NATTO GUM (created through the fermentation of a proprietary strain of bacteria (the safe kinds), not enough research on this one, may become a potent antioxidant), PHENOXYETHANOL (preservatives), SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE(another bloody ingredient that‚Äôs used to make something more viscous in texture, so basically it thickens the formula to form a gel, okay we get it 111SKIN you like gel textures), SODIUM HYALURONATE (wow a humectant, salt form of hyaluronic acid), PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL (an emulsifier that‚Äôs amber/yellowish in colour (and that‚Äôs the colour of the Meso Overnight Mask) its used to solubilized fragrances into water based formulas, it really seems like there‚Äôs a lot of water in this product), SORGHUM BICOLOR STALK JUICE (not much information on this one besides skin conditioning agent, soften and hydrates, maybe? But some sites will tell you that it‚Äôll tighten skin and creates a immediate lifting effect.  Again until I find a study or a ton of anecdotal evidence, I‚Äôll call bs on the tightening and lifting claims for now), ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN (preservative), SODIUM HYDROXIDE (a very alkaline pH adjuster), SODIUM BENZOATE (preservative against fungi, not strong enough to work by itself so it‚Äôs usually combined with the next ingredient, works best at acidic pH of 3-5, our skin‚Äôs natural pH levels are usually between 5.5 to 6.5), POTASSIUM SORBATE (preservative thats not strong and often is paired with the previous ingredient) PENTYLENE GLYCOL (a humectant, also makes product feel nice on the skin), HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT (antioxidant, antibacterial, not sure why it‚Äôs at the end of the ingredients list in such low concentrations), CAPRYLYL GLYCOL (it‚Äôs a humectant, but it‚Äôs mainly used cos of its ability to boost the effectiveness of other preservatives mainly phenoxyethanol, there are sure a lot of preservatives on this ingredient list), PARFUM / FRAGRANCE.\n\nSo here‚Äôs the breakdown of the $200 111SKIN Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask. NO OCCLUSIVES, NO EMOLLIENTS, the best ingredient is the panthenol, but without any occlusive/emollients ingredients everything will evaporate right off the skin that also will take moisture from your own skin too!  After analyzing the ingredients list of this lovely $200 product I‚Äôm incline to believe it‚Äôs basically water.  I like the panthenol but La Roche Pasay Cicaplast Balm B5 is so better, and it also has a gel version, it‚Äôs also $15. \n\nSeriously wtf is 111SKIN thinking? I can‚Äôt even consider this as a moisturizer or serum or overnight mask or toner, I don‚Äôt know what kind of product this is....cos from looking at the ingredients it‚Äôs just water with panthenol and a lot of THICKENING AGENTS to get that gel texture.  \n\nBelow are more information on occlusives, humectants and emollients if you‚Äôre interested feel free to have a look: \n\nOcclusives are ingredients that form a physical barrier around your face so that all the moisture from serums and moisturizer won‚Äôt evaporate off the skin making it drier, you‚Äôll often hear dermatologists refer to this as transepidermal water loss (TEWL), for obvious reasons having a hydrated skin will contribute greatly to age prevention.  They also act as a shield protecting the skin from physical irritates, pollution, etc, think of occlusive ingredients as a saran wrap for your face or body, except it only traps the water and keep out irritates especially for people who have compromised skin barriers.  Some examples of widely used occlusives are: \n\n- Shea butter, cocoa butter, mango butter \n\n- Petroleum jelly and by default mineral oil since it‚Äôs derived from petroleum, for reasons unknown the Clean Beauty Movement has demonized Vaseline (and mineral oil) and it‚Äôs been made out to be this monster that‚Äôll take your first born and use it as a sacrifice, but it‚Äôs still one of the best occlusive ingredients we have, quote from one study on moisturizers ‚ÄúPetrolatum in a minimum concentration of 5% reduces TEWL by more than 98% followed by lanolin, mineral oil, and silicones which only reduce TEWL by 20‚Äì30%.‚Äùobviously it‚Äôs less cosmetically elegant (it‚Äôs grease) but perfectly safe to use the molecules are too big to get into the skin that‚Äôs why it makes such a good barrier ESPECIALLY for people who suffer from compromised skin barrier issues (eczema, psoriasis etc) and when you‚Äôve messed up your skin barrier with too much retinol and exfoliating acids.  The new trend in Korea is I think called ‚Äúslipping‚Äù? Where people put on a layer of Vaseline before bed to stop TEWL.  As for people with oily skin maybe stay away from this one. \n\n- Squalane, soy, sunflower oil, lecithin\n\n- Cholesterol and ceramides (two important skin lipids that can be found in the famous Skinceuticals moisturizer 2:4:2 (the first 2 are two different ceramides, 4 is 4% cholesterol, and the last 2 are fatty acids, it looks like they used sunflower seed oil)\n\n- Beeswax, candelilla wax, carnauba wax\n\n- Lanolin, silicones \n\nSorry for rambling, next important class of ingredients are humectants, ‚Äúcompounds that attract and bind water. They can help hydrate the skin by drawing water from the deeper epidermis and dermis (layers of your skin) or from the air if the humidity is greater than 75%.‚Äù (Definition taken from National Centre for Biotechnology Information). Common humectants used are:\n\n- Glycerin \n\n- Propylene glycol (again the Clean Beauty Industry has labelled this one as antifreeze and brake fluid....long story short, it‚Äôs not and safe to use), hexylene glycol, butylene glycol.\n\n- Hyaluronic acid and it‚Äôs many forms, like sodium hyaluronate, sodium acetylated hyaluronate etc \n\n- Lactic acid, PHA (the acids that‚Äôs in Glow Recipe‚Äôs toner, or Olehenriksen‚Äôs Phat Mask) it‚Äôs a very gentle exfoliating acid and they also retain moisture. \n\n- Urea, amino acids \n\n- Aloe Vera \n\nFinally we get to last category of ingredients, emollient ingredients are used in moisturizer to make your skin soft and smooth like a new born baby (I wish it were that easy). They are usually lipids (fatty acids, which are super important to a healthy skin barrier) and oils,  a lot of occlusives are also emollients.  Common emollients found in moisturizers (some are also occlusives) \n\n- Lanolin \n\n- beeswax \n\n- Shea butter \n\n- Jojoba oil \n\n- Castor oil \n\n- Moringa seed oil \n\n- Linoleic acid\n\nTL:DR : even if the 111SKIN Overnight Mask in the pop up spoiler is real as in made in UK with all the other real products that‚Äôs going to be sold in Saks, CultBeauty, SpaceNK etc, it‚Äôs still junk, beyond junk, it‚Äôs basically water, and then a lot of ingredients to make the water into a gel, the ONLY beneficial ingredients are panthenol (vitamin B5), glycerin, and hyaluronic acid....seriously that‚Äôs it, all those ingredients are available in the Ordinary‚Äôs Hyaluronic Acid Serum.",

    "body": "Here‚Äôs a comment I posted about Avant:\n\nAvant‚Äôs Deluxe Hyaluronic Acid Vivifying Face & Eye Night Cream (this was being sold in the FFF edit sale last week), we were suppose to get this last December for premium box but instead we got the Pro-Intense Hyaluronic Acid Illuminating Day Cream instead, it‚Äôs the same RV $134 and has equally crappy ingredients, I‚Äôve seen hand creams/body creams with better/actual effective formulas.\n\nIngredients for the Avant Face & Eye Cream: aqua (water), Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) butter, glycerin (humectant) cetyl alcohol (texture enhancer, emollient), glyceryl stearate (emulsifying agent), dicaprylyl ether (emollient), propylheptyl caprylate (emollient), dimethicone (type of silicone occlusive), sodium hyaluronate (salt form of hyaluronic acid), niacinamide (Vitamin B3, excellent antioxidant has many beneficial properties), maris aqua (sea water, has more minerals than tap water), Prunus Amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil (emollient which contains lots of skin nourishing fatty acids), allantoin (skin soothing), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e), peg-75 stearate (texture enhancer, emulsifier), ceteth-20 (texture enhancer), steareth-20 (emulsifier) propylene glycol (humectant, texture enhancers), disodium edta (too lazy to explain this one) sodium polyacrylate (thickening agent, texture enhancer), xanthan gum (thickening agent), lactic acid (when used at this kind of low concentration most likely it‚Äôs being used as a pH adjuster), parfum (fragrance), potassium sorbate (preservative), ethylhexylglycerin (preservatives) CI 15985 (orange dye) (FD&C Yellow No. 6), CI 17200 (red dye) (D&C Red No. 33).\n\nHere‚Äôs the ingredients for a $134 moisturizer.  It doesn‚Äôt take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn‚Äôt worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it‚Äôs $134.  Avant products AREN‚ÄôT EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it‚Äôs like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it‚Äôs just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there‚Äôs CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM‚Äôs hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere‚Äôs copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it‚Äôs that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain‚Äôs Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury‚Äôs Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant‚Äôs Micellar Water it‚Äôs missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of ‚Äúhigh end/effective‚Äù micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they‚Äôre selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin‚Äôs online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the ‚Äúreal‚Äù moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achill√©e) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin‚Äôs site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / P√äCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BL√â) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHIL√âE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it‚Äôs made with lotus water, there‚Äôs no lotus anything in the ingredients. It‚Äôs full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the ‚Äúgel texture‚Äù of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that‚Äôs $200 isn‚Äôt that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I‚Äôm assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it‚Äôs $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the ‚Äúmade for beauty boxes 111skin products‚Äù will have ‚ÄúMade in China for 111skin‚Äù on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it‚Äôs made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin‚Äôs site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the ‚Äúfake‚Äù ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren‚Äôt even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if Avant‚Äôs website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it‚Äôs still a scam.",

    "body": "x-post from SCA\n\nThis isn't the post I wanted to write, but it's what I've got so far. I'm still hoping that I'll get around to do the actually writing.\n\nNote: I do not include prescription treatments. I do mention retinoids, but Differin is OTC now.\n\n***\n\n**Antibacterial:** aka kills acne bacteria.\n\n+ Benzoyl Peroxide is the biggie. Kills the bacteria, it won't ever become resistant to BP, reduces inflammation, keeps dead skin cells from building up, and can enter pores. *Usage Suggestion:* 2.5% has been shown to work pretty much as well as stronger formulations and works great in short-contact therapy. So, to make BP as gentle as it'll get: apply 2.5% for a few minutes or so and wash off. Yay!\n\n+ Azelaic Acid is surprisingly cool too. 15% has been shown [equally effective](http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/16281587) as BP, and might have [similar results](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11701404) to 0.05% isotretinoin (both studies linked used AA + antibiotic fyi).\n\n+ Other Great Stuff: Sulphur, neem oil, tea tree oil, salicylic acid, and blue light therapy. \n\n**& Antimicrobial** in case you wanna prevent that kind of colonization. Benzoyl peroxide and maybe tea tree oil will help you.\n\n\n**& Antifungal.** Avoid those nasties with neem oil. And probably stuff I'm forgetting. Edit: zinc pyrithione, thank you /u/mastiii!\n\n\n**& Antiseptic:** Wanna reduce the possibility of infection?\n\n+ Neem oil and tea tree oil as above, plus perilla and karanja oil. Be warned, I'm getting most of that info from Garden of Wisdom and not peer-reviewed science.\n\n+ Zinc. An [underrated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120804/) little baby. Zinc sulfate that can prevent acne at 5%. There's a not-very-readable list of products [here](http://cosdna.com/eng/stuff_prod.php?in1=62d146399) but I believe you need to log in first.\n\n\n**Anti-inflammatory** stuff to prevent pores from getting *extra* clogged and icky.\n\n+ Salicylic acid, azelaic acid, neem, tea tree and perilla oil, zinc - we went other these already.\n\n+ Retinoids! Differin is the only one available OTC, but it's less irritating than tretinoin. It works extra well with the addiction of antibacterial agents.\n\n+ Niacinamide is something you should be taking a good, long, hard look at. It's [been](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23786503) [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7657446) to be as effective as 0.1% clindamyacin (prescription antibacterial). It also suppresses [sebum production](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14764170600717704?journalCode=ijcl20) at only two percent and promotes wound healing. Plus a [ton more stuff](https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Review+of+the+Range+of+Effects+of+Niacinamide+in+Human+Skin&oq=A+Review+of+the+Range+of+Effects+of+Niacinamide+in+Human+Skin&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64l3.279j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).\n\n\n\n**Bacteriostatic:** salicylic acid, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide. These prevent bacteria from reproducing so rapidly.\n\n\n**Comedolytic:** benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids. What it sounds like, prevents comodos from forming.\n\n\n**Keratolytic** stuff prevents dead cell build-up and softens keratin (good for dry skin).\n\n+ Urea has been written about [far better](https://simpleskincarescience.com/urea-for-skin/) than I ever could. The tl;dr is it's hydrating, exfoliating, and helps your skin [be better](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3352965/). It also makes people really, really pretty.\n\n+ Sulphur has keratolytic benefits, antibacterial ones, and antiseptic ones. It works for acne (I have a figure of 2% but no idea from where...) as well as psoriasis and eczema.\n\n+ Plus the good ol' standards, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and retinoids.\nsulphur\n\n\n**Sebostatic** is a really cool category. These good 'uns help regulate and/or reduce sebum production. They include: benzoyl peroxide, niacinamide, retinoids, and zinc. Surprise, surprise. \n\n**Other Stuff I Haven't Sorted:**\n\n+ Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (SAP), a vitamin c derivative, helps acne. I didn't write [this post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/sodium-ascorbyl-phosphate/) either.\n\n+ The sebum of people with acne has been shown to have higher than usual levels of oleic acid, which is kind of goopier. Using oils high in linoleic acid (rosehip, borage, evening primrose, and a tooon more) might help to sort of dilute sebum into a freer-flowing substance. \n\n***\n\n**Super TL;DR**\n\n- Antibacterial: neem oil, tea tree oil, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulphur, azelaic acid, blue light therapy\n\n- & Antimicrobial: tea tree oil possibly, benzoyl peroxide\n\n- & Antifungal: neem oil, zinc pyrithione\n\n- & Antiseptic: neem oil, tea tree oil, perilla oil, karanja oil, zinc\n\n- Anti-inflammatory: neem oil, tea tree oil, niacinamide, adapalene/retinoids, salicylic acid, azelaic acid, perilla oil, zinc\n\n- Bacteriostatic: salicylic acid, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide\n\n- Comedolytic: benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids\n\n- Keratolytic: benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulphur, retinoids, urea\n\n- Sebostatic: benzoyl peroxide, niacinamide, retinoids, zinc",

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It‚Äôs a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It‚Äôs like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can‚Äôt see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can‚Äôt remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn‚Äôt learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also ‚Äúbleed into‚Äù and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it‚Äôs also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it‚Äôs also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I‚Äôve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don‚Äôt know, but it‚Äôs probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Av√®ne Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you‚Äôd only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it‚Äôs suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It‚Äôs like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it‚Äôs less shiny as well ‚Äì more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It‚Äôs important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it‚Äôs not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It‚Äôs smells like sunscreen. If you‚Äôve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you‚Äôll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn‚Äôt go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I‚Äôve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it‚Äôs worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it‚Äôs advertised as ‚ÄúANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS‚Äù.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish ‚Äì it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn‚Äôt a chore. If you don‚Äôt apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even ‚Äì that‚Äôs how dry it is. But I didn‚Äôt feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you‚Äôve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you‚Äôll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of ‚Äúuniversal tints‚Äù), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it‚Äôs a mineral sunscreen, I‚Äôm sceptical if it‚Äôll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that‚Äôs something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as ‚Äúsilicone-y‚Äù, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don‚Äôt think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like‚Ä¶ First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper ‚Äì I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle‚Äôs mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it‚Äôs no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it‚Äôs still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it‚Äôs only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month ‚Äì and only if you‚Äôre just applying it to your face. At least it doesn‚Äôt have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it‚Äôs not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you‚Äôre left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you‚Äôre very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn‚Äôt that bad of a sunscreen, but it‚Äôs also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn‚Äôt enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU‚Äôs regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn‚Äôt know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it‚Äôs the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can‚Äôt remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn‚Äôt like it, is because of the texture. It‚Äôs the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn‚Äôt dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a ‚Äúchemical‚Äù smell to it, but that didn‚Äôt bother me. It might not have worked for my face, but it‚Äôs still a good sunscreen for the rest of the body.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Skinnies Sungel SPF30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, broad spectrum, PA++++ (PPD 16+)**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel‚Ñ¢. It contains no water, and thus it doesn‚Äôt have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it‚Äôs still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It‚Äôs oily, but it doesn‚Äôt move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it‚Äôs completely see-though so I can with confidence say it‚Äôll suit every skin tone. It doesn‚Äôt completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn‚Äôt notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn‚Äôt water based it also feels sturdier than the others I‚Äôve tried, so I wasn‚Äôt as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight ‚Äúchemical‚Äù smell, it also doesn‚Äôt contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It‚Äôs on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn‚Äôt working for me, by the way. It‚Äôs definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I‚Äôve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you‚Äôve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

Note that this tinted moisturiser is much lighter than any of The Balm‚Äôs other products labelled ‚ÄúLighter Than Light‚Äù. It‚Äôs really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I‚Äôve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn‚Äôt matter. A little goes a long way, and that‚Äôs why you shouldn‚Äôt really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you‚Äôre pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick. No fragrance, and I haven‚Äôt used it close to my eyes.\n* \\- **Score: 2/5**\n\n**La Roche-Posay ANTHELIOS SHAKA ULTRA-LIGHT SPF 50+**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50+, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), PPD 42**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen was bought in Europe. America/Canada/Australia/Asia might have a different version of this sunscreen, because of the country‚Äôs different restrictions on UV filters and sunscreen criteria (especially American sunscreens). These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first ‚Äì and I loved it. I couldn‚Äôt understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone‚Äôs skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It‚Äôs a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it‚Äôs a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can‚Äôt see that you‚Äôre wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can‚Äôt buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)‚Ä¶ and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn‚Äôt dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has ‚ÄúANTI-OXYDANT‚Äù written underneath the ‚ÄúUVB + UVA‚Äù text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn‚Äôt have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn‚Äôt get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new ‚ÄúANTI-OXYDANT‚Äù version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don‚Äôt lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they‚Äôre very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream‚Ä¶ and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I‚Äôve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it‚Äôs very hydrating. The other sunscreens I‚Äôve liked, I‚Äôve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don‚Äôt need to worry about it, because I can‚Äôt feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it‚Äôs been hydrated) and it doesn‚Äôt do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing ‚Äì it‚Äôs not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we‚Äôve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven‚Äôt been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants. I‚Äôm already on my third bottle of EVY, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5\n\nSome sunscreens I‚Äôve heard good things about and might want to try one day: Anessa sunscreens, Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++, Ultrasun sunscreens, Bioderma Photoderm Max Cream SPF50+.",

UV photons that were not absorbed/scattered by the sunscreen formulations generated ROS within the viable epidermal layers...The addition of the bioconvertible antioxidants **vitamin E acetate and sodium ascorbyl phosphate**...improves photoprotection by converting to vitamins E and C, respectively, within the skin...**The bioconversion forms an antioxidant reservoir that deactivates the ROS **generated (within the strata granulosum, spinosum, and basale)\n\n*Conclusion - adding SAP and Tocopherol acetate to sunscreen did show promise for deactivating reactive oxygen species in the dermis and lower epidermis (but not the top layer of skin)*\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOxybenzone, Octinoxate and Avobenzone are popular sunscreen filters in the USA\n\nThis study tests the antioxidant potential of grapeseed extract in providing extra stabilization to these sunscreen filters so they do not degrade in light as quickly\n \n[**Study: Photodegradation of avobenzone: stabilization effect of antioxidants.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27759892/)\n\n**TL;DR** \n\n>The photostabilizing ability of grape seed extract ...was investigated. Samples were exposed to simulated solar radiation and monitored by spectrophotometric and chromatographic methods. ...UV radiation increased the UV absorption capacity of the extract. **All sunscreens showed an improved photostability in the extract. The inherent photo-instability of (avobenzone) when exposed to UV radiation was almost eliminated in the presence of grape seed extract.** ...**all three sunscreens in the extract showed very high photostability and a red shift covering the entire UVB and UVA regions, thereby improving the broad-spectrum protection.** \n\n*Conclusion - The incorporation of grape seed extract in sunscreen and other cosmetic formulations for topical application boosts photoprotection by stabilizing the UV filters*\n\n**Related** [An in vivo study showing that when grapeseed extract is applied to the skin (sans sunscreen) there was less sun burn cells and cell damage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22103910/)\n\n**Related Related study** [More on vitis vinifera seed extract/grapeseed extract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4777472/#!po=55.1471)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSome consumers worry about effects of skin permeation of certain sunscreen filters, even ones that may not necessarily accumulate in the body.  One of main concern is octinoxate for pregnant women.\n\n \n[**Study: Trans-resveratrol and beta-carotene from sunscreens penetrate viable skin layers and reduce cutaneous penetration of UV-filters.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27759892/)\n*Note* Study was done on pig skin which is similar to human skin - much more so than a lab rat\n\n**TL;DR** \n\n\n >Formulations containing octocrylene, (octinoxate), avobenzone and (Tinosorb s) were prepared and supplemented or not with BTC, or with RES, or with both compounds in combination. \n\n>...Results suggested that UV-filters and antioxidants did not permeate the skin but were retained for 12h post application. About 90% and 80%, respectively, of the total penetrated amount of UV-filters and antioxidants was found in the (stratnum corneum)...\n\n>observations  That BTC, alone or combined with RES, reduced the skin retention of UV-filters on average by 63%. \n\n\n*Conclusion - About 90% of the sunscreen filters did not even pass the first layer of human epidermis. This study demonstrated that the combination of antioxidants and UV-filters in sunscreens may be advantageous for penetration, BTC improved sunscreen safety by reducing delivery of the four UV-filters in the study into SC and viable epidermis.*",

    "body": "I've tried quite a few vitamin c stuff. I use it to mostly improve overall brightness, fade hyperpigmentation and their antioxidant benefits. Here are some of the ones I tried most recently.\n\n- Ole Henriksen c-rush brightening gel creme: \n\nBought this on impulse in sephora. The ingredients aren't the best with some fragrances and benzyl alcohol. Personally did not irritate me at all. It contains 3 types of vit c: ascorbic acid, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, ethyl ascorbic acid. It comes in a jar, so I'm not sure if the vitamin c will remain effective after some time since its repeatedly exposed to air and light. Also contains vitamin e, collagen, HA, panthenol and different extracts.\n\nIts an orange coloured medium thickness gel consistency. Its not the type of gel that turns very watery when you rub it in so it does okay in terms of hydration. \n\nI noticed no fading at all, but that‚Äôs a given since this cream is marketed more towards giving skin a glow, hydrating, plumping and firming. On that note I didn't notice any increase in glowiness and suppleness. The hydration part was alright, I definitely needed to layer other products before it. It wasn't enough to use at night. I can't really say anything about the firming part.\n\nIt does what a moisturizer does but I honestly did not feel it managed to do as much as it claimed. It was just an average product with a pretty heavy price tag. I still finished my jar of it but will not be repurchasing.\n\n- Laneige radian-c cream: \n\nI stumbled upon this right after finishing the ole henriksen. It looked pretty simillar from the name and packaging. This one only has 1 type of vitamin c: 8.5% ethyl ascorbic acid. This one also comes in a jar. No drying alcohol (contains cetearyl alcohol) but contains fragrances. Other notable ingredients are madecassoside and vitamin e.\n\nUnlike the ole henriksen this one does claim to fade dark spots and brighten in general. Personally can't confirm this claim since I had to stop after only a week or so. It wasn't an immediate reaction, but my skin slowly got more and more irritated and prone to breakouts the more I used it. It might have been the fragrance in this. I tried it again after a couple weeks when my skin healed, but it only got irritated again.\n\n- Youth to the people superberry hydrate and glow dream mask: \n\nProbably the one I like the most out of the creams. I use this as a sleeping mask every other day. Contains tetrahexyldecyl as vitamin c. Has fragrance in it bit no reactions. This form is stable, but the product comes in a clear jar. Other ingredients are vitamin e, squalane, HA, panthenol, allantoin and some extracts.\n\nIt definitely delivers on the hydrate and glow part. It makes my skin brighter and glowier when using it, and the hydration lasts after I've washed my face. Its supposed to help uneven skintone and be anti aging. Didn't notice any fading but its fine since it does make me look brighter and glowier.\n\nIts a yellow cream that sort of becomes a light oil when you rub it in. Reminded me of the ordinary's vitamin c suspension in texture, but much more pleasant. The oil dosen't just sit on the skin and feel heavy. I've used squalane stuff that broke me out before, but this did not. Has a fruity smell that is kinda unpleasant to me, but it usually dissapears after a bit.\n\nI'll probably try this as a morning moisturizer in the winter. I like this a lot and the only bummer about this is the price tag.\n\n- Melano cc: \n\nA good place to start, took me a month or so to see some fading, but none of it has dissapeared. Did feel some warm tingling the first few times but nothing major. Vitamin c in here is ascorbic acid and ascorbic palmiate which are both not that stable. \n\nThis serum has a light, slightly oilly texture that gave my dry skin a nice glow too. I used it morning and night until it eventually oxidised 7 months after I bought it. But honestly thats fine cause this isn't that expensive and I noticed more results when I used this generously. \n\nAlso might be my bad though cause I took this travelling a lot and didn't refrigerate it. I've heard their packaging is good though since it limits the contact the serum has with air and sunlight. Its pretty hard to squeeze it out of the tube. \n\nHas a citrus smell so it has fragrance. It dosen't irritate or break me out at all. This also has vitamin e which I heard boosts the effects of the vit c.\n\n- Innisfree brightening pore line:\n\nDelivered the fastest results. The only caveat with this is that the ingredients contain drying alcohol and fragrance pretty high up. My skin does react to those sometimes but was completely fine with this line. In just 1-2 weeks it literally lightened my entire face. The serum is mostly responsible for this.\n\nThis vit c is in the form of ethyl ascorbic acid which is very stable. The brand also mentions that the hallabong extract here is a good source of vitamin c. \n\nI was using it morning and night at first. The texture is like a light hydrating water type serum thats just a touch viscous. More pleasant to layer other products on it. Leaves just a slight residue that dissapears when I layer stuff on it. Theres an artificial orange scent but its honestly pretty pleasant and not too strong and dissapears after a while. I decreased use to night time and eventually stopped since I got a good 2 shades lighter. \n\nThis line also contains arbutin, niacinamide, HA and other nice ingredients. Really noticed no differnce with my pores with this line but pretty good at moisturizing. I still use the sleeping mask from this line every few days that is less scary whitening and more just brightening. Its not the best at hydration and I definitely need to layer other products under it or it will just dissapear into my skin.\n\nThe toner feels a bit too alcholly for my taste. My nose is pretty sensitive and I can smell it. I've tried it out a few times though and was surprisingly hydrating, it didn't dry my skin out at all. It passes as a hydrating toner and didn't irritate me. Not sure about the long term effects since I never used this regularly over a period of time.\n\nThe cleanser is just average. It stripped my skin and made it feel tight but its not the most drying cleanser out there. I did notice like a slight boost in brightening after using this, but I don't think it lasted that long.\n\n- Ti'am my signature red c serum: \n\nCurrently testing this 20% ascorbic acid. Its unstable and reviews generally say this oxidises quickly. Its been in my fridge for a while and no oxidisation for me. \n\nIts honestly not going that great right now. Just straight up using the serum from the bottle breaks me out. Surprisingly no tingling or warm sensation, although my face will look more red the next day. The only way to prevent it from breaking me out is to mix it with moisturizer, but then I don't notice any brightening with that method. I've tried mixing it with other lighter serums too but it always breaks me out the next day. \n\nThis also contains alcohol and essential oils, so my skin could either be reacting to that or the concentration of vit c is too high. Contains other nice ingredients like glutathione, niacinamide, beta-glucan. \n\nThe texture is like a thicker serum with very sticky finish and it always smells like barbeque chips in a bad way. The worst texture and scent in this list. I think we'll have to breakup soon, I don't see this working out.\n\n- Somebymi yuja niacin 30 days blemish care line: \n\nI purchased a travel set to try out first. My skin didn't agree with their aha bha line so I was a bit more cautious. I only repurchased the full version of the toner and serum.\n\nAgain, the serum seems the most effective at brightening. The star ingredients are 5% niacinamide and 82% yuja extract but still contains vit c in the form of sodium ascorbyl phosphate, which is reportedly stable since this comes in a transparent yellow bottle. \n\nThe most pleasant one in terms of texture. Had the lightest watery texture that dosen't leave any residue after I rub it in, just a slight touch of hydration. Lighter than the innisfree, but less hydration. I layer other hydrating essences/serums with this since its hydration is not enough for my dry skin. \n\nThis contains essential oils but my skin dosen't react to it though. The smell of the serum though is an issue. Really smelled like yuzu (a type of lemon) at first, but after a while the smell started changing and now it just smells like chemicals with a hint of chicken noodle soup. Haven't found any reviews criticizing the smell so far. I haven't had mine for that long yet so it can't be expired. I only have this issue with the serum, the other stuff from this line are okay.\n\nThis serum brightened my skin overall but I noticed almost no fading, although I still liked the effect it gave me. Just like the name I really liked this for the first 30 days or so, but then it stopped working halfway through the bottle. Like I noticed no more of that brightening effect.\n\nContains other fun ingredients like licorice extract, green tea extract, arbutin and many more. Really would like it if it just didn't stop working. Also marketed for wrinkle care but I can't say how effective that is. I also found out through their youtube that the vit c concentration in this is low enough to use with chemical exfoliants which can be good for people who want to mix actives, but not so much if you want that vitamin c to really shine.\n\nThe toner seemed fine to me at first. Trying out the trial version it didn't stand out to me and I mostly bought it together with the serum because there was a bundle promotion. I would always notice some redness redness after wearing this but it never caused really bad irritation or breakouts. I've only figured out recently that it might be because this contains fragrance (serum dosen't, this explains why the toner has a much more pleasant yuzu smell). Its also not good for layering since it leaves a sticky residue. I found a cotton pad worked better for this. I've since stopped using it. It didn't really do much in the brightening department. \n\nThe gel cream was the type that turns really watery when you rub it in and offered almost no hydration even when I used a lot. The sleeping mask was okay, still lacking in hydration and lost by far to the innisfree sleeping mask in terms of brightening.\n\nFinal:\n\nOut of all of these I'd probably repurchase melano again since I mostly miss it as a light hydrating oil. The others probably aren't for me. I don't think I'll be purchasing cream type products again as they haven't worked so far in lightening hyperpigmentation. The yttp cream can stay in my routine though. Personally vitamin c is good for overall brightening but it dosen't significantly improve hyperpigmentation for me.\n\nFor fast results I'd go for the innisfree but then again this will probably only work if you got tanned or sunburned since it lightens everyting. It also has a blend of different brightening ingredients, so it might not just be because of vit c.\n\nYuja niacin is pretty good for a daily morning serum if you don't have much hyperpigmentation. I really like the light texture when I want to layer more stuff. Then again its really not a \"miracle\" product. Next I might try the klairs vitamin serum, but its not a priority. There are other things I want to try more.",

    "body": "Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration Weightless Face Sunscreen SPF 30\n\nOne of the cues that I picked up on pretty early in my K-Beauty skincare expiration is that‚Ä¶‚ÄùUS sunscreens/brands are simply not on par with their European and Asian counterparts.‚Äù.\n\nAnd while that may be true when talking about the effectiveness of more modern UV filters...there is something to be said about the occasional diamond in the rough.\n\nThe Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration Weightless Face Sunscreen SPF 30 is one example of a major/well known US sunscreen brand really knocking it out of the park.\n\nThis chemical sunscreen is built around a super lightweight/nearly watery lotion that feels very comfortable on the skin. It‚Äôs the closest product I‚Äôve used from a US brand that offers a similar ‚Äúbreathability‚Äù to my favorites from Klairs and Krave Beauty.\n\nSkincare-centric ingredients aren‚Äôt quite as robust though with Silk Amino Acids, Papaya Fruit Extract, Mango Fruit Extract, Plumeria Flower Extract, and Guava Fruit Extract showing up towards the bottom of the list.\n\nStill, the mild hydration I noticed from this product was surprisingly long lasting (especially with multiple applications throughout the day). And while there is a slight shine to this product right after application...it dissipates into a more soft/satin finish in a minute or so.¬†\n\nAll this combined with a total lack of white cast and a pleasant tropical scent made this a quick favorite to my routine.¬†\n\nI really wish/hope that Hawaiian Tropic releases an SPF 50 of this same formulation. I would feel more comfortable taking this out with me on adventures or applying before light exercise if the protection factor was a bit higher.\n\nBut, for an around the house product or to run a quick errand...the Silk Hydration Weightless Face Sunscreen SPF 30 is a surprise win that holds up well against more ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù sunscreens.\n\nComing in at less than $10.00 USD and available at most supermarkets/drug stores...it‚Äôs one that I will keep in mind when my stash gets low!\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nActive ingredients\n\nAvobenzone (2.0%) Homosalate (5.5%) Octisalate (4.5%) Octocrylene (4.0%)\n\nInactive ingredients\n\nInactive Ingredients: Water, Isohexadecane, Diisopropyl Adipate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Methylparaben, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Fragrance, Propylparaben, Polysorbate 60, Disodium Edta, Xanthan Gum, Aminomethyl Propanol, Mica, Tocopheryl Acetate, Titanium Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Silk Amino Acids, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Antiquorum Root Extract, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Fruit Extract, Passiflora Incarnata Fruit Extract, Plumeria Acutifolia Flower Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Iron Oxides.\n\nWhere To Buy (Target $8.99 USD): [https://www.target.com/p/hawaiian-tropic-silk-hydration-weightless-face-sunscreen-spf-30-1-7oz/-/A-51164217](https://www.target.com/p/hawaiian-tropic-silk-hydration-weightless-face-sunscreen-spf-30-1-7oz/-/A-51164217) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0lgi3s2z1ug51.jpg?width=3915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74d316f0ce361efbdfa32a834ed23bd046664f1a",

I bought it off Nykaa\n\n**Skin info:** Combination. Sometimes, it is combination-dry, sometimes combination-oily, sometimes normal. When it is oily-dry, it is oily around the nose and cheeks but the tip of my nose and chin will be dry. Its weird and really depends on my water consumption. It has been looking dull and dehydrated this past month.**Climate:** Humid, Hot, Rainy (currently)\n\n**Ingredients list:**  Water, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol,                             Styrene/‚ÄãAcrylates Copolymer, Coco‚ÄìGlucoside, Poloxamer 407, Acrylates/‚ÄãC10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methyl Paraben, Menthol, Disodium EDTA,                          Petrolatum, Allantoin, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hyaluronate,                            Perfume, Benzyl Alcohol, Citronellol, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, CI 42090\n\n**Packaging:** Just like the photo. Comes in a plastic tub. You have to dip your finger in it to pick up the product.\n\n**Texture:** Looks like a light custard in the tub (it jiggles) but spreads like a light gel. It is described as a gel creme on the packaging and the description fits.\n\n**Usage:** Been using it two-three times a day since the 28th of September. In the morning, I spread a light layer on my damp skin after washing my face with Neutrogena Extra Gentle Face Wash. If I am reapplying during the day, I just clean my face with water and apply it on damp skin. At nights, I repeat the morning routine and spread a light layer on my damp skin after washing my face.   \nOn October 1, I had to go out and applied Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sun Screen over it. On October 3rd morning, I applied Biotique Bio-Dandelion Serum after washing my face and then applied this gel on top. On October 3rd night, I mixed a drop of glycerine with the vaseline gel and applied on my damp skin after cleansing.   \nI have also increased my water intake so that is one thing that will contribute to my skin looking better. I am doing nothing else in my routine so far.\n\n**Opinion:** I love it (so far). It spreads smoothly across the skin and sinks into my skin easily.  At one point I felt that it absorbed too easily and perhaps I needed more on my skin but as soon as I splashed water on my face, I saw this light sheen blocking the water (probably because of the silicone). It feels a little cool when I apply it (because of the menthol) and tingles my eyes a wee bit (but doesn't hurt or make my eyes water. I actually like the tingling sensation on my skin). It keeps my skin feeling soft, smooth and moisturised for a long time. My skin felt a tad bit oily when I applied a thick layer though (however it could be because I sweat a lot that day). This combines well with both my Biotique serum (which is more like a light moisturiser than a serum) and glycerine. It does have a light fragrance (doesn't bother me at all) that seems to go away in a couple of minutes.\n\nI plan to add to this review and write about my whole basic routine at the end of the month. But my first impressions about this product are great. For those with dryer skin or living in dryer climates, you might need to apply a thicker layer of this to feel the benefits. I have never used the Ponds Gel that everyone loves. But looking at the ingredients list, this Vaseline Gel Creme could possibly be a substitute (I personally feel the ingredients are better but I am a beginner at this and could be wrong)\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about this product.\n\n\nEdited to add:  I did notice a couple of tiiiiiny white heads around my chin and cheeks. And I seem to have a pimple forming near my nose. But I don't know if I can attribute it to the Vaseline gel. On 29th and 30th, I had to go to work and was wearing my mask for 5+ hours and its almost that time of the month. So I don't know if this product is clogging my pores and causing the one pimple and three whiteheads. I don't have a \"break out\" so can't say yet. Will be able to give a more informed opinion when I give a full review.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sc2z56tdu0r51.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c42ec854fa29737c2bfeff62a44ddd5bc341294",

In the comment section, Brandon Truaxe of Deciem answered questions regarding the science behind their products.  I waded through them all and decided to put them together.  I was doing the research for myself before I venture into Vitamin C but thought I'd share (not affiliated with either company/people):\n\n___________________\nVitamin C itself can make acne conditions worse in some people. If you are only facing acne scars but no active acne, then Vitamin C wouldn't hurt but new retinoic compounds (like the one in Retin Oil) is simply more effective on such scars. Niacinamide does improve acne but its effect on acne scars is minimal. \n\nVitamin C, especially at the early phases of application, can make acne conditions worse. If you're using Vitamin C for its antioxidant value, there are many better options in the world today. If you're using it for its collagen support value, CAIS is light years ahead. For acne scars and acne, retinoic compounds always win; in fact, Vitamin C can and generally does make acne worse. I am mainly referring to casual pimples. Very serious acne is a whole different issue and topical (Retin-A) or internal medications (Accutane) are extremely good at fixing the issue. I generally do not recommend AHA/BHA as they cause inflammation and their short-term value is less than the inflammation they cause. With reference to wanting to brighten your skin, Vitamin C has some but limited value in this case. It balances pigmentation but does not really lighten natural pigmentation. As the area of visible skin lightening is very poorly served in the beauty industry (most things don't work since the bans of hydroquinone and mercury salts which are harmful)\n\nAs both Vitamin C offerings in Hylamide and NIOD are free of water and oil, the order of application is not as important but we would recommend as the last step before a moisturizer (or any form of surface barrier) and only at nighttime. These products are designed almost as a nighttime masque that contains a push-pull technology to stay \"wet\" for a longer period to offer extensive exposure to Vitamin C.\n\nAs the product itself contains no water, the concept of pH doesn't really technically apply. Once applied to the skin, the Vitamin C will start to interact with skin water content which would then slowly trigger pH fluctuation but you generally don't need to wait to apply any product other than NIOD CAIS (or anything contains copper peptides) after application of the product. Please note that any high-molecular form of hyaluronic acid would become slightly thick and \"stringy\" if it comes in contact with acidic pH so if immediately after application you apply a HM HA, it may make the texture different. I generally discourage use of topical high-molecular weight HA anyway.\n\nVitamin C has been a big part of our focus not because it represents a skincare revolution but because the ingredients (or the subject rather) has been abused. \n\nThere are three forms in which Vitamin C is used in skincare today: \n\n1. Liquids containing L-Ascorbic Acid:\nThese serums all contain water to solubilize L-Ascorbic Acid. They all turn orange over time which means the Vitamin C changes from an antioxidant to a pro-oxidant as it has begun oxidation. At best, the ingredient becomes useless to the skin. Many brands own patents on making VC in this format stable but these patents don't prevent the oxidation that is very obvious in the colour change. (Please note a patent offers exclusive use of an idea; it does not validate that the idea works but the consumer creates this association.) \n\n2. Non-Liquids containing L-Ascorbic Acid:\nIn these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; it's just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage. \n\n3. Formulations Derivatives of Vitamin C\nThese ingredients include Magnesium/Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP or SAP), Ascorbyl Palmitate, Ascorbyl Glucoside and others. These technologies are stable but release small amounts of Vitamin C so a 10% solution of MAP (which is high), may release 2-3% of pure Vitamin C at best. \n\nThe problem common to all of the above, first and foremost, is that VC is very cheap and can be obtained even at retail (nutrition shops) for $30/KG to last a lifetime of topical application so I am not sure why many of these formulations are so expensive. \n\nNIOD ELAN and Hylamide C25 both use Ascorbic Acid that has been ethylated so that it is far more stable in water but neither product uses any water at all in any event since we have solubilized the VC without the use of water which we have provisionally patented despite my general disregard for commercial value of patent filings in skincare. \n\nThe problem you have highlighted is two-fold. In case 1 above, the acidity of any formulation with high VC will be very strong (pH of around 2) which would cause irritation. Since none of our Vitamin C formulas contain any water, the concept of pH doesn't apply and the slow release of Vitamin C into the skin overnight will discourage any interim irritation as a result of a very acidic pH. \n\nThe second issue you highlighted around the higher concentrations of Vitamin C refers to studies that have shown Ascorbyl Palmitate in higher concentrations can be harmful to the skin. No such reference is ever made to pure Vitamin C. And in any event, since there is no water in the formulation and technically the formula is a slow-release nighttime masque in liquid form, the basis of its function is exposure to low amounts of (a lot of) Vitamin C overnight. Ultimately, any slow-release approach refers back to how much VC there is actually to release and this exact point is why a higher concentration is actually better. \n\nHaving said all of the above, we wanted to make the world of topical Vitamin C better, but there are many technologies today that offer far better collagen support and better antioxidant value that any form of Vitamin C. Vitamin C still offers some level of radiance and pigmentation balancing (very different to bleaching technologies) and so this specific reference is what we encourage VC for. For overall anti-aging purposes, I absolutely would encourage CAIS/MMHC ahead of any Vitamin C product within our or other ranges. \n\nVitamin C can make acne conditions worse and so I definitely would not recommend ELAN. \n\nAcne is not at all related to the ability of the skin to fight bacteria; in fact acne is generally a condition present in younger, healthier skin. The cause is the entrapment of bacteria. Sebum function and surface consistency can affect acne. LVCE, CAIS, MMHC, FECC and PF will not affect acne in anyway. HV, NEC should be used only on the lower neck. You do not need all of the above at all. I am only highlighting in reference to acne. My suggestion is that you incorporate only CAIS and/or MMHC and continue with other acne treatments as we do not offer one. You don't need anything else really. If you use makeup, LVCE will get it off completely. If you do not use makeup, just use water to cleanse. Cleansers generally make skin worse in the longer term. \n\n----------------------------\n\nFor those well versed in the science of actives,  how do you feel about what he wrote and anything else I should know? thanks\n\nedit: this is from 2015 before their new The Ordinary launch, still interesting to read about his thoughts then.

C25 does have technologies specifically to target skin pigmentation whereas ELAN offers more Vitamin C in a more sustained form since it's in an renewing antioxidant network.

    "body": "Hi! I often see questions about pigmentation, spots, and I know that vitamin c is good for pigmentation, and other skin problems. I found and structured information about the form of Vitamin C and its effective concentrations.\n\nMy post about:\n\nWhat is the concentration of vitamin C good for anti-aging/ pigmentation/acne? What concentration of vitamin C should apply for the first time? How to choose the form and concentration of Vitamin C\n\nMaybe it is helpful to you.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n# Which Vitamin C is best for the skin?\n\nThe main forms of vitamin C and their markings in cosmetics.\n\nPopular stable forms of Vitamin C:¬†\n\n* Ascorbyl palmitate, AA-PAL, ascorbic acid-6-palmitate (AA6P)\n* Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate, VC-I\n* Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, MAP\n* Sodium ascorbyl phosphate, SAP\n* Ascorbyl glucoside, AA-2G\n* Ester-C, calcium ascorbate\n* Sodium ascorbyl palmitate\n* 3-O-ethyl ascorbate, EAC).\n\nAn unstable form of Vitamin C ‚Äì Ascorbic acid, L-ascorbic acid, LAA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7dolbbpc59781.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=18dfb30391b03af79d38fceaf5d3f02804a7d756\n\n# How to determine the Vitamin C concentration\n\nIf the Vitamin C concentration is not indicated on the package of the care product, the location of the Vitamin can determine the approximate content of the ingredient. The ingredients in the compounds are indicated in descending order. So, if Vitamin C is at the beginning of the list, the concentration is high. The closer to the end of the list,  the lower the concentration. Ingredients with content of 1% or less can be listed in any order. Of course, the exact amount of Vitamin C cannot be determined in this way, but it will help determine the expectations of the care product.\n\nFor example, you choose a face cream, and  Vitamin C is indicated in the compound, as Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate. As you can see from the compound, Vitamin C is not in the first position,  so you should not expect strong lighting of pigmentation from the cream  (Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate lightens pigment spots at 10%). The cream will work as an anti-age by increasing collagen synthesis and improving skin tone.\n\nFor example, Serum with 10% Vitamin C contrast in the form of Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate  (in the compound in second place) will work as an anti-aging agent, help reduce pigmentation, and protect the skin from the aggressive effects of UV radiation.\n\n## How to choose the form and concentration of Vitamin C\n\nIf you are starting to know Vitamin C or your skin is sensitive, I recommend paying attention to stable forms or a low concentration of unstable forms.\n\nIf your skin is dense or already ready for more active action, you can switch to the option with a concentration of 15%.\n\nA slight stinging after applying Vitamin C is quite normal, but if the skin is hypersensitive or prone to rosacea, a highly concentrated vitamin C serum (above 10%) will not suit you.\n\nIf you have previously used Vitamin C serums and skin irritation has occurred (severe burning or redness), I recommend switching to a milder form of Vitamin C or reducing the concentration of the product.\n\nRegular use of vitamin C in small percentages is much better for the skin than a single-use in high concentration.",

If you'd like to learn more about vitamin C, please check out the [vitamin C wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin_c_recs) :)\n        \n&nbsp;\n\n###Here‚Äôs how it works:\nWe have a template you can copy. This thread doesn't have any top-level categories, so simply reply to this thread with the template and fill it out. Include as much info as you can! Type of vitamin C and %, smell, product feel, packaging, effects on your skin, etc. \n        \n&nbsp;\n\n###Template\n\n**Product name**:\n\n**Vitamin C type and %**:\n            \n**Price (range)**:\n\n**Country of purchase**:\n            \n**Skin info**:\n            \n**Ingredient list**:\n            \n**Special info**:\n            \n**Experience & opinion**:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Comment template notes:*\n\n* 'Vitamin C type' should be noted on the product or in the ingredients list; common types of Vitamin C include ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbyl phosphate (SAP), and magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (MAP). Don't worry if you can't pinpoint it though!\n* 'Amount (%)' of vitamin c is highly encouraged! Brands will often include that info in the product description, and sometimes review sites will have it as well. But don't worry if you can't track it down.\n* 'Skin info' covers skin type, skin concerns and skin tone/ethnicity/[Fitzpatrick type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale).  \n* 'Ingredient list' is optional, but encouraged. Online sellers like Amazon and review sites like Beautypedia often list a product's ingredients.  \n* ‚ÄòSpecial info‚Äô covers anything that people might be specifically looking for. Like cruelty free / vegan / fatty alcohol free / fragrance free / pH value / etc. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Don't forget to have fun!\n        \nOf course, this thread isn‚Äôt just about listing a load of products - it‚Äôs also about sharing experiences! So feel free to chat about your product with others, or ask someone a question about the product they like, or share your experience with the product someone else has recced.

        "body": "**Brand:** [Timeless Skincare](https://www.timelessha.com/)    \n\n**Product Name:** [20% VITAMIN C+E+FERULIC SERUM](https://www.timelessha.com/collections/all/products/20-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-acid-serum-1-oz)    \n                 AKA [CEF Serum](https://ibb.co/HTpvL46)\n\n**Ingredient List:** [Water, Ethoxydiglycol, _20% L-Ascorbic Acid,_ Propylene Glycol, _1% A-Tocopherol,_ Polysorbate 80, _Panthenol, 1% Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate,_ Benzyl alcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid](https://www.timelessha.com/products/20-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-acid-serum-1-oz?variant=31714127773807#ingredients)\n\n**Vitamin C Type:** L-Ascorbic Acid   \n\n**Vitamin C Percentage:** Twenty Percent    \n\n**Price Range:** $17.95 half oz | $26.95 full oz    \n\n**Country of Purchase:** United States   \n\n**Skin Information:** Combination of mildly-moderately oily & normal^ish when not using tretinoin gel. With my full skincare routine my skin remains rather normal, but if I overuse my exfoliants or retinoids then the lower third of my face can get dry/flakey. I‚Äôm moderately acne-prone and extremely discoloration-prone. I don‚Äôt consider my skin to be sensitive but it does react negatively to certain ingredients.   \n\n**Experience & Opinion:**   \nBest OTC product I‚Äôve used for brightening my skin and keeping it looking healthy & radiant and I‚Äôm ecstatic it doesn‚Äôt exacerbate my acne! Despite its excellent brightening abilities it doesn‚Äôt fully remove my brown post-acne discoloration on its own _(it fades them but it needs help from other ingredients to remove them)._ I don‚Äôt fault the brand because no vitamin c product I‚Äôve tried fully lightens my acne PIH spots; they‚Äôre incredibly stubborn. I‚Äôm pretty sure it prevents them from getting worse because when I‚Äôm not using this serum my post-acne marks can sometimes darken further when I‚Äôm not using a depigmentation product. This benefit is probably due to the L-AA enhancing my skin‚Äôs photoprotection. \n\nWarning, this has the highest viable percentage of active vitamin c; accordingly it can be quite irritating when you first start using it but its entirely tolerable once your skin is acclimated if you‚Äôre not overly sensitive to the ingredients. If you use other sensitizing products like I do make sure to wait a few minutes in between applying. Storing it in the fridge so it‚Äôs cool also seems to improve tolerability but YMMV. Refrigeration also can increase stability so I also recommend it for that reason; especially if you‚Äôre after the collagen-synthesis & free radical neutralizing effects of vitamin c.   \n___{Edit:___ *Timeless Skincare now offers a 10% version of this serum that would be more suitable for novices.*}\n\n**Special Information:**   \n‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs worth noting that L-ascorbic acid is the active form of vitamin c, it doesn‚Äôt need to be converted to work. Similarly, when compared to other forms of vitamin e, alpha-tocopherol is preferentially absorbed and accumulated in humans. So, this formulation is a really good option if you‚Äôre wanting the best bang for your buck.\n\n‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs noted on Timeless Skincare‚Äôs [FAQ page](https://www.timelessha.com/pages/frequently-asked-questions) that this serum may not be suitable for individuals w/ _‚Äùvery oily or very fair skin types.‚Äù_\n\n‚Ä¢ The FAQ page also notes _‚ÄùWe refrain from testing on animals and avoid the use of animal byproducts whenever possible.‚Äù_\n\n‚Ä¢ I‚Äôve been buying this product on & off for years and I‚Äôm fully satisfied with the quality of the service and product. When I order it a fresh bottle always arrives to home rather quickly. Every time I‚Äôve pH tested it in the past I was satisfied with the result. It‚Äôs not always exactly the same but it‚Äôs always in the 2s or low 3s. It has never seemed to oxidize/degrade before I finished using it _(I usually use it both day & night but if you only use it once a day I think you‚Äôll be fine since this is one of the few L-AA serums that comes in an airless pump bottle)_",

I've tried many of TO's vitamin c products, but this one is my favourite. I think it's one of TO's most cosmetically elegant serums: doesn't pill, isn't tacky, etc. The consistency is like a dry oil, although it contains no oil. You only need 2-3 drops, which I spread between my hands and press it into my skin. If you use to much or drop it straight onto your skin, you might end up with absorbency issues and greasiness. I've been using it for two years now and it's helped fade my hyperpigmentation and give my skin a nice glow. A bottle lasts me around a year and I haven't had any oxidization issues.",

Upon application they are completely inactive. We don't know much about how efficient this conversion process is or even if it happens for everyone, since our individual skin environment is so different.\n\nMore reading on Vitamin C derivatives here: \n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7vh3if/research_kindofstephen_just_posted_about_a_study/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Be00ARIlbpZ/?igshid=6rl55r95fc5j \nhttps://thebeautybrains.com/2014/05/which-kind-of-vitamin-c-is-best-for-skin-the-beauty-brains-show-episode-31/\n\nThe overwhelming majority of research on Vitamin C derivatives is in vitro research.\n\nI choose to use Ascorbic Acid because why wouldn't I use the ingredient directly that everything else purports to convert into? I'm skipping a step, in essence. It's more active, more bioavailable and more effective  than any derivative.\n\nBut, not everyone can tolerate Ascorbic Acid.\n\nIf you (understandably) can't tolerate Ascorbic Acid, my recommendation is to use a different, evidence based antioxidant, not a Vitamin C derivative. I'm talking about Niacinamide, Vitamin E, EGCG, Coenzyme Q10, Resveratrol, etc.",

        "body": "Start with the wiki always! But here‚Äôs my individual take:\n\nI think about it a lot like retinols and their derivatives. Ascorbic Acid is the gold standard period. Most studied,reliable results, etc. Most formulations aren‚Äôt at the correct pH or effective %. I doubt people who mix using AA powders are consistently formulating something truly effective. Like retinol, in its effective range, it‚Äôs gonna be tricky and potentially irritating to work with. I don‚Äôt really have hyperpigmentation or effects of photoaging (humble brag) so I‚Äôm not at a place personally where I‚Äôm gonna put my reactive skin in the line of fire like that. \n\nNow derivatives have little to no clinically backed results. That‚Äôs true of most at home skincare. There‚Äôs no incentive for studies of these kinds unless it‚Äôs coming from skincare companies themselves who are obviously biased. Dermatologists study things in **clinical** trials to use in their **clinics**.  Aside from ceramides, niacinamide, retinol, sunscreen and AA, which all have to be formulated and used correctly (which most products probably aren‚Äôt), everything else is more or less a scientific unknown. A lot of AB superstar ingredients fall into this category but people will swear up and down it‚Äôs the snail mucin/green tea/centella etc that changed their whole life. For this reason I don‚Äôt mind derivatives. They tend to be more stable, less irritating, and not pH dependent. Are you gonna see results as good or better than AA? Probably not. But it will work better than AA that‚Äôs oxidized, at the wrong pH or concentration, in the wrong place in your routine/not preceded by a pH adjusting toner, etc. I would say for newbies, people with sensitive skin, or who aren‚Äôt dedicated to researching AA to just stick to derivatives.",

    "body": "Just for information, I bought Mad Hippy Vitamin C serum (mainly because it was the only recommended serum I could find in the UK) and when trying to fit it into my routine got a tad confused as most routines seem to use vit c first due to the low pH.  Anyway, Mad Hippy is up towards the higher end of the pH scale at 6.5 to 7.5, therefore I plan to fit it into my routine based on pH (someone tell me if this is wrong).\n\nFor information, here is the email that they replied to me with (responding the same day):\n\n\"Thank you for reaching out! We are glad that you found us and hope that you enjoy our line! As you may know, different forms of Vitamin C require a different pH for maximum stability and absorption. The form of Vitamin C that we use requires a pH of around 6.5-7.5 for the best stability and absorption. \n\nAdditionally, because we use a different form of Vitamin C than most companies and a different concentration is needed, we don't put the percentage on the label. Most companies use L-ascorbic acid, however,  it has some disadvantages when compared to other forms of Vitamin C that are now available.  For one, L-ascorbic acid is very unstable and it oxidizes very quickly.  Apart from oxidizing easily, L-ascorbic acid is also not very easily absorbed through the skin's lipid barrier so a high concentration of L-ascorbic acid is needed (usually 15-20%) to make an effective product. At this concentration, while it slowly absorbs,  L-ascorbic acid can cause irritation and acne outbreaks for those with sensitive or acne prone skin.  So while L-ascorbic acid has been around for a long time and it works for some people, we feel that there are better forms of Vitamin C now available. \n\nThe form of Vitamin C that we choose to use is called sodium ascorbyl phosphate (SAP).  It is a form of Vitamin C that has a salt molecule attached to it, allowing it to easily penetrate the skin's lipid barrier. Because this form of Vitamin C is easily absorbed and utilized by the skin, it is not associated with the irritation often experienced with L-ascorbic acid.  Furthermore, a lower concentration is needed for the same results, which also leads to less irritation.  We use about 10% sodium ascorbyl phosphate which is equivalent to a much higher concentration of L-ascorbic acid because it is much more bioavailable.  It is also phenomenally more stable, allowing longer shelf life, even once it has been opened. We have won several awards for our Vitamin C Serum and it was dubbed the \"Glow-getter serum\" in InStyle Magazine and \"a miracle worker\" in Allure magazine in the last couple of months. \n\nAlthough most people purchase our Vitamin C Serum to heal sun damage, brighten the skin and reduce discoloration/ age spots, SAP has also been shown to treat acne and reduce the appearance of acne scars.  I have included a PDF that discusses the benefits of this form of Vitamin C in more detail if you would like to see some more detailed information on it.\"\n\nHopefully this is helpful.\n \n",

    "body": "Okay I had a few comments and messages so here is update so far. I had a message with someone asking me to take a picture of the ingredients, through this I noticed the ingredients on the website do NOT match what‚Äôs on the packages, it seems like more than just a different of MD or for public sale products. I have sent a message to inquire about this. Below is the difference between what is listed on medestitics website and the ingredients on the actual box. \n\n\tCaprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n\t‚Ä¢\tAzelaic Acid\n\t‚Ä¢\tTitanium Dioxide\n\t‚Ä¢\tAloe barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\t‚Ä¢\tCopernicia cerifera Cera (instead, List Two has Euphorbia Cerifera Cera)\n\t‚Ä¢\tKojic Acid (List Two has Kojic Dipalmitate, which is a derivative)\n\t‚Ä¢\tPEG-8 Beeswax\n\t‚Ä¢\tAlpha-Arbutin\n\t‚Ä¢\tCetearyl Alcohol\n\t‚Ä¢\tNiacinamide\n\t‚Ä¢\tSodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (List Two has Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, another vitamin C derivative)\n\t‚Ä¢\tCeteareth-25\n\t‚Ä¢\tBisabolol\n\t‚Ä¢\tMagnesium Aluminium Silicate\n\t‚Ä¢\tStearyl Dimethicone\n\t‚Ä¢\tBehenyl Alcohol\n\t‚Ä¢\tDisodium Ethylene Dicocamide PEG-15 Disulfate\n\t‚Ä¢\tSodium Lauroyl Lactylate\n\t‚Ä¢\tAscorbic Acid\n\t‚Ä¢\tCitric Acid\n\t‚Ä¢\tAllantoin\n\t‚Ä¢\tAcacia senegal Gum\n\t‚Ä¢\tGlyceryl Stearate Citrate\n\nWhen I asked chat gpt if any of these ingredients could change the effectiveness this was the answer:\n\nIt depends on the goal of the product. If the formula is meant for brightening and treating hyperpigmentation, losing Azelaic Acid, Alpha-Arbutin, and Niacinamide could reduce its potency. If it‚Äôs meant for acne-prone or sensitive skin, removing Bisabolol, Allantoin, and Aloe could make it harsher. However, List Two does have other effective ingredients, like Retinol, Kojic Dipalmitate, and Hexylresorcinol, which may compensate for some of the missing benefits.\n\nHowever, Skin is doing as expected and so far the same as when I had it applied in office by physician. Red and tight but very little peeling yet‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôll start tomorrow. \n\n1st pic is immediately after rinsing to show my before. 2 picture are yesterday evening, skin looks the same today.\n\nOk thanks for listening to my rant üòÖ",

    "body": "Here are some various lotions and balms from Dollar Tree, drug stores (i.e. Walgreens) and Ulta which I‚Äôve tried to organize left to right, top to bottom from lightweight to medium and heavier. Some are empty, others halfway or new to me. \n\n> Skin type: oily, acne prone. Lately dry because of (over)using actives. \n\n##Watery gel\n * Peter Thomas Roth - Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer. New to me. Humectant forward, nice at first but burns a bit after a while if by itself. I think layering it with a moisturizer should be fine. I don‚Äôt understand the 30% hyaluronic complex claim‚Äîisn‚Äôt this ingredient usually only at 1%? \n* (Dollar Tree) B Pure Hydrating Gel Cream. Supposed to dupe the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel (I haven‚Äôt tried that one). Similar to the Peter Thomas Roth, not that friendly to my skin, and doesn‚Äôt smell as nice (like a baby powder smell). But this one actually is a pretty good as a makeup remover cold cream which can remove eyeliner. \n\n##Gel cream \n* (Dollar Tree) Global Beauty Care - Lift and Firm Eye Cream with Collagen and Peptides. Actually a very nice serum texture. The 0.5 oz lasts a while. I just used as a lightweight face moisturizer instead of eye cream. While I‚Äôd want a larger size I would get this texture again. \n* Nivea Breathable body lotion in scent Tropical Breeze. New to me. I got this as people said it‚Äôs light enough to be a face lotion, and it‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs very light. Too light for body really. I have some issues with this one. Perhaps my skin is currently compromised (it‚Äôs dry), but there is a consistent cooling feeling to the lotion, that sometimes also feels a bit burning. I don‚Äôt know what ingredient it is. It‚Äôs interesting there‚Äôs a vitamin c derivative sodium ascorbyl phosphate though. The scent is nice like a floral rose, geranium, jasmine type scent, that is true that it smells like Glad Air Freshener, which I happen to like. \n* Gold Bond - Pure Moisture daily body and face lotion. This didn‚Äôt work for me as a hand cream (not moisturizing enough). Slightly thin so it does also go by fast. But I started to love it when I thought of it as a face lotion instead. Layers nicely with other lotions too. I‚Äôm interested in repurchasing as it comes in large value sizes, although it appears this product may be on the way out in some stores. Seems a great value. \n\n##Lightweight lotion \n* Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion. Similar story to Gold Bone Pure Moisture, didnt value it until I thought of it as a lightweight face lotion instead of for body. This is a nice but plain light lotion. I‚Äôve heard the ceramides complex might not be in an amount to help skin recovery that much. But it‚Äôs nice enough anyway. The Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair is a pretty similar product on skin. \n* Vaseline - Intensive Care Soothing Hydration. I liked the Vaseline Advanced Repair unscented a lot so tried this one. I like its cucumber melon type scent. But similar to the Nivea Breathable lotion (above), it has a cooling sensation but also can burn at times, especially on my face which is also currently sensitized. It seems fine for body. \n* The Beauty of Eczema - Moisturizing Cream. Rebranded as a ‚Äúdaily moisturizer,‚Äù this independent business which started on Instagram has since closed shop. The moisturizer is quite lightweight but also has sweet almond oil as the second ingredient, making the feel similar to a face oil/lotion hybrid. Not as moisturizing as something with dimethicone or petrolatum (like Cerave Daily Moisturizer or Vaseline Advanced Repair), but did not cause any breakouts. I didn‚Äôt find this to be ‚Äúenough‚Äù in winter time but I loved the natural rose scent, just so much like the flower. I don‚Äôt have eczema btw. \n\n##Moderate lotion \n* Cetaphil - Moisturizing Lotion. New to me. A bit scared to put on my face as I‚Äôve heard people have had breakouts. But it does seem to moisturize for a long time (applied to hands) and doesn‚Äôt cause sensitivity. The pump is a bit annoying as it locks when you turn it 45 degrees and also doesn‚Äôt dispense a lot for body use (but enough for face). \n* (Dollar Tree) Dermasil - Eczema Relief Body Lotion with chamomile flower and colloidal oatmeal. Moisturizes well for face and body. Possibly caused stinging once but has been fine after that. Has a light herbal scent kinda like dead flowers (pelargonium graveolens oil), but not bad. \n* (Dollar Tree) Kissable - Diabetics Dry Skin Relief Lotion. Has 30% petrolatum and 1% dimethicone as active ingredient skin protectant. Unscented. Actually love how this moisturizes and has a slight gel feel. It‚Äôs similar to Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion but less emollients (no oils). I am comfortable using for face and hands. \n\n##Thicker lotion \n* Alba - Very Emollient Body Lotion. Has a big variety of oils. Actually a godsend for when my nails are dried out because of Bath and Body Works hand soaps, dish detergents and bleach cleaners. Makes nails glossy. But uses a plant based emulsifier (glyceryl stearate SE) so it takes a long time to rub in, where a dimethicone would cut down that time. Seems great as a hand cream rather than a body lotion‚Ä¶ takes too long after a shower on damp skin. \n* Gold Bond - Age Renew Retinol Overnight for face and body. Definitely thicker than the Gold Bond Pure Moisture. Has shea butter. Makes my skin soft in the morning (especially with Vaseline on top). Doesn‚Äôt seem to cause acne strangely enough. Has a texture like Hempz hand cream. I like this lotion especially in winter. \n* Eucerin - Eczema Relief Cream with 1% colloidal oatmeal. A good balance between a lighter and thicker cream. Doesn‚Äôt seem to cause issues. I don‚Äôt have eczema but liked this for drier skin days on face and body. \n\n##Cream \n* Lumin - Face Moisturizer for Oily and Normal Skin. A similar thickness to Gold Bond Age Renew Retinol Overnight, except a little more like a gel cream. This is an interesting one as there‚Äôs a stickiness similar to Cosrx Snail Mucin (but doesn‚Äôt have that ingredient) but also has meadow foam seed oil high in the ingredients list. Enjoyable to use. Is a men‚Äôs marketed product and has a citronella scent like bugs spray but also the Belif Aqua Bomb fragrance (not the texture). 1 oz but does take a while to use up. \n* Lumin - Face Moisturizer for Dry Skin. The same as above but includes more meadow foam seed oil (second ingredient) for a somewhat thicker balm. I believe both of these are made in Korea and they do remind me of K-beauty products with the long ingredients lists full of plant extracts to match. \n\n##Balm \n* La Roche Posay - Cicaplast Balm B5. Unscented but kinda smells like white out paint. It‚Äôs a white color that takes a bit to rub in, probably because of the zinc Gluconate which I hear does have healing properties. Had madecassoside which is the chemical form of centella. 1% dimethicone is listed as skin protectant (similar to the Dollar Tree Kissable one above). Seems to have great ingredients, but is just expensive and the 1.35 oz goes by quickly for me. Looking for alternative. \n* Cerave - Healing Ointment. Lasts a long time. It‚Äôs nice, I like it. A different feel than Aquaphor but similar in its skin protectant qualities. Both of them changed temperature after a particularly hot day though (the Aquaphor became runny and he Cerave became gritty). \n* (Dollar Tree) Revitalizing Body Balm Jelly Stick. Probably meant as a dupe to the Vaseline petroleum jelly stick. Haven‚Äôt tried that one but from reviews I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs similar. This is a nice way to put petroleum jelly on nails but tends to get dirty otherwise and is sort of a bit stiff so it can take other product off. \n* (Dollar Tree) Personal Care 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly (not pictured). I got this after the jelly stick, and like how it‚Äôs softer and more spreadable for face. It‚Äôs unscented but does have a small bit of cocoa butter taste (I think they also sell a cocoa butter iteration). \n\n##Repurchase?\n* ‚úÖ I would buy these again: Gold Bond Pure Moisture, Gold Bond Retinol Overnight, Kissable Diabetics Dry Skin Relief (awesome find), Cerave Healing Ointment, and also Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair (not pictured) as a Cerave Daily Moisturizer alternative as it‚Äôs cheaper. I‚Äôll try putting the Alba Very Emollient in a hand cream tube as I think it works great for that purpose specifically. I have it in my bathroom in the meantime. \n* ‚ö™Ô∏è I‚Äôd find some alternatives for the other ones as I like to try new products and find great deals. Specifically want a La Roche posay cicaplast replacement (is Triple Paste butt cream good enough?). It‚Äôs not that I saw results, it‚Äôs just people say this is their holy grail, and I don‚Äôt think I was able to go ham on it as it cost üí≤üí≤to my budget ass. \n* ‚ùå I would avoid: Nivea Breathable and Vaseline Soothing Aloe as my skin seems sensitive to something about these two (fragrance?), especially in my skin‚Äôs current somewhat compromised state. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Then I Met You - Honey Dew Lip Mask\n\nThen I Met You is a skincare brand that has always impressed me.¬†\n\nCharlotte Cho (co-founder of Soko Glam) created Then I Met You over the course of several years...focusing on results driven formulations.¬†\n\nBack in 2018 ...the Living Cleansing Balm blew me away with its herbal/hanbang scent and really thorough yet gentle cleansing.\n\nAnd again in early 2020, The Giving Essence has become one of the most deeply hydrating products I have ever tried.\n\nNow...with fall fast approaching I have gotten the chance to try the Honey Dew Lip Mask and am so happy to have had it in my routine for the last month or so.\n\nFeaturing melon fruit extract, squalane, lactic acid, and honey...this lip mask is much more lightweight and nearly gloss-like in consistency. Not at all that I am used to from heavier lip sleeping masks.\n\nJust a tiny amount is needed to provide a really nice infusion of hydration and nourishment to the lips. I always wake up with lips that feel soft and hydrated.\n\nThat in combination with the lovely melon/honey scent makes this something I will absolutely be coming back to.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Diisostearyl Malate, Triethylhexanoin, Polyglyceryl-2, Isostearate/Dimer Dilinoleate Copolymer, Dipentaerythrityl Hexahydroxystearate/Hexastearate/Hexarosinate, Synthetic Wax, Cucumis Melo (Melon) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Squalane, Lactic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aqua (Water, Eau), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Honey Extract, Aroma/Flavor\n\nWhere To Buy ($22.00 USD - Soko Glam - 15ml): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/then-i-met-you/products/then-i-met-you-honey-dew-lip-mask](https://sokoglam.com/collections/then-i-met-you/products/then-i-met-you-honey-dew-lip-mask) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e2l3iky5vpo51.jpg?width=5472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d8f9f3bca27105c7b785066f29aa6e2c6555239",

Even their website hasn't updated the ingredients yet, but I've found the new version in a couple of stores already and finally bought it on offer for ¬£3 at Sainsbury's. The product is called 'Kind to Skin Vital Vitamin Foaming Cleanser' and the new ingredients are as follows:\n\n> Aqua, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Panthenol, Allantoin, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Glycolate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid.\n\nApologies if there are any spelling errors, I just typed it out myself. [Here are some photos of the bottle, if you're interested.](http://imgur.com/gallery/c1XPS) \n\nI had switched to Simple's gel cleanser after Boots discontinued their 'Simply Sensitive Foaming Cleanser' and wasn't really feeling it. For one, the packaging seemed to allow for condensation build up far more than a pump dispenser, and I threw it out and replaced it because of some black gunk under the lid. Secondly it still left my skin feeling somewhat tight afterwards, though I do have very dry skin. I've been trialling the new cleanser for about a week now and have no complaints whatsoever. It doesn't leave a filmy sensation, is easy to wash off without a cloth and no tightness after use! Let me know what you think. I'd like to know the pH if anyone has it.",

Not at all that I am used to from heavier lip sleeping masks.\n\nJust a tiny amount is needed to provide a really nice infusion of hydration and nourishment to the lips. I always wake up with lips that feel soft and hydrated.\n\nThat in combination with the lovely melon/honey scent makes this something I will absolutely be coming back to.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Diisostearyl Malate, Triethylhexanoin, Polyglyceryl-2, Isostearate/Dimer Dilinoleate Copolymer, Dipentaerythrityl Hexahydroxystearate/Hexastearate/Hexarosinate, Synthetic Wax, Cucumis Melo (Melon) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Squalane, Lactic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aqua (Water, Eau), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Honey Extract, Aroma/Flavor\n\nWhere To Buy ($22.00 USD - Soko Glam - 15ml): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/then-i-met-you/products/then-i-met-you-honey-dew-lip-mask](https://sokoglam.com/collections/then-i-met-you/products/then-i-met-you-honey-dew-lip-mask) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1nb6rmxupo51.jpg?width=5472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e56767c2e8ca2102c4fc2a77b0fb4978c53f9ef",

    "body": "Illdiko (from Hungary) asks.. I really love vitamin C serums, but I would like to use them properly. Do vitamin C products really need a special low pH? And what about their derivatives, like Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate and others? Which vitamin C ingredient is the best?‚Äù\n\n**What‚Äôs the deal with Vitamin C?**\n\nVitamin C is a chemical called ascorbic acid that is naturally occurring in skin. It is known to play a role in collagen production. In addition, when topically applied it is thought to help heal acne, increase the barrier function of skin to decrease moisture loss, protect from UV radiation, and prevent age spots.\n\nSounds too good to be true, huh? Well there is a downside ‚Äì it‚Äôs difficult to deliver vitamin C to skin in a form that is stable, effective and non-irritating.\n\nThere are something like 7 or 8 different forms of vitamin C that are used in cosmetics and there‚Äôs a LOT of noise out there about how the different versions work, how much to use, what kind of formula is required to deliver the ingredient, and so forth.\n\nSo, today, we‚Äôre going to try to get to the bottom of that mess by reviewing the best scientific data available on each ingredient. And we‚Äôll do that using the three Kligman questions format that we‚Äôve used before. Randy, want to describe that again for our readers?\n\n**How to prove an anti-aging ingredient works ‚Äì the Kligman questions**\n\n1. Based on the chemistry of the ingredient, is there any scientific mechanism that could explain why it would work?\n2. Does it penetrate to the part of the skin where it needs to be in order to work?\n3. Are there peer reviewed, double blind, placebo controlled studies demonstrating the ingredient really works when applied to real people?\n\nOur assessment is based primarily on a paper which reviews the technical literature on Vitamin C through 2012: ‚ÄúStability, transdermal penetration and cutaneous effects of ascorbic acid and its derivatives‚Äù from the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, 2012.\n\nLet‚Äôs start by discussion the mechanism. Remember the active form is ascorbic acid so all the derivatives must be converted to ascorbic acid on the skin.\n\n**Is there a mechanism that explains how Vitamin C works?**\n\nRemember that unlike many other anti aging ingredients, Vitamin C is naturally found in skin (mostly in the epidermis, some in the dermis) and it‚Äôs role in skin biology is well documented. For example‚Ä¶\n\n**Protecting from UV damage**\n\nAlthough vitamin C is NOT a sunscreen but it protects skin from the free radicals that are caused by UV exposure. It‚Äôs been shown to reduce lipid peroxidation, limit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, protect against apoptosis (or cell death) and to reduce redox-sensitive cell signaling. All this means that vitamin C reduces many of the nasty effects of sun exposure.\n\n**Increasing collagen to reduce wrinkles**\n\nAs you know collagen collapse is a major cause of wrinkles. Vitamin C regulates the synthesis of collagen and it does this by hydroxylating collagen which makes it more stable and improves the way it supports the epidermis.\n\n**Reducing skin pigmentation**\n\nVitamin C not only reduces melanin production but it also reduces oxidation of the melanin that is produced. It‚Äôs also thought to reverse the conversion of DOPA to o-DOPA quinone (which is a skin pigment).\n\nSo, as you can see, the effects of vitamin C in the skin are well understood. Now let‚Äôs look at the other properties of each ingredient and what kind of data is available to prove that they work.\n\n---\n\n**Ascorbic Acid (AA)**\n\n**Is it stable?** Stable at pH less than 3.5 in aqueous solution and it‚Äôs stable in anhydrous systems\n\n**Does it penetrate?** Ex vivo testing proves it penetrates as a solution or micro particles\n\n**Does it convert to Ascorbic Acid?** No conversion required.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** Yes, human in vivo testing.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** Yes, human in vivo testing.\n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** Yes, human in vivo testing.\n\nSo this ingredient is the gold standard for Vitamin C. However because it‚Äôs often used at very low pH it can be harsh to skin which has lead to the development of other versions of AA. For example‚Ä¶.\n\n---\n\n**Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (SAP)**\n\n**Is it stable?** Stable at pH 7\n\n**Does it penetrate?** There is limited ex vivo animal testing which shows it penetrates.\n\n**Does it convert to Ascorbic Acid?** There is no data showing it converts to AA.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** Yes, human in vivo testing shows is protects but less effective than AA.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** Yes, in vitro testing only and it‚Äôs less effective than MAP.\n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** Yes, human in vivo testing (but from trade journal only so the data may be less robust.)\n\n--- \n\n**Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP)**\n\n**Is it stable?**  Stable at pH 7\n\n**Does it penetrate?** Yes it penetrates, but data is limited to ex vivo animal testing.\n\n**Does it convert to Ascorbic Acid?** In vitro testing indicates it converts to AA.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** No data.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** Yes but only in vitro testing. Apparently equally as effective as AA.\n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** Yes, human in vivo testing.\n\n---\n\n**Ascorbyl Palmitate (AA-PAL)**\n\n**Is it stable?** Same stability issues as AA (requires low pH or anhydrous system.)\n\n**Does it penetrate?** In vivo animal testing shows it penetrates but it‚Äôs very dependent upon the formula.\n\n**Does it converts to Ascorbic Acid?**  No data showing that it converts.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** Yes, animal in vivo testing shows it protects from UV.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** Yes, but in vitro testing only.\n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** No data showing that it works.\n\n---\n\n**Ascorbyl Tetra-Isopalmitate (VC-IP)** *(tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate)*\n\n**Is it stable?** It‚Äôs stable at pH less than 5.\n\n**Does it penetrate?** According to a trade publication, human ex vivo testing shows it penetrates better than MAP.\n\n**Does it converts to Ascorbic Acid?** In vitro testing shows it converts to AA.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** Yes but in vitro data only.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** Yes but in vitro data only.\n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** Yes, human in vivo testing (according to trade journal.)\n\n---\n\n**Ascorbyl Glucoside (AA-2G)**\n\n**Is it stable?** Yes, stable at a range of pH.\n\n**Does it penetrate?** In vitro testing shows it penetrates.\n\n**Does it converts to Ascorbic Acid?** In vitro testing shows it converts to AA.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** Yes, human in vivo testing shows it protects but it‚Äôs less effective than SAP.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** Yes but in vitro data only.\n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** In vitro testing shows it diminishes dark spots. \n\n---\n\n**Ascorbyl 2-Phosphate 6-Palmitate (APPS)**\n\n**Is it stable?** Stable at pH 7\n\n**Does it penetrate?** In vivo animal data shows it penetrates.\n\n**Does it converts to Ascorbic Acid?** In vitro data shows it converts to AA.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** No data.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** No data.\n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** Yes, human in vivo data shows it diminishes dark spots.\n\n---\n\n**3-O-Ethyl Ascorbate (EAC)**\n\n**Is it stable?** No published data on stability.\n\n**Does it penetrate?** Ex vivo animal testing shows it penetrates better than AA-2G.\n\n**Does it converts to Ascorbic Acid?** No published data showing it converts to AA.\n\n**Protects from UV damage:** No data.\n\n**Increases collagen synthesis:** No data.  \n\n**Reduces skin pigmentation:** Human in vivo data shows it works against dark spots.\n\n---\n\n**Tip #1 for finding the best product: Ask for Ascorbic Acid**\n\nThis much is clear: of all the Vitamin C derivatives, Ascorbic Acid has the best data to prove that it really works for all three main functions. So, if possible, why wouldn‚Äôt you use AA?\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt mean that ANY product with AA on the label will be best. There are other factors at play‚Ä¶Which brings us to tip #2‚Ä¶\n\n**Tip #2 for finding the best product: Concentrate on the concentration**\n\nSo how much AA should a product contain?\n\nAccording to the Pauling Inst. the maximum skin absorption occurs at 20%. Higher concentrations actually have less absorption. Which is good since high concentrations are also more irritating.\n\nShould you go lower? Paula Begoun says that a proven range for vitamin C effectiveness is generally between 0.3% and 10%. 0.3 is a LONG way from the maximum absorption of 20% so that seems low.\n\nIf you can stand the irritation, 10% or even 15% should give better absorption.\n\n**Tip #3 for finding the best product: Watch out for water**\n\nAA can begin to oxide (which causes it to be used up) as soon as it‚Äôs dissolved in water. Look for products where water is NOT one of the first ingredients. That gives you a better chance of finding a product that will really work. That means looks for serums instead of cream based products.\n\nAlso, if water is present, look for products that use stabilizing agents ‚Äì Paula‚Äôs Choice is good for this.\n\n**Tip #4 for finding the best product: Look for low pH**\n\nAs we noted, AA is unstable above 3.5 or so. Look for low pH products. Of course pH is only meaningful if water is present so it‚Äôs less of an issue in the kinds of water free formulas we just discussed.\n\n**Tip #5 for finding the best product: Purchase proper packaging**\n\nAny Vitamin C ingredient must be properly packaged to protect it from excess light and air.\n\nLook for pump packaging (or individually sealed single use capsules) to protect from air. I would even avoid products in plastic tubes unless you know they‚Äôre used some kind of laminate to act as a barrier to oxygen transmission.\n\nAvoid clear packages to protect from light. If it‚Äôs a glass jar make it dark.\n\n**Bonus tips:**\n\nWatch out for irritation\n\nAs we said, AA can cause redness and stinging. Be prepared to switch to another type if irritation is to great. The alternative may be less effective but you‚Äôll be likely to use it more often if it‚Äôs gentle to your skin.\n\n**Don‚Äôt rush it!**\n\nAfter applying a vitamin C product you should wait a while before applying any other products.\n\nThat‚Äôs because other ingredients can trigger oxidation and if they‚Äôre applied on top of the AA before it can be absorbed into your skin it could become inactive.\n\n**The Beauty Brains bottom line**\n\nSo based on the data we‚Äôve seen, ascorbic acid is the best version of  Vitamin C to use in an anti-aging product.\n\nBut, just having ascorbic acid on the ingredient list doesn‚Äôt make a product ‚Äúthe best.‚Äù A well formulated product based on other derivatives could be better than a poorly formulated product based on ascorbic acid.\n\nYou need to keep in mind that the efficacy of any vitamin C based product depends on not only the type of Vitamin C, but also the concentration, the other ingredients in the formula and the packaging.\n\nBut following our 5 tips should help you pick a product that‚Äôs more likely to work at a price you can afford.\n\n**SOURCE:** [The Beauty Brains](http://thebeautybrains.com/2014/05/which-kind-of-vitamin-c-is-best-for-skin-the-beauty-brains-show-episode-31/)\n\n*/u/Asideofstyle, thank you for the link!*",

    "body": "Haven't seen many reviews for this brand overall, so why not? I've used this product for several months now and figured that was enough time to share my thoughts.  \n\n> **Ingredients**  \nDiisostearyl Malate, Triethylhexanoin, Polyglyceryl-2 Isostearate/ Dimer Dilinoleate Copolymer, Dipentaerythrityl Hexahydroxystearate/ Hexastearate/Hexarosinate, Synthetic Wax, Cucumis Melo (Melon) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Squalane, Lactic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aqua (Water, Eau), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Honey Extract, Aroma/Flavor.  \n  \n___  \n\nOverall inoffensive multitasking lip product. It's a lightweight nonsticky gloss. And that's what I was looking for. The lactic acid helps with mild, gentle exfoliation. It won't slough off severely dry, cracked, and peeling lips immediately. But it'll handle some mild peeling well. Very hydrating for daytime usage. Don't feel the need to reapply in the middle of the day even after it's absorbed/rubbed off, but I do it anyways because the slippery gliding sensation is very pleasant ~~and distracting~~. There's a very faint honeydew scent (which I love), but it doesn't linger. It also plays well with other lip products layered under and over it.\n\nI don't really like it as an overnight lip sleeping mask (like Laneige). It doesn't feel as occlusive and absorbs too quickly to be considered a mask. But it *does* function better as a mask when you layer Vaseline on top. Somewhat defeats the purpose though, so maybe don't do this unless you're allergic/sensitized to the ingredients of the reformulated Laneige sleeping mask (like me!). \n\nAh, the packaging. I'm not in love with it. It's in a tube with a \"hygienic silicone tip for easy, contactless application\", according to the brand's product description. Easy to squeeze, simple to apply...in theory. But it often pops or bursts randomly due to the air that comes in through the opening (where the product comes out). I'm assuming it's because the product maintains its shape, no matter how much of it you use. Not really a deal breaker to me, but it *is* mildly annoying having the product pop/bubble on you while squeezing. But I do like how easy it is to wipe off/clean excess product.   \n\nI'd probably say this is close to what I wanted Laneige's Glowy Lip Balm to be. Texture is less sticky, feels lightweight, and the scent doesn't get overbearing. (Tbh I'd actually want a product that smells like honeydew so I wouldn't mind in this case.)  \n\n**WRP**, while I get through the rest of my lip product to-buy list. It's a multitasker for lip exfoliation *and* hydration. Also helps that the size and shape isn't too clunky. Nor does it weirdly disintegrate or melt in the heat, making it an ideal travel companion. Would not suggest for sole purpose of a mask. Retails for $22 (USD) for 15mL(0.5 fl.oz) \n\n___  \n\nMiscellaneous thoughts: Purchased this product after the [announcement of UZU's Lip Treatment discontinuation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/v0c6ks/uzu_discontinuing_their_lip_products/) out of desperation. Yeah, I could have purchased more of the UZU to have something to tide myself over with, but then I'd never get around to finding a new HG. I'd be too focused on getting through all of that product before it expires. And I much prefer the freedom of not feeling obligated to finish a huge stash out of fear of expiration.  \nThis lip mask does *not* replace the void left behind by UZU's lip treatment. But UZU was its own special thing with its own special niche. Hard to replace such a unique product tbh. And this mask has its own niche as well. *And it smells better than the UZU, so I'm happy about that.* Also doesn't taste like oil, which is an added bonus.",

I've been on 0.05% Tretinoin since the end of December 2021.** I've been getting into doing a bath routine so I've been on the hunt for moisturizing masks I can add into my routine to help offset some of the irritation I've been getting from the Tretinoin.\n\nI did a quick browse at Marshalls for any hydrating wash-off mask that was from a brand I've heard of and I found the [**No7 Instant Results Nourishing Hydration Mask**](https://imgur.com/k9IKbs9)**. I skim the** [**ingredients list**](https://imgur.com/zx1iGLL)**(bottom of this post has them typed out) and see it's just got a bunch of standard hydrating ingredients in it, nothing crazy, and I like that it's in an airtight pump which is hygienic, so I purchase it.**\n\nWhen I get home **I look it up on** [**Beautypedia**](https://www.beautypedia.com/products/no7-instant-results-nourishing-hydration-mask/) **for the heck of it, and see that it has a decent rating but it does get shit on for having fragrance.** Fragrance, personally, isn't a deal breaker for me, especially with something I'm gonna wash off eventually. It notes that **petrolatum is near the top of the ingredient list, which isn't an ingredient that I've found to irritate my skin, but it is kind of weird to me to see an occlusive that high up on the ingredient list for something you're just gonna wash off.** Again, my concern here is just regarding efficacy, not that it's going to do anything detrimental.\n\nAnyway, I remove my makeup with an oil cleanser and hop into the bath and get ready to apply this mask. The most obvious thing about this mask is the swirl aesthetic of the bottle. B**eautypedia told me it mixes fine when it pumps out, and that turns out to be** [**kind of a lie**](https://imgur.com/KkuZLzO)**. While you obviously don't see all the portions as separated as they are in the bottle, even once pumped out there's a bit of a marbled look to it still.** My [photo of it](https://imgur.com/U5DWX3L) probably doesn't do it justice but hopefully you get the idea or have experienced something similar with this arbitrarily swirled products.\n\n**I'm looking at this unmixed substance in my hand not sure if I'm supposed to mix it up fully before I apply it to my face? Or is supposed to be applied in this weird suspended manner? I basically just put it on my face and rub it in a bit hoping that it kind of mixes that way.** The texture of it is **incredibly runny, almost more watery than a lotion**, but it adheres to the skin well enough that it stays on during my 20ish minute bath. I go to wash it off, thinking that warm water will do most of the work, as is the case with most hydrating mask, **and then the petrolatum shows its ass.**\n\n**It just doesn't come off. Like maybe 20% of it, the glycerin or whatever else is in there, comes off with water. But it does straight up feel like I have a layer of vaseline on my face.** I was gonna go in with my CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser to really indulge in the gentle self-care hydration vibe I was imagining this evening to be, but I know there's no way that shit is coming off with the cleanser that's basically just conditioner. I use the CeraVe Foaming Cleanser instead, which isn't like patently stripping, but isn't as soothing as the Hydrating one. **Once I get the foaming cleanser lathered up, the mask comes off for the most part.**\n\nI get out of the bath, and my skin looks incredibly dewy and smooth and hydrated. Which might be the glass skin thing people dream of, **but it also might just be a thin residue of vaseline left on my face?** Again, I'm not thinking this residue is gonna cause any problems; it's just kind of annoying and isn't really more helpful than regular slugging. I go forth with my nighttime routine, and there aren't any issues, so I go to bed, trying to ignore my ponderings about the marbled vaseline I had on my face in the bath.\n\n**The next morning, disaster.** I've been doing my current routine for a few weeks now with no issues. **This fucking mask is the only thing that's been different. Somehow I wake up with peeling dry flaky skin all over the lower half of my face, worse than any irritation I've encountered while easing onto the Tretinoin, and I can just FEEL the acne ready to pop out underneath my skin.** I don't know what's causing this issue, since normally I can tolerate slugging with vaseline fine, and I don't think the fragrance would do something this intense. But lord, just avoid this mask at all costs. **It's a bizarre experience to apply it, and it doesn't do anything helpful; in fact, it fucks everything up.**\n\n**Ingredients;**  Aqua (Water/Eau), Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Petrolatum, Butylene Glycol, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Hexyl Laurate, Magnesium Sulfate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Methylparaben, Parfum (Fragrance), Potassium Hydroxide, Ethylparaben, Sodium PCA, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Magnesium PCA, Dipropylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Ceramide 3, Manganese PCA, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide 6 II, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide 1, CI 19140 (Yellow 5), CI 14700 (Red 4).",

    "body": "\n***Please share this with anyone in need***\n\nOkay so, a long time ago I discovered a guide that was created to help lonely men with dating issues. \nI was so inspired by it, so transformed...I feel like I need to share things from it so that other's can benefit as I have.\n\nNow listen, this guide will mostly help you if you are about average looking. If you are obese/deformed, then this guide may not help much. If you live in a very small town, it may not help much. \n\nEven below average men can have success if they follow this guide pretty closely. \n\n***Here we go:***\n\nMy entire life I was a loser (age 29 now). Skinny. Pathetic. Shy. I wasn't attractive at all. I was blissfully unaware of how bad I looked, but in my mind I was a normal guy. \n(Fast forward to today, gorgeous women stare at me in public).\nAfter reading the guide that I did, I became obsessed with attraction/dating.\nThere is so much I'm going to try to cover, hopefully this helps at least one lonely man out there.\n\n\n***---->Step 1):*** Do EVERYTHING you can to look as attractive as possible. Some men will say \"I just haven't met the right girl\" or \"it'll happen someday, I'll find someone\".\nGuess what? IT....WILL.......NOT! \nYou will remain single forever unless you actually put in effort. Women won't just show up one day and ask you out. (Very rare, even for hot men).\n\nSo we've identified what to work on, now how do you accomplish this? Many ways.\n\n->(Skip over this step if you absolutely will not lift)<-\n\n***-Lift weights):***\n\n This step is so underappreciated. Guy's will read this and say \"Oh here we go! You gotta be a jock, I knew there was a catch\".\nIt's really not as bad as it sounds. Just go to the gym and lift weights 3+ times a week or so for an hour at a time. Now, if you do this....educate yourself on how to properly exercise.\n\n Exercise shouldn't be random or whatever you think you need. You need to work each muscle group individually and with varying techniques. Good diet is also key.\nYou need to go to Youtube and watch videos from the channel 'Athlean-X'. Guy named Jeff is a beast and a very competent instructor. He teaches NFL players how to get big and strong.\n\nWhen I began lifting, I started lifting milk jugs full of water in place of dumbbells. Simply did pushups for chest. Basic stuff that any guy can do.\nSo if you are intimidated about going to the gym as a non-muscular man, then I suggest you build base muscle at home first.\nYou will eventually need to go to the gym or buy your own equipment as I have. \nYou will see good results in 3 months, after 1 year you will be a completely different person. I've been lifting weights for 2.5 years now, I'm pretty huge and women love me.\n\n***-Skin care):***\n\nIt's just sad how many men don't care about their faces....some of you guys are covered in pimples. Some guys have blotchy faces with large open pores. Ghoulish dark circles under your eyes....I'm talking to you.\nYou only get one face, treat it like gold. It is what women look at when they talk to you. If your face isn't right, dating will be tougher.\n\nSolution?\n\n Listen to me, skin care products actually work. Those products that women spend tons of money on actually work. The types of products I'm going to recommend are all scientifically backed, I wouldn't suggest products that \"may work/may help\". These products produce visible results, and they physically change your skin on a molecular level. My face has been transformed after like 3 days of using these products. Pure complexion. Tighter skin. Invisible pores. Reduction in fine lines. Noticeably brighter face. (Bonus: if you quit consuming processed sugar then your face will be even further enhanced. Sugar damages the collagen in your face, there is actually a term called \"sugar face\").\nDon't be a sugar face.\n\n-Bonus): Look into chemical peels if you have significant skin issues on your face.\nTCA peels might be a good fit for you.\nOnly allow board certified dermatologists to do this to you.\n\n***-Antioxidant serums):*** \n\n They do all kinds of stuff, like brightening your face and protecting your collagen from damage. (Collagen is absurdly important for appearance, protect what you have at all costs).\nThese serums typically contain various kinds of antioxidants such as Vitamin C and Vitamin E.  Hyaluronic acid is another common ingredient. My personal recommendation is a vitamin C serum. I won't suggest specific products because this isn't a sales pitch. This is just solid advice. If you have sensitive skin, look for vitamin C derivatives such as sodium ascorbyl phosphate. L-ascorbic acid is pure vitamin C, it's the strongest but too harsh for sensitive types. \n\n***-AHA's/BHA's):***\n\nThese are facial acids. They chemically exfoliate your skin and do all sorts of wonderful things for your face. Most people use the BHA called Salicylic acid, but that's far too harsh for sensitive skin types. Try Mandelic acid instead, which is an AHA. Other options exist as well.\n\n***-Moisturizer):***\n\nWent my whole life thinking this was just lotion....it's not. After you clean your face and apply your serums or acids, you'll want to moisturize. There is an order to these things, don't just slop on products at random.\n\n~This is the order~\n\nA): Clean your face with a cleanser that your skin can tolerate. A very gentle soap can also work.\nB): Allow 10-15 mins for your face to get super dry.\nC): Apply Acid OR antioxidant serum, not at the same time. Alternate days for safety.\nD): Moisturizer is always the last step after everything else dries.\nDon't overdo things, especially the face acids. Follow instructions on all of these beauty product bottles.\n\nSome face acids/serums need to sit on your skin for 30 mins to really absorb and function best. After 30 mins, apply moisturizer.\n\n***-Sunblock):***\n\n The sun is your enemy. It makes you look old. I won't go on a 15 min walk without sunblock. (These beauty products can cause sensitivity to UV, increasing the importance of sunblock). \n\n\n\n***-Clothing):***\n\n Dress in clean clothes that fit you very well. No loose clothing. No random clothes. Your clothing should make sense. \nColors should match or compliment each other. Buy cool shoes or manly leather boots. Wear stuff like dark wash jeans, not light wash.\nTight shirts for when/if you get muscular.\nAccessories help, just 1 or two though. (Hat, watch, etc). \nYou may need to research this yourself as style is subjective. Google trendy clothes for inspiration. Dress to present masculinity.\n\n\n***-Hair):***\n\nIf you are balding really bad, just shave it. It looks bad if you can't grow a full head of hair. I shaved myself bald and have never gotten more attention from girls.\nHair style and length make a difference too, work on this. Copy someone else with hair you like.\n\nSo that's a lot of it when it comes to looks. It's all about getting as hot as possible. Takes time.\n\nNow on to...\n\n***---->Step 2): Dating profiles:***\n\nThis is the good stuff, the things that most men struggle with on dating apps.\n\nBefore I begin let me just say, I get it....you want to sleep with girls. You probably think about it nonstop. There is no instant gratification here, most women WON'T sleep with a total stranger. You gotta go on dates, develop those social skills first.\n Once you've spent enough time with a woman she will naturally grow closer to you and be more open to such things.\nRelationship first, intimacy later guys.\nWomen (almost always) want \"baby steps\", if you rush things you will fail. Take things slow and don't push if she isn't being receptive.\n\nOkay, now then:\n\n***90%*** of your dating profile is based on your ***PICTURES***. Too many guys think that what your bio says matters most, but that's ridiculous. Bio's matter, but not as much as looking great in pics.\n\n***The thing that sets you apart from successful men is something called juxtaposition. It's when you have images side by side, and each one is STRIKINGLY different than all of the others.\nWhen a woman is looking at your profile and sees 4 pictures of you sitting in your bedroom, she is gonna swipe left buddy.\n\nYou need VARIETY. You need juxtaposition.\n\nHow?\n\nYou need 6 high quality pics. Really solid, great pics.\n5 is a bare minimum, shoot for 6 though. You don't need to pay a photographer. You just gotta get inventive and be able to get those pics. You of course could pay a photographer.\nI own a $400 digital camera and know some decent photography skills. I spent 2 months taking 1000's of photos. I deleted all of them except for the required 6. That's how hard it can be to take amazing pics, but it's 100% worth it. You can use those pics across multiple dating websites. (Don't use multiple dating sites simultaneously, just don't. Quit one after you've been through all of the profiles, then start on a new dating app).\nYou'll get dates if you can pull all of this off. \n\n\n***Let's break it down further:***\n\nThe first pic a woman see's on your profile should be your highest rated pic. Your hottest pic.\n\nYou need (2) pictures where you look sexy. This is undoubtedly the hardest thing to pull off in pics.\nDress manly, don't smile at the camera. You will have other pics where you are smiling. Sexy men aren't smiling in pics. (At least, not an obvious/dopey smile...a mild smirk can be okay).\nLook at the comments below, someone asked me what to do for sexy pics and I explained it clearly.\n\nYou need at least (1) funny picture. It's okay to smile in these. You need (2) funny pictures if you naturally look very masculine/androgynous.\nWarning: Don't look like a total clown. Funny pic doesn't mean make the pic as outrageous as possible. Should be tasteful and legitimately funny.\nGood example, I have a funny pic of myself holding a banana phone. Simplistic but it is an incredible photo that makes me look funny + attractive.\n\nYou will need (1) plain pic, of your blank face looking at the camera. Don't look awkward, just neutral. No dopey smile. Mostly focused on face and upper torso/shoulders. You can tilt your head at a very slight angle. She wants to know what you look like naturally, without alteration. No special effects.\nDon't appear as intense/crazy.\n\nYou will need at least (1) outdoorsy pic. Something physical or sporty maybe. Hiking, kayaking, etc...\nIf you can't pull that off, just be outside near something cool. Women want to know you leave the house.\n\nYou should also have (1-2) 'edgy' pics. \n(1) if you look masculine.\n(2) if you are small and timid looking.\nEdgy is kinda confusing. It's like being a \"bad boy\", but not lame. It's generally darker styles/colors of clothes. \nLots of guys take edgy pics, and then use a black & white filter on them. It creates a dark/mysterious vibe. Google image search 'edgy guys' or 'edgy clothes' for inspiration.\n\n***-Photography Tips):***\n\n***-Best tip ever, use NATURAL lighting. Period.***\n      Don't you dare let light bulbs be your light source.\n\n-FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ARE VITAL, you could end up with an amazing shot...but it's ruined because you have a bad expression. Smiley in fun pics, guilty/edgy in sexy pics.\n\n-Utitlize basic editing for all pics (not photoshop).\n-Shoot from many different angles.\n-Do not shoot in direct sunlight. Use indirect light. (stand in the shade on sunny days, or near an open window when indoors. Don't let direct sunlight come through the window and touch your face, adjust the blinds so that it's just a really bright room).\n-Backgrounds are really important.\n-If it looks posed/lame, delete it.\n-You don't need pics of friends to date.\n\n\n\nYour pictures need to look CANDID. NATURAL. NOT FAKE. With the exception of your blank faced pic/funny pics, your pics shouldn't look posed. \nA picture of your face at one angle can look dramatically different from another angle.....photography is tricky. You need to take many photos at different angles, different light levels, different backgrounds. \nIf I took a random selfie right now, I would look terrible. Good candid photos are in fact actually planned. When you look at a photo that seems like it \"just kinda happened\", you can bet they took that photo 50+ times. \n\n**Another user pointed this out, It's worth repeating:\n-No bathroom selfies, -No pics involving anyone's kids, -No pics of women at all, -No shirtless pics unless you have crazy low body fat/lean, -No sunglasses ideally.\n\nTake your best pics and run them through a safe website called 'photofeeler'. It's a way to get women to rate your pics, this way you know for sure if that 'awesome pic' you just took is actually awesome....or incredibly creepy. Your best pics should ideally be getting ratings of 7/10 out of 40+ women voters.\nThese ratings are more for your unique/cool pics. Women probably won't rate your plain photo as a 7+ unless you are really hot.\n\n***-Bio):***\n\nYour bio/self summary on dating websites is important but not that important.\nWhat you write can definitely kill all of your potential matches.\nIt shouldn't be super crazy long, but it's better to be longer than too short.\nMention hobbies, stuff you're into, values, etc.\n\nWomen want to get to know you IN PERSON. Don't list your flaws in the bio, put your best foot forward. It's not lying if you simply don't mention stuff. I don't condone lying, I'm not suggesting anyone lies. Be honest, but don't write stuff in your profile like....\n\n\"Hi I'm Kevin, I'm an introvert. I like to go on walks and play videos games. 420 friendly. I'm just looking for a nice girl to go out with, I'm a real nice guy.\"\n\nSee what I mean? Don't act/be like Kevin.\n\n***-Tip)***: Being nice isn't special. Most men are nice on dates. Being nice doesn't make you stand out.\nYou should be nice to women, but don't call yourself nice. It's especially important that you never say \"I'm a nice guy\" in person or online.\n\n***-Cool Tip)***: When sending messages to women on any dating app, match her texting style. If she uses proper grammar & punctuation, do the same.\nIf she is sloppy with punctuation, don't you go using proper punctuation....you will look nerdy in a bad way.\n\nDo not \"get to know women online first\".\nDON'T....DO....IT.\nChat with them, get their phone numbers within 5 messages roughly. You shouldn't be sending long messages. Women are on dating apps to give out their phone number, it's not unusual to ask for it. \nInitiate in a funny/clever way, then steer the conversation towards getting her number. \nDiscuss meeting for a coffee or lunch date soon. If she's not chatting anymore then move on, she's not into you. \n\nDating apps are programmed to punish you if they notice patterns. Don't swipe right on every profile. Only swipe right if you know for sure you are physically attracted to them.\nDon't send out too many messages per day, you can be punished this way too.\n\n***-Crucial, Obvious Tip):***  Bathe before a date, smell good.\n\n***-Pro tip):*** Your very first date should just be a casual meetup for 30mins-45mins. Let her know it's a no-pressure date at a cafe for half an hour. This will likely relax her, now she knows you won't be too forward or pushy on the date. It really should be a cafe because it's casual and if you guys don't have chemistry then it's not a big deal. You will feel lame if you take a girl out to fine dining on the 1st date and it doesn't work out. Once it's been 30-45mins, say \"oh look at the time, that went fast. I really should get going, I gotta go do (blank). I had a good time talking to you and I'd like to see you again.\"\n\nDo not try to kiss her goodbye.... save that for the end of the second date. A brief hug is okay (if she seems comfortable). You may want to wait a few days before you contact her again to set up a second date. (Unless she begins texting you, then you should call her up & set up the next date in a day or two).\n\nThis should help lots of guys get much closer to having a girlfriend.\n\n*Keep in mind, failure is inevitable. Say what?!?!\nMost people are not very good when they start something new, including entering the dating scene.\nYou will lose some women during this process, it's almost bound to happen. You will get better though if you keep going on dates.\n\nGive yourself permission to suck at life....\nIt's okay :)\n\n***Warning:*** This guide has been taken down before for reasons unbeknownst to me. Copy it, save it.\nI may post this guide again at times to benefit more men.",

Even with that, L-AA will start oxidizing fairly quickly, so it wouldn't be a bad idea to just make it weekly. \n\nBe careful with using citrus oils in skincare. They contain compounds that are phototoxic and you will get sunburned so much faster. They're also highly concentrated, so you'd have to make like an ounce of product per 1 drop of oil.

It made me self-conscious about how other people perceive me, especially the girls.\n\n\nSo I recently got really fed up with it all and decided to try my up-most best to look as good as possible which eventually led me here :)\n\n\nMy request is if you could critique the way I look and give some recommendations on how I could improve my overall appearance.\n\n\nA couple of things I particularly don't like are the blue-insh under eye circles which are especially prominent in the first picture and it's the closest to how I actually look like in real life. And I've had them pretty since being a kid. Can I do anything about them? I assume since they're not caused by Hyperpigmentation (ok I actually have just a little bit) my only option is some lazer treatment. If yes, could someone recommend one and state if it's effective and safe.\n\n\nJust overall, I think my eyes are my weak area due to making me look tired, the skin's odd and darker color compared to the rest of my face and the fine lines under them.\n\n\nAnother thing I hate is the skin redness I have from the acne. It can be seen from the pictures but the redness is actually worse than it appears to be here.\n\n\nI was also thinking about my face's fat level - I think that if I lose some weight and have a well defined jawline, thus reducing the volume of my cheeks I'd actually look a lot better. What do you think about that?\n\n\nI believe my skin is normal with oily T-zone.\nMy routine so far:\n\n\nAM:\n\n- Cleanse with Cetaphil\n\n- Apply once La Roche-Posay Anthelios XL Ultra-light 50+ fluid (and not reapply since it's entirely photostable)\n\nPM:\n\n- Cleanse with Cetaphil\n\n- Exfoliate with Nip+Fab Glycolic serum at 4%\n\n- (Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate) Vitamin C 20% serum\n\nSpot treatment:\n\n- Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5% in Neutrogena On-The-Spot acne treatment\n- Ketoconazole 2% cream for the redness around the sides of my nose\n\n\nI was thinking of picking up a Salicylic acid exfoliant to help me minimise the acne, use a higher % Glycolic acid (something like 8-12%) and also Azelaic acid for reducing the redness (which I believe is Post inflammatory erythema).",

I started off with Retin-A but now I use Tazorac. The up front costs can be $$ but one tube lasts a long time. However, any retinoid cream will make it worse before it gets better. You also want to use it all over your face, and not as a spot treatment. If you can get through the first 3 months, you will be amazed at the change in your skin!

Have you tried using a brightening concealer under your eyes? I find this makes a huge difference with the appearance of dark circles, just make sure it's brightening as I find matte concealers enhance wrinkles significantly. This would be a lot cheaper than lazer treatment and might solve our problem for you!\n\nAnother thing I noticed was a lack of moisturizer in your routine, with the amount of serums you're using you should really be trying to balance this with a moisturizer. I find my skin tends to appear redder if I'm using chemical exfoliants and not adequately compensating. I personally recommend either Cerave moisturizing cream or the lotion depending on how lightweight you prefer creams. \n\nI just ordered my first tub of Benton Snail High Content Essence (thanks /r/AsianBeauty!), which I have heard is effective at reducing redness, i'll see how that goes. \n\nOverall though, I think you have a good base of a routine going, it looks like your skin has improved a lot between the last two pictures! I would just be way of adding too many chemical exfoliants to your routine as you might be stressing out your skin a bit too much.",

Exfoliants are pretty harsh on skin. They're mainly to scratch off old skin that's getting in the way of the younger beneath it that needs to breathe. I used to exfoliate a lot when I was in my teens. I thought it was awesome because I thought it was scratching off all my acne and getting rid of it. In the end it made my acne angry and flare up worse. It wasn't until this year -or the year before that- I learned that I was seriously screwing up my skin and was taught moisture without greasy-ness is key.\n\nMy skin type is combination/dry: Flaky skin, reacts poorly to oil strippers, easily reddened, somewhat sensitive (I think the years of exfoliating made it stronger lol)\n\nHope this helped! :)\nEDIT: my horrible spelling",

    "body": "So recently - as some of you may have noticed - there has been a bunch of actives (especially Vitamin C serums) popping up on Amazon with basically the same ingredients. That's because they buy from a wholesaler and just repackage the product. The wholesaler in question is commonly RainshadowLabs, and you can buy the product direct from them in 2oz bottles (~56ml) for much cheaper (~$4) than the repackaged Amazon equivalents. \n\nI ordered 4 sample bottles from them. If it's your first order you get 3 samples free which was nice of them, but they don't advertise it. They contacted me a few days after ordering letting me know they discounted the amount charged to me. One thing people might not like is that they don't give a shipping cost outright, once you've ordered they process it and apply the shipping to your card after, so you sort of have to pay an unknown amount. I ended up paying ~$25 for 4 sample bottles to the UK, so I think shipping is okay, but probably a lot cheaper for US purchases. \n\nI contacted them about the pH of a couple of their products I was interested in (I would have asked for more for this sub in hindsight but these were the only ones I wanted so I only asked for these three), and though it took them a little while to get back to me, they were very open about the information. So here it is:\n\n[**VITAMIN C SERUM**](http://www.rainshadowlabs.com/QVSC-Vitamin-C-Serum-72-organic_p_1111.html)\n\nComes in 18% or 20%\n\nVitamin C: Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate\n\npH: 7.9\n\n*18% Ingredients:* Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel), Carbomer, (2s)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.\n\n*20% Ingredients:* Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel), d-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Carbomer, (2s)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic Acid, Ferulic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin. \n\n[**RETINOL SERUM**](http://www.rainshadowlabs.com/ARRSARRSI-Retinol-Serum-72-organic-_p_639.html)\n\nComes in 1% or 2.5%\n\nUses retinol, not a weaker derivative. \n\npH: 5.7\n\n*Ingredients:* Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel), Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Triticum Vulgare (Wheat Germ Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), Wildcrafted Resina Propoli (Propolis), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.\n\n[**RETINOL MOISTURISER**](http://www.rainshadowlabs.com/LORLORI-Retinol-Moisturizer-71-organic-whole-foods-_p_1019.html)\n\nComes in 1% or 2.5%\n\nUses retinol, not a weaker derivative. \n\npH: 6.1\n\n*Ingredients:* Organic Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera), Organic Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower Oil), Isopropyl Palmitate (Palm Oil),  Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Tocopheryl (Vitamin E), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Glyceryl Stearate,Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Wildcrafted Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), Wildcrafted Resina Propoli (Propolis), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter),  Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid.\n\nFinal note: I am not affiliated with RainshadowLabs in any way, I just have been hearing murmurings about them in this sub so I thought I'd share some information for anyone else curious.

    "body": "If you‚Äôre anything like me, you‚Äôve probably seen [**Truskin Vitamin C Serum**](https://amazon.com/dp/B01M4MCUAF) pop up everywhere, whether on amazon or Instagram.\n\nI‚Äôve tried my fair share of skincare products, and I‚Äôm always looking for that one magic serum that can actually do what it promises. So, I took the plunge and tested this popular serum every morning for three weeks. Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs not all hype.\n\n# First Impressions: The Good and the Meh\n\nWhen I first opened the **TruSkin Vitamin C Serum**, I wasn‚Äôt immediately sold. \n\nThe packaging is basic‚Äînothing fancy, but I care more about what‚Äôs inside. The serum itself is a clear, slightly watery liquid with a mild citrus scent. Not bad, but not amazing either. It‚Äôs lightweight and absorbs quickly, which is always a plus when you‚Äôre layering other skincare products.\n\n# Week 1: Nothing Dramatic, But a Glimmer of Hope\n\nDuring the first week, I didn‚Äôt notice much difference, and I‚Äôll be honest, I was tempted to stop using it. But I stuck with it because skincare is all about the long game, right? After the first few days, my skin felt a bit smoother, but nothing to write home about. I was using about three drops each morning and following it up with a moisturizer and SPF (always wear sunscreen with vitamin C products).\n\n# Week 2: A Subtle Shift\n\nBy week two, things started to change. My skin looked a little brighter, and I noticed that my dark spots were starting to fade‚Äînothing drastic, but they weren‚Äôt as prominent as before. The serum was easy to integrate into my routine, and I didn‚Äôt experience any breakouts or irritation, which is a win since I have sensitive skin. I did start to notice that my skin felt more hydrated throughout the day, even though the serum itself isn‚Äôt marketed as a heavy hydrator.\n\n# Week 3: The Results You‚Äôve Been Waiting For\n\nBy the end of the third week, I could see a noticeable difference in my skin‚Äôs overall tone. My dark spots were still there but lighter, and my skin had a healthy glow that wasn‚Äôt there before. Was it life-changing? No. But it was definitely a solid improvement, and my skin looked fresher, smoother, and more even.\n\n# The Honest Pros and Cons\n\nLike with any product, there were highs and lows. Here‚Äôs what stood out:\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* **Brightens Skin:** My skin definitely looked more radiant by the end of week three. It‚Äôs subtle but noticeable.\n* **Non-Irritating:** Even with daily use, the **TruSkin Vitamin C Serum** didn‚Äôt irritate my skin, which is a big deal for me.\n* **Lightweight Formula:** It‚Äôs easy to apply and layers well with other skincare products.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* **Takes Time:** If you‚Äôre expecting overnight results, this isn‚Äôt the serum for you. It takes at least a couple of weeks to see any noticeable changes.\n* **Not a Miracle for Dark Spots:** While my dark spots faded slightly, they didn‚Äôt completely disappear. If hyperpigmentation is your biggest concern, you might need something stronger.\n* **Mild Scent:** The citrus scent wasn‚Äôt overwhelming, but it‚Äôs something to consider if you‚Äôre sensitive to smells.\n\n# What‚Äôs Unique About This Vitamin C Serum?\n\nI‚Äôve tried several vitamin C serums over the years, and what makes the **TruSkin Vitamin C Serum** different is its gentle formula. Most vitamin C serums use L-ascorbic acid, which can be irritating, but this one uses sodium ascorbyl phosphate, a more stable and less irritating form of vitamin C. That‚Äôs probably why I didn‚Äôt experience any redness or irritation, even with daily use.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is the price. For under $25, you‚Äôre getting a solid product that delivers results without breaking the bank. I‚Äôve paid way more for serums that didn‚Äôt do half as much.\n\n# Final Verdict: Is It Worth Trying?\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a budget-friendly vitamin C serum that can brighten your skin and reduce the appearance of dark spots over time, the **Truskin Vitamin C Serum** is worth a shot. It‚Äôs not a miracle worker, but it‚Äôs a solid, effective product that delivers gradual, real results without any harsh side effects.\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes, but with a caveat‚Äîbe patient. This isn‚Äôt an instant fix, but if you stick with it, you‚Äôll see your skin improve over time.\n\n# My Tips for Best Results\n\n1. **Consistency is Key:** Don‚Äôt skip days. Use the serum every morning for at least three weeks to see noticeable results.\n2. **Pair with Sunscreen:** Always use SPF after applying the serum to protect your skin and enhance the brightening effects.\n3. **Don‚Äôt Overdo It:** Three to five drops is plenty. Using more won‚Äôt give you faster results and could cause irritation.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe [**TruSkin Vitamin C Serum**](https://amazon.com/dp/B01M4MCUAF) is a solid addition to any skincare routine if you‚Äôre looking for gradual improvement in brightness, texture, and tone. It‚Äôs not an overnight miracle, but it does deliver subtle yet noticeable changes after a few weeks of consistent use. I‚Äôm glad I gave it a chance, and I‚Äôll likely keep it in my rotation for a while.\n\n# Affiliate Disclosure:\n\n*This article contains affiliate links.

Currently I'm using Hylamide C25 and it's wonderful but for my next option I'm deciding on going the SAP Vit C route to double on the benefits since I'm acne-prone as well. Since TO surprisingly doesn't make a SAP Vit C serum (but yet they have basically every other derivative out there), I have to rely on other brands for this serum.\n\nI did research and found Mad Hippie's, it looks promising and I know it's already a cult favourite. I'm kinda iffy though because it equates to $50 CAD which is bordering on a luxury serum. I would try that but I want to just try a cheaper SAP Vit C serum to test the active on my skin first. I also found SkinSo's serum, which is 20% SAP and really good ingredients as well but it's also fairly expensive and looks like it's sold out all the time/discontinued? Not sure with their website always being finicky as it's a startup.\n\nAny recommendations?",

They said occlusivity measures how well an ingredient keeps water from evaporating out of the skin (usually by being hydrophobic) but isn't really correlated with how well it prevents actives from penetrating into the skin as long as what you want to absorb is oil soluble. Alcohol is, and my sunscreen has a bunch of that, so I think I'm good!**",

    "body": "Note/TLDR: Sorry if the title triggers you especially if Vitamin C serums have done wonders for your skin. I don‚Äôt intend to antagonize Vitamin C, I did enjoy using the TO Vit. C 23% since it did make my skin glow but the acne I got from it made me question if there were people who reacted badly to Vit. C. There are comments on various posts here on ScA that say they reacted badly to it but there‚Äôs not much discussion. \n\nThe Oumere article below claims Vit. C could actually be bad for the skin (if applied topically because of it‚Äôs pro-oxidant nature). I‚Äôm still skeptical and haven‚Äôt completely given up on Vit. C yet, but I wanted to know people‚Äôs experiences with it especially if they had a bad reaction. Hopefully, discussions can be initiated to provide more insights regarding this! :)\n\n‚Äî\n\nHi guys! I‚Äôve been an ScA lurker since getting into skincare late last year (and so much grateful for all that I‚Äôve learned and discovered here!). Most of the time, I‚Äôve come across posts saying how Vitamin C has improved their skin. I‚Äôm dealing with acne now and wanted to find ways to help with the scarring and thought that Vitamin C could be helpful in this regard (plus it has other benefits too). I bought TO‚Äôs Vitamin C 23% + HA and saw that it was doing a good job of brightening my skin and maybe helping with my acne scars. I‚Äôm almost a month into using the Vit. C 23% (2-3x a week) but the following day every after I put it on, I would get red pustules or acne and sometimes both. (Even on my neck, when it never reacts badly to any product.) This would lead me back to dealing with acne all over again. \n\nI wanted to know if it was the Vit. C itself that caused this, and I encountered this article dated just last December 23, 2018 from a biologist that says concentrated forms of antioxidants especially Vitamin C actually leads to bacterial infection and cause acne:\n\n[How Vitamin C Serums Cause Acne in Healthy Skin](https://www.oumere.com/blog/2018/12/23/how-vitamin-c-serums-cause-acne-in-healthy-skin)\n\nWhat do you think about it? Has anyone reacted badly from using Vitamin C serums or perhaps any other serums with concentrated forms of antioxidant (EUK, Reservatol, Ferulic Acid, etc.) regardless of what brand or product? Or if not, do you think you have other products or ingredients in your skincare that may actually counter Vit. C or other antioxidants‚Äô side effects?\n\nThank you! :)\n\nP. S. I‚Äôve also encountered SimpleSkincareScience‚Äôs [Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate: EVERYTHING You Need to Know!](https://simpleskincarescience.com/sodium-ascorbyl-phosphate/) saying that Sodium Ascrobyl Phosphate is a stable Vitamin C derivate that‚Äôs antimicrobial and helps with acne and this might be the thing that falls in the middle of Vitamin C being good or bad for acne. But I‚Äôm yet to find such product readily available in my country.\n\n‚Äî\nEdit: Added a note and clarified the purpose of the post (to stimulate discussion).",

        "body": "vitamin C serums/products are all formulated differently with different ingredients any one or multiple of which might cause acne for some people like any other product(tocopherol can cause acne for me for example and is often included in C serums because it works so well with it but it could be any ingredient for anyone). I wouldn't jump to thinking the ascorbic acid in your product caused you problems when there are many other ingredients in there that might have been the culprit. That is a mistake people frequently make with whatever the starring ingredient in a product is, forgetting that just because you bought the product for that ingredient doesn't mean the other ones in there can't do anything to you.\n\nThe fact that that writer states for a fact that they know why *every* C product broke every person that wrote them out and it is this theory that they made up goes to show you shouldn't trust them. They know for a fact that not one of those people simply had a sensitivity to another ingredient in the formula? They made a lot of statements in that article based on nothing more than their own hunches. They went from too much injected vitamin B might cause acne=vitamin C serums don't have enough C in them to do anything=C serums are harmful because they contain too much vitamin C...what?\n*edit this title didn't trigger me op, we were having discussions about it! It is kind of annoying when posts get changed because responses make less sense though.\n\nDon't trust people making statements like that just because they use sciency sounding words or links.",

You read [here}(https://www.glowrecipe.com/products/make-prem-blue-ray-sun-gel).   It has chia seed and niacinamide and can be used as a primer. \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Homosalate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Propanediol, Niacinamide, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Pentylene Glycol, Salvia Hispanica Seed Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Fragrance, Glyceryl Caprylate, Fructooligosaccharides, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Pullulan, Adenosine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betula Alba Juice, Dipropylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Xylitylglucoside, Sodium Palmitoyl Proline, Rubus Arcticus Callus Extract, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Nymphaea Alba Flower Extract, Glycerin, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Glucose, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Alcohol, Lecithin, Sodium Dilauramidoglutamide Lysine, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Phytosterols, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Lysolecithin, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n**Comments:** This brand is very popular for the zinc versions and the this chemical version as well.  It goes on beautifully like a gel.  It just glides on.  Not really sticky or anything.  Dries down well fast creates a nice base for makeup.  But I did notice a good deal of shine on my forehead, but  I did use a good bit of moisturize, as it's less moisturzing than what I normally use.  It was quite wearable with makeup.  I think people would like the texture.  As for cooling, I did feel a subtle cooling when I was out in the heat one day and testing it on my neck and chest. Not sure how it keeping your skin cool really protects it, but if you skin gets hot and irritated you might like the effect. It's subtle. I had to look for it. \n\n  This was a fail for me ,but it's not for dry skin.  It said moisturizing and refreshing.  I knew it was a gel so not going to be super moisturizing. It's not so drying it but i hate the feel of anything mattifying   It does have a scent that doesn't go away.  It smells sort of like fake citrus (a bit like Biore mixed with a floor cleanser).  Not strong but I did keep noticing it.   It  didn't cause redness or stinging. I just wanted it off my skin, because it felt weird. Might be the one of the extracts or some other made me slightly sensitive.  \n\nI see now it's for combo or oily skin really.  I do think it would work well for someone oily or with combo skin.  It's gotten some decent reviews. It's different and a nice texture. ",

That's because they buy from a wholesaler and just repackage the product. The wholesaler in question is commonly RainshadowLabs, and you can buy the product direct from them in 2oz bottles (~56ml) for much cheaper than the repackaged Amazon equivalents. \n\nI ordered 4 sample bottles from them. If it's your first order you get 3 samples free which was nice of them, but they don't advertise it. They contacted me a few days after ordering letting me know they discounted the price charged to me. One thing people might not like is that they don't give a shipping cost outright, once you've ordered they process it and apply the shipping to your card after, so you sort of have to pay an unknown amount. I ended up paying ~$25 for 4 sample bottles to the UK, so I think shipping is okay, but probably a lot cheaper for US purchases. \n\nI contacted them about the pH of a couple of their products I was interested in (I would have asked for more for this sub in hindsight but these were the only ones I wanted so I only asked for these three), and though it took them a little while to get back to me, they were very open about the information.

Absorbs easily.\n\nI also got the \"Ultra Lifted Night Treatment\" which has a small percentage of retinol and is EXTREMELY thick.. so thick that I realized it would probably make a good eye cream.  I've been using it around my eyes for about a week now and surprisingly, no issues with redness or sensitivity.  I'm going to keep using it to see if it works any magic on my fine lines.\n\nI also got turmeric essential oil (seems to help as a spot treatment), geranium cleansing oil (nice, doesn't break me out, but doesn't contain any emulsifiers), and the \"Extreme Antioxidant Masque\" which has 5% glycolic, I think, and seems to be a fairly gentle, nice exfoliator.\n\nShipping in the US is really reasonable.

Also if some ingredients are in the wrong category please just let me know and i will correct it. Basically i just wanted to start out because i find a blank page to be harder to work with than correcting something wrong and i hope you feel that way too. Like maybe reading the ingredients makes you remember another ingredient, common misconception etc):\n\nVery reliable\n- niacinamide 1-5%\n- panthenol 1-5% (dunno about higher %) \n- urea 1-30% (5 and up is ezfoliating and above 5 is not recommended for face) \n- green tea constituents (no idea about %) \n- sunscreen spf 30 and up is recommended but spf 50+ is much better\n- petrolatum (very occlusive unknow concentration) \n- benzoyl peroxide\n-salicylic acid/bha\n- glycolic acid (aha) \n- lactic acid (aha) \n- hyaluronic acid (1%)\n- copper peptides (unknown % but low enough dalton to penetrate skin well) \n- hydroquinone (%?) \n- oat (not sure specifically what kind)\n- glycerin\n- sulfur (for acne and rocasea) \n- azelaic acid (15-20%)\n- tretinoin\n- Madecassoside \n\n\nReliable\n-retinol \n- bifida ferment lysate (10% and up for reducing sensitivity and dryness)  \n- other typed of acid (lha, pha, mandelic acid,) \n- ceramides (unknow effective concentration) \n- polyglutmic acid (% dunno) \n- laa (l ascorbic acid 5-20%)\n- tocopherol (vitamin e) for stabalising and boosting laa formulas\n- ferulic acid\n-resveratrol\n-super oxide dismutase\n- green tea polyphenols\n- genistein\n-lycopene\n-idebenone\n- euk\n- catalase\n- glutathione peroxidase\n-coenzyme q10 (ubiquenone) \n- supplementing hyaluronic acid\n- supplementing collagen\n- matrixel complex (5% and up to?) \n- licorice root and active constituents \n- sodium ascorbyl phosphate (for acne) \n-honey\n-shea butter\n-safflower oil\n-sunflower oil\n- silicone (lighter weight alternative to petrolatum but less occlusive) \n\n\n\nLess reliable\n- retinal\n- topical tranexamic acid (more research on taking it oraly) \n- bakuchiol\n- other peptides \n- squalane (contradicting findings on whther it is good - again plz correct me if im wrong) \n- clay for acne/oily skin\n\n\nPromising (not the focus of this post but i don't mind adding more) \n- ginseng\n- snail\n- heartleaf \n- algee \n- granactive retenoids\n- Tocopherol (not used for the purpose of stabalising other better antioxidants) \n\nI know some things i wrote are probably WAY off but again i just wanted to get started. Also i havent added a lot to the promising because that is not the category that intrests me the most so i haven't look into it that much. I do plan on organising and updating the post as i get more comments and info but for now i have hopefully listed most of the most of the ingredients that are throughly backed by reascearch. \nPs english is my second laguage so excuse my spelling, i will correct as i update the post.",

Tretinoin has the highest supporting data  for anti aging but the rest of them are very likely to be on par. \n\nVitamin E is not desirable generally. The risk profile outweighs the potential benefits and it's not great as anything besides as an antioxidant to stabilize formulations with something like vit c or SPF where it is very helpful inside those formualtions at specific ratios  which the manufacturer should be including it at  \n\nIn general you should aim for SPF 50+. \n\nThrow clay masks in the garbage. They're very high risk for no benefit. Just use cleansing oils if you want that effect in a safe and healthy way. \n\nCentella (specifically the component called madecassoside) is big reliable.\n\nSqualane is very good. Hemisqualane is lighter if you desire that.\n\nIf you want more info about ceramide concentration you can look up \"Ceramides golden ratio\" and you'll find it  \n\nTranexamic acid for the purpose of hyperpigmentation is üëç the studies are more on oral tranexamic but topical is really effective.

It says that there is also retinol, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid in it. It doesn't tell you the percentage of vitamin C or anything else in it, however vitamin C in the sodium ascorbyl phosphate form is the second ingredient so I'm assuming it's a pretty high percentage. I have no valid reason to change my brand up, it's just seeing all these great things being said about Timeless that makes me feel like I should try something different. I've also seen that Dr Brenner's vitamin C is great and comparable to Timeless. Which one of those two do you think is better? The Doctor Brenner one is 20% vitamin C and I was looking at the 20% one for timeless too. Hope to hear some thoughts!",

Finally, the ingredient list I saw online was fragrance- and oil-free.\n\nUnfortunately, the reality wasn't the case... After reformulation, now it contains almond oil (Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil) which contributes to comedgenicity and quite a strong smell which lingers. Moreover, the serum is very sticky and hard to layer. Right after application, as soon as it dried down, I have a feeling like a slightly tight film is formed on my face, which starts pilling in combination with more than 1 product.\n\nAll in all, I definitely do not recommend it. However, I would give it two stars out of five because I ended up using it on my arms for keratosis pilaris and it seem to be helping a bit due to a good concentration of Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate.\n\n**Old formulation:**  \nAQUA (WATER), SODIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE (VITAMIN C), CITRIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE  \n  \n**New formulation:**  \nWater, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Glycerin, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tyfvpwa9jj4d1.png?width=416&format=png&auto=webp&s=433ae72c01c5bebca5f077a1b7d1814e74228de8\n\n",

Currently we use phenoxyethanol in our products (Line of anti-aging serums/creams including Vitamin C, Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid products). We are aware that it pheno is somewhat frowned upon, but the current alternative we've found is Sodium Benzoate. The issue there is it's reaction with Vitamin C. It appears this is highly debated whether or not it generates enough Benzene to matter - but public perception and the amount of blog articles out there is tough to compete against. \n\nWe've found a couple formulas of a competitor that doesn't use either, but we don't completely understand how this works. Here is an example of a Vitamin C Serum without Phenoxyethanol or Sodium Benzoate : \n\nAqua, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Betaine, Propanediol, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Arginine, Aspartic Acid , PCA, Glycine, Alanine, Serine, Valine, Proline, Threonine, Isoleucine, Histidine, Phenylalanine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Acmella Oleracea Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol \n\nAny ideas/thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

They claim the vitamin C in antioxidant serums needs to be pure L-Ascorbic Acid in order to be effective. \n\nI've read a couple of articles about tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, and those sources claim that it's a great alternative to LAA because it's better for sensitive skin, it's oil soluble (instead of water soluble) and penetrates much more deeply into the skin. \n\nThe Mad Hippie Vitamin C serum uses another derivative- sodium ascorbyl phosphate as its form of vitamin C, which is also supposed to be a gentler form. I don't know why this product would have so many rave reviews if LAA is the only effective form.\n\nIf anyone has any knowledge on vitamin C derivatives VS. pure LAA I would super appreciate it ! ",

I have never found a cleanser or serum that actually make a visible difference with regular use in a couple months. I couldn't imagine using anything else at this point, I'm 28. The Vitamin C Ester Brightening line specifically... the cleanser makes my skin super soft and cleans better than anything. I would actually write to the company if they ever discontinued this line.\n\nAccording to Perricone: A more potent, highly stable and less irritating form of antioxidant-rich Vitamin C, Vitamin C Ester gives the appearance of collagen-rich skin by visibly smoothing, brightening and minimizing discoloration over time. Unlike traditional Vitamin C, Vitamin C Ester is fat-soluble and easily absorbable for maximum antioxidant benefits.\n\nIngredients\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau,Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Caprylyl Methicone, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Behenyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Squalane, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Ferulic Acid, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polysorbate 20, Xanthan Gum, Beta-Glucan, Fragrance/Parfum, Sorbitol, Limonene, Stearyl Glycyrrhetinate, Disodium EDTA, Elaeis Guineensis (Palm) Oil, Tocotrienols, Linalool, Tocopherol, Citral, Citronellol.\n\nI just love that the cleanser and serum have the Vitamin C, Squalane, Ferulic and Hyaluronic...

The Timeless 20% Vitamin C is a good one.\n\nI'd also recommend switching to a stronger sunscreen.  3% zinc oxide and 3% titanium dioxide is quite low, even if it is SPF 30.  You want strong UVA protection.  That's going to be your #1 defense against wrinkles.\n\nNiacinamide could be an easy thing to add to your routine.  It's in CeraVe PM (if you want to switch from the Trader Joe's one) or The Ordinary sells a 10% niacinamide serum.\n\nYou could also switch the retinol to tretinoin (the prescription strength version).  My sebaceous filaments went away with tretinoin, plus it's the gold standard for anti-aging.   You can get plain tretinoin from a doctor, or a compounded tretinoin cream with 4% niacinamide from Yoderm or Curology.\n\nSounds like you're off to a good start though!",

        "body": "When choosing a type of Vitamin C serum for treating acne, it's important to consider both the effectiveness of the form and its suitability for acne-prone skin, which can often be sensitive or easily irritated. Here are some of the best types of Vitamin C for treating acne:\n\n1. Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (SAP)\n\nEffectiveness: SAP (water-soluble form of Vitamin C) is highly effective for acne-prone skin due to its stability and gentleness. It is known to help reduce acne lesions and inflammation. SAP is converted to ascorbic acid after it penetrates the skin, providing antioxidant protection and skin-brightening effects.\n\nWhy It‚Äôs Good for Acne: SAP has been shown to have antimicrobial properties, which are beneficial for acne sufferers as it can help reduce the growth of acne-causing bacteria.\n\n2. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP)\n\nEffectiveness: MAP is another water-soluble form of Vitamin C that is less irritating than L-ascorbic acid. It offers similar benefits, such as reducing hyperpigmentation and boosting collagen production.\n\nWhy It‚Äôs Good for Acne: Like SAP, MAP is also more gentle on the skin, making it suitable for sensitive and acne-prone skin. It helps in reducing inflammation and can be hydrating, which is beneficial for acne treatments that may dry out the skin.\n\n3. Ascorbyl Glucoside\n\nEffectiveness: Ascorbyl glucoside is a stable form of Vitamin C that converts to ascorbic acid over time on the skin. It offers antioxidant benefits and helps in skin brightening.\n\nWhy It‚Äôs Good for Acne: This form of Vitamin C is less potent than L-ascorbic acid, making it less likely to irritate sensitive acne-prone skin, while still offering the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial benefits needed to treat acne.\n\n4. L-Ascorbic Acid\n\nEffectiveness: L-ascorbic acid is the most potent form of Vitamin C and offers significant benefits in terms of photoprotection, collagen synthesis, and pigmentation reduction.\n\nWhy It‚Äôs Good for Acne (with Caution): While L-ascorbic acid can be beneficial for acne, particularly in fading acne scars and promoting healing, it can be irritating and unstable. It should be used cautiously, preferably in formulations designed for sensitive skin or in lower concentrations.",

Azelaic Acid (Holy Grail for You)\n\n‚úî Targets: Hyperpigmentation, post-inflammatory dark spots, redness, mild exfoliation\n‚úî Safe for: Fungal acne, rosacea, eczema\n‚úî Bonus: Helps with acne and strengthens the skin barrier\n\n2. Vitamin C (Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate or Ascorbyl Glucoside)\n\n‚úî Targets: Dark spots, hyperpigmentation, collagen production (wrinkles)\n‚úî Safe for: Sensitive skin, rosacea, and fungal acne if used in a non-greasy formula\n‚úî Avoid: L-Ascorbic Acid (can irritate rosacea and eczema)\n\n3. Retinaldehyde or Adapalene (Gentler Alternatives to Retinol)\n\n‚úî Targets: Wrinkles, fine lines, skin texture\n‚úî Safe for: Sensitive skin (Retinaldehyde is gentler than retinol; Adapalene is great for acne-prone skin)\n‚úî Avoid: Traditional retinol in oily formulations (can trigger fungal acne)\n\n4. Niacinamide (5% or Less)\n\n‚úî Targets: Hyperpigmentation, strengthens skin barrier, improves oil control (great for combo skin)\n‚úî Safe for: Fungal acne, rosacea, and eczema\n‚úî Avoid: High concentrations (10%+ can be irritating)\n\n5. Tranexamic Acid\n\n‚úî Targets: Melasma, stubborn dark spots, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation\n‚úî Safe for: Rosacea, eczema, and fungal acne\n‚úî Bonus: Pairs well with azelaic acid and vitamin C\n\n6. Centella Asiatica (Cica) & Green Tea Extract\n\n‚úî Targets: Redness, inflammation, skin barrier repair\n‚úî Safe for: Rosacea, eczema, fungal acne\n‚úî Bonus: Soothes irritation from other actives like vitamin C or retinoids\n\n7. Sunscreen (Essential for Pigmentation & Anti-Aging!)\n\n‚úî Best Options: Mineral sunscreens with zinc oxide (soothing for rosacea and eczema)\n‚úî Avoid: Chemical sunscreens with oxybenzone or avobenzone (can trigger sensitivity)\n\nWould you like product recommendations tailored to your combination skin?\n\n\n- Yes, but the retailer must deliver to australia\n\n\nAnd then it suggested a few products. You can ask for products on specific retailers and ask it to distribute to a week routine, really helpful.\n",

SO here are the details.  \nI scanned the ingredients of the sampler I got from a reseller in Shopee PH. I scanned the ingredients manually (the official website is not complete) using [Sezia.co](https://Sezia.co) and got one positive which is Polysorbate 60.

Now, I have also gone to the official website of Dear Klairs but I have found a discrepancy between this sampler and their website's listed ingredients. I haven't tried this particular product before but as I checked their official website and a reseller on Shopee there's no difference in ingredients.

I also authenticated its barcode on [https://www.upcitemdb.com/](https://www.upcitemdb.com/) and it has listed that its country of registration is in South Korea and nothing else (along with Midnight Blue Calming Cream)\n\nP.S.

I bought a full size bottle from Ulta months ago, used it a couple times and was wondering why the HECK it‚Äôs so popular because it immediately started breaking me out *and* caused a seb derm (fungal) flare the same day I started using it.   My skin felt super soft and nice right when I put it on, but within a couple hours there was no hydration to be felt (yes I put moisturizer over it/know how to use toners properly lol). \n\nI assumed it was the betaine because every single product I‚Äôve ever tried that has betaine in it has caused me major issues - it‚Äôs been the only consistent ingredient across all of the products. I never bothered to check the ingredient list on the box when I first got it, or when it caused problems because I remembered seeing betaine on it when I ordered it (before I bought other products with it and discovered, or assuming, that it‚Äôs the issue). \n\nI checked the box of the Klairs toner after reading this post a few days ago and sure enough, Polysorbate 60. Now honestly/to be fair, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm sensitive to it/if it causes issues for me because I haven‚Äôt been using anything else that contains it, or any other polysorbates, over the past 3+ years. But I found your post while doing a general Google search to see if there have been any other people who suspect a betaine sensitivity after I *again* foolishly tried using this toner (for the 4th time spaced out over a few months) to see if maybe I was wrong about it. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm a weirdo and keep all of my product boxes for a long time after purchasing stuff because otherwise I‚Äôd never know - Ulta‚Äôs website and app still have the WRONG ingredient list posted, and like so many other products, the ingredient list isn‚Äôt on the bottle. \n\nI won‚Äôt be back home until later today, possibly tomorrow, but I will happily take a picture and share it here. I was in a hurry the other day when I first discovered it and just remembered to come back and comment. I was *super* bummed that I had such a bad, immediate reaction to it because sooo many people swear by it. I wonder how many other people with fungal issues are using this formulation, and if they are having issues!!   \n\nWhile I‚Äôm here/at it - anyone else suspect betaine sensitivity?  Especially anyone with fungal issues?  I know it‚Äôs an amino acid so the times I‚Äôve used products that have it I‚Äôve made sure not to combine it with anything containing squalane or any other fatty-whatever ingredients that you aren‚Äôt supposed to mix with AAs if you have malassezia-related skin issues. (It *is* all amino acids right?  Not just arginine?  That‚Äôs what I recall the blog saying - all AAs).\n\nEdit to add - LOL i just looked up my Ulta orders to see the order date was - April 25, 2022‚Ä¶ one day before you made this post hahaha!  My bday is 4/24 so it was part of my ‚Äúhappy bday to me‚Äù order.",

    "body": "So I received a mailout from PC today advertising this product, stating it had won a POPSUGAR beauty award. I started using it about a month ago. I haven't seen many people talk about it here, but I find it quite an interesting product, so I thought in case anyone was curious because of the mailout I'd write a review.\n\n**What and who is it for?**\n[*Paula's Choice Resist Weekly Retexturising Foaming Treatment 4% BHA*](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/aha-and-bha-exfoliants/_/Resist-Weekly-Retexturizing-Foam-Four-Percent-BHA/). For all the things BHA is used for, but PC indicates it for:\n\n*\"Signs of aging, enlarged pores, and breakouts. Also excellent for those with rosacea or for treating \"chicken skin\" (keratosis pilaris).\"*\n\nI have dry, sensitive and acne-prone skin with some sun damage and enlarged pores, and the product has helped with the latter three without causing significant irritation (for me). PC says it is suitable for all skin types including sensitive skin but is best for oily or combination skin, and I would tend to agree.\n\n**Your thoughts on the product:**\nMy skin has always been fine with salicylic acid, and after using 2% every day for about a year I was interested in whether I could make more progress with a stronger product without levelling up to a peel. I like PC's BHA formulations, so I decided to give this a try.\n\nIt is a PITA to apply. It comes in a pump bottle - pump for a small quantity of foam (I use two pumps for my whole face). You then apply the foam to your face, where it becomes liquid, and leave it to absorb. The sensation is basically what I would assume rubbing hair mousse on your face would feel like. It's sticky and it takes awhile to absorb, although the stickiness goes away when the product has fully absorbed. However, this takes, like, 25 minutes. If you are into staggering your products, this is great because it means you *have* to give the BHA time to exfoliate - but if you're into skipping out on that or prefer pH adjusting toners or whatever, give this a miss. \n\nYou **must** leave it to fully absorb, because whatever the foaming agent in the product is will cause any products you apply over it to foam up unless it has fully absorbed. Your other products will lift the foam residue off your face, mix with it, the whole thing becomes a sticky mess - it's annoying. I find waiting 20 minutes sufficient to go in with my next product with minimal foaming, but the longer I can leave it the better. BHA factors into many people's routines as a fairly early step - mine only has three steps following this product, but if yours has a lot more this product might not be for you.\n\nAlso, daps to PC as always for not using fragrances, but this stuff smells pretty bad. It gives me cat food vibes? Yeah. The smell kind of lingers until the product fully dries, too. You need to wash your hands, because otherwise they will be sticky and smell.\n\n**Any adverse reactions when applying it?** None. As I stated, my skin has always reacted well to salicylic acid, but if yours is sensitive or if you experience sensitivity or irritation with a 2% formula, give this one a miss.\n\n**Did it solve your problem or reason for buying it?** This is why I'm writing this review - I was really surprised by how much of a difference this product made for my skin.\n\nI really bought it to see if my skin could tolerate a stronger BHA, and having used BHA in the longterm I wasn't expecting a massive change in results. After three days of using this nightly, my skin texture looked dramatically better and my enlarged pores appeared much smaller and shallower. It also assisted with some stubborn closed comedones and reduced the appearance of my SFs. I haven't been using any other exfoliants, and I had not introduced any other products to my routine, so I have to assume it was this product that made the difference.\n\nPC says this would be suitable for KP; I say absolutely not. There's not enough product, and it would become ridiculously expensive. There are cheaper alternatives for KP.\n\n**How often does it need to be used / how long do you have to keep using it to have a significant effect?** In terms of frequency, PC markets this as a weekly treatment, but I decided to dive in and start using it nightly (I do these things so you don't have to). It hasn't caused any sensitivity for me. If you're experienced with acids I would say you'll probably be fine, if not or if acids cause sensitivity or drying for you, maybe try once or twice weekly.\n\nIn terms of seeing effects, as I said within a week of using it nightly I observed real improvement. Obviously, YMMV. \n\nThe price is justified, I guess, by how infrequently it is *designed* to be used, as opposed to how frequently it *can* be used. You'd have to factor that in to deciding if it's good value for you or not.\n\nMy main thing was that I was *not* really expecting visible results from this product - it was more of a bridging step to progressing to peels - but for me it has made a difference. Again, if you frequently use stronger peels this probably won't do anything for you, but if you use a 2% without adverse effects and you'd like to try something stronger, this might be a go.\n\n**Would you get it again? Why?**\nAt this stage, I will probably repurchase - I'm not totally confident about trying peels yet - but *not unless it's on sale or I'm able to get free shipping*. In Australia this product retails for $45 for 1.5oz/45ml of product. I don't see it lasting a super long time. If I run out in an week when I'm short on cash, I'm not going to go out and repurchase this over buying something I need more (which I probably would do for, say, my moisturiser), but I would put it on the list for next time I come into some disposable cash.\n\n**Full ingredients**\n\nWater (Aqua), Butylene Glycol, Salicylic Acid, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Polysorbate 20, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Adenosine, Allantoin, Glycerin, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Borage Officinalis (Borage) Extract, Ulmus Fulva (Slippery Elm) Bark Extract, Lamium Album (White Nettle) Flower Extract, Arctium Lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Disodium EDTA, PEG/PPG-17/6 Copolymer, Aminomethyl Propanol, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n**Any known adverse reactions?**\nI would assume all the usual risks of BHA apply here. I would also caution people who are very sensitive to smells, because this does have an odour (not a fragrance) and while it doesn't trigger my own sensitivities I know how variable that is for other people.\n\nCombined with other products, I would suggest that if your routine is super long and you need to layer multiple products after your BHA, this may not be great for you. The \"like textures with like textures\" advice for layering products is going to be hard to observe here, because of its unique texture.",

I'd totally be up for making it the first active I start up in early May and doing a photo review if this thread comes up inconclusive and there's a demand. Right now I have to wait until then because I'm a subject in an acne research study and I'm not allowed to use \"any products meant for acne or anti-aging\" on my face until it finishes out. I have fairly non-reactive skin with some active acne, many tiny closed comedomes around my cheeks, mouth, and forehead, and plenty of PIH to fade.\n\nOnto the product! It's [Eva Natural's Vitamin C+ Serum,](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BT02Q88/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which claims to include 2% Retinol, 3.5% Niacinamide, 5% Hyaluronic Acid, 2% Salicylic Acid, 10% MSM, 20% Vitamin C. I'm aware that the big red warning light on this list is the combo of niacinamide and vit C, but from what I understand, because the vit C is the less reactive SAP, rather than LAA, the combination will likely be stable. I know there have also been concerns about combining a BHA and Retinol, but I've found a lot of that information to be inconclusive for Salicylic Acid (rather than Benzol Peroxide) and Retinol.\n\nPlease let me know if there's just something big I'm missing about this serum. I'm interested in the combination of actives because I know that if I have too many products with wait times between them, I'm just not going to use the products further down in order consistantly, or I'll just start skipping the wait. I recognise the sacrifice here of using an SAP vit C rather than LAA in terms of strength to reduce time between products. It was actually the retinol that I wanted to start using, but I'd love to get all of these actives in my regiment.\n\nThe ingredient list according to Amazon is: Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), Retinol, Olive Oil Squalene, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Organic Rosa Canina (Rosehip Seed Oil), Carbomer, (2s)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic Acid, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree Essential Oil), Lavandula Augustifolia (Lavender Essential Oil), Ylang Ylang Essential Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.",

I Shampoo/Condition my hair 2-3 times a week and dried with a T-shirt. Everything was going great until a week ago where I noticed my hair didn't feel the same anymore. I don't know how to describe it, but it almost feels rough and in need of conditioner? and my ends feel drier that normal. I am not sure whats happening my first thought was damage since I've been growing it out for almost a year without a trim or a cut. Now i'm starting to think that there is some sort of build up? What do you guys think? I have thick wavy/curly hair. Also, how do you know if your hair is moisturized? I always thought soft silky elastic hair = moisturized which is why I am writing this post because it no longer feels soft and silky, it feels rough.\n\nHeres the Shampoo https://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133656/Kirkland-Moisture-Shampoo/Unlisted-Brand/Hair\n\nIngredients: water sodium cocoyl isethionate cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine methyl isethionate disodium cocoyl glutamate sodium lauryl sulfoacetate decyl glecoside ammonium cocoyl isethionate divinyldimethicond/dimethicone copolymer disodium laureth sulfosuccinate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract glycol disterate glycerin fragrance quaternium-91 sodium cocoyl glutamate peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate amodimethicone panthenol polyquaternium-10 ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate chlorphenesin methyl gluceth-20 guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride c11-15 pareth-7 laureth-9 phospholipids hydrolyzed vegetable protein pg-propyl silanetriol c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate trideceth-12 superoxide dismutase sodium ascorbyl phosphate tocopheryl acetate methylchloroisothiazolinone methylisothiazolinone\n\nAnd the Conditioner: http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=133657/KIRKLAND-MOISTURE-CONDITIONER/Unlisted-Brand/Hair\n\nIngredients: water cyclopentasiloxane cetearyl alcohol stearyl alcohol cetrimonium chloride behentrimonium methosulfate helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil lycium barbarum fruit extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract camellia sinesis leaf extract cucumis sativus (cucumber) fruit extract persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract punica granatum extract melanin vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract helianthus annus (sunflower) seed extract glycereth-26 dimethiconol divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer fragrance gluconolactone cetrimonium bromide panthenol ppg-3 benzyl ether myristate jojoba esters quaternium-91 amodimethicone hydroxyethylcelloulose cetrimonium methosulfate sodium benzoate c11-15 pareth-7 peg-45m laureth-9 aminomethly propanol glycerin butyrospermum parkii ( shea butter) c12-13 pareth-23 c12-13 pareth-3 cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride (sunscreens) trideceth-12 citric acid ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate sodium ascorbyl phosphate butylene glycol hydrolyed soy protein tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e) hydrolyzed vegatable protein pg-propyl silanetriol\n\nedit: Some more info, My hair is just above shoulder length, when i get in the shower i use a wide tooth comb to get rid of knots then i soak my hair with warm water then lather the shampoo all over scalp and from root to end then rinse then i take a huge blob of Conditioner and use it the same way and leave it in for 1-2 minutes then rinse with cold water.\n\nThanks for the help!",

Rinsing your hair will have the shampoo run down your strands to clean them. You can also consider combing once your hair is saturated with conditioner and not rinsing all of it out.",

I guess it will take some more trial and error, but I was wondering if anyone else is/has been in this situation? Do you have any brand or product recommendations, advice - anything?

I'm specifically mad because they added salicylic acid and I have a sensitivity to it. It is VERY hard to find a drugstore face wash without salicylic acid in it lol.\n\nAnyway, when I was on my mission to find a face wash with a similar formula to the old one, I wasn't able to find a summary of how the formula changed. I assume it's out there somewhere, but I didn't see it. So, if you're like me and want to know what they changed, here are the two ingredients lists:\n\nC&C Morning Burst OLD FORMULA (taken from the back label of my last physical bottle I had)-\n\nWater,\nSodium Laureth Sulfate,\nGlycerin,\nAcrylates Copolymer,\nCocamidopropyl Betaine,\nFragrance,\nPhenoxyethenol,\nSodium Hydroxide,\nMenthyl Lactate,\nMannitol,\nCellulose,\nDisodium EDTA,\nMethylparaben,\nMenthol,\nPropylparaben,\nEthylparaben,\nSodium Ascorbyl Phosphate,\nTocopheryl Acetate,\nHydroxypropyl Methylcellulose,\nCucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract,\nRetinyl Palmitate,\nPanax Ginseng Root Extract,\nZingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract,\nAcrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer,\nTriethyl Citrate,\nCitrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract,\nCitric Acid,\nIron Oxides,\nTitanium Dioxide,\nMica,\nTalc\n\nC&C Morning Burst NEW FORMULA (taken from C&C website)-\n\nWater,\nSodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate,\nCocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine,\nSorbitol,\nSodium Hydrolyzed Potato Starch Dodecenylsuccinate,\nAcrylates Crosspolymer-4,\nSodium Ascorbyl Phosphate,\nTocopheryl Acetate,\nMannitol,\nCellulose,\nHydroxypropyl Methylcellulose,\nIron Oxides,\nSodium Hydroxide,\nCitric Acid,\nDisodium EDTA,\nSalicylic Acid,\nMenthol,\nFragrance\n\nHere is a summary of the changes:\n\nWhat they added-\n\nSodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate,\nCocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine,\nSorbitol,\nSodium Hydrolyzed Potato Starch- Dodecenylsuccinate,\nAcrylates Crosspolymer-4,\nSalicylic Acid\n\nWhat they removed-\n\nSodium Laureth Sulfate,\nGlycerin,\nAcrylates Copolymer,\nCocamidopropyl Betaine,\nPhenoxyethenol,\nMenthyl Lactate,\nMethylparaben,\nPropylparaben,\nEthylparaben,\nCucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract,\nRetinyl Palmitate,\nPanax Ginseng Root Extract,\nZingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract,\nAcrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer,\nTriethyl Citrate,\nCitrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract,\nTitanium Dioxide,\nMica,\nTalc\n\nI'm not a chemist so I'm not going to claim any of these changes to be good or bad or whatever, but if you found the new Morning Burst formula isn't working for you anymore, I think it's good to examine the ingredients lists.\n\nI will note that the first 5 ingredients (excluding water) in the new formula are all new additions, and that the first 4 ingredients in the old formula were all removed.\n\nSo, did I find a replacement? Maybe. Neutrogena's Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scrub's first 2 ingredients are the same as C&C MB's old formula (Glycerin and Sodium Laureth Sulfate). It also has the little exfoliating bits that I love, and NO salicylic acid. I haven't tried it yet, so this isn't an official recommendation, but the ingredients are giving me hope.\n\n(EDIT: After 3 weeks of using this new face wash, I do recommend the Neutrogena wash as a replacement specifically for C&C's Morning Burst. It has been working very well for me, personally.)\n\n(Side note: I'm not being paid by Neutrogena lol. I used this product's full government name because Neutrogena also has a product of a similar name with different ingredients. They were right next to each other at the store when I went. If in doubt, check the formula!)\n\nI hope that compiling this info is helpful for at least 1 person out there!",

Is this the only Vitamin C serum at this price point and effectiveness?  I recently bought a similar one on amazon.  The Vitamin C ingredient is sodium ascorbyl Phosphate (Amara Organics is the brand.)  Everything I've researched says this is a good and effective form of Vit C but you guys are the real geniuses here.  I'd *rather* not pay $40+ for the PC serum if I can manage it! haha\n\n2.) There are really conflicting instructions out there about HOW to apply the serum.  I generally apply it, get dressed, then start applying other lotions (eye cream, moisturizer).  So there's like a 2 minute break between the Vit C serum and everything else.  But I've read that you need to wait at least 30 minutes after applying (WTF I have to wake up so early for that) to apply anything else, OR that you should apply it with other products or on wet skin (the PC website suggests adding it to existing lotions as a \"booster\" in addition to using on its own).  So what's the deal with timing?\n\n",

I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin with acne scars and dark circles. \n\nAs I was looking through the deals on Amazon I found Valentia's Even Glow Serum and recognized some of the ingredients from the C15 serum, so I decided to buy it without much research besides the reviews. I would like to know how similar these two products are and what the ingredients mean in relation to my skin. The product is still on sale so I'm curious if I should purchase more or buy C15 instead. \n\nEven Glow Serum: http://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Serum-Anti-Wrinkle-Antioxidant-Non-Watery/dp/B00HJD8NLY (sorry, I'm on mobile!)\n\nIngredients:\nProprietary Organic Skin Tea, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Methlsulfonylmethane (MSM), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), Globularia Cordifolia Callus Culture Extract (plant stem cells), Organic Rosa Canina (Rosehip Seed Oil), Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel), Citrus Paradisi (Pink Grapefruit Essential Oil), Carbomer, (2s)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic Acid, d-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Algae Extract, Camelia Oleifera (Japanese Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Seabuckthorn Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glyceri\n\n- Should I put this serum on a wet face? (I read somewhere that hyaluronic acid should be put on a wet face to trap moisture.. IIRC) \n- Can I put it on top of Paula's Choice Resist Advanced Replenishing Toner with Vitamin C? Even if it works best on a wet face? \n- Will I have better results if I just switch over to C15? \n- How does this serum, C15, serums in general work with the oil cleansing method? \n- Is there anything I need to know about this product/ingredients? \n\nI tried the OCM briefly but recently my routine is washing my face with Cerave moisturizing cleanser and using Cerave moisturizer with some argan oil. I just bought PC's Resist toner and even glow serum and have been using them between cleansing and moisturizing. I would like to continue with OCM, but I feel like I just keep adding things to my skin and I'm not removing anything. Before this subreddit, I used to look forward to a squeaky clean face every night üòÅ \n\nI am very new to this subreddit and I'm amazed by how much people know here. Please enlighten me!\n\n",

I thought it was the Niacinamide so I stopped using it for about a week but then a week later a few new pimples still kept showing up... even though before that my face had been clear for months. I just incorporated TO's Niacinamide again into my routine but I am not sure if it is causing the breakouts, or if its because of something else.\n\nSkin type: Dry/Combo\n\nCurrent Routine (with Niacinamide):\n\nAM: Cleanser (*The Body Shop Tea Tree Facial Wash),* Toner (*Thayers Witch Hazel*), Serum\\*, Eye Cream (*BaeBody Eye Gel -* I'm not sure if eyecreams actually work but I have dark circles so Im using it anyway, just in case :P ), Sunscreen (*La Roche-Posay Anthelios Ultra Cream SPF* containing Tinosorb S, Mexoryl SX, Mexoryl XL, Avobenzone,..., I reapply at least every 2 hours if I'm outside)\n\nPM: Same as AM but replace Sunscreen with The Ordinary's Moisturizing Factors + HA\n\n\\*Serum Schedule:\n\nAM, everyday: TruSkins Vitamin C Serum (Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate) + 1 drop of TO's ferulic acid, TO's **Niacinamide** (5 mins wait in between)\n\nPM: Mon, Thur, Sat: Tretinoin 0.01% through Curology (been on this for 2 weeks now but I dont think it cause purging because I started getting red bumps before I started Tret)\n\nTue, Fri, Sun: Paula's Choice BHA Exfoliant, TO's **Niacinamide**\n\nAlso on Sunday morning: Indian Healing Clay Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you guys think I am breaking out due to the Niacinamide? Or is it something else in my routine that causes this? I really want to love TO's Niacinamide because I have acne scars that I want to get rid of and I have heard many good things about TO's product.\n\nP/S: I live in Philadelphia, PA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: I have been testing Niacinamide only on 1 side of my face (left side) mornings and nights for 3 weeks. I got a few new small pimples but interestingly, they were all on the OTHER side my face (right side) LOL?!? So I guess TO's Niacinamide is not the problem...?",

I have already tried the Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix pads which were good, but I am looking for something that will do a little more for me.

I heard that short contact therapy with benzoyl peroxide worked just as well as leaving it on, as well as at a lower percentage, so I switched to a 5% gel and have been leaving it on for about 5-10 minutes in the mornings while I brush my teeth, after cleansing.\n\nI also now only use the azelaic acid as a spot treatment, and started to apply a light amount of moisturizer and TO Niacinaminde and Zinc serum before applying my tretinoin. I noticed that my skin looks glowier and more moisturized, however after a few weeks of doing this, I am starting to breakout in (whiteheads) places that were previously clear  (ie: my forehead).

I had forgotten how convenient it is to just slap on a chemical sunscreen rather than rubbing in a physical sunscreen for 10 minutes before I can be seen in public. It feels great, it feels barely noticeable on the skin- kind of similar to the Clearly Sheer line, but without the nasty piling. Even better, it only irritates my eyes a little (far less than some other chemical sunscreens). It's also very protective: Sunscreen Simulator pegs the PPD at just over 10; not bad at all for an avobenzone-based sunscreen.\n\nSo what *don't* I like about it? Two things: One, the price. It's not that expensive (~$10 for a 3 oz tube), but it is over my $3/oz threshold. What bugs me is that Coppertone has a habit of selling \"face\" versions of sunscreens in much smaller bottles than their body sunscreens, when AFAIK they are exactly the same formula. They make a body version of the SPF 30 oil free ($10 for 8 oz), but not the 50 SPF. Grr. Add in that I used this while I was outside quite a bit, and with constant reapplication I went through my tube in 3 days.\n\nSecond (and this is the real deal breaker), there are 5 different kinds of alcohol in the ingredient list. Five!! My skin can normally handle a little alcohol, but holy crap! \n\nAll in all, as much as I liked wearing this, I don't think I'll buy this one again.\n\nActive Ingredients: Avobenzone (3%), Homosalate (15%), Octisalate (5%), Octocrylene (10%), Oxybenzone (6.0%)\n\nInactive Ingredients: Water, Butylene Glycol, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Benzyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Myristyl Alcohol, Cellulose Gum, Butylated PVP, Chlorphenesin, Lecithin, Cetyl Alcohol, Lauryl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate \n",

    "body": "Hello all,\n\nI‚Äôve been battling adult cystic acne for over a year now. I initially thought it was pandemic-triggered stress, but after reviewing my history, it seems to have started when I ceased taking norethindrone (the mini pill - I was on camila generic 2019-may2020)\n\nIve always struggled with acne prior to cessation of the mini pill, but this was the first time I‚Äôve ever dealt with hormonal CYSTIC acne.  \n\nIn late august of 2020, I added prescription tretinoin .05 to my routine, which helped tremendously with the intensity & duration the lesions. it doesn‚Äôt seem to prevent cysts from forming in the buccal region of my cheeks, but it helps me cope with them when they come about.  \n\nAfter religious use of tret, azelaic acid, and sodium ascorbyl phosphate for months on end, my skin wasn‚Äôt perfect, but I was down to dealing with maybe a cystic pimple a week - it was manageable.  \n\nI really wanted to start preventing lesions altogether before I started addressing scarring. I didn‚Äôt look flawless, but I could wear a light layer of missha bb cream most days and that was all it took for my skin to look pretty damn good.  \n\nI added yasmin (3mg drospirenone and 0.030 mg ethinylestradiol) on 5/21/2021, and Started spironolactone 25 mg 5/27/2021. I also stopped applying azelaic acid around the same time.  \n\nA month later , my skin is the WORST it‚Äôs been since before I added the tret or azelaic in 2020. I‚Äôve got cystic and non cystic acne popping up on my cheeks, jawline, and chin, along with pimples on my forehead.  \n\nI added back in the azelaic (finacea 15%) a week ago now, and I regret stopping it, but I strongly suspect the breakout is from the birth control / spironolactone.  \n\nRoutine  \nAm  \nCleanse  \nProactiv step 2 toner  \nDerma e vitamin c serum + typology 11%   vitamin c serum  \nPipette lotion  \nFinacea 15% (jawline, chin, & forehead)  \nBiossance sunscreen  \n\nPm  \nCleanse  \nProactiv step 2 toner (sometimes skip)  \nPipette lotion  \nTret 0.05 cream (generic)  \nSebamed 5% urea cream  \n\nI‚Äôm also having the side effects (irregular bowels, extra dizziness, dry lips, peeing a ton) - and its only 50mg worth of spiro (the yasmin is equivalent to 25 mg of spiro for its diuretic properties).     \n\nI‚Äôm starting to really regret adding the spironolactone and yasmin. Maybe my hormones were finally recovering from the norethindrone and I just totally messed that up? Did anyone else get WORSE skin on these meds ? Did it get better ??  \n\nEdit: forgot to space routine",
