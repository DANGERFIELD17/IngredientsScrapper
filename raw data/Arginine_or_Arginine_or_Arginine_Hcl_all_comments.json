    "body": "First off: I am so proud of the hard work and dedication everyone in this sub shows. You have all inspired me and because of that, I'd like to pass on my thoughts, routine, and results.\n\n# Tl;dr\n\n* 4.5 months\n* 220 lbs → 174 lbs\n* 20.1% BF → 9.9% BF\n* Current Goal: 8% BF\n* Long-term Goal: 8-10% BF up to 200 lbs\n\n\n\n**Pics & stats**\n\n(📸: [Progress Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/5pTKTqy))\n\n*Sex*: Male\n\n*Age*: 31 years old\n\n*Height*: 6'1'’\n\n*Before I started cutting*: 03/02/2019 - 220 lbs\n\n*Current weight (last weigh in):* 07/15/2019 183.2 lbs\n\n*Goal weight:* 180 - not necessarily a goal but I would think I need to lose another 2-3 lbs to get to my BF% goal of 8 percent.\n\n*Long-term goal:* 8-10% body fat at 200 lbs - wouldn't that be a dream?\n\n# Background\n\nI’ve been going to the gym regularly for most of my adult life but it wasn’t until March 2019 that I decided to seriously take a look and dedicate time to understanding my body and seek assistance for diet, macro counting, and splits.\n\nI thought I could do this work on my own but when my macro counting has been terrible. I didn’t know how to do this, it was overwhelming, and quite honestly not very intuitive to macro count. I was putting waaaay too much into my body, and when the scale kept going up, I truly wondered why my body wasn't changing the way I wanted (frankly, NEEDED) it to do.\n\nMy lifestyle was fairly sedentary, I’d go hiking occasionally but outside of the gym 5 times a week, I didn’t do much but sit even when I got home.\n\nFrom 03/02/2019 - 07/15/2019 my days have been twice a day at the gym, early morning target cardio (plan below and what that means) and then heavy lifting in the afternoon. Depending on how I feel, this is usually six days a week.\n\n# Current Lifestyle\n\nI’m a software consultant, sitting behind a desk 5 days a week. My life, outside of working out two times a day, six days a week, is pretty sedentary, even today, so I have to be hyper aware of my nutrition and ensure that my food intake is as clean as possible.\n\n**Actual Workout**\n\n**(03/02/2019 - 07/01/2019)**\n\nAt the beginning from March through June, I was hitting every major muscle group around once a week. My splits would look something like:\n\nDay 1: Legs\n\nDay 2: Delts + Target Cardio\n\nDay 3: Back\n\nDay 4: Chest + Target Cardio\n\nDay 5: Arms\n\nDay 6: Delts - because they’re STUBBORN + Target Cardio\n\nDay 7: High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Cardio\n\n**07/02/2019 - Present**\n\nTracking the photos, I knew what areas were weakest. My trainer put a plan in place to help adjust to focus more on my weaker areas so my splits changed. Also note: I added targeted cardio daily to the workout routine to help cut more. Cardio consists of *at least* 45-mins targeting heart rate at 115 - 135 bpm, my body's fat burn zone. Side note: targeted cardio can be done walking on a treadmill, it's boring, so find some music, tv, anything to get through it.\n\nThe other thing is what works for me, may not work for you. Know your body, its limits, and what you can accomplish and what areas you need to focus on. My trainer has been a huge asset in helping me understanding my own body and what areas I need to work on.\n\nDay 1: Legs + Mid-back; Target cardio\n\nDay 2: Chest; Target cardio\n\nDay 3: Back/biceps (lat dominant); Target cardio\n\nDay 4: Delts/core; Target cardio\n\nDay 5: Legs/triceps; Target cardio\n\nDay 6: Chest/light delts; Target cardio\n\nDay 7: High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Cardio; abs\n\nMy delts and lats continue to be pretty stubborn and I'm slowly realizing I'll always have to go after them in the gym multiple times a week.\n\n**Overall diet**\n\nI am a creature of habit, my diet is pretty boring, especially when I find something good I usually keep it in my week. For that reason, I’m just going to show my macro counts because I’m not eating anything special.\n\nI adjust my macro intake based on what muscle group I’m working on. Larger muscle groups will have higher carbs and protein; smaller groups will be higher fats and protein, low carbs.\n\n**Back and Legs (Large muscle group)** -  I try to consume around 1734 Kcal, which will consist of 46% Carbs; 46% proteins; 24% fats.\n\n**Arms/rest day (smaller muscle group) -** Calories: 1562 Kcal, which consists of 26% carbs; 32% proteins; 42% fats\n\n**Chest/delts (smaller muscle group) -** Calories: 1728 Kcal, which consists of 27% carbs; 30% proteins 43% fats.\n\nGET A FOOD SCALE. GAME. CHANGER.\n\nMeal prep in general is a struggle for me, it takes me about two hours overall on a Sunday. I know, not that much,  but my god, time is so limited, that’s the last thing I want to do. So crafting recipes that I can throw in a slow cooker, rice maker, insta pot has been a life saver.\n\n*Supplements*: I take **L-Carnitine** for fasted cardio; **L-Arginine** (3g) pre-workout; **BCAA** (5g) 3:1:1 ratio during the workout; G**lutamine** (5g) post workout; **Glucosamine** before bed. **Super greens powder** for when I didn’t feel like I didn’t eat enough vegetables that day.\n\n# My Thoughts / Takeaways\n\nSo I’m a little more than four months in and I’m scared. I don’t want to go back to that person I was in March. It’s such a short amount of time I’m scared that I could go back to that person any minute. I know I won’t be able to maintain these incredible results long term - it’s going to get harder and come more slowly, so I know I have to readjust my expectations. Seeing the current results and progress is so addicting. I love seeing my body transform. It’s like a science experiment where I get to experience the results first hand.\n\nI feel incredible - I have more energy, more stamina, I fall asleep in 5-mins when I go to bed. I was always hitting high blood pressure for my age and I check my blood pressure periodically and my blood pressure is all in the normal ranges now.\n\nThe biggest challenge of this process is knowing and being honest with myself. Six days a week, twice a day, is very hard. I may feel like shit after a day at work and I have to know my body - am I fighting exhaustion or am I just in a bad mood? If it’s exhaustion, it’s fine, I can take a day to break or I can go after a nap and it’s going to be alright.\n\nAnother challenge behind this is the social aspect. People are mean when it comes to this journey! Socializing, going to dinner and drinks after work, I will find anything on the menu to fit my dietary needs for the day. I don’t want to put anyone out, but I often find people don’t like it when I say I’m going to eat a salad, or I won’t drink alcohol at a happy hour. I can brush it off for now. If you have thoughts behind this, please let me know! I’m still learning and would love to know your thoughts.",

I'm in good shape but had always just eaten at maintenance, or if I was \"cutting\" I would still eat whatever I wanted when I ate out.\n\nWent out with friends last week.  I didn't order a drink, got the food that fit my calories, didn't gorge myself on queso for the appetizer, etc.  It was surprising at how much my friends felt they should comment on this.  \"But you're already fit!\", \"But you have plenty of muscle!\", etc.  Like, none of that is the point.  I have a specific way I want to look, and this is what will get me there.  I have no idea why people feel they need to comment on this stuff.  Me eating less or not drinking doesn't impact them in any way, but they seem to take it almost as a personal affront.",

If you start dinner at 300-400 calories you can easily order most things and eat 2/3 of the plate for 1000 calories.  That still leaves room for a few drinks and you can end the day around 1500-1700.  \n\nAlso, you can totally eat at maintenance for a day or so (which for you is over 2000 if you don't work out that day.  Even higher if you do).  You won't gain anything, just lose a little time on cut.  \n\nThen you'll find your friends will give you shit for losing weight so easily cause all they will see you do is eat out and drink beers with them.",

    "body": "Okay, so technically this was on Monday but definitely one of the biggest mistakes I’ve made in my life. \n\nSo for context, I absolutely love really strong, dark coffee. There’s a running joke amongst my friends that I drink “jet fuel” because I brew it so heavy. For whatever reason that strong flavor psychologically gives me kind of a dopamine rush and wakes me up before the caffeine hits. \n\nAnyways, on Monday, I had a really important client meeting and my boss had flown into town for said meeting. So, I had to meet her at her hotel pretty early in the morning and it was across town. So I had to get up way earlier than usual and was not having it that morning. \n\nSince I was not handling waking up early and kind of in a rush I hurriedly made my coffee and made it strong. At the store, I had come across this coffee called “Death Wish” which was coined as “the world’s strongest coffee” at one point so I cracked it open, gave the filter a heavy fill, and scurried away to do other morning tasks. I was really excited to try it. \n\nIn my mind, “strong” was synonymous with the actual taste, not the caffeine content. For context, the company doesn’t release the actual caffeine content but tests show a 12oz cup ranges from 300 up to 750 milligrams depending on how you brew it. Judging by my not-so-light brewing habits, I’m sure that number was far closer to the 750. \n\nAs I’m going about my morning, I’m hammering it down pretty quickly. Slightly disappointed, it was “strong” but not what I was expecting out of “world’s strongest” but hey, whatever, it works. \n\nAfter the first few sips, I look at the clock and realize I’m running out of time. So I say “fuck it” and just take my coffee with me to the shower where I can finish it off.\n\nA few minutes into my shower while I’m lathering up and jamming out to Cruel Summer by Taylor Swift, you know, as us dudes who are married to Swifties do, I start absolutely BUZZING. \n\nAt first it was just kind of like that little tremble and I’m just like “huh!” And cracked it up to drinking coffee on an empty stomach. Over the next few minutes that feeling gradually increased, and I had the full-on shakes and felt hot. \n\nAt this point I put two and two together. Strong=caffeine content. Oopsies!\n\nA little concerned, I hop out of the shower grabbed my phone, and googled the amount of caffeine and saw that 750 number and was like OH FUCK. \n\nThis sent me into a full on caffeine-induced panic attack. First panic attack of my life. My legs gave out from the shakes and my heart was pounding while I laid on the fetal position on the ground trying to chill myself out. \n\nI thought I was having an actual heart attack. At the time, there was a little bit of irony in my mind that as a guy in my late 20s who powerlifts and works out 5 days a week, my cause of death would be via *heart attack* caused by being a dumbass and more or less shotgunning 750mg of caffeine. Not the way I thought I’d go, but I accepted my fate in that moment. \n\nI called for my wife who was extremely confused, very concerned, and her being frantic about me being frantic made me feel worse. But when I explained it she calmed down, realized I *probably* wasn’t dying and just said “ohhhh yeah. That’ll do it.” And just laid on the floor, pet me like our dogs, and handed me her water off of the sink counter. \n\nThen, the farts happened. \n\nIn my panic attack I started aggressively farting uncontrollably. Not just regular farts or squeakers, but full-blown ground-shaking ass rippers every 5-10 seconds. Quite impressive and in rapid succession. \n\nMy wife started *dying* laughing and just patted me on the head and started saying shit like “there, there, that’s it, honey. Just fart it out! You’ll be fine!”. \n\nSo I’m glad she got some enjoyment out of it because I was not having a great time laying there buck-ass naked and still wet on the bathroom floor in the fetal position farting uncontrollably and shaking haha. \n\nAfter about 15 minutes I chilled out a little bit and realized I was okay-ish and my wife kept an eye on my heart rate and stuff just to make sure I wasn’t actually having a heart attack. For the rest of the day I was *WIRED* and definitely a little traumatized but now I think it’s funny. \n\nEnded up missing the meeting and my boss was a little pissed she flew down here. But hey, shit happens. Sometimes we’re dumbasses, and drink way too much caffeine. \n\nMy question is… who in the actual *fuck* wants that much caffeine at once?? \n\nTLDR: I misunderstood “world’s strongest coffee” as pertaining to the actual flavor of the coffee as opposed to having 750mg of caffeine. I shotgunned it down way too quickly, and hade a full-on caffeine-induced panic attack followed by a fart-attack and missed an extremely important meeting as a result. \n\n9/2 UPDATE: I consulted with my doctor casually to make sure this wasn’t anything to be worried about on Friday and gave him a list of the supplements I take. \n\nTurns out, one of the supplements I take OTC is a high dosage of for muscle pumps (nitric oxide boosters) before workouts. It’s meant to expand your blood vessels and increase blood flow. \n\nIt’s “normal” dosage is a major component within blood pressure medications, used for certain diabetics, and most notably in comparable doses… ED medications are like 33% nitric oxide apparently (which.. can confirm, NO 100% helps “firm” things up beyond muscles during workouts if you want a cheat code fellas😂). \n\nBut, a side effect of expanded vessels from this is sensitivity to substances within 24hours of use and specifically caffeine and alcohol… especially in “high” intake situations and can be dangerous. Explains a lot lol \n\nSo.. any of my workout folks who take NO, arginine, beet root, or ED medication this is apparently a side effect of that lol ",

But funnily enough, that roasted to shit flavour that tastes like it would be \"strong\" has less caffeine than a frail tasting light roast because during the roasting process the caffeine gets burnt off too. \n\n\nFurthermore, espressos are considered the strongest possible coffee out there probably because of the dense ratio of coffee to water. But a single serving of pour over made with the same coffee will have about 50% more caffeine in it due to better extraction. \n\n\nAll that to say that you can't taste caffeine.",

    "body": "**I now maintain an updated and more user-friendly version of this guide at /r/ConstipationAdvice.**\n\n\nI've seen that many of you have chronic constipation but you do not understand why you have it, and your general practitioner doctors either don't think you have an issue or don't know what to do.\n\n\nI know how you feel. I know what it's like to not even feel like a human being because you can't go to the bathroom like everyone else. It is frustrating and depressing, and not something you can just go around telling people.\n\n\nI hope this guide helps you a ton.\n\n\n**BECOME A DETECTIVE**\n\n\nKeep this in mind as you proceed: your disorder is a puzzle. All you have to do is solve it. You can do it, if you have a great deal of patience, persistence, and commitment. Become your own investigator. Figure out your digestive cycle and your body's language. Listen to your body. Keep notes - I'm talking handwritten or typed notes, anything that will help you make a paper trail.\n\n\n**Women:** I have left a special note for you at the bottom regarding the additional problems you face when dealing with doctors. Please read it.\n\n\n----------------------\n\n\n**WHY I MADE THIS GUIDE**\n\n\nI'm a (mostly) healthy, physically active 31-year-old male. I have spent years seeing doctors, reading studies, accosting and interrogating medical professionals and pharmacists, calling pharmaceutical companies, and generally being an interrogator to anyone who has information that could help improve my life. This post is the aggregation of my conclusions and recommendations.\n\n\nIn 2012 I got constipated. I grabbed an OTC laxative and was fine after that. But then the constipation happened again a few months later. It became more frequent, going from once a month to once a week, to every day. As of 2016, I was completely unable to eliminate without the use of pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n\nIt took seven years for doctors to figure out what was wrong with me. I made this post because I want to help some of you turn my 7-year journey into a 7-month journey.\n\n\nPrint this guide out and keep it with you. I've done all the heavy lifting for you. I did all of these myself, and now I want to help you. You will spend money on all of this, but it will change your life. You will be glad you did it.\n\n\n----------------------\n\n\n**QUESTIONS FOR YOU**\n\n\nIf you suffer from severe chronic constipation, you need to answer the following questions, write them down, and bring them to your doctor:\n\n\n* Do you have the urge to go, but you cannot? Or do you have zero urge to go? (this is the most important question)\n\n\n* Do you have alternating diarrhea and constipation, or just constipation?\n\n\n* Do you have nausea, vomiting, acid reflux, difficulty swallowing, or early satiety (getting full really early into a meal)?\n\n\n* Have you had this issue since childhood, or did it begin in teen years/adulthood/after a major life event (surgery? divorce? car accident? mauled by bears?)\n\n\n* Did you in the past or do you currently take any medications that could damage your intestines? The acne drug Accutane/Sotret/Claravis/many other names (isotretinoin) has been linked to serious conditions of the digestive tract. I am absolutely convinced that my large intestine was destroyed by this drug. Antibiotics are also a major culprit in ruining the small intestine microbiome and causing diarrhea/constipation disorders. Antidepressants can ruin the serotonin balance in the gut as well.\n\n\n* Did you suffer sexual abuse as a child? There is a high degree of correlation between childhood sexual abuse and adult constipation disorders. Meaning, a lot of people with chronic constipation disorders in adulthood experienced trauma when they were young. This sort of thing must be investigated by *both your doctor and a therapist in coordination*. Do some Googling on this topic if you believe this might be your issue.\n\n\n**If you have the urge but cannot go**, you very likely have [Pelvic Floor Dysfunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_floor_dysfunction), especially if you are a woman who has had children. Other indicators of PDF are pain during sex and incontinence. Sorry, but your test is the [anorectal manometry](https://motilitysociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Anorectal-Manometry-Patient-Information-8-5-2005.pdf) - have fun! It can sometimes be treated. Alternatively, you might have a bowel obstruction or a tumor. Your doctor must test for these.\n\n\n**If you have zero urge to go to the bathroom**, you very likely have a nerve or muscle disorder of the large intestine. These are called [motility disorders](https://www.columbiadoctors.org/childrens-health/condition/gastrointestinal-gi-motility-disorder#:~:text=GI%20motility%20disorders%20are%20digestive,food%20through%20the%20digest%20system.). This is what I have. The most common are Slow-Transit Constipation, Chronic Idiopathic Constipation, and the dreaded Colonic Inertia. Both are extremely frustrating and difficult to treat. It is especially likely that you've got one of these conditions if you have no associated pain or any other symptoms. Your current gastroenterologist likely specializes in IBS; tell him you want a **motility specialist** or a **neurogastroenterologist**.\n\n\n**If you have constipation sometimes and diarrhea sometimes**, you very likely have IBS-C or a rare form of colitis, or a combination of issues. You may have a nervous condition. Outside chance you have Crohn's Disease. You must be checked for intestinal ulcers/irritation/inflammation, and also for food intolerances and allergies. A buddy of mine had \"IBS\" for many years, but then later discovered he was allergic to tuna, shellfish, pistachios, and fructose. \n\n\n**If you have nausea, vomiting, acid reflux, difficulty swallowing, or early satiety**, you very likely have [general gastroparesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroparesis), where your entire GI tract is sluggish. I'm sorry to say that this is very difficult to treat and a horrible disease. You must see a neurogastroenterologist, AKA a gastroenterologist who specializes in motility disorders, and you must also see a neurologist to test for autonomic neuropathy. You need a prokinetic motility drug like cisapride, domperidone, prucalopride, etc. Don't go on cisapride unless you have excellent heart health and make sure the doctor keeps an eye on your heart at all times.\n\n\n**If you have experienced constipation since childhood**, you might have [Hirschsprung's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschsprung%27s_disease) and you need a neurogastroenterologist (a special type of gastroenterologist who studies nerves and motility) to diagnose it by taking a [Full-Thickness Biopsy](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/486390). This is a major surgery and you should try to exhaust all other options first. The Full-Thickness Biopsy comes with its own potentially serious side effects. \n\n\n**If you took heavy medications that could possibly have caused your issue**, first write out a timeline of events and try to remember exactly when you took the medication and when your issues started. Write down the progression of symptoms and severity. Bring it with you to your doctor appointments. Correlation does not imply causation, but you are a detective now and you need to follow every lead.\n\n\nYou need to *insist* to your GP that you want to see a **gastroenterologist** (a specialist of your digestive tract, from your mouth to your anus). You need to advocate strongly for yourself because nobody else is going to do it for you. You have to be aggressive in your appointment-making, follow-ups, call-backs, consultations, and arguing with your insurance company about getting your specialty medications covered.\n\n\nYou have to do it yourself. You have to fight. If you don't, you will suffer alone. Nobody is going to save you but you. It's time to get smart and tough about your condition.\n\n\n------------------------\n\n\n**THE FIVE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS**\n\n\nYou are embarking on a journey to improve your health and to discover the cause of your digestive issues. Rather than force you to stumble upon these facts yourself, I'm just going to lay them out for you:\n\n\n1. Your general practitioner (AKA \"family doctor\") does not know anything about your condition. He is not an expert in diseases of the large intestine. With a few exceptions, he is a gatekeeper for the experts that actually can help you. He will only refer you to these experts after you complete a few basic tests. Do them quickly.\n\n\n2. The specialist your GP refers you to is also probably not an expert in your condition. Once you arrive at the specialist's office, ask him what his specific expertise is. It took me a year to realize that my specialist was an expert in *liver cancer*. Womp womp. Your disorder is likely in your large intestine, and your specialist may have spent the years of his fellowship removing nodules from the esophagus. **Ask him who he knows that is an expert in motility disorders, and if he doesn't know anyone, tell him to find one and send you there.**\n\n\n3. You have to elbow your way through the medical system like a Muay Thai fighter if you want to get anywhere. Make your GP give you a referral to a specialist. Make that specialist refer you to the *right* specialist. Make *that* specialist order a bunch of tests. Then make him lay out a treatment plan for you.\n\n\n4. Your insurance is going to act like all of your tests and prescriptions are \"experimental.\" Experimental is insurance-code for \"F*ck you, we aren't paying for this.\" The magic spell to banish this bullshit is the phrase \"medically necessary,\" and only your specialist has the power to utter it. Make sure he does, on all of your prescriptions and test orders.\n\n\n5. Your digestion operates in a cycle - just like your sleep cycle. Pay attention to it, listen to it, memorize it. Know the foods your body hates, know what throws your cycle off, know what improves it. Most importantly, once you have the cycle memorized, track its rhythm over a long period of time. After a year or two, you may notice some changes to the cycle. This information is key.\n\n\n-------------------\n\n\n**TESTS YOU PROBABLY NEED**\n\n\nFirst, work your way through the following tests with your general practitioner:\n\n\n1. *Standard blood panel* to check for any really wacky levels/deficiencies\n\n\n2. *Celiac blood panel* to eliminate the small possibility that you have Celiac\n\n\n3. *Fecal blood test*. Blood = tumors, ulcers, or perforations\n\n\nThen, once you have a referral to a gastroenterologist, have him perform the following tests:\n\n\n4. *Extensive stool cultures*: look for rare parasites. Small chance you have [SIBO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3099351/), very small chance you have [SIFO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25786900), very very small chance you have a [Clostridium infection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3391391/) that paralyzes the bowels. Ask the doctor to ensure Clostridia are tested for.\n\n\n5. *Extensive thyroid panel* (sometimes hypothyroidism causes gastroparesis / slow gut transit. This one's an EASY FIX; pray you have this one). You want a full workup, not the standard one.\n\n\n6. *SITZ Marker Study*: The lab will not know what this is or why you're doing it. Follow the doctor's instructions carefully. Do not take laxatives during this study (it lasts a week) because the point is to identify which specific part of your large intestine is broken (ascending, transverse, descending, rectum). If you accelerate transit by taking laxatives, you will give the lab a false result and it will screw up your treatment.\n\n\n7. *Endoscopy with small bowel aspirate and biopsy; and colonoscopy with biopsy*: If you're under 30 your doctor will fight you on this. He is an obstacle. Defeat him. Also, specify that you want two types of biopsies performed: a normal biopsy of the small intestine to check for Celiac and Crohn's, and an eosinophilia biopsy to check for allergies. They won't do this unless you specifically request it. Don't screw up the pre-op prep, no matter how hungry you get. If your condition is severe enough, ask about the Full-Thickness Biopsy which tests for ganglionic nerve density / Hirschsprung's disease. This is a very serious surgery and I urge you to get a second opinion before having it done.\n\n\n8. *Anorectal manometry and MR Defacography:* The anorectal manometry is critically important for people with severe constipation disorders. It really sucks to get it done, but do it.\n\n\nThe AM / MRD test suite is sometimes described as a \"motility workup\" and it can only be performed at highly specialized GI clinics. You will need to pressure your doctor to help you find one, tell him to contact your insurance company and declare these tests *medically necessary*. This is a battery of humiliating tests to determine if you have PFD or another nerve-related motility disorder. If you have a good sense of humor and are capable of relaxing in embarrassing situations, it'll be easy.\n\n\n9. *CT Scan with contrast*: This is the one where you drink the radioactive dye and lay down inside a space ship. The point is to find tumors, divurticula, obstructions, etc. Ask the radiologist what s/he sees. Sometimes they'll slip up and tell you. They can't say \"You don't have cancer\" (that's for your doctor to determine) but they can say \"I don't see any tumors.\" \n\n\n**Risks:** Some redditors have expressed disagreement with the CT scan's former position on this list (it was higher up), citing the patient's exposure to radiation as dangerous. They argue a CT scan should only be performed after a colonoscopy. To be clear, a CT scan exposes you to much more radiation than a regular X-ray, but only about 1 in 2000 people develop cancer as a result of a CT scan, and that cancer generally occurs late in life. The reality is, the purpose of the scan is to help diagnose and treat a condition that is debilitating and potentially dangerous to you *right now*, and you are weighing that benefit against the potential prospect of cancer later in life. Talk with your doctor about the risks vs benefits. Ask him/her if you should do it before or after a colonoscopy. \n\n\nYou will have a diagnosis after these tests.\n\n\n**If none of these tests result in a clear diagnosis:** see my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/bujy3a/i_made_a_comprehensive_guide_for_those_of_you/f7m3wkp/) for next steps.\n\n\n-----------------\n\n\n**TREATMENTS AND MEDICATIONS**\n\n\n**Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. Make sure to clear each of these with your doctor before proceeding. Do not gamble with your own health.**\n\n\nCycle through these home remedies and request these medications from your doctor, in roughly the following order:\n\n\n* Do all the **stupid fiber crap** just so you can tell your doctor to shut up about it. Fiber does not help people with motility disorders (people like you, probably). It will not help you - unless you have a lack of the *Prevotella* bacterium in your gut microbiome. Increasing your roughage intake and eating a plant-based diet will increase your *Prevotella* count, and might alleviate your condition. If the extra fiber constipates you more, move on.\n\n\n* Cut out all **dairy** immediately for a month. Dairy is delicious and makes live worth living, but it is disgusting and terrible for you. Almond milk, almond milk ice cream, rice milk, dark chocolate...get used to it.\n\n\n* Cut out all **gluten** for a month and stick to it. Wheat is insanely hard to digest for almost all people and it causes nothing but problems for people with bowel disorders. Even if your Celiac panel comes back negative, you still might have Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity, which is still being researched but quite prominent. Many people immediately see results after cutting gluten. But look out - the shit's in BBQ sauce, soy sauce, it's in the air, it's in the water, it's in your pillow, it's *everywhere*. It's as if the USDA has an agreement with US farmers to sprinkle wheat in literally every f*cking food product.\n\n\n* Try the [FODMAP diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/low-fodmap-diet) and stick to it. Eliminate all potential dietary causes of your constipation, then reintroduce them one at a time to identify the culprit. For 90% of you, diet has nothing to do with your constipation. You have a nerve disorder. As a rule of thumb, grains are all difficult to digest and should be avoided, but I've found that potato and corn are easiest, rice is a bit harder, and wheat and oat are the worst. No idea about quinoa. I strongly recommend sweet potato as a healthy filler replacement for breads. It doesn't even need butter!\n\n\n* Try a few high-quality **probiotics**. People with intestinal motility disorders have different gut microbiota than normal people, but scientists aren't sure which is the cause and which is the result. A [2015 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4288092/) showed that *Bifidobacterium*, *Lactobacillus*, and *Prevotella* are significantly reduced in people with functional constipation disorders, and their *clostridia* counts were higher. (*Clostridia* is bad and requires antibiotics. You can determine if you have this by asking your doctor for a Clostridia-specific stool culture test.) Try [Visbiome](https://www.visbiome.com/), VSL#3 if you can find/afford it. Also, try one of [these](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-3-best-probiotics-for-constipation-17940859). You want enteric-coated capsules that are not broken down by your stomach acid so they make it to your intestines.\n\n\n* **Miralax (polyethylene glycol)** is your first line of defense. It's a chemically inert (non-reactive) substance that you mix in water and chug. It's an osmotic laxative, meaning it does not stimulate the nerves/muscles in the intestines. It draws water into the bowel and flushes you out. It works slowly; it might take several days to work. The mainstream medical consensus is that polyethylene glycol is extraordinarily safe and can be used in babies, the elderly, etc. It can be used for years and years. However, there is some evidence now that it's bad for the environment and probably not as good for people as we thought. I'm ignorant of chemistry, but polyethylene sure sounds like plastic to me.\n\n\n* If you need fast relief, go to a health food store with a supplement section and buy a bottle of **Magnesium Citrate powder**. It must be citrate, and it must be powder. Mix 450mg (usually a heaping teaspoon) into a tall glass of water and chug it as fast as you can. Do this on an empty stomach in the morning before breakfast. If your disorder is mild, you will have to take a dump *immediately*. Don't get in the car to go to work for a little bit. MagCit is extremely safe and effective. Doctors prescribe it to old people for years and years with no side effects. But if you have renal disorders (kidney problems) talk to your doctor before trying this.\n\n\nI find that MagCit works best for me right before bed. I have to wake up in the middle of the night to pee out all the water I chugged, but in the morning, I generally am able to empty. By the way, MagCit is also an osmotic laxative.\n\n\n* **Cayenne pepper capsules** have been used in combination with magnesium citrate with great success in some people. The pepper stimulates peristalsis in the large intestine, and the magnesium draws water to the large intestine. Combined, they propel your gut's contents along. These capsules can be obtained at any health food store with a supplement section; you can get them and magnesium citrate in the same store usually. Be warned, some people report a mild burning sensation both in their esophagus and their rectum (basically like when you eat some really spicy food and it gives you the runs). The regimen I've read that works best is a heaping teaspoon of magnesium citrate in a large glass of water, chased with 1 or 2 Cayenne capsules before bed produces a BM the next morning. Start with a low dose. When you buy the capsules, they'll have a heat rating, usually between 40,000 - 90,000 HU. \n\n\n* Request **Lactulose** from your pharmacy. It's basically a sugar that helps with bowel transit. Didn't work for me, but it works for some. \n\n\n* **Docusate** is an OTC stool softener that makes me nauseous and does nothing else, but maybe it'll work for you. MagCit beats its brains out.\n\n\n* **Bisacodyl** is your go-to OTC stimulant laxative. In the US it's known as Dulcolax, but there are off-brand boxes that are cheaper and similarly effective. Use this carefully. It can exhaust the muscles in your intestines, so while you get relief one day, the next two days you're in a refractory period where constipation starts up again. Use 10mg 2x per week if you have insanely bad constipation like me. Don't exceed twice per week. Use 5mg if you're underweight. Safe to use with MagCit. I like using it in the morning on an empty stomach and I'll skip breakfast that day. The more food you have in your digestive tract, the longer it takes. Empty stomach = 2-4 hours, full = 8-12. Long-term use is frowned upon but there's no actual evidence whatsoever that it causes a problem. Read the case studies if you don't believe me.\n\n\n* **L-Arginine** is an over-the-counter supplement available at health food stores. It is used by athletes to increase cardiovascular health, but it has a magic side effect: diarrhea! Why? Because it breaks down into nitric oxide synthase, which regulates bowel transit time, and researchers recently discovered is [deficient in people with motility disorders](https://bit.ly/2WuGrCV). See [this conversation](https://www.ibsgroup.org/forums/topic/352542-unexpected-cure-slow-transit-colonic-inertia/#entry1449238) for more details. Also, taking this supplement with a small amount of baking soda might increase its effect, according to some athletes who experienced intense diarrhea after doing so (they like baking soda because it reduces acid production / muscle soreness). Oral dosages vary from 2-6 grams but some people go higher. Be careful and talk to your doctor first. L-arginine is also available in suppository form and there is good evidence to believe these are safer and much more effective.\n\n\n* **Amitiza (lubiprostone, prescription):** Your doctor might prescribe this first. It's an expensive prescription osmotic laxative. It causes nausea in a lot of people and it didn't work for me, but it's a godsend for some. Try it. Take with a great deal of water. DO NOT TAKE AMITIZA WITH LINZESS, MIRALAX, OR MAGCIT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL OSMOTICS (or behave like osmotics).\n\n\n* **Linzess / (linaclotide, prescription, \"Constella\" in Canada):** This is the most powerful prescription \"osmotic\" (it's actually a Guanylate cyclase-C agonist) in the world, and it will make your ass explode the first time you take it. It comes in strengths of 72mcg (that's micrograms), 145, and 290. I have a lot to say about this medication so read carefully. Also, if you've tried Linzess and it didn't work, please read my [how to make Linzess work guide](https://www.inspire.com/groups/agmd-gi-motility/discussion/guide-why-linzess-fails-and-how-to-make-it-work-again/).\n\n\nFirst of all, it has a mild prokinetic effect (meaning it stimulates your nerves) in addition to its osmotic effect. This is a good thing. Amitiza does not have this.\n\n\nYour digestion is on a schedule. Some of you go every day. Some every other day. Some once a week. Whatever your normal clockwork is, this medication will sometimes work and sometimes not, depending on how much fecal obstruction there is in your intestine on the day. There were times when 290mcg did absolutely nothing for me, and other times 145 made me run wide-eyed to the bathroom fifteen times in thirty minutes. You will figure out how to make this medication work after a lot of trial and error. Don't just dismiss it the moment it doesn't work. \n\n\nI'm of the mind that no human being should ever take 290mcg and it has got to cause long-term damage to the intestines, but all my specialists disagree. They prescribe this dose to women quite frequently for some reason. \n\n\nLinzess has a penchant for working very well for a few weeks, and then ceasing to work at all. Keep it refrigerated (there's a rumor that it goes bad if it gets warm, but pharmacists will not confirm this). Take it with a large glass of water and stay super hydrated all day. Water is key; it cannot work if you don't drink a ton of water with it. If this medication dehydrates you (it will), grab a bunch of those vitamin/mineral powder packets from the health food store and chug one or two a day. If you get bad headaches/migraines/weak pulse/sweats/nausea, you need to just quit the medication and talk to your doctor. Ask him to reduce the dosage.\n\n\nAlthough the prescription for Linzess is once daily, I find it works best for me taken twice per week with another medicine like Motegrity (Prucalopride) or Bisacodyl. I take it on an empty stomach in the morning and don't eat anything until it starts kicking in (which is quite fast...usually under two hours).\n\n\nLINZESS HAS A [BLACK BOX WARNING](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxed_warning) against its usage in persons under 18. It is extremely dangerous to children. If you don't hydrate enough on a regular basis, it is also dangerous to you. It is illegal to give it to your kids. **If you don't have a gallbladder, mention this to your doctor before taking Linzess. I once heard that's an issue, but I can't find a source online. DO NOT TAKE LINZESS WITH AMITIZA, MIRALAX, OR MAGCIT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL OSMOTICS (or behave like them).**\n\n\n* **Motegrity (prucalopride, prescription):** This is a brand new drug, the first in its class, and it's a 5-HT4 agonist. It works similar to some antidepressants, by targeting specific serotonin receptors in your intestines. Except Motegrity is a highly specific agonist, meaning it has a narrower range of side effects and typically won't affect your mood. This drug actually works for me, it worked immediately, it still works. Zero side effects. I take it in the morning on an empty stomach, although it can be taken without regard to food. \n\n\nMost doctors in the US don't even know about Motegrity so ask them to look it up. It's brand new, meaning it's expensive. But don't worry. *All* of these drugs are insanely expensive. As far as I can tell it is safe to take with osmotics like Linzess but I have not confirmed this with a doctor. In my reading, I see no relevant contraindications between the two. \n\n\nThere is a warning in the box that some people committed suicide or experienced suicidal ideation while participating in clinical studies for Motegrity. There is no statistically significant relationship established here, but the company is by law required to make this information public. Frankly, Motegrity has zero side effects on me, and I expect these people killed themselves or thought about it simply because constipation disorders are f*cking horrible and make you depressed.\n\n\nIf you live in the UK, Europe, or Canada, your doctor will know this medication as Resolor or Resotran.\n\n\n* **Zelnorm/Zelmac (tegaserod, prescription):** This drug is similar to Motegrity (insofar that it is also a 5-HT4 agonist). It is older than Motegrity, and considered less safe because it interacts with receptors in a less specified way; there is some evidence that it interacts with cardiac receptors. In plain English this means it *might* be responsible for causing strokes and heart attacks in some patients. The evidence is debatable. 0.11% of people who used Zelnorm in a study experienced cardiac events, compared to 0.01% who took the placebo. That's 13 out of 11,500 people. The drug is available in the US only to women, although your doctor can order it \"off-prescription\" if he deems you low risk. Basically don't try this drug if you are overweight or have any notable cardiac family history.\n\n\n* **Trulance (plecanatide, prescription):** This is the main competitor of Linzess (linaclotide) and has a smaller side effect profile. It appears to work pretty well if osmotics work for you, but I haven't tried it. It also has a mild prokinetic effect (meaning it stimulates the nerves in your intestines). I assume, like Linzess, it is also dangerous to children. Give it a try.\n\n\n* **Mestinon (pyridostigmine, prescription):** This is where it gets weird. Mestinon is a drug that treats myasthenia gravis, which is a nerve disorder similar to MS. But, it can be used to treat constipation in some cases. It's an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, meaning it *increases* your body's levels of acetylcholine. This is a neurotransmitter that is partly responsible for telling your intestines to squeeze. Most doctors will be hesitant to put you on it, but you can give it a try if all else fails. It has a strange side effect profile and causes fainting/blood pressure drops in some people. I never tried it.\n\n\nAn interesting story...there is a woman who did a bit of basement chemistry and figured out that she could spike her acetylcholine levels by literally sticking a nicotine patch on her stomach below the belly button. It caused her bowels to empty after a week of constipation. She then invented [Parasym Plus](https://secure.vagusnervesupport.com/products/parasym-plus%E2%84%A2), a supplement that allegedly does the same thing. I bought this and I cannot figure out if it actually worked. Maybe it did a little.\n\n\nThere are many acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting drugs on the market. Prostigmin (neostigmine) is one of them. Ask your doctor if he thinks it's a good idea. He'll say it isn't. But if all else fails...\n\n\n* **Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate, prescription), or any related SSRI antidepressant:** Antidepressants are now being used to treat constipation. Some clever fellow figured out that the majority of serotonin (the mood-regulating neurotransmitter) is manufactured in your intestine, not your brain, and that antidepressants were giving people diarrhea for some reason. I haven't tried Lexapro but it's next on my list and my doctor likes it because of its small side effect profile relative to other antidepressants. This drug has a wider side effect profile than related constipation meds like Motegrity/Tegaserod, meaning you could have mood swings or drops/spikes in energy, etc.\n\n\nDespite our overwhelmingly negative public opinion about antidepressants, they are rather safe* and effective for many people. It's just that they're over-prescribed. A low dose does help some people normalize bowel function without causing mood/personality changes.\n\n\n*edit: A redditor linked me to [this article](https://rxisk.org/bladder-and-bowel-problems-after-antidepressants/) explaining that some SSRIs can cause long-term GI problems. The comments are worth reading. As with all pharmaceutical drugs, you are weighing your current problem versus the potential side effects of its treatment. Talk to your doctor about the risks and do your own research. Talk to friends and family members who have taken SSRIs.\n\n\n* **Erythromycin:** This is an OTC (I believe) antibiotic with a very odd side effect: it speeds up gastric emptying and gut motility. Hooray! The case studies are kind of back and forth on its efficacy for constipation, but some doctors swear by it. The problem is that it's an antibiotic.\n\n\nHere's the thing about antibiotics. They should not be overused or used unnecessarily. They can *seriously devastate* your gut flora and cause SIBO and worsen your condition. On the other hand, your condition could have already been caused by antibiotics, or by a pathogen that will killed with antibiotics. Proceed with extreme caution.\n\n\n* **Colchicine:** This is an anti-inflammatory derivative of the autumn crocus plant. In large doses it's highly toxic, but in small doses it's used to treat Gout. However, [a recent study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19705134) determined that it's an effective treatment for Slow Transit Constipation / Colonic Inertia (basically any constipation disorder that does **not** involve physical blockage like tumors, obstructions, etc). I haven't tried this but my specialist claims it is quite safe in low doses and he would be happy for me to try it out.\n\n\n* **For those of you who are diagnosed with slow-transit constipation / colonic inertia:** [Here is a master list](https://www.inspire.com/groups/agmd-gi-motility/discussion/masterlist-of-remedies-for-colonic-inertia-slow-transit-constipation/) of treatments.\n\n\n---------\n\n\n**MY PERSONAL REGIMEN:**\n\n\nSome of you have asked about my specific medication regimen. After several years of trial and error, I have found regimens that basically make my life normal again. **Please note** how the regimen evolves over time! Intestinal diseases typically are very transient and change over the years. What works for you now might not work in a while:\n\n\n2012 - 2014: Senna laxative once per week\n\n\n2016: Bisacodyl and Miralax twice per week\n\n\n2017: Magnesium citrate 450mg each morning before breakfast\n\n\n2019: \n\n\n* 2mg Motegrity (prucalopride) daily in morning\n\n\n* 145mcg Linzess (linaclotide) every other day in morning\n\n\n* 450mg Magnesium citrate before bed\n\n\n-----------\n\n\n**EXERCISE**\n\n\nOf all the treatments I've tried, exercise is near the top on the list of effectiveness. Exercise is a conduit for getting all of that stress and potential energy out of your body and away from your guts.\n\n\nGet a standing desk at work (a good company will accept a doctor's note and buy one for you). Stand for half the day, intermittently. Go on jogs in the morning and walks in the evening. Get to the gym and get your knees above your waist - stairmaster, yoga, squats, etc. Just MOVE MOVE MOVE. By doing so you are stimulating the vagus nerve and increasing motility. You will literally shake the poop out.\n\n\nIf you live an incredibly sedentary life, you will suffer much more.\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n**SURGERY FOR EXTREME CASES**\n\n\nPlease visit my updated guide at /r/ConstipationAdvice for new guidance on these surgeries.\n\n\n* For those of you diagnosed with CI, you might be considered for the [TAR IA surgery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180598/), (total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis). This is the laproscopic removal of your entire large intestine and the attachment of your small intestine to your rectum. The nice thing about this surgery is that you still get to go to the bathroom normally, except you have mostly diarrhea for the rest of your life (because your large intestine is the thing that turns diarrhea into solid stool by absorbing water).\n\n\n* The other option is one of many variants of the colectomy (resection or removal of the large intestine) with colostomy or ileostomy. These are both [ostomies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma_(medicine), which is the surgical creation of a hole in your lower abdomen. A medical bag is affixed to that hole, and your small intestine drains into it instead of down into your rectum. This is a much bigger life change, but from the people I've talked to, it's surprisingly not that big a deal.\n\n\nIf you are interested in these surgeries you will have to have a great number of conversations with many doctors and jump through a lot of hoops.\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\n**A NOTE FOR WOMEN AND TEENAGERS**\n\n\nThe feedback I get from most **women** is that their (male) doctors are extremely dismissive and incredulous about the woman's constipation issues. Doctors are going to act like you are crazy and hormonal. They're going to tell you to just eat some fiber and take some miralax and bugger off. You have to be strong, confident, and knowledgeable of your situation. Do not take no for an answer. Inform your doctor that you are *past* the standard constipation treatments and this is an ongoing problem that reduces your quality of life and warrants the attention of a specialist.\n\n\nIt helps if you appear to know what you are talking about. Learn about your [digestive anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract) and understand the difference between your small and large intestine. Understand the [constituent parts of the large intestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine) (ascending, descending, sigmoid, transverse, rectum, etc). This will help you communicate to your doctor more efficiently and it will help you better understand his/her findings. If you show your doctor you've done your homework, it is very likely he/she will take you more seriously.\n\n\nEverything I just said applies to **teenagers**. The additional problem facing you is that you have an extra gatekeeper: your parents, and the fact that you rely on their insurance. You need to have a level-headed conversation with them about your situation, however embarrassing that may be, and convince them that **they need to be advocates for you, not obstacles to you.** Getting them on your side now will benefit you greatly when the doctor questions the seriousness of your complaint.\n\n\n----------------------\n\n\n**A FEW FINAL NOTES**\n\n\n* Read. You aren't going to effectively communicate or convince your doctor of anything unless you have some introductory knowledge of your body. Learn about your [digestive anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract) and understand the difference between your small and large intestine. Simply knowing this information will help you come up with questions about what could be causing your issue.\n\n\n* Save yourself the remarkable headache and get physical and digital copies of the results of every single test you have performed, even simple blood tests. When you inevitably get transferred to a different specialist, having this stack of files will make your life so much easier.\n\n\n* Your insurance company is going to fight you on some of these medications. Tell your doctor to tell your insurance it is an *urgent medical necessity* that they cover this medication. They will fold. \n\n\n* DO NOT GIVE UP. Write down your next steps. Follow up on calls, appointments, etc. I keep lists of all my medical to-do's and I cross them off line-by-line. It gives me a great sense of accomplishment and control over this whole situation.\n\n\n* Relax and get your mind off your condition. This is hard. But there is absolutely a psychological component to your condition. For some people, it's *entirely* psychological (this is called Chronic Idiopathic Constipation or Functional Constipation). **People who suffered sexual abuse in childhood often develop constipation disorders in adulthood.** Google this and investigate it with your doctor!\n\n\nI go on long nature walks with my headphones. This is how I unwind. Some people do Ju Jitsu. Some people do music. Spend time with family and engage in your hobbies. This will absolutely help, especially if your condition is idiopathic in nature.\n\n\n* Intractable constipation is often the result of extreme stress. Have a serious brainstorm about whether you need to quit your high-stress job. Are you in an abusive relationship? GET THE FUCK OUT OF IT. Can you afford a week-long spiritual retreat where you take a vow of silence and eat a vegetarian diet and sit in a garden with a pen and paper? DO IT. Now is the time to try all the weird stuff.\n\n\n* Cry whenever you have to; don't bottle anything up.\n\n\n* Talk to other sufferers about it. Reach out and get involved in a community. Support is everything.\n\n\n-------------------\n\n\nYour enemy has a name. You very likely have a [motility disorder](https://www.iffgd.org/motility-disorders.html). It can be caused by an underlying nerve disorder, blood vessel disorder, mechanical muscle failure, neurotransmitter imbalance, hormone imbalance, or bacterial imbalance. Once you get your diagnosis, you will not feel so confused and lost about how to treat it.",

See a cardiologist (doctor of your circulatory system):\n* Have him listen to lower abdomen for bruit sounds (vascular mumur), which indicate cardiovascular narrowing\n* Test for mesenteric ischema (failure of blood vessels near bowels)\n* Test for wall-thickening and vascular anomalies with a Doppler ultrasound of the mesenteric arteries\n\n\nWhy a cardiologist? Because some vascular diseases can affect bloodflow to the bowel and cause it to stop working properly.\n\n\n2. See a rheumatologist (doctor of your soft tissues and musculoskeletal / connective tissues):\n* Test for general autoimmune diseases\n* Test for Scleroderma of the intestines with dysmotility as the presenting symptom\n* Test for Raynaud syndrome\n* If he looks at you funny, make him read [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5267349/) and [this](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/374383-overview)\n\n\nWhy a rheumatologist? Because some autoimmune diseases cause constipation, and your gastroenterologist won't pick up on them.\n\n\n3. See a neurologist (doctor of your nerves and nervous system) who knows about neurological diseases that affect the digestive tract, OR, if you can find one, locate a neurogastroenterologist (see note below):\n* Bring your full-thickness biopsy results from your colonoscopy\n* Test for AGID (autonomic gastrointestinal dysmotility) \n* Test for autonomic neuropathy and enteric neuropathy\n* Test for intestinal neuronal dysplasia. Make him read [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4986395/#:~:targetText=Intestinal%20neuronal%20dysplasia%20(IND)%20is,as%20Hirschsprung's%20disease%20(HD).) If he doesn't know how to test you for this, tell him to send you to someone who can.\n\n\n**Note:** in rare cases you might be able to locate a neurogastroenterologist, which is a doctor who specializes in digestive disorders caused by underlying nerve disorders. These doctors are extremely rare and you need to do some hardcore Googling and networking to find them. They usually work at \"motility clinics\" so use that in your keyword searches. Ask your gastroenterologist to ask his colleagues to help you find one of these guys.\n\n\n[Here](https://www.agmdhope.org/neurogastroenterology-and-motility-centers/) is a great list of neurogastroenterology / motility clinics in the United States.\n\n\nThe most notable among them include:\n\n\n[Johns Hopkins Center for Neurogastroenterology](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/gastroenterology_hepatology/specialty_centers/motility_neurogastroenterology.html)\n\n\n[Stanford Gastrointestinal Motility Program](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-clinics/gastrointestinal-motility-lab.html)\n\n\n[Temple Health Digestive Disease Center](https://www.templehealth.org/services/digestive-disease/for-physicians/clinical-expertise/motility-disorders)\n\n\n4. See an endocrinologist (doctor of your endocrine system):\n* Bring your thyroid panel results (this was a blood test)\n* Test for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (also known as MEN2) with constipation as presenting symptom. This is extremely rare; only one several thousand people will have this as the cause of their constipation.\n\n\n**Most importantly**, be aware that your disorder might cross the boundaries of medical expertise. This means you might need your gastroenterologist to coordinate testing and treatment, exchange medical notes, etc. YOU must arrange this and STAY ON IT. These people aren't going to do it themselves.",

However, at the chance I might help anyone considering the anti-depressant suggestion - please consider this one very carefully. I actually believe my IBS-C is in large part due to having been on anti-depressants (duloxetine) for depression for approximately 10 years. It was not until I went off of this drug that I developed IBS-C. I have a feeling my body became so reliant on the medication to keep the supply of neurotransmitters high enough to keep my motility normal that when I discontinued my motility just shut down. I don't know if the risk with the suggested Lexapro is lower - but this is something to consider. The long-term impacts of anti-depressant use are real. I have learned to deal with my depression better than I could before I started taking medication, but I would say I am actually probably more depressed than before I took the meds - again because I think my body/brain became reliant on them. Hopefully my body will learn to do this for itself again...",

        "body": "Thanks for this. I often have thought of writing up something similar, but you’ve done a great job!\n\nI wanted to add some comments on magnesium. But first a quick history- Roughly 10 yrs of Chronic idiopathic constipation. I found early on that fiber made it worse, I did a colonoscopy etc... pelvic floor therapy, SIBO and stool tests too, couldn’t find anything. So, just idiopathic. \nHydro-C from the Fiber Menace guy worked, but tasted bad. Lactulose and most OTC meds I tried did not work. I didn’t take Linzess when the GI offered, because Miralax was working without side effects which I worried about with Linzess.\nI also tried 5htp as a supplement- based on the serotonin theory- it didn’t seem to make a difference- but that was a shot in the dark anyway.\n\nHowever I’m saying all that because now, I find Mag Citrate To be just as effective as Miralax, once I found the right brand. First I used Natural Calm (a powder) which would work for a bit then cause disaster pants with a lot of pain. I switched to a Mg Cit pill which didn’t work at all. I tried a different brand pill, combined with a liquid form- RNA reset’s ReMag, and am doing well on them for a month now, most days I have a mostly normal bowel (Bristol type 3-4)  and no disasters and no cramps. Anyway I am assuming that since Magnesium is used by our bodies normally, while Miralax- PEG is basically a plastic, (which I heard also thins the guts mucus lining) that long term Mg is better. I wish someone had told me to try different brands of the stuff sooner. \n\nJust tacking my two cents on to your work! Thank you!",

    "body": "**TLDR**\n\nAge: 36\n\nYears lifting: 13\n\nHeight: 5’5”\n\nWeight: 158 to 196.\n\n1,000 consecutive workouts without a rest day.\n\nIn this period I accomplished numerous goals. Including a [1RM Press of 235 lbs](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5i4OGAAyl_/). (+10 lbs. PR), a [315 lbs. 20-rep max squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5nlw7pgZ04/) (both at 175 lbs. bodyweight), gaining size ([about 20 lbs. of lean mass](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYfsa0hAOr-/)), and stamina (I can shovel snow literally forever). To celebrate the 1,000th day, I completed 33 rounds in a [60-minute AMRAP of a 1,000 lbs. total](https://youtu.be/_M-GCGod4RE) (345 squat, 243 bench, 412 deadlift).\n\n**Introduction**\n\nHello! /u/GZCL ([Cody](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPhXX0CgmbJ/)) here. Creator of the [GZCL Method](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-gzcl-method-for-powerlifting.html) and many popular programs derived from it. A good intro to the method is linked in the [/r/Fitness Wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/).\n\nFor over 1,000 days I have worked out without rest days. That means no days out of the gym, and no counting steps as a workout, nor yoga, and not even shoveling snow… quickly becoming my [least favorite activity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIwyZefLyL4).\n\nAll my workouts used resistance training in some way. Workouts were 99% barbell based and all but about 30 were above 10,000 feet elevation, where my gym is nestled. My training is structured by and progressed through my [General Gainz](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/) training framework.\n\nI accomplished these things by using a simple training framework, being consistent, and patience – the three foundational elements of progress.\n\n**Goals**\n\n· To see if I could.\n\n· Assess potential for overtraining.\n\n· Better regulate my training.\n\n· Improve strength, size, stamina, and the condition of lingering injuries.\n\n· To test and refine my General Gainz training framework and programs derived from it. (Read the above linked reddit post to get an idea of what that looks like.) All my personal training clients have also been lifting within this training framework.\n\nOne client has surpassed a year without a rest day. Read his fantastic write up:\n\n[365 Days and Counting](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2021/).\n\n**Results**\n\nNo missed workouts for 1000 consecutive days (closer to 1,050 now). Nearly all workouts consisted of lifting weights. Only one was bodyweight only (while on vacation, a fast paced, high volume, nauseating bodyweight circuit). Running, hiking, snow shoveling, etc., did not count as a workout, nor did yoga or other such activities. On many days in the winter because I live at over 10,000 feet elevation, I must shovel snow for hours. This I counted as survival, not training. Same for chopping and hauling wood in a sled. [Training is the means to survive easier.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIJuOsogabe/)\n\nBecause I was working out daily, I grew more aware of my recovery limits, thereby avoiding overtraining. This allowed me to better regulate my training as the days continued. Previously, when I was taking rest days, I counted time out of the gym as being a major aspect of recovery. That is a false notion. Because of that former belief I would go too hard in some workouts, figuring that “I would be out of the gym, and so recovering for the next session.” This was not always the case, as some workouts would go on for hours, often performing excessive amounts of sets and needlessly high intensities at all to frequent occurrences.\n\nI had the mindset that a hard workout was always a beneficial workout and that a hard workout meant that I must be puking, shaking, or crawling out of the gym – I was wrong. A beneficial workout is one that produces a positive training stimulus while not increasing recovery debt so much that it inhibits the next workout. As I continued to train within my General Gainz framework I grew to understand this distinction and apply it consistently to my training. This improved the quality and consistency of my training. Compounding interest, but for gains.\n\nI set personal records across rep ranges, from [1RM](https://www.instagram.com/p/B55q4pKggk3/) to 20RM, particularly for [press](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5i4OGAAyl_/) and [squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5nlw7pgZ04/). These are the two lifts that I have favored because they are less stressful on previously injured joints. Six weeks ago I hit a PR 203 lbs. [behind the neck press](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWmTgj5gZu9/) at random. It was just feeling good that day, so I went for it – an unusual decision for me lately – but old habits die hard. This lift improving shows me that my regular pressing is also, despite not currently being in an intensity directed training phase.\n\nThis was not my first bulk. But I do consider it my best. I gained 38 pounds between Day 31 and Day 1,000. Going from a low [of 158 pounds](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwItaivA_2-/) to a high of [196 pounds](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVjId0WA6KI/), with about 25 of those in 2021. I committed 2021 to a long bulk and a body building phase. The words are separated because I do not mean the sport, rather the goal of building muscle, particularly my arms and shoulders, as those were my goals.\n\nFat mass increased by about 5%, going from approximately 12% at 158 pounds bodyweight to 17% at 196 pounds bodyweight. This increased how much lean mass I am carrying by about 23.5 pounds (158\\*.88=139, 196\\*.83=162.6). ~~This means that in about 1,000 days I gained on average 1.4 pounds of muscle (and associated water weight) per month, or .35 pounds per week average. This is the biggest I have ever been.~~\n\n~~(1000 days / 365 = 2.739 years \\* 12 months = 32.868 months / 23 pounds = 1.42)~~ If my math is wrong here, let me know. I’m a pleb history major, not a king math wizard.\n\nMath correction (I knew my math was wrong...): I gained 23 lbs of lean muscle of 32-ish months, hence about 0.7 lbs/month (or 1.4 months per lb). (Thank you /u/itsgilles )\n\nAdditionally, I achieved the goal of rehabbing a hip and shoulder that would often cause pain while lifting and during daily living.  In 2017 and 2018, before these last 1,000 days, I could not even do a bodyweight squat, or bench, or deadlift one plate without pain. That is no longer the case, as I can now squat four plates and deadlift five without those prior issues. Not my best weights for those lifts but considering what they were rebuilt from – it is great progress for me.\n\nThis was accomplished without training either of those lifts with powerlifting-esq training intensities during 2021. Likewise, despite bench pressing maybe five times in 2021, I still managed an easy [293 pound paused single](https://www.instagram.com/p/CW3ZKIsLQ69/). This lift is the one that causes my shoulder the most grief, so I have not trained it much in the last two years (a mistake discussed in the following section).\n\nLastly, during this period I exclusively used General Gainz as the basis for every workout. Doing so improved the concept by expanding and refining the framework. Throughout these 1,000 days it became easier to plan, execute, and assess workouts. Since I began lifting in 2008, my training evolved from random everything to percentage-based powerlifting focused, to volume, intensity, effort relationship based, with a general strength and conditioning focus. In my early powerlifting years, from “[OG GZCL](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-gzcl-method-simplified_13.html)” to [Jacked & Tan 2.0](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/07/jacked-tan-20.html) to [UHF](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/02/gzcl-applications-adaptations.html) and later [VDIP](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/11/volume-dependent-intensity-progression.html). The last of which grew into what became General Gainz.\n\n**Injuries**\n\nThis section is not a prescription or advice. It is meant to describe how I improved the conditions physically ailing *me*. Consult your physician regarding your specific problems.\n\nDo not use reddit to diagnose and treat your injuries!\n\nDuring the 1,000-day period I sustained no major injuries. Only aggravating a previous tear to the right trapezius and rhomboid, and a left groin strain. Both were caused by pushing too aggressively in a single session, causing old injuries (hip and shoulder) to flare up. When this happened, I trained those areas using light resistance and high rep exercises to improve the affected muscles. I would then focus on unaffected muscles and movements, training them with more weight and/or volume.\n\nFor example, when benching caused my shoulder to stiffen or ache, I began to do more overhead pressing, a movement that did not cause such problems. Likewise for deadlift, which affected my hip more than squatting – so I squatted more.\n\nWhen a movement or muscle was giving me problems, I simply ‘worked it out’ in a very literal sense. In fact, years ago I bought a specialty leg press ([Shuttle Systems MVP](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIKA3q2ALIs/)) to help rebuild my hip strength after the joint sustained multiple injuries; the worse of which were not due to lifting, but by falling (I am clumsy and unathletic).\n\nThrough exercise I was able to improve the deteriorating condition of my two problem areas, left hip and right shoulder, thereby gradually improving the lifts that tax them most. Granted, I am not at my [peak powerlifting strength](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvePo-WSuzg), but I have not been training for powerlifting for years now.\n\nWhere I could have done better is the bench press. Between 2012 to 2016 I had strained my right pec numerous times. This coupled with a once dislocated shoulder resulted in a total dislike of the bench by 2017, for even 135 pounds caused serious discomfort. Disheartened (as I once enjoyed the lift) I abandoned it almost completely these last three years. That I should not have done. Instead, I should have committed to regularly benching very light weights, alongside the other kinds of pressing that I had redirected towards (predominately the strict press).\n\nApart from those things described above I sustained no other injuries. Symptoms of overtraining, considered by some a kind of injury, were only experienced after months-long bouts of doing the same lifts daily (squat and press, later deadlift and press). Those symptoms were slight (and perhaps more psychological than physical) and came on the heels of testing High Frequency Undulating Progression (HFUP); a training program detailed in a link below. After ending the HFUP training cycle, symptoms of overtraining disappeared within days. Therefore, I do not think I had overtrained, I was just carrying more fatigue than I was used to at that time.\n\n**Training Organization**\n\nWorkouts were built using my General Gainz training framework the entire period. From that framework, various training plans were built, tested, and improved. Training ranged from periods of high frequency and specificity, where I would do the same lift daily for a month or more (HFUP). Such periods resulted in all-time personal records for press, behind the neck press, and pause squat (linked above). Throughout 2021 I largely stuck to a body building training plan to achieve the goal of gaining size, especially to my arms and shoulders.\n\nI have not done the same program throughout these 1,000 days, but I have stuck to the General Gainz framework, using it to construct numerous progressions to achieve various training goals. Example Training Plans:\n\n[Generally Strong](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2019/10/): A flexible upper/lower split. (Post includes details on applications and adaptations of General Gainz; ideas to implement GG and improve your training.)\n\n[High Frequency Undulating Progression](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2020/01/): (HFUP) Training the same lift(s) daily by changing the reps/sets/weights each workout.\n\n[Wave LP](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/bw6qg0/general_gainz_wave_lp/): 4x Week Full Body. (Built by /u/ctye85) I’ve built and ran a similar progression to Wave LP.\n\n[General Gainz Body Building](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/01/general-gainz-body-building.html): (GGBB) A body part split using supersets. This is the training plan I followed for most of 2021, in some form or another, as I was tinkering with what seemed to work best and changing the workouts as my recovery dictated. This means I was adjusting or changing exercises, order of exercises, volumes, and intensity, so that I could workout frequently – without training an under recovered muscle group. The linked post describes in greater detail a weekly progression outline, schedule options, exercises, supersets, etc.\n\nWith GGBB, I followed (mostly) a split of this nature:\n\nDay 1: Legs\n\nDay 2: Shoulders\n\nDay 3: Back\n\nDay 4: Arms\n\nThese were the muscle groups that were the focus in the workout. I would often do abs alongside legs or back, for example. (I did not train chest intentionally, but if that is your goal, then you can tailor GGBB to suit you.)\n\nI would progress volume first, then once I hit a designated Rep Max (RM) target I would add weight and try to push that new weight to a higher RM. If in a workout I could not add reps to an RM set, I would do more reps in the sets that came after it.\n\nLift variations were used and rotated as I trained with GGBB. Such as doing SSB squat or Romanian deadlifts instead of the standard variety. Same for football bar press or incline bench. I used barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, cables, bands, TRX, etc.\n\nThe above linked posts detail the training plans I used during this period. Each was developed using General Gainz, which works by performing one or a combination of four actions to progress: Find/Hold/Push/Extend. Those concepts and associated progressions are also detailed in the above linked posts. (The GGBB post has a good intro to General Gainz.)\n\nYou can develop your own training plan using the GG framework. If you do, I have high confidence that you will be successful in achieving your lifting goals. GG provides a simple and intuitive organization and direction. Your consistency and patience produce the results.\n\nMy training is based in GG and so is my client’s training.\n\n**How to Train Daily: Prioritize Recovery**\n\n“Gains are made out of the gym” is a cliché.\n\nOne should not consider such a cliché the dominate factor in improving their physicality. People who say such things are often better at giving unsolicited advice than lifting weights.\n\nTo physically improve, it takes physical training. To consistently train, you need to recover – but that does not necessarily mean that sedentary days are required. There is nothing magical about staying out of the gym. Doing so does not guarantee an increased recovery rate.\n\nIf lifting regularly leaves you hobbled for a few days after, then you likely need more physical activity, not less. (And you also need to reassess how your training is set up. Follow a proven plan. Read the [/r/fitness wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/).)\n\nDo more general physical preparedness (GPP) work, like snow shoveling, my favorite, not. If you don’t have snow, then just dig and fill the same hole in the dirt. If you don’t like those options, then push and pull a sled in the gym for an hour a few times per week. The point is that recovery is just as much about your work capacity as it is about your practices and habits outside the gym. None of which require staying out of the gym as a condition for success.\n\nIf you don’t want to lift weights or do manual labor daily, that’s fine. Go for walks, runs, bike – **do** something!\n\nI have been able to recover from my workouts by prioritizing:\n\n1.Eating and hydration.\n\n2. Sleeping.\n\n3. De-stressing.\n\nPeople confuse not going to the gym with recovery because not doing something is easier than working on improving recovery habits. Knowing I had a workout tomorrow, I made those three things bigger priorities in my life. I was also able to better regulate my desire to absolutely crush myself, *because I have the weekend off and need to earn it*. (So I would say years ago.)\n\nTime out of the gym is not the most important aspect of recovery. If it is for you, then you’re probably not prioritizing good recovery habits. An easy workout is better recovery than a hard night out partying, or a late night of Netflix, or a day full of stressed-out consumption of “news.”\n\nOf the things listed above, I did the worst with eating. This has always been trouble for me, but I do think I improved a bit in this aspect these 1,000 days. Having always been a scrawny manlet, getting to 200 lbs. was my goal. I barely missed that. This is due to the many days where I forgot my lunch or was just too consumed by work to eat. I could do better here, and if I had, I know I would have had better results.\n\nWhen it comes to nutrition, I have a consistent diet that is made up of rice, salad, eggs, and various meats. Often in the shape of a burrito.\n\nI also eat a fair share of potatoes and bread but will limit those during a cut period when I am trying to lose weight. I do eat out a few times per month on average, but rarely more than once a week (if that). My most common meal is a salad with rice and beef. Since I was bulking for all of 2021, I simply increased the serving. In 2022, I’ll eat less, but typically the same kinds of foods.\n\nGenerally, my motto is: “If bulking, never be hungry. If cutting, always be.” And I try to bias my eating to the “Green Faces” practice (if it is green or had a face, eat it).\n\nI tend to not track macros closely, nor calories. If I did, I would have had better results. 13+ years of training has developed my ability to gauge my own eating and practice good habits somewhat accurately and consistently. I could do better here, I admit.\n\nAs for hydration: I pee so often it sometimes annoys me.\n\nAlcohol consumption is rarely more than a six pack per week. If I averaged out the number of beers drank over these 1,000 days, it would probably be one to two per week. Some weeks have more than others, especially if I find a beer I have not tried, and it turns out to be good.\n\nI regularly get 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. If I do not, then I try to squeeze in a nap. I try to nap as much as I can. One to three a week on average.\n\nDe-stressing can be hard. To do this I have tried to limit my media exposure, which I determined to be the greatest source of stress for me. Doing so has reduced worrying about things I cannot control. I admit that I could do better, and just delete every social media account and stop watching and reading any current events whatsoever – perhaps later down the road.\n\nI have found that spiritual and philosophical practices are helpful in de-stressing and am working on improving this aspect of my life. Same for reading literature. My favorite book from last year’s reading was Hemingway’s *A Farewell to Arms*.\n\nRegarding supplements, I infrequently consume protein powder. Perhaps 3 to 5 scoops per week. Many weeks not even that much. I try to focus on whole foods as best as I can, and supplement as may be necessary (they’re called supplements, after all). More protein powder is consumed during bulking periods for this reason, as it is easier to get in a few ounces of fluids with 30 grams of protein than it is to eat that much more beef, chicken, or fish. On reflection, I should always have an emergency shaker of protein, just in case I forget my lunch.\n\nAdditional supplements I use are creatine, vitamin D, ZMA, Arginine and Ornithine. I had (have) an unhealthy amount of caffeine daily, but I have recently switched to half-caff and have drastically reduced my energy drink consumption. I try to keep it less than 300mg daily.\n\nAt no point in these 1,000 days have I used prescription or otherwise obtained performance enhancing drugs such as hormones, SARMS, pro-hormones, or steroids. I am not a “lifetime natural.” For about one year, ending in 2016, I tried TRT. I did not find it that helpful and I could no longer justify the cost. Well before that I was a crackhead addicted to Jack3d, which was basically crystal meth… *remembers the good ol’ days* (they were, in fact, not).\n\n**Summary**\n\nOver 1,000 days ago I started lifting daily and have not stopped. I gained size, strength, and stamina. I have not overtrained. The condition of pre-existing injuries has improved and were only aggravated on occasion that I became a knucklehead and did more reps than I knew better to.\n\nAdditionally, I worked through my General Gainz training framework, further developing the concept, and many successful training plans in the process. Several are linked in this post. GG improved my training and my client’s training too. I hope this post improves your training similarly.\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, thank you. I hope you’ve found this information helpful.

Thanks for all the replies, constructive criticisms, etc. Just to be clear I am by no means a scientist or expert on this matter. Just a student who loves ex phys and all things fitness and compiled some research into an assignment for class. If you are looking for references I put them in the comment section a few times when people asked for them.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nCreatine is a nonessential dietary compound (a nitrogenous organic acid) that can either be ingested from exogenous sources such as fish or meat, or produced endogenously, primarily by the liver. Most creatine is found in skeletal muscle. Investigations of creatine as an oral supplement began in the early 1900s with the extraction of creatine from meat. Since then, creatine supplementation has been used for a variety of conditions such as congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, and neuro-degenerative diseases (Greenhaff et al. 1998, Matthews et al. 1998). The most prevalent use of creatine supplementation today is sport or exercise enhancement. Bemben et al. (2005) estimated that more than 2.5 million kilograms of creatine are used each year, with creatine sales increasing to over $200 million in 1998. Furthermore, creatine is not regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration nor banned by the International Olympic Committee or National Collegiate Athletic Association (Mangus).\n\tCreatine supplementation has become very popular among many different generations and populations. In fact, twelve years ago Dempsey et al. (2002) reported that creatine was the most widely used performance-enhancing supplement among youth aged 10-17 years, with 15% to 30% of high school athletes and 48% of male Division I college athletes reporting creatine use. In addition, many recreational exercisers, the elderly, and children as young as 10 of both sexes ingest creatine in hopes of improving physical performance (Grindstaff et al. 1997, Berman et al. 1998, Unnithan et al. 2002). Creatine has been shown to improve strength and hypertrophy, and it appears to be most effective for activities that involve repeated short bouts of high-intensity physical activity (Earnest et al. 1995)\n\tA handful of factors must be addressed before the user considers creatine supplementation. One such factor is the extent to which creatine improves strength. Becque et al. (2000) showed that after resistance training and supplementing with creatine for 6 weeks, arm flexor 1RM increased 29% while in the placebo group, 1RM increased only 16.5%. Earnest et al. (1995) found that creatine increased bench press 1RM by 6% after 28 days of resistance training while placebo decreased 1RM by 3%. Subjects on creatine were also able to bench press 26% more repetitions in a muscle fatigue test after training compared to before training, while placebo subjects neither increased nor decreased in number of repetitions. Volek et al. (1998) showed that after a 12-week resistance program, subjects who supplemented with creatine improved squat 1RM by 32% while placebo improved squat 1RM by 24%. \nAnother consideration is whether creatine induces muscular hypertrophy. Olsen et al. (2006) found that creatine supplementation in association with strength training amplifies the training-induced increase in the number of satellite cells and myonuclei in human skeletal muscle fibers. After 12 weeks of resistance training, Volek et al. (1999) reported that the percentage increases in cross-sectional area for all muscle fiber types in creatine subjects ranged from 29% to 35%—more than twice the increase observed in placebo subjects. Becque et al. (2000) took three upper-arm circumference measurements on all subjects before a 6-week resistance training program. After 6 weeks, subjects on creatine significantly increased all three upper-arm circumference measurements while subjects on placebo did not. However, this increase may be due to water content, which is a side effect discussed later in this paper.\n\tDosage, timing and frequency are other important considerations when supplementing with creatine. Candow et. al (2011) studied frequency by having two groups take equal dosages of creatine, but exercise at different frequencies. One group exercised 2 days per week and the other group exercised 3 days per week.  After testing and analysis, researchers determined that equal-dosage creatine supplementation led to similar gains in muscle thickness and strength between the two groups. Antonio et al. (2013) studied timing of creatine ingestion and determined that post-workout creatine supplementation was more beneficial than that of pre workout with regard to improvement in fat free mass, fat mass, and 1RM bench press. Bemben et al. (2005) discussed creatine dosage. The authors performed a meta analysis and found that dosages were similar throughout most studies. Twenty grams of creatine were typically ingested during the first 4-7 days of supplementation, a phase known as creatine loading. Following creatine loading, subjects consumed 5 grams per day. This appears to be the optimal dosage for effectiveness.\n\tOther benefits of creatine include muscle damage recovery and improvements in fat-free body mass. Cooke et al. (2009) examined creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, which are widely accepted markers of muscle damage, in muscle biopsies of subjects who participated in an exercise session designed to cause muscle damage. They found that subjects who took creatine had lower plasma CK and LDH levels than those taking placebo in the days following exercise. Becque et al. (2000), Volek et al. (1999), and Antonio et al. (2013) found that subjects who supplemented with creatine increased fat free mass more than subjects who took placebo.\n\tThe purpose of this paper is to examine potential mechanisms by which creatine supplementation increases strength and hypertrophy during resistance training. This topic is important due to the many individuals who are supplementing with creatine to increase strength and hypertrophy. As the use of creatine supplementation continues to increase, so does the need to investigate its effects on the human body.\n\n\n**Rationale for Use and Mechanism of Drug Action**\n\nIndividuals who supplement with creatine typically do so in order to receive ergogenic benefits or an improved physique. Some individuals take creatine specifically to increase strength. Increasing strength benefits nearly all athletes, especially those involved in contact sports such as football. For example, increased strength would improve the performance of an offensive lineman who must constantly push against heavy forces. In addition, some individuals ingest, or are prescribed, creatine in order to change their physical appearance. Males, specifically, tend to desire a physique in which their muscles are larger and fuller. Other individuals, such as the elderly, may be prescribed creatine as a therapeutic strategy. Gotshalk et al. (2002) found that 7 days of creatine supplementation (0.3 g per kg) in older men was effective at increasing several indices of muscle performance and functional tests. These tests included 1RM for leg press and bench press, maximal isometric strength, upper and lower-body explosive power, timed sit-stand test and tandem gait test. This could reduce the loss in muscle strength that occurs with aging and increase performance of functional living tasks.  \n\tThere are several lesser-known purposes of creatine supplementation. One such example is the prescription of creatine for individuals with congestive heart failure (CHF). These individuals tend to have abnormalities of skeletal muscle. These abnormalities may be an important determinant of symptoms in those with chronic heart failure. Greenhaff et al. (1998) found improvements in skeletal muscle endurance and metabolic response to exercise after creatine supplementation in patients with CHF. Subjects who took creatine increased maximum voluntary contraction in handgrip exercise while those who took placebo did not increase muscle contraction. Those who took creatine also decreased lactate and ammonia (markers of fatigue) levels in the blood 30 minutes post exercise, while those who took placebo did not have decreased levels of lactate and ammonia. This study means creatine could result in substantial symptomatic improvement in these CHF patients. Kuethe et. al (2005) also found that short-term creatine supplementation, in addition to standard medication in patients with CHF, led to an increase in body weight and an improvement of muscle strength. Creatine is also prescribed to those with neuro-degenerative diseases. For example, Matthews et al. (1998) found that treatment with creatine may be a novel therapeutic strategy to slow or halt neurodegeneration in Huntington’s Disease as well as other neurodegenerative diseases in which deficits in energy metabolism are indicated. Dedeoglu et al. (2003) and Hersch et al. (2006) also found evidence of creatine supplementation having neuroprotective effects on those with Huntington’s disease.\n\tCreatine is first synthesized by a two-step process involving three amino acids (arginine, glycine and methionine) in the liver, kidney and pancreas. It is then released into the blood. Since creatine is produced outside the muscles, it must enter the muscle cell against a concentration gradient. Creatine enters the cell via Cr transporter-1, a sodium-dependent transporter (Bemben et al., 2005). About 95% of the body’s total creatine is found in skeletal muscle, and the remaining 5% is in the heart, brain and testes. In skeletal muscle, 40% of the creatine is in free-form (Cr) and 60% is in the phosphorylated form (PCr). PCr levels are higher in type II (fast twitch) muscle fibers compared to type I (slow twitch) fibers. (Bemben et al., 2005). Supplementing with oral creatine increases skeletal muscle creatine concentration by 16 to 50% (Dempsey et al., 2002). When the body needs to excrete creatine, it is converted to creatinine. Creatinine is a byproduct of muscle metabolism that is derived from Cr and PCr. Creatinine is filtered in the kidneys via diffusion, sent to the bladder, and excreted through the urine.\n\tCreatine acts via several mechanisms. When an individual takes part in high-intensity, short duration activities such as lifting weights or sprinting, skeletal muscle cells require immediate availability of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). PCr is the primary energy storage molecule for the rapid rephosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) back to ATP by the creatine kinase (CK) reaction. This reaction provides muscle cells with more ATP, which is required for the reactions involved in muscle contraction. ATP is needed to bind actin and myosin to form a cross-bridge. ATP must also bind to myosin to break the cross-bridge and enable the myosin to rebind to actin at the next muscle contraction. Creatine also helps to deliver more oxidatively-produced ATP via a process termed the PCr shuttle (Bessman et al., 1981). The PCr shuttle process occurs when free Cr diffuses toward the mitochondrial membrane. At the inner mitochondrial membrane, a phosphate is transported and Cr is phosphorylated again into PCr. This PCr then diffuses back toward the myosin heads of the muscle. PCr is transported back and forth; hence, it is called the PCr shuttle. \nCreatine also has the capacity to buffer pH changes in the muscle. Muscle acidity occurs at the onset of physical activity due to hydrogen ion accumulation and results in decreased muscle pH. This leads to decreased muscle performance. Creatine buffers the pH by utilizing the excess hydrogen during the CK reaction and rephosphorylation of ADP to ATP (Mesa et al., 2002). \nCreatine also regulates glycolysis. When energy demands increase during exercise, PCr concentrations decline. The body must now find another way to rephosphorylate ADP. This is accomplished by an increase in glycolytic flux. Glycolytic flux is stimulated by phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is a key glycolytic enzyme. This enzyme is partly inhibited when PCr is present. Therefore, the decrease of PCr consequentially results in increased glycolysis (Volek et al., 1996). Supplementing with creatine increases the amount of PCr available in the body, thus delaying glycolytic flux. \n\tSome researchers have offered alternative explanations as to how creatine contributes to muscle hypertrophy. Poortmans et al. (2000) suggested that creatine may cause an osmotic loading effect resulting in the movement of extracellular water into the muscle cell, which is a stimulus for protein synthesis. Hespel et al. (2002) suggested that creatine can shorten relaxation time during maximal isometric contraction by facilitating calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Change in body mass due to creatine supplementation is a controversial topic that is still being researched, but most studies report significant increases in body mass.\n\n**Side Effects, Risks, and Prevalence for Abuse/Misuse**\t\n\nAccording to Bemben et. al (2005), researchers tend to agree about the side effects of creatine supplementation. No strong scientific evidence supports serious adverse effects. A majority of reports have been minor and purely anecdotal. Dempsey et. al (2002) found that in two retrospective trials no adverse effects were reported from longer term creatine supplementation. Both studies were up 4-5 years. However, there have not been many long-term studies exploring side effects and more research is needed. Some reported side effects include gastrointestinal pain, renal and liver function problems, muscle cramping, and water retention (Bemben et al., 2005).\n\tGastrointestinal distress is the most frequently reported side effect of creatine supplementation. Mesa et al. (2002) and Poortmans et. al (2000) reported that if creatine is insufficiently dissolved or if it is ingested during or immediately after exercise, it causes an upset stomach. However, when a placebo group has been included in a double-blinded study, there appears to be no detrimental effect on the GI system (Romer et al., 2001). Poortmans et al. (2000) investigated renal function following creatine supplementation by examining urinary creatinine clearance. Subjects took individual doses from 1 to 20 g creatine up to 1 to 4 doses per day. Daily doses were ingested every day of the week for a period from 10 months to 5 years. The researchers found no indication of impaired renal function. Bemben et al. (2005) explained that most reports of muscle cramping following creatine supplementation have been anecdotal and unverified. Researchers speculate that those who experience cramps do so due to the high intensity of the workout or to a disruption in electrolyte balance (Mesa et al., 2002). \n\tEarly changes have been observed in body weight following creatine supplementation. Researchers believe that this is probably due to increases in body water, specifically in the intracellular compartments within the muscle cell (Mesa et al., 2002, Kern et al., 2001). Researchers speculate that the reason for the increase in intracellular water is the increased osmotic load associated with the elevated creatine concentrations within the cell. Increased intracellular water should be kept in mind when reading studies that claim creatine is directly responsible for hypertrophy. Increases in muscle cross-sectional area may be attributed to increased muscle hypertrophy, but the increase in size may actually be due to intracellular water retention. \n\tIt appears that the benefits of creatine far outweigh the risks. Mangus et. al explained that most creatine users would argue that the greatest benefit from its use is in activities that require rapid muscle recovery throughout the exercise period. When surveyed, most athletes demonstrated a good knowledge of the actual reported adverse effects. Although athletes acknowledge the potential risks associated with creatine supplementation, they continue to use it as a supplement because they do not believe the risks are long term or cause any physiological changes in their bodies. \n\n**The Mechanisms Behind the Muscle**\n\nIt would be difficult to dispute the evidence that supplementation of creatine in addition to resistance training improves strength, hypertrophy, and performance. Volek et al. (1999), Becque et al. (1999), Earnest et al. (1995), Dempsey et al. (2002), and Olsen et al. (2006) are just a few of the many published works that have shown greater 1RM increases in those who supplement with creatine compared to those on placebo. Earnest et al. (1995), Volek et al. (1999), Cooke et al. (2001), along with many others, found that performance factors such as total anaerobic work, fatigue, peak power, and isometric and isokinetic knee extension peak torque improved more in creatine groups compared to placebo. Becque et al. (1999), Earnest et al. (1995), Volek et al. (1999), and Candow et al. (2011), Olsen et al. (2006), and Antonio et al. (2013) revealed greater increases in body mass, fat-free mass, mean muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and arm thickness in creatine groups compared to placebo groups. These increases, however, may only be due to extra intracellular fluid. It is important to understand why the body responds this way when supplementing with creatine in conjunction resistance training.\nThe majority of researchers that showed improved strength and performance when supplementing creatine used the same basic type of exercise when testing their subjects. Subjects typically performed exercise that involved short periods of extremely powerful activity in repetitive bouts separated by short rest periods. This type of exercise primarily involves type II muscle fibers, which are fast-twitch fibers that are activated during quick and powerful anaerobic exercises. Volek et al. (1999) conducted a double blind study in which one group consumed 25 g of creatine per day and one group consumed a placebo. Both groups underwent a 12 week resistance training program. After the 12 weeks, researchers took muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscles of the subjects. The results showed a significant increase in the size of type II fibers in creatine subjects compared with placebo. The creatine group increased type IIA 36% and IIB 29% while placebo only increased type IIA 15% and type IIB 8%. These results indicate that additional creatine in the body enhances these type II muscle fibers, thus giving individuals on creatine an advantage in anaerobic-type exercises. Cooke et al. (2001) helps provide an explanation as to why creatine improves performance and strength during anaerobic, high intensity exercise. Researchers had 14 subjects perform 4 sets of 10 eccentric-only repetitions at 120% of their maximum concentric 1-RM on the leg press, leg extension and leg flexion machine. Blood samples were taken following exercise and examined for markers of muscle damage such as creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The creatine group had, on average, 84% lower plasma CK and plasma LDH than placebo after 48, 72, and 96 hours. This means that the creatine-supplemented group had an enhanced rate of muscle function recovery. Olsen et al. (2006) supported these findings by obtaining muscle biopsies of 32 males (age 19-28) who were split into creatine and placebo groups. All subjects resistance trained 3 times per week for 16 weeks. The creatine group consumed 3 g of creatine before and after each training session. At the conclusion of the 16 weeks, biopsies showed that the subjects in the creatine group increased their number of satellite cells significantly more than placebo. In addition, the creatine group resulted in an increased number of myonuclei per fiber and increased 14-17% in muscle mean fiber. This demonstrated for the first time in human skeletal muscle fibers that creatine supplementation amplifies the training-induced increase in satellite cell number and myonuclei concentration, and thus potentially muscle generation.\nAs stated earlier, creatine’s primary mechanism of action is the increased delivery of ATP to the muscle and increased PCr resynthesis. This increase improves overall muscle energy and function. More ATP availability to the muscle would provide increased energy, and increased PCr resynthesis would delay fatigue and hasten recovery in an individual taking creatine. When adding up the components, it makes sense that creatine leads to improved strength and performance. Increased ATP, enhanced type II fibers, and faster recovery all give an advantage to individuals who are trying to improve strength and power.\nThe other aspect of creatine involves hypertrophy and increased body mass. Candow et al. (2011) examined body mass, fat free mass, and arm circumferences in 23 males before and after 6 weeks of training. One group took 5 g of creatine 4 times daily for 5 days and then took 2 g of creatine every day for the remainder of the study. The other group took a placebo. Body composition was taken via hydrostatic weighing, and muscle thickness was measured using B-mode ultrasound. After 6 weeks, body mass increased 2.3% in the creatine group while it only increased 0.2% in the placebo group. The creatine group increased elbow flexor muscle thickness by 20%, while placebo only increased 2.3%. The authors suggested that although both groups had increased stimulation rate of muscle proteins after resistance training, this response was delayed in those who didn’t supplement with creatine. Additionally, one other proposed mechanism of hypertrophy is water retention. Balsom et al. (1995) suggested that creatine may alter the hydration status of muscles cells, resulting in increased mass. Bemben et al. (2005) stated that creatine may cause an osmotic loading effect, resulting in the movement of extracellular water into the muscle cell. Although there is a ample literature regarding the mechanisms behind hypertrophy, these studies can only go as far as suggesting mechanisms. Conclusive mechanisms are still being studied.\n\tSome studies found that creatine did not have any ergogenic effects. Stevenson et al. (2000) conducted an 8-week study with 18 resistance-trained subjects who were assigned to either creatine or a placebo in a randomized, double-blind fashion. The creatine group took 20 g for 7 days and then 5 g per day for the remainder of the study. During the 8 weeks, EMS was applied to the left quadriceps femoris twice weekly while all subjects continued voluntary resistance training of both lower limbs unsupervised. Cross-sectional area of each quadriceps femoris was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After 8 weeks, the results showed that the average cross-sectional area of the left quadriceps femoris increased equally in the creatine in placebo groups. In addition, maximal torque did not differ between the two groups. Dempsey et al. (2002) conducted a meta analysis and found that other than maximal resistance exercise performance, there is insufficient evidence that creatine improves other measure of strength, such as cycle ergometry sprint peak power or isokinetic dynamometer peak torque. The effect of creatine on endurance, submaximal exercise, or actual “on-field” athletic performance was not addressed.\n\n**Summary and Conclusion**\t\n\nAfter reviewing much of the literature and research regarding creatine supplementation, it is evident that creatine is ergogenic, but only in specific modes of exercise. Creatine supplementation primarily benefits those who are performing short bouts of intense exercise, especially with short rest times between sets. Individuals who take creatine in conjunction with resistance training will increase maximal strength more than they would without creatine. In addition, individuals will be able to resist fatigue longer (during short-duration anaerobic exercise) than they would if they were not taking creatine. Creatine has also been linked to increases in muscle size and body mass, but this has not been the case in all studies. In addition, the mechanism behind these increases still remains unclear. More studies need to be conducted in order to identify if and how creatine may cause increased body and muscle mass. Another aspect that must be researched more is side effects associated with long-term use of creatine. Sports performance and endurance training are areas that also need more attention. Although it is sometimes assumed that increased strength will increase sports performance, this isn’t necessarily the case. Reaction time, coordination, flexibility, and a number of other variables affect performance in each individual sport. Thus, research should be done to see exactly how creatine could boost performance in specific sports. \n\tIn conclusion, supplementing creatine while resistance training would be beneficial to individuals who want to gain an extra edge in terms of strength and (possibly) hypertrophy. Creatine offers a safe and affordable way to improve these parameters without risking your health, as seen in those who turn to anabolic steroids and prohormones instead. Creatine (like all drugs and substances) should be taken as directed and used in moderation, or side effects could emerge. For those who want to “play by the rules” yet maximize performance, creatine is one option you can’t go wrong with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "I'm guessing most readers will want to know A does it work and B how should they use it. \n\n It is worth mentioning that the improvements you report in those studies are only an average and that not all individuals improve performance and that some actually get slightly (probably not significantly) worse. We wouldn't want to make false promises. It would also have been helpful if you summarised the appropriate dosage and pattern of intake that should be used (i.e. 20-25g daily for 6 days followed by 2-3g for a further 21-28 days- no one knows what is best after then).\n\nEndurance training probably doesn't need looked at more. The mechanisms of action don't aid anything beyond short term performance and repeated short bouts. As most people gain weight through water retention it is also likely that there is a exercise time at which that weight gained causes an overall drop in performance. Its unlikely too much more mechanistic research into creatine will be done in the future as we know most of what we need to find out about it. This was certainly the opinion I got when visiting Paul Greenhaff's group and when he came to visit.\n\nSO FAR, no one has found sufficient evidence that creatine use is harmful to health. This doesn't mean its risk free. It means that if it is harming you that we don't know how or to what extent. Obviously it can't be that bad as nobody is dropping dead using it but the sort of research that is needed to tell you if its knocking 2-3 years off your lifespan just hasn't been done. In fact very little work has been done at all. Be aware that the risks are unknown.\n\nYou've clearly put a lot of work into this. It is a little bit of an information dump tbh. With a bit of work on structuring of arguments and a bit more critique it could make a pretty nice essay. Currently you've *described* a lot papers but some of your interpretations are a bit hazy e.g. when you said \"The creatine group had, on average, 84% lower plasma CK and plasma LDH than placebo after 48, 72, and 96 hours. This means that the creatine-supplemented group had an enhanced rate of muscle function recovery\" - you can't say muscle function recovered without having been measured. These are just markers of damage. Just wanted to add some friendly constructive criticism. To add a little perspective, if we want to help the redditors of this sub I think sources like a student's term paper should be summarised in lay language and give practical guidelines and importantly give a wholly critical review of research. \n\nLets be clear:\nYou cannot say creatine IS ergogenic - this is misleading.\nYou can say creatine can be ergogenic or has shown to on average have an ergogenic effect on a group.",

    "body": "Very tired parents here. We were at our wits ends with our 9 month old. Doctors were useless “lol he’ll grow out of it, moisturize and use these steroids for now.” Rebounds after steroids made it worse than before. We were lucky to sleep for 2 hrs each for almost a month straight. \n\nI spent a whole weekend on PubMed doing research. Turns out people with eczema are colonized by staphylococcus aureus instead of good bacteria.  We started treating the baby for staph and taking steps to encourage other bacterias to take hold, including applying topical probiotics. There’s been a few successful trials using strains of bacteria to treat AD, and we had nothing to lose.  \n\nWe got a 98% reduction in symptoms within a week. \n\nI’ll make a detailed post sooner or later, but a shift in treatment philosophy might be useful for some of you guys.\n\nEdit: Wow so much positive response! I’m getting a lot of questions from people asking for brief outlines of what I did, so hopefully this tides you over:\n\n1.  Look up MRSA decolonization procedures and follow them. Get yourself some Hibiclens (chlorhexidine soap) and a topical mupirocin prescription. Don’t use the mupirocin for more than 10 days. Be aware that staph can build resistance to chlorhexidine. Bleach baths can be effective/soothing but do not actually kill bacteria (concentrations are far too low). The exact mechanism behind bleach baths are still unknown. Edit: I found a cool study that actually showed that bleach baths over the long term (a month and longer) actually led to changes in the skin’s microbiome composition. Less staph and more good guys!\n\n2.  Get a good oral probiotic and some topical probiotic sprays (several available on Amazon). Bacillus subtilis and coagulans help kill/inhibit staph. Others help outcompete the staph. We rotate several to maintain a diversity of species. \n\nStreptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus johnsonii, vitreoscilla filiformis, and bifidobacteriums are what you should be looking for to help outcompete staph and help your skin with ceramide production and healing. There has been a very interesting study on roseomonas mucosa but it doesn’t seem to be commonly available. Just because a bacteria hasn’t been studied doesn’t mean you should stay away, just that we simply don’t know. These will not live on skin permanently and fix you long term. Frequent reapplication is needed. \n\nIf you cannot access probiotic sprays, get probiotic capsules with high CFUs (less filler, more active spores) and mix them with hydrogel (currently using McKesson) and apply that topically. Hydrogels seem to be one of the most effective spore carriers that helps the spores to adhere and germinate. Hydrogel also moisturizes. If you need more info on specific probiotics, I answered that somewhere in the comments. Short answer: Garden of Life Skin+ is good but also has lycopene that turns it red. If the red is a problem, you can buy the bacteria strains I listed individually and blend them together.  When I go this route, I just open the capsules and pour out like a quarter of each of them into a few mL’s of hydrogel, mix it up, and apply. \n\n3. Use prebiotics (microbial foods for good bacteria) like GladSkin (arginine is a prodrug for urea; has protein complex that feeds bacteria) and MiteBGone (contains sulfur. It stinks, but it feeds good bacteria and staph doesn’t like it; also contains tea tree oil which is known to inhibit staph). Smart lotion contains both sulfur and hydrocortisone, but we prefer to apply topical steroids infrequently and separately.  Daily hydrocortisone use can thin the skin and has other drawbacks you can look up. \n\n4. Moisturize. Our go to is EpiCeram (prescription only in US; contains lipids the skin needs to repair itself). \n\n5. Other stuff: Amerigel Hydrogel contains oak tannins that fight staph and is an astringent that helps weeping wounds heal and is a great moisturizer. Aloe and coconut are also nice moisturizers that staph does not like.  Edit: As time goes on, the more impressed I am with this Amerigel. It’s being used in long term wound care to prevent staph/MRSA because it doesn’t seem to create resistance. And I’m talking pretty gnarly wounds, like diabetic ulcers on feet. \n\nDon’t just take my word for it! Start googling or searching PubMed for “topical probiotics atopic dermatitis” and the stuff I’ve mentioned. Unfortunately, this is a shotgun approach by a desperate dad, and not a scientific approach. I can’t tell you which of these treatments are the most important/effective. But it’s a shotgun approach that at least has some evidence behind it.  Look for scientific journal articles and reviews. Any other sources like health/beauty sites and mommy blogs should be taken with a grain of salt and further investigated through PubMed. The science is out there!  \n\nEczema is crazy complex, poorly understood, and can have many causes. Just because this worked for us doesn’t mean it will work for you. My infant has had zero negative reactions to anything I’ve listed here, but make sure you research ingredients and spot test before slathering anything on your child or yourself. But I truly hope this helps some folks.\n\nEdit 2/Update: The scope of this project has broadened considerably as I get sucked further down this rabbit hole. \n\nI am currently on a side quest exploring acidification of skin as a therapy. The severity of AD flare ups directly corresponds to ph. The higher the pH, the worse the flare up. \n\nThere have been studies that found that found acidification of skin with polyhydroxyl acids (PHAs) not only prevents AD development, but halts the atopic march in murine models. They simply added PHAs to Cetaphil. Cetaphil is usually ph 7.4; the researchers brought down to ph 2.8. I will be incorporating skin acidification into our routine for our son.  Edit/Update: we’ve also been using AmLactin rapid relief and a lotion (Neostrata) with PHA for a week now and so far so good!  My wife can’t stand the smell of the MiteBGone, so I only use it when she’s away at work. I still want to keep tea tree oil in the rotation, so we add a drop here and there to other treatments.\n\nYes, I’m still working on this paper. The scope keeps getting larger and larger as time goes on and I sift through more and more research papers. Life is crazy rn and it will take some time, but I’ll finish eventually.  I was a molecular neuroscience and biochem nerd in another life, and I never expected to be teaching myself all the pathways involved in atopic dermatitis, yet here we are.\n\nEdit 3 or 4: Over the past 10 days, the importance of acids has been apparent. AmLactin Rapid Relief has become the moisturizer we reach for the most. Very fast redness relief, not a single hint of flaring since we started using it (still using the other stuff throughout the day too).  We cover him head to toe immediately after the shower/bath. Using it in conjunction with the Neutrogena PHA cleanser and the Eczemact Body Wash has been huge for us. Switching to ph balanced cleansers have also allowed us to increase the frequency of bathing. Things are going very, very well over here.\n\nEdit 5 (almost 6 months later): Our son is still clear and free!  We still use the AmLactin and PHA lotion in rotation, but we only moisturize once per day (twice if he takes a bath, which happens every 2-3 days). We haven’t had to use mupirocin or hydrocortisone in months. Every few weeks, we might see that purplish tint to his skin that precedes a flare up. When that happens, we use a dab of Hibiclens and it clears up within a few hours. We are still applying topical probiotics, but only once per day. \n\nThe most recent round of IgE testing has revealed that he is no longer allergic to soy, wheat, or oats. We have incorporated those foods back into his diet with zero problems. He is still allergic to peanuts and diary, but he is now less sensitive to both. He went from level 5 to 3 for peanuts and level 4 to 3 for dairy, 5 being the most allergic. We’re on the right track. It really does seem that we’re reversing the atopic march. \n\nThe amount of love I have received for this post has been unreal. 6 months later, I am *still* getting regular DM’s from patients and parents saying that this has changed their life, with many reporting total relief. I am so glad my combing through the research has helped so many people, I and am truly touched by all your messages. Seriously, it makes my day when I hear from someone who is enjoying a better quality of life. What a great community. \n\n2/19/2024 Edit:  [This NIH-funded study](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/probiotic-markedly-reduces-s-aureus-colonization-phase-2-trial) found that a specific strain of b. subtilis (MB40) resulted in a major reduction (95% in gut, 65% in nostrils) of staph colonization. \n\nThe MB40 is available for a reasonable price from AmeoLife. Some success stories from other anti-staph subreddits have started to trickle in. Personally, we have just incorporated it into our routine. I think this could be HUGE, since our guts and nostrils are reservoirs for reinfection. (Side note: make sure everyone in your house decolonizes together) Will update about after allowing the probiotic to do its thing for a while month. \n\nIn the meantime, we are switching to HU58 b subtilis and megasporebiotic for topical use. Unfortunately, the AmeoLife has other ingredients besides probiotics, so we’re avoiding it for topical use. The megasporebiotic has some other bacillus strains known for skin-colonizing and anti-staph properties. However, I can’t vouch for its safety or efficacy yet. Use at your own risk. \n\n2/21/2024 Edit:  So there have been some pretty promising studies on Vitreoscilla filiformis extract. It’s a prebiotic that’s selective for good bacteria. Looks like a new product line from L’Oreal was released that contains said VF extract. I’m particularly interested in the “La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+” that’s endorsed by the National Eczema Foundation. It should be available online and at major retailers. I’m gonna pick some up. I’ll add that while my son def isn’t having a flair up, this is the worst his skin has looked in months. Winter sucks. ",

Consider bleach baths to help manage skin bacteria.\n2. **Introduce Probiotics**:\n   * Use oral and topical probiotics to restore good bacteria. Look for strains like *Bacillus subtilis*, *Streptococcus thermophilus*, and *Lactobacillus*. Reapply frequently since they don’t stay on the skin long-term.\n3. **Use Prebiotics**:\n   * Apply prebiotics like GladSkin or MiteBGone to feed good bacteria and inhibit staph. Be mindful of ingredients like sulfur and tea tree oil, which staph dislikes.\n4. **Moisturize Regularly**:\n   * Moisturize with products like EpiCeram or AmLactin Rapid Relief. These help repair the skin and reduce redness. Apply after bathing and throughout the day.\n5. **Balance Skin pH**:\n   * Incorporate acidic lotions like AmLactin or polyhydroxyl acids (PHAs) into the routine to maintain a low skin pH and prevent flare-ups.\n6. **Hydrogels**:\n   * Use hydrogels mixed with probiotics if topical sprays aren’t available. Hydrogels help carry probiotics and moisturize the skin.\n7. **Adjust as Needed**:\n   * Monitor and rotate treatments to maintain good bacteria and stop staph from building resistance.

Ive done extensive allergy testing, contact dermatitis testing .. nothing seems to be triggering my eczema allergy wise. I read this post and was inspired to try to treat eczema as staph since staph seemed to be the root cause of my very first severe eczema outbreak. Prior to my MRSA infection, I had manageable eczema on elbows and back of knees - nothing extreme. However, post MRSA infection i now have eczema all over my neck/face + other areas of my body. My facial eczema has lead to depression..

I pump the solution on to a clean face towel and apply to all outbreak areas (face, neck, body.. all of it). My face eczema seemed to clear up almost immediately after the first application of the Chlorhexidine Gluconate 4% Solution\n\n-Apply steroid cream to active bodily outbreaks (I plan on doing this temporarily while i get the current outbreak under more control). I am using **triamcinolone 0.1% ointment**.  \n-At night I apply [**AmLactin Intensive Healing 15% Lactic Acid**](https://www.amazon.com/AmLactin-Relief-Restoring-FragranceFree-ParabenFree/dp/B08R8SSB4G/ref=asc_df_B08R8SSB4G/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693406448376&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14968031231296168105&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9019578&hvtargid=pla-1237320524775&psc=1&mcid=fcf29dc449d4380380238f7818b3f73f&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw9IayBhBJEiwAVuc3fn4Pt0r4ecYm1DOgxMBMlNwdKaWqB9uPPrD3gpcZ1vRaI1aulo1tSRoC__0QAvD_BwE) to my face, I haven't tried this on my body yet because it does burn slightly and temporarily.

I love love love your post because I too have always believed there was a staph component. I have done most of my own research as well and I feel like when you make suggestions to a dr at times they can become offended…. I’ve worked with them and for them for years and I just can’t figure it out. But I’m so excited to have come across your research, and we’re going to start the process. I hope we’re able to convince the dr to prescribe the mupirocin!! Fingers crossed. Thank you for your time, your brain, and your commitment to finding a treatment, no one understands like a desperate heart broken parent. I totally get it. I wish you continued success for your baby, and for all of us!!",

        "body": "I am mid 50s and maybe ‘just came down with’ likely eczema, and potentially hives that are potentially something else, and digestive issues. It all started happening a year ago. Eczema hit about 5 months ago on my neck and jaw and then my hands. Very painful on my hands. Hurt to touch things. I have been into improving my gut for years but fell off right before 2020. Then I am pretty sure I had Covid in 1/20. (U.S. didn’t even think we had it back then, but I’ve never had that kind of “flu” in my life.)Then I was vaccinated pretty late in the game cuz I had to for work or it’d be a p.i.t.a. for me plus I’m old. So I got vaccinated. Then I got Covid again anyway in 12/22. \n\nMeanwhile, at work, and since 2020 in the U.S. in general, hand sanitizer was happening for me and everyone else probably almost every day. Not sure if two bouts of Covid, or the vaccine I got, or the antibacterials I was using left and right, or all three together caused my eczema/potentially hives/horrible digestive issues I’ve been dealing with for six months, but I’d never had ANY of these things before. \n\nWhy are we not connecting eczema—at least hand eczema—to stripping the good bacteria from our hands? Or the virus stripping it from our gut? (Even tho I never took meds for it, the virus itself could’ve wreaked havoc on my gut microbiome.) \n\nI’d never had any of these three horrible problems before. Stopped using hand sanitizer and antibacterial soaps etc. when I all of a sudden had an aha moment one day. I had been blindly following what I was told, even though I did and do believe the gut and skin microbiomes are so important and am anti meds in general. I can’t even remember the last time I took antibiotics. Anyway, there I was this anti-med, gut microbiome believer not making the connection between all the antibacterial everything and my issues. But when I stopped using them, my eczema gradually dropped off to either unnoticeable levels it had been at my entire life or got 95% under control. The hives thing is tapering down. The diarrhea I had every dang day has gone. I’ve had tests and they can’t find the root of the digestive issues. Coincidence? I don’t know but I’m back to making kombucha, sauerkraut, pickles and not using sanitizer….just like I was doing precovid. So far so good…except the hives/bites thing….two weeks free of those and the jury is still out. \n\nFeel like doctors in the U.S. are very very pharmaceutically-oriented. Research will continue but I think the microbiome is more strongly connected to our health than we have proof of…for now. Time will eventually reveal the connections. \n\nSo glad your baby is doing better. ☺️",

We were leaning toward it being an infection right from the start as he had a weepy impetigo-like wound on his ear, but docs dismissed it.  When he came up in rashes we had urticaria diagnosis and ‘it’s just eczema, here are some steroids’. Back then I hadn’t found your thread, so none the wiser. Over the space of 6 months he got worse and worse and it culminated with two weeks in hospital with suspected sepsis / scarlet fever and scalded skin syndrome.  Until they finally gave it and swabbed the ear and managed to isolate the staph they were fighting they kept throwing antibiotics at him which never worked as the staph was resistant.  We finally got there and we’re now a month off ABx and using your protocols, pre and pro biotics and the staph decolonisation steps we seem to be winning! No sings of eczema now, just occasional flares which I attribute to bacterial die off as the toxins are worked out.  We’ve gone from a hospital bound bandaged boy to a thriving young man full of energy who finally loves life again.\n\nI wish I’d found this thread sooner, I feel if we’d known what we know now back then we could have avoided a year in hell, and treated this before the infection spread out of control.\n\nBest of luck to everyone fighting this.  Don’t give up!\n\nAnd thank you to OP, for taking the time to share and spread knowledge, we’re indebted to you",

    "body": "[last july](http://imgur.com/XbrzR)\n\n[yesterday](http://imgur.com/yOKYN)\n\nJust putting this out there because the scale is BS.  Act healthy, eat healthy, and be healthy!\n\nedit because the MAN got all up in my GRILL about posting progress pics.\n\nSo here's my story:  I'm currently 27 years old, 5'8\" tall.  Last july i became interested in getting serious about working out.  I had suffered from back problems probably not totally unrelated to the beer gut you see in the before picture.  I was freshly out of a long term relationship and, for the first time in my adult life, free to do as I pleased.  I decided to learn about strength training and I reasoned that given my naturally stocky build I probably would not ever look like Usain Bolt, but I could probably gain a good bit of muscle and power.  I read Starting Strength and Stronglifts, Madcow, smolov, and similar programs and developed a consistent weightlifting routine 3x a week, steadily increasing weight as I went on.  I have experimented with a number of supplements and currently do a 3x daily ECA stack, mainly for appetite control and energy.  I also take creatine, fish oil, D-3 and multivitamin daily.  I've also been experimenting with beta alanine, L-Tyrosine, Taurine, and 1,3DMAA and I have noticed positive effects from them.  I have also played with L-carnitine, L-arginine, and a number of other amino acids but I've dismissed most of them as broscience for now.  Currently my workout routine is MWF or MWS of the following lifts:\n\n*  5x5 upright row or pendlay row\n*  5x5 overhead press\n*  5x5 heavy low-bar back squat\n*  5x5 lat pulldowns\n*  5x6 weighted dips\n*  5x7 barbell curls\n*  5x10 pushups\n\nnaturally this will vary from time to time, I may do bench press, deadlifts, farmers walk, or axe chops depending on how I'm feeling but it's basically the above sequence, just with a little more weight each week.\n\nFor most of my progress I ate around 1800-2000 calories a day in a cyclic ketogenic diet with carb-up weekends.  I probably drink too much for optimum health but lately I've cut that out of the week and isolated it to weekends only.  My waist has gone from 42 inches to 36 inches, my biceps from 13.5 to 15.5, my 3-lift powerlifting total is around 850lb, inching toward that magical 1000lb barrier.  I no longer get headaches or back pain and my perception among my peers has gone from being the fat guy to being the fitness guy.  I still have a long way to go, my goal is to eventually be around 170lb with roughly the same lean body mass I have now and I figure that I should be there around next august.  Thanks for all your support!\n\nFinal edit:  During keto my weight got as low as 185lb but mostly hovered around 188-190.  I am currently off-keto and on a moderate-carbohydrate whole-foods diet at around 2500-3000 calories a day.  I'm going to try to gain as much muscle mass as I can until the end of august then just maintain as I go back into keto.",

Nathan Wolfe dedicated his book \"Viral Storm\" to Israeli spy Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Gates and is BFF with Israeli spy Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nHere's the archived website for Ghislaine Maxwell's TerraMar company listing Nathan Wolfe and David de Rothschild as Founding Citizens: https://web.archive.org/web/20120715091022/https://theterramarproject.org/\n\nHere's the Nathan Wolfe biography from the University of Houston website (https://archive.is/NOoIZ) which confirms Wolfe works for DARPA, EcoHealth, and Bill Gates: \n\n>He has received research support totaling over $20 million in grants and contracts from the **Google.org, The Skoll Foundation, NIH, the National Science Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation**, the National Geographic Society, Merck Research Laboratories and various branches of the **U.S. Department of Defense, including: the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance & Response System (GEIS), HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP), and the U.S. Military HIV Research Program (USMHRP).** He has extensive consulting experience and has served on a number of advisory and editorial boards, including, since 2004, the editorial board of **EcoHealth** and since 2008, **DARPA's Defense Science Research Council (DSRC).**\n\nGood short documentary on Nathan Wolfe showing his Google-funded \"Global Viral\" company commissioned Wuhan Bat Lady Shi Zhengli to collect bat coronaviruses as early as 2013 for genetic engineering\nhttps://youtu.be/Q8UgtUtDDp8?si=rtVbLNeSElmDwTkz\n\nMe exposing Nathan Wolfe for creating COVID-19 on Alex Jones show: https://rum ble.com/v4tpk46-keeny-on-alex-jones-show-562019-round-2.html\n\nPresident Joe Biden's former stenographer Mike McCormick exposing Nathan Wolfe for creating COVID-19 on Alex Jones show a month after me: https://banned.\nvideo/watch?id=668c748b1c5e795c46db9ff3\n\n\"Did virus hunters cover up a lab leak?\" (Good article about the Global Virome Project headed by Nathan Wolfe and Peter Daszak and which began in a Rockefeller Foundation establishment)\nhttps://archive.is/G8Lp8\n\n**April 2018 US State Department Cable: \"China Virus Institute Welcomes More U.S. Cooperation on Global Health Security\"**\n\nhttps://foia.state.gov/Search/Results.aspx?searchText=&beginDate=&endDate=&publishedBeginDate=20200716&publishedEndDate=20200716&caseNumber=\n\n\"Chinese funding for the project would likely come from CAS (Chinese Academy of Sciences).

Eventually every single of the 16 virus databases managed by the WIV was taken offline.\n\nhttps://archive.is/i79eW\n\n\n\n**Here's former CDC director Robert Redfield under oath before the Congress on Wuhan Lab September 2019 events:**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/aXXWRaM-sWQ?feature=share\n\n\n>I will say if you go back and look, it's declassified now, and I'm sure you all have your classified briefings, but the declassified information now: \n\n>In September of 2019, three things happened in that lab, one is they deleted the sequences, that was highly irregular, researchers don't usually like to do that\n\n>Second thing they did was they changed the command and control of the lab from the civilian control to the military control. Highly unusual, and I've been involved in dual use labs when I was in the military.\n\n\n>And the third thing they did which I think is really telling is they let a contractor redo the ventilation system in that laboratory. So I think  clearly there was strong evidence that there was a significant event that happened in that laboratory in September. It's now been declassified, you can read it. I'm sure there's more classified information around it.\n\n**Scientist Richard Ebright**\n\n>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction. And here is a proposal from the beginning of 2018 [from Fauci/Gates-funded EcoHealth Alliance] proposing explicitly to engineer that sequence at that position in chimeric lab- generated coronaviruses.\n\n- Richard Ebright, an eminent molecular biologist at Rutgers University, https://archive.is/cCBUw\n\n**Eminent Virologist David Baltimore of CalTech**\n\n>When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine [humanized] codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.\n\n- David Baltimore, an eminent virologist and former president of CalTech, https://archive.is/yalCe\n\n\n**Former CDC Director Robert Redfield:**\n\n>I was concerned because of the presence of the furin cleavage site that we've talked about and I think it's important to understand what that cleavage site does. That cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of COVID, so where before it could not see the ACE2 receptor which is the human receptor, it totally changes the orientation now so it has high affinity for human receptors. So that furin cleavage site bothered me, it didn't seem like it belonged there. \n\n>And then if you look at the sequences they use in those 12 nucleotides for arginine, where the arginine sequence nucleotide triplet were coded for humans. So why did it have the arginine coding for humans and not bat? It was very disconcerting to me. It looked like this virus was engineered.\n\n\n>It's not scientifically plausible that this virus went from a bat to humans and became one of the most infectious viruses that we have for humans. \n\n\n\n**Scientist Valentin Bruttel:**\n\n>I tried to raise awareness to this for a year now.\nWIV use BsaI and BsmBI/Esp3I sites before to make synthetic WIV1 variants.\nAnd exactly those sites appear in a \"silently introduced, perfect for synthetic assembly\" pattern in SARS2, but non of its nat. relatives.\n\n>seriously, what is the chance that exactly those type IIs restriction appear or disappear through random evolution in a Banal-20-52 like virus?\n5-6 precise mutations in 30000bp?\nabout 1 in 10^20!\nSARS2 is clearly synthetic!\n\n**Type Ils restriction sites prove a synthetic origin**\n\nSynthetic RNA viruses are assembled at the DNA level and later transcribed. 30,000 nucleotides cannot be synthesized in one go. These viruses are therefore assembled from smaller, 2- 8,000 nucleotide long pieces. Specific DNA restriction sites are often added to later reassemble the individual building blocks in the correct order. It is also technically possible to hide these interfaces (No See'em), but this was not done in the WIV.\n\nIn a 2017 paper, two very specific, particularly suitable type Ils restriction enzymes were used at the WIV. These have the advantage that they can produce different DNA overhangs (sticky ends), which are crucial for a correct assembly of the complete genome: Bsal and BsmBI.\n\nSARS2 shows a Bsal and BsmBI restriction site pattern which is ideal for assembling synthetic viruses and to later replace the spike protein or furin cleavage site.\n\nBsal and BsmBI restriction sites also exist in closely related viruses (Banal20-52, RaTG13), but these are distributed in such a way that an artificial virus could never be generated using the methods established at WIV 2018/19. \n\n**The probability that the required 5 synonymous mutations, which enable a synthetic assembly of SARS2, arose purely by chance is less than 1 in 10^20 or about as likely as winning the lottery jackpot 3 times in a row.**\n\nDr. Valentin Bruttel\n\nhttps://twitter.com/VBruttel/status/1566365635680124929?t=koDQ9poynY6I9qSchgQAnw&s=19",

    "body": "I have been training seriously for 3 years. I cut every summer, but I took my body to the limits this time.  I made this cut a practice run for a competition that I would like to do in the future.\n\nPhotography by David Ford July 18th 2012 [Album](http://imgur.com/a/GFoJt#0)\n\nHeight: 5’9.5”\n\nAge: 24\nStarting Weight March 5th 2012: 185lbs\n\nDay before the Photo shoot July 17th 2012: 150 lbs\n\nSkin fold Measurements July 17th 2012 (in mm):\n\n\t\tTriceps – 3.6\n\t\tAbdominal – 7\n\t\tSubscapular – 7\n\t\tThigh – 7.2\n\t\tChest – 2.2\n\t\tCalf – 4.1\n\t\tMaxillary - 4.2\n\t\tBicep – 2.2\n\t\tLower Back – 6.4\n\t\tSuprailiac – 3.7 \n\t\tParrillo Caliper Method – 7.8% Body Fat\n\nDiet: \n\nI have tried two approaches in dieting, a cyclical ketogenic diet (CKD) and a clean eating style of diet. When I was on the CKD diet I lost a tremendous amount of body fat but I also lost a ton of muscle. A clean style diet was a better approach for me this year and it spared nearly all of my muscle.\n \nI ate 1.2 g/lb of protein and gradually increased to 1.5 g/lb as I crept closer to my goal. I kept my fat at 20% and carbohydrates made up the remaining calories. My calories were kept at 14 calories/lb and I ate 6 times a day.\n\nFor major protein sources I consumed chicken breast, egg whites, cottage cheese and protein powder. For carbohydrates I had oatmeal, brown rice, and fruit (mostly bananas). My fat sources were almonds and natural peanut butter. My vegetable consumption was not limited so I was to able to eat as much as I wanted.\n\nI had hot sauce and mustard for condiments. No ketchup the entire time. No refined carbohydrates! However, I did allow myself to have diet pop and one cheat meal per week.\n\nThree weeks out from my photo shoot I stopped having cheat meals. Two weeks out I started to gradually increase my water consumption to 7-8L per day. 7 Days out I stopped having all spices (salt, pepper, and condiments). I did a three day carbohydrate depletion followed by a 3 day carbohydrate load and gradually decreased my water to almost nothing (0.5L day before).\n\nSupplements: \n\nPre Workout – EC Stack (Ephedrine 24mg, Caffeine 200mg – only on lifting days), Arginine, Taurine, Beta-Alanine.\n\nPost Workout – 2 scoops protein (approx 50g protein), Beta-Alanine, Creatine Monohydrate, 1 or 2 bananas.\n\nWater Drop – PVL Watertight for 10 days.\n\n\nTraining: \n\nDay 1 – Chest/Tri\n\nDay 2 – Back/Bi/Core\n\nDay 3 – Quads/Hamstrings\n\nDay 4 – Shoulders\n\nDay 5 – Full Body Recovery/Core\n\nDay 6 – Cardio (7 km outdoor run or elliptical/bike for 45mins)\n\nDay 7 – Rest\n\nConclusion: Overall I'm extremely happy with the results and I finally have the confidence now to do a competition!\n\n**Edit1: Working through the comments everybody and answering questions. I'm trying to make the best responses possible. Ask Away!**\n\n**Edit2**: Ab Routine: 2 cycles, no rest between exercises.\n\n*High incline ab crunch with weight behind head x15\n\n*High incline leg raise and lift bum, lower back, off the pad straight up at the top of the lift x15\n\n*Oblique crunch on oblique bench with weight x15 on each side\n\n*Ab Roller x 15\n\n*Side to side oblique crunch with legs up with weight x25\n\nReally hard to describe the names\n\n**Edit3**: Water Drop/Carb Depletion:\n\nThe idea with the depletion is to deplete your body of its glycogen stores both in the liver and muscle. I did this for 3 days, and i had no carbohydrates in my diet. You train in the higher rep range with less rest between sets to burn off all the glycogen stores in your body.\n\nBy doing this you create an environment where your body is basically starving for carbs. When you carb load (approximately 50% more carbs then usual) your body responds by super saturating the muscles with glycogen therefore making you look harder and fuller. You also drop your water intake at this time to promote water flowing into your muscle with the glycogen and releasing the water from under your skin.\n\nso 3 weeks out increase water to 6-8L.\n\n6 days out - carb depletion, normal water \n\n5 days out - carb depletion, 10L water \n\n4 days out - carb depletion, 8L water \n\n3 days out - carb load, 6L water \n\n2 days out - carb load, 2L water \n\n1 days out - carb load, 0.5L water \n\nday of photoshoot- no water\n\nThe water cycling is to trick your body to drop your water from under your skin to make you tight and ripped. I also took a diuretic to lose as much water as possible.\n\n**Edit4**\nSample Day 1 sets x reps\n\nBB Bench Press 5x8 or 5x5\n\nDB Incline Bench Press 4-5x6-8\n\nIncline DB Fly 3x10\n\nFlat DB Fly 3x10\n\nCable Rope Tri Extension 5x8\n\nCable Single Arm Tri Extension or Cable Rope Overhead Tri Extension (Cable French Press)  3x8-10\n\nI workout approximately 90 mins on lifting days.\n\nSwitch up the exercises or rep ranges once and while  (at least every 8 weeks) for periodization. \n\n\n**Edit5 Added new images to the album!** \n\n**Edit6** Sample Meals\n\nmy breakfast shake is delicious and easy. 1 scoop vanilla protein, liquid egg whites (1/2 cup) and coffee. Gives a specialty coffee place a run for its money. Plus i had a half cup of plain oatmeal.\n\n\nAlso my dinner was 150 grams of chicken, 2/3 cup of rice, veggies, and 1/2 cup of cottage cheese. throw some mustard in there and hot sauce. Microwave. The liquid in the cottage cheese makes a nice sauce!\n\n\nHomemade granola was my snack. 1/3 cup of raisins, 1/2 cup toasted oats (homemade in a frying pan) and like 20 almonds. Delicious. \n\n**I find simple foods are generally the healthiest like, oatmeal, fruits, rice, almonds. Little or no cooking involved and they will nourish your body. Don't spend too much time making complicated food because it will become a chore and monotonous. Make it easy to eat so that its harder to cheat.**\n\n**Edit 7** THE EC STACK\nThis is taken directly from an essay I wrote last semester:\n\nEphedra/Ephedrine: “Ephedra increases the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine [which] stimulates [the] α- and β- andrenergic receptors” (Manore, 2012, p. 3).The effects are similar to caffeine as ephedra increases thermogenesis, heart rate, and alertness (Manore, 2012, p. 4). It also has some appetite suppressing qualities. When taking both ephedra and caffeine together they work synergistically to promote increased fat oxidization then taking them separately (Manore, 2012, p. 5). “Two double-blind RCTs lasting 6-9 months reported greater weight loss (~3-5kg) and fat loss (~1.5-4.3kg) with ephedrine alkaloids (40-90mg/day) and caffeine (100-192mg/day) versus a placebo in overweight or obese individuals” (Manore, 2012, p. 5).\n\nManore, M. (2012). Dietary supplements for improving body composition and reducing body weight: where is the evidence?. International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, 22, 139-154.\n\n**Edit8** Full Body Recovery\n\nSuper Set 1: No break between exercises, 10 reps per exercise, 3 cycles, 90-120 sec rest\n\n* DB Row\n\n* Air Squat\n\n* DB Bench Press\n\n\nSuper Set 2: No break between exercises, 10 reps per exercise, 3 cycles, 90-120 sec rest\n\n* BB Military Press (press from front then press from back = 1 rep)\n\n* BB Squat (I use same weight from military press)\n\n* Pull Ups or Chin Ups if you can (lat pull down if not)\n\n\nSuper Set 3: No break between exercises, 12 reps per exercise, 3 cycles, 90-120 sec rest\n\n* Rope Tri Extension\n\n* DB Standing Bicep Curl (strict, no cheating!)\n\n* DB Side Raise\n\nThen finish with some core work!\n\nNotes: Choose weight that will only give a minimal burn (if at all). This workout is designed to give a pump and blood flow to all the muscle groups in your body to promote recovery. This is NOT a muscle building routine. Enjoy this workout it is supposed to be fun and give you a great pump! \n\n",

    "body": "**TLDR**\n\nAge: 36\n\nYears lifting: 13\n\nHeight: 5’5”\n\nWeight: 158 to 196.\n\n1,000 no-rest days.\n\nIn this period I accomplished numerous goals. Including a [1RM Press of 235 lbs](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5i4OGAAyl_/). (+10 lbs. PR), a [315 lbs. 20-rep max squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5nlw7pgZ04/) (both at 175 lbs. bodyweight), gaining size ([about 20 lbs. of lean mass](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYfsa0hAOr-/)), and stamina (I can shovel snow literally forever). To celebrate the 1,000th day, I completed 33 rounds in a [60-minute AMRAP of a 1,000 lbs. total](https://youtu.be/_M-GCGod4RE) (345 squat, 243 bench, 412 deadlift).\n\n**Introduction**\n\nHello! /u/GZCL ([Cody](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPhXX0CgmbJ/)) here. Creator of the [GZCL Method](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-gzcl-method-for-powerlifting.html) and many popular programs derived from it. A good intro to the method is linked in the [/r/Fitness Wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/).\n\nFor over 1,000 days I have worked out without rest days. That means no days out of the gym, and no counting steps as a workout, nor yoga, and not even shoveling snow… quickly becoming my [least favorite activity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIwyZefLyL4).\n\nAll my workouts used resistance training in some way. Workouts were 99% barbell based and all but about 30 were above 10,000 feet elevation, where my gym is nestled. My training is structured by and progressed through my [General Gainz](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/) training framework.\n\nI accomplished these things by using a simple training framework, being consistent, and patience – the three foundational elements of progress.\n\n**Goals**\n\n· To see if I could.\n\n· Assess potential for overtraining.\n\n· Better regulate my training.\n\n· Improve strength, size, stamina, and the condition of lingering injuries.\n\n· To test and refine my General Gainz training framework and programs derived from it. (Read the above linked reddit post to get an idea of what that looks like.) All my personal training clients have also been lifting within this training framework.\n\nOne client has surpassed a year without a rest day. Read his fantastic write up:\n\n[365 Days and Counting](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2021/).\n\n**Results**\n\nNo missed workouts for 1000 consecutive days (closer to 1,050 now). Nearly all workouts consisted of lifting weights. Only one was bodyweight only (while on vacation, a fast paced, high volume, nauseating bodyweight circuit). Running, hiking, snow shoveling, etc., did not count as a workout, nor did yoga or other such activities. On many days in the winter because I live at over 10,000 feet elevation, I must shovel snow for hours. This I counted as survival, not training. Same for chopping and hauling wood in a sled. [Training is the means to survive easier.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIJuOsogabe/)\n\nBecause I was working out daily, I grew more aware of my recovery limits, thereby avoiding overtraining. This allowed me to better regulate my training as the days continued. Previously, when I was taking rest days, I counted time out of the gym as being a major aspect of recovery. That is a false notion. Because of that former belief I would go too hard in some workouts, figuring that “I would be out of the gym, and so recovering for the next session.” This was not always the case, as some workouts would go on for hours, often performing excessive amounts of sets and needlessly high intensities at all to frequent occurrences.\n\nI had the mindset that a hard workout was always a beneficial workout and that a hard workout meant that I must be puking, shaking, or crawling out of the gym – I was wrong. A beneficial workout is one that produces a positive training stimulus while not increasing recovery debt so much that it inhibits the next workout. As I continued to train within my General Gainz framework I grew to understand this distinction and apply it consistently to my training. This improved the quality and consistency of my training. Compounding interest, but for gains.\n\nI set personal records across rep ranges, from [1RM](https://www.instagram.com/p/B55q4pKggk3/) to 20RM, particularly for [press](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5i4OGAAyl_/) and [squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5nlw7pgZ04/). These are the two lifts that I have favored because they are less stressful on previously injured joints. Six weeks ago I hit a PR 203 lbs. [behind the neck press](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWmTgj5gZu9/) at random. It was just feeling good that day, so I went for it – an unusual decision for me lately – but old habits die hard. This lift improving shows me that my regular pressing is also, despite not currently being in an intensity directed training phase.\n\nThis was not my first bulk. But I do consider it my best. I gained 38 pounds between Day 31 and Day 1,000. Going from a low [of 158 pounds](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwItaivA_2-/) to a high of [196 pounds](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVjId0WA6KI/), with about 25 of those in 2021. I committed 2021 to a long bulk and a body building phase. The words are separated because I do not mean the sport, rather the goal of building muscle, particularly my arms and shoulders, as those were my goals.\n\nFat mass increased by about 5%, going from approximately 12% at 158 pounds bodyweight to 17% at 196 pounds bodyweight. This increased how much lean mass I am carrying by about 23.5 pounds (158\\*.88=139, 196\\*.83=162.6). ~~This means that in about 1,000 days I gained on average 1.4 pounds of muscle (and associated water weight) per month, or .35 pounds per week average. This is the biggest I have ever been.~~\n\n~~(1000 days / 365 = 2.739 years \\* 12 months = 32.868 months / 23 pounds = 1.42)~~ If my math is wrong here, let me know. I’m a pleb history major, not a king math wizard.\n\nMath correction (I knew my math was wrong...): I gained 23 lbs of lean muscle of 32-ish months, hence about 0.7 lbs/month (or 1.4 months per lb). (Thank you [/u/itsgilles](https://www.reddit.com/u/itsgilles/) )\n\nAdditionally, I achieved the goal of rehabbing a hip and shoulder that would often cause pain while lifting and during daily living.  In 2017 and 2018, before these last 1,000 days, I could not even do a bodyweight squat, or bench, or deadlift one plate without pain. That is no longer the case, as I can now squat four plates and deadlift five without those prior issues. Not my best weights for those lifts but considering what they were rebuilt from – it is great progress for me.\n\nThis was accomplished without training either of those lifts with powerlifting-esq training intensities during 2021. Likewise, despite bench pressing maybe five times in 2021, I still managed an easy [293 pound paused single](https://www.instagram.com/p/CW3ZKIsLQ69/). This lift is the one that causes my shoulder the most grief, so I have not trained it much in the last two years (a mistake discussed in the following section).\n\nLastly, during this period I exclusively used General Gainz as the basis for every workout. Doing so improved the concept by expanding and refining the framework. Throughout these 1,000 days it became easier to plan, execute, and assess workouts. Since I began lifting in 2008, my training evolved from random everything to percentage-based powerlifting focused, to volume, intensity, effort relationship based, with a general strength and conditioning focus. In my early powerlifting years, from “[OG GZCL](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-gzcl-method-simplified_13.html)” to [Jacked & Tan 2.0](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/07/jacked-tan-20.html) to [UHF](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/02/gzcl-applications-adaptations.html) and later [VDIP](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/11/volume-dependent-intensity-progression.html). The last of which grew into what became General Gainz.\n\n**Injuries**\n\nThis section is not a prescription or advice. It is meant to describe how I improved the conditions physically ailing *me*. Consult your physician regarding your specific problems.\n\nDo not use reddit to diagnose and treat your injuries!\n\nDuring the 1,000-day period I sustained no major injuries. Only aggravating a previous tear to the right trapezius and rhomboid, and a left groin strain. Both were caused by pushing too aggressively in a single session, causing old injuries (hip and shoulder) to flare up. When this happened, I trained those areas using light resistance and high rep exercises to improve the affected muscles. I would then focus on unaffected muscles and movements, training them with more weight and/or volume.\n\nFor example, when benching caused my shoulder to stiffen or ache, I began to do more overhead pressing, a movement that did not cause such problems. Likewise for deadlift, which affected my hip more than squatting – so I squatted more.\n\nWhen a movement or muscle was giving me problems, I simply ‘worked it out’ in a very literal sense. In fact, years ago I bought a specialty leg press ([Shuttle Systems MVP](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIKA3q2ALIs/)) to help rebuild my hip strength after the joint sustained multiple injuries; the worse of which were not due to lifting, but by falling (I am clumsy and unathletic).\n\nThrough exercise I was able to improve the deteriorating condition of my two problem areas, left hip and right shoulder, thereby gradually improving the lifts that tax them most. Granted, I am not at my [peak powerlifting strength](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvePo-WSuzg), but I have not been training for powerlifting for years now.\n\nWhere I could have done better is the bench press. Between 2012 to 2016 I had strained my right pec numerous times. This coupled with a once dislocated shoulder resulted in a total dislike of the bench by 2017, for even 135 pounds caused serious discomfort. Disheartened (as I once enjoyed the lift) I abandoned it almost completely these last three years. That I should not have done. Instead, I should have committed to regularly benching very light weights, alongside the other kinds of pressing that I had redirected towards (predominately the strict press).\n\nApart from those things described above I sustained no other injuries. Symptoms of overtraining, considered by some a kind of injury, were only experienced after months-long bouts of doing the same lifts daily (squat and press, later deadlift and press). Those symptoms were slight (and perhaps more psychological than physical) and came on the heels of testing High Frequency Undulating Progression (HFUP); a training program detailed in a link below. After ending the HFUP training cycle, symptoms of overtraining disappeared within days. Therefore, I do not think I had overtrained, I was just carrying more fatigue than I was used to at that time.\n\n**Training Organization**\n\nWorkouts were built using my General Gainz training framework the entire period. From that framework, various training plans were built, tested, and improved. Training ranged from periods of high frequency and specificity, where I would do the same lift daily for a month or more (HFUP). Such periods resulted in all-time personal records for press, behind the neck press, and pause squat (linked above). Throughout 2021 I largely stuck to a body building training plan to achieve the goal of gaining size, especially to my arms and shoulders.\n\nI have not done the same program throughout these 1,000 days, but I have stuck to the General Gainz framework, using it to construct numerous progressions to achieve various training goals. Example Training Plans:\n\n[Generally Strong](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2019/10/): A flexible upper/lower split. (Post includes details on applications and adaptations of General Gainz; ideas to implement GG and improve your training.)\n\n[High Frequency Undulating Progression](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2020/01/): (HFUP) Training the same lift(s) daily by changing the reps/sets/weights each workout.\n\n[Wave LP](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/bw6qg0/general_gainz_wave_lp/): 4x Week Full Body. (Built by /u/ctye85) I’ve built and ran a similar progression to Wave LP.\n\n[General Gainz Body Building](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/01/general-gainz-body-building.html): (GGBB) A body part split using supersets. This is the training plan I followed for most of 2021, in some form or another, as I was tinkering with what seemed to work best and changing the workouts as my recovery dictated. This means I was adjusting or changing exercises, order of exercises, volumes, and intensity, so that I could workout frequently – without training an under recovered muscle group. The linked post describes in greater detail a weekly progression outline, schedule options, exercises, supersets, etc.\n\nWith GGBB, I followed (mostly) a split of this nature:\n\nDay 1: Legs\n\nDay 2: Shoulders\n\nDay 3: Back\n\nDay 4: Arms\n\nThese were the muscle groups that were the focus in the workout. I would often do abs alongside legs or back, for example. (I did not train chest intentionally, but if that is your goal, then you can tailor GGBB to suit you.)\n\nI would progress volume first, then once I hit a designated Rep Max (RM) target I would add weight and try to push that new weight to a higher RM. If in a workout I could not add reps to an RM set, I would do more reps in the sets that came after it.\n\nLift variations were used and rotated as I trained with GGBB. Such as doing SSB squat or Romanian deadlifts instead of the standard variety. Same for football bar press or incline bench. I used barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, cables, bands, TRX, etc.\n\nThe above linked posts detail the training plans I used during this period. Each was developed using General Gainz, which works by performing one or a combination of four actions to progress: Find/Hold/Push/Extend. Those concepts and associated progressions are also detailed in the above linked posts. (The GGBB post has a good intro to General Gainz.)\n\nYou can develop your own training plan using the GG framework. If you do, I have high confidence that you will be successful in achieving your lifting goals. GG provides a simple and intuitive organization and direction. Your consistency and patience produce the results.\n\nMy training is based in GG and so is my client’s training.\n\n**How to Train Daily: Prioritize Recovery**\n\n“Gains are made out of the gym” is a cliché.\n\nOne should not consider such a cliché the dominate factor in improving their physicality. People who say such things are often better at giving unsolicited advice than lifting weights.\n\nTo physically improve, it takes physical training. To consistently train, you need to recover – but that does not necessarily mean that sedentary days are required. There is nothing magical about staying out of the gym. Doing so does not guarantee an increased recovery rate.\n\nIf lifting regularly leaves you hobbled for a few days after, then you likely need more physical activity, not less. (And you also need to reassess how your training is set up. Follow a proven plan. Read the [/r/fitness wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/).)\n\nDo more general physical preparedness (GPP) work, like snow shoveling, my favorite, not.. If you don’t have snow, then just dig and fill the same hole in the dirt. If you don’t like those options, then push and pull a sled in the gym for an hour a few times per week. The point is that recovery is just as much about your work capacity as it is about your practices and habits outside the gym. None of which require staying out of the gym as a condition for success.\n\nIf you don’t want to lift weights or do manual labor daily, that’s fine. Go for walks, runs, bike – **do** something!\n\nI have been able to recover from my workouts by prioritizing:\n\n1.Eating and hydration.\n\n2. Sleeping.\n\n3. De-stressing.\n\nPeople confuse not going to the gym with recovery because not doing something is easier than working on improving recovery habits. Knowing I had a workout tomorrow, I made those three things bigger priorities in my life. I was also able to better regulate my desire to absolutely crush myself, *because I have the weekend off and need to earn it*. (So I would say years ago.)\n\nTime out of the gym is not the most important aspect of recovery. If it is for you, then you’re probably not prioritizing good recovery habits. An easy workout is better recovery than a hard night out partying, or a late night of Netflix, or a day full of stressed-out consumption of “news.”\n\nOf the things listed above, I did the worst with eating. This has always been trouble for me, but I do think I improved a bit in this aspect these 1,000 days. Having always been a scrawny manlet, getting to 200 lbs. was my goal. I barely missed that. This is due to the many days where I forgot my lunch or was just too consumed by work to eat. I could do better here, and if I had, I know I would have had better results.\n\nWhen it comes to nutrition, I have a consistent diet that is made up of rice, salad, eggs, and various meats. Often in the shape of a burrito.\n\nI also eat a fair share of potatoes and bread but will limit those during a cut period when I am trying to lose weight. I do eat out a few times per month on average, but rarely more than once a week (if that). My most common meal is a salad with rice and beef. Since I was bulking for all of 2021, I simply increased the serving. In 2022, I’ll eat less, but typically the same kinds of foods.\n\nGenerally, my motto is: “If bulking, never be hungry. If cutting, always be.” And I try to bias my eating to the “Green Faces” practice (if it is green or had a face, eat it).\n\nI tend to not track macros closely, nor calories. If I did, I would have had better results. 13+ years of training has developed my ability to gauge my own eating and practice good habits somewhat accurately and consistently. I could do better here, I admit.\n\nAs for hydration: I pee so often it sometimes annoys me.\n\nAlcohol consumption is rarely more than a six pack per week. If I averaged out the number of beers drank over these 1,000 days, it would probably be one to two per week. Some weeks have more than others, especially if I find a beer I have not tried, and it turns out to be good.\n\nI regularly get 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. If I do not, then I try to squeeze in a nap. I try to nap as much as I can. One to three a week on average.\n\nDe-stressing can be hard. To do this I have tried to limit my media exposure, which I determined to be the greatest source of stress for me. Doing so has reduced worrying about things I cannot control. I admit that I could do better, and just delete every social media account and stop watching and reading any current events whatsoever – perhaps later down the road.\n\nI have found that spiritual and philosophical practices are helpful in de-stressing and am working on improving this aspect of my life. Same for reading literature. My favorite book from last year’s reading was Hemingway’s *A Farewell to Arms*.\n\nRegarding supplements, I infrequently consume protein powder. Perhaps 3 to 5 scoops per week. Many weeks not even that much. I try to focus on whole foods as best as I can, and supplement as may be necessary (they’re called supplements, after all). More protein powder is consumed during bulking periods for this reason, as it is easier to get in a few ounces of fluids with 30 grams of protein than it is to eat that much more beef, chicken, or fish. On reflection, I should always have an emergency shaker of protein, just in case I forget my lunch.\n\nAdditional supplements I use are creatine, vitamin D, ZMA, Arginine and Ornithine. I had (have) an unhealthy amount of caffeine daily, but I have recently switched to half-caff and have drastically reduced my energy drink consumption. I try to keep it less than 300mg daily.\n\nAt no point in these 1,000 days have I used prescription or otherwise obtained performance enhancing drugs such as hormones, SARMS, pro-hormones, or steroids. I am not a “lifetime natural.” For about one year, ending in 2016, I tried TRT. I did not find it that helpful and I could no longer justify the cost. Well before that I was a crackhead addicted to Jack3d, which was basically crystal meth… *remembers the good ol’ days* (they were, in fact, not).\n\n**Summary**\n\nOver 1,000 days ago I started lifting daily and have not stopped. I gained size, strength, and stamina. I have not overtrained. The condition of pre-existing injuries has improved and were only aggravated on occasion that I became a knucklehead and did more reps than I knew better to.\n\nAdditionally, I worked through my General Gainz training framework, further developing the concept, and many successful training plans in the process. Several are linked in this post. GG improved my training and my client’s training too. I hope this post improves your training similarly.\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, thank you. I hope you’ve found this information helpful. Below are more links to posts I’ve written along the way to 1,000 days.\n\n[100 Days](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2019/06/100-days.html)\n\n[200 Days](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2019/10/200-days.html) (Also linked above for Generally Strong.)\n\n[300 Days](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2020/01/300-days.html) (Also linked above for HFUP.)\n\n[500 Days](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2020/07/500-days.html)\n\n[600 Days](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2020/11/600-days.html)\n\n[1000 Days](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/01/1000-days.html)\n\nLastly, /r/weightroom – *thank you*. It was about 11 years ago that I started sharing my training with you here. Now people around the world use my training to get bigger, stronger, and more fit. Moderators, you have a thankless job that you do wonderfully. I appreciate you. Without your help I would not be as successful at doing my part in improving humanity.",

The nutrition part resonated with me as I go through phases of being super organised (with meal prep), to days where I am just eating in a \"just-in-time\" approach (and is one of the reasons I keep a list of \"good foods\" to have in the house to grab and whip up a nutritious meal).

I even had chronic lower back/ischial pain and couldn’t sleep on my side because of it.\n\nI tried so many things – L-Arginine, Citrulline, Zinc, Omega-3s, training, clean diet. Some things helped a bit, but nothing really fixed it.\n\nThen I started taking **Cialis 5 mg daily** about a week ago – and it was like someone flipped a switch:  \n– Ischial pain completely gone  \n– Libido like I’m 20 again  \n– I can ejaculate again (that wasn’t possible before)  \n– My erections are stronger – and even my penis looks bigger  \n– I can sleep on my side again with no pain  \n– My whole pelvic area feels alive and relaxed\n\nI have **zero side effects** – no headache, no nasal congestion, nothing.\n\nI think I had a **functional pelvic blood flow issue**, maybe combined with chronic tension or nerve irritation. But I’m not sure – and I’m wondering now if it’s something permanent or if I’ll need Cialis long-term.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? I’d really appreciate your insights 🙏",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster.

    "body": "I know CeraVe in the tub is quite popular here, but I just wanted to provide a quick overview of other CeraVe moisturizers for those who aren't familiar.\n\n**NOTE**: All CeraVe moisturizers contain cetearyl alcohol/cetyl alcohol, which may cause breakouts to those who have a sensitivity to fatty alcohols.\n\n**Cerave Moisturizer Overview**\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream) (also known as Cerave \"in the tub\") is a thick, creamy moisturizer with ceramides, hyaluronic acid and petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-lotion) comes in a bottle and is a thinner consistency. It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin’s outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin’s water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin’s barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates—aspirin’s technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics. Shea butter is a rich source of antioxidants.\n\n**Ingredient Lists**\n\n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n>\n> **CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Active Ingredients: Homosalate (12%), Octinoxate (7.5%), Octocrylene (2%), Zinc Oxide (3.5%). \n> Inactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate and Boron Nitride, Dimethicone, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n> \n> **CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Mineral Oil, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Trolamine, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Dimethicone 360, Methylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Triethanolamine, Cetyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Methylparaben, Edetate Disodium, Propylparaben, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Glyceryl stearate SE, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Saccharide Isomerate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 1, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic  Acid, Caprooyl Tetrapeptide-3, Tripeptide-1, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Phytosphingosine, Dextran, Xanthan Gum\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n>\n>Purified Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Emulsifying Wax, Niacinamide, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lauric Acid, Zinc Citrate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Arginine PCA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, EDTA, Sodium PCA, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**\n>\n>Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Petrolatum, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nHopefully this information will be useful to people interested in trying Cerave.",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

Anyway, Biore claims that these products stay on evenly in severely hot and humid weather. This gets me very excited as I live in a very hot and humid area (75% - 85% and 30°C to 37°C during day time) so I would like to test this ~~or these~~ as soon as I get my hands on them. Will be sold from 9th February 2019 in-store with limited availability on Japanese online stores at an earlier date priced at [1944 JPY RRP](https://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?__mk_ja_JP=カタカナ&url=search-alias%3Dbeauty&field-keywords=ビオレ+UV+アスリズム+スキンプロテクト). ~~internal cries and gasp~~ but to be fair it has more grammes. \n\n**Ingredients**:\n\n~~Again, hasn't been released but mentioned:~~\n\n* ~~Hyaluronic Acid, Royal Jelly extract, and Butelyne Glycol (moisturising ingredients).~~\n* ~~White floral scent (made from natural fragrances), Citrus, Musky Wood.~~\n\nEssence: \n\nWater, ethanol, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, ethylhexyl triazone, isopropyl palmitate, (lauryl methacrylate / sodium methacrylate) cross-polymer, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (Uvinul A Plus), hydrogenated polyisobutene, sodium acrylates copolymer, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), dextrin palmitate, BG, (acrylates / C10-30 alkyl acrylate) crosspolymer, alkyl benzoate (C12-15), glycerin, propanediol, potassium hydroxide, glyceryl behenate, hydroxyethylcellulose, (vinyl dimethicone / methicone silsesquioxane) crosspolymer,  pullulan,  cetyl alcohol , sorbitan distearate, stearoyl glutamic acid, arginine, EDTA-2Na,BHT, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronic acid, phenoxyethanol, fragrance.\n\nMilk: \n\nCyclopentasiloxane, zinc oxide, ethanol, water, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, (lauryl methacrylate / sodium methacrylate) cross-polymer, dimethicone, hydrogenated polyisobutene, isopropyl palmitate, talc, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (Uvinul A Plus), titanium oxide, alkyl (C30-45) dimethylsilyl polypropylsilsesquioxane, polymethylsilsesquioxane, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), Butelyne Glycol, PEG-12 dimethicone, triethoxycaprilsilane, PEG-3 dimethicone, Aluminium hydroxide, stearic acid, methicone, BHT, royal jelly extract, sodium hyaluronate, phenoxyethanol, fragrance.\n\n**So, what are their claims?**\n\n* **Unique durable \"Tough Boost\" technology:**\n   * Supposedly stays on skin even during hot and humid conditions of 40°C and 75% humidity even when skin perspires or sweats.\n   * Super waterproof which lasts 80 minutes through water resistance tests but easily cleansed.\n   * Usable as a makeup base (so...white cast? primer?)\n* **Two versions**:\n   * Water-based essence (70 g): fresh and moist feeling that leaves the skin with a smooth sensation.\n   * Oil-based milk (65 ml): silky touch that glides on the skin with a light-weight sensation, no stickiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ii2mnvhve8621.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3215d1e3ed7e8e9b5eabc5a3b78bcdbe9f3553f6\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that Biore UV SaraSara Line (so, Perfect Milk, Bright Milk, Face Milk and Spray) is repackaged but no reformulation. Only the cardboard packagings seem to change to my eyes.\n\n[Here if you want to see the complete list of Biore UV lines (in Japanese).](https://www.kao.co.jp/bioreuv/itemcheck/) On the table there are star ratings. The first one is its suitability for children and the second is how well it interacts with makeup (whether makeup slip or not).",

    "body": "Is it possible that I have discovered an encrypted message linking biochemistry and literature?\n\nMy name is Diego, I'm a UCLM student in Spain,  currently studying a biochemistry degree. As an exercise I was proposed to solve a ms/ms espectrum. This graph may be useful to give you a glimpse about the subject. These molecules bond using between them to form proteins. This time we were only targetting a small sequence of about 10 to 15 aminoacids. In order to simplify the nomenclature of these molecules, it is common to use an amino acid code of one letter ([https://imgur.com/a/EDJXvxC](https://imgur.com/a/EDJXvxC)). For example, a sequence of amino acids would be: RGAHKDALL that stands for arginine, glycine, alanine,...  It's important to say that the order which amino acids are linked to conform a protein it's relevant, so the order which they are written represent their real position. Once made this first introduction, let's focus on what's really important. \n\nI was chilling at home, following the needed steps to solve the spectrum exercise. When I finished the task, I wrote down the sequence and the result was \"SHALLANDAVAR\" which match serine-alanine-histidine-etc. That is when it comes into play the trilogy I'm reading at the moment. The Stormlight Archive (I'm at the second book still). I went literally crazy at home, one of the main characters in the series is called Shallan and belongs to the Davar household. The solution to this excercise proposed in one of my subjects turned out to be the complete name to one of the main characters in a fantasy book series I´m reading! \n\nFor you to understand the difficulty of getting a word  out of an amino acid sequence of a protein, here´s the seric albumin sequence of Bos taurus ([https://imgur.com/a/yEelrEX](https://imgur.com/a/yEelrEX)).  For example, in this sequence of around 600 amino acids, small, one sillable words can be found in between them but almost never more than three letters long (MEN or FLY). Thats way the chances of finding this exact combination of letters is are amazingly low, near 0. Let's not forget that he is one of the characters in the serie that I am reading at this moment, so even more coincidence. Then in the middle of the rush, debating with my friends, it came to my knowledge that the author of such books did in fact study a couple of years of biochemistry in college. Because of the ridiculous probability of it being a coincidence and the connection between the author and the subject we thought it made sense to ask if this was some kind of easter egg set up by the professor in case he had read the stormlight archive. The next day I wrote him an email and he kindly responded he didnt know anything about such encrypted message. He said he´d gotten the exercise from other researchers and scientists and that only them or u/mistborn could give me the answer I craved. \n\nSo, I don´t really know if this will reach a lot of people but to all those readers it may get to, I want you to know the objective of this thread, and that´s to get an answer to the was it all Brandon Sanderson´s doing and in that case what lead him to get this name from that source or all the other names for that matter.\n\nI hope to get your feedback :) u/Izykstewart",

I spent a lot of time with biochemistry when I was in undergrad and prof liked to hide messages in their problems. I don't know what your assignment is exactly but there are very easy was to reverse engineer this type of experiment. Assuming i understood your prompt. \n\nFor example say i wanted my end message to say \"HIS PLANET\" I would just make the protein sequence by making a DNA strand of the corresponding triplets of DNA which would then make a protein that the prof knows the identity of but you don't and then the students \"discover\" the sequence. The technique is useful in the real world for identifying compounds    but to make a sequence that the prof knows so he can then grade based on how close your protein is based on the key. \n\nLike some people said, the odds that your proteins form a word or happened by accident is incredibly small. For another thing there are no proteins in nature that are only 12 amino acids long meaning this was not found in nature (true this could be a part of a protein but still odds are not likely). Also even if your prof says he's not a fan of the series many profs share practice problems with each other. The science community is a small world.  \n\nhope this helps and makes sense. :)  \n\n(trust me I'm a doctor)",

That's just me tho :) The Cosrx is definitely weaker, but suitable for those with very sensitive skin who needs very slow exfoliation.   \n\n\n**QUESTION TIME!** \n\nDoes anyone know anything about JainaFace? How legit is this brand?   \nI have their 10% Glycolic Acid that doesn't even tingle on my face and seems to do nothing at all. Meanwhile, Cosrx AHA liquid, that has a lower percentage of free acid even, tingles. I suspect this brand to be a hoax but I'm not sure. Their 2% salicylic acid doesnt' really do anything for me either *(and I have spent 12 months testing out salicylic acids)*.  Same with a friend, she says she tried some products *(HA and some vitamin C stuff)* but that it didn't do anything for her face at all.   \nI contacted JainaFace a couple of months back to ask **1**. why they are allowed to use 2% salicylic acid in their products when the limit is 0.5% in Korea, and **2**. why there is next to zero information about this brand.  \nThe person who answered was nice enough but I find it shady that they don't want to market themselves... They claimed they would have to think about it, if it was true that people were starting to think they repackage and sell an American product, or that their products are generally fake/Chinese.  \nNothing's really happened except I saw they made a reddit account and posted a statement in  a reddit thread that they're not fake :P",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), *Australian* websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it, but it can come out a bit forcefully sometimes.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** **Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\nI hope these reviews were useful :)",

I would only trust claims I can see after using a product. \n\n\nAs far as I know, topical creams cannot generate collagen production. Collagen is created from the foods you eat. I’m not even sure you can take collagen supplements to increase collagen production because everything in your body is broken down in the same way and your body will direct the amino acids to where the body needs it most and not where you might want it.",

It removed all of my waterproof sunscreen and makeup really, really well. The key is to use it dry first, like cleansing oils and balms. \n\nI've seen tons of bad reviews for this and other first-step (or single step) gel cleansers like the Innisfree one and [Kikumasamune cleansing gel](https://www.ebay.com/itm/KIKUMASAMUNE-Skin-Care-Cleansing-Gel-Makeup-Remover-Glutaminic-acid-Arginine/152264396357?epid=1737685660&hash=item2373aa4e45:g:0EMAAOSw4shX8chE) for \"not doing anything\". But others love them for being such gentle second-step cleansers too, so that is a plus.\n\nAnyways, I'm Korean and waaay back when r/AsianBeauty was a babe, I felt like I was the only one who knew that Innisfree's gel cleanser was supposed to be a first step cleanser because I can read the Korean in the ads. The directions says to use it dry to remove makeup. I tried telling people it was meant to be a first-step cleanser but it never caught on, lmao.\n\nI think a lot of Westerners are not used to seeing gel cleansers as makeup removers, so most assume that all the AB gel cleansers are only second-steppers, too. And a lot of AB is marketed as 12-step/multi-step so I think a lot of people also think that you MUST, MUST have a 1st step and a 2nd step in cleansing. But there are ~lazy~ people like me all over the world! And many of us love single products that can do multiple jobs at once! =) \n\nAnd the beauty of AB is that you can get skin care in SO many different textures and varieties! I personally don't like the feeling of cleansing oils so I heavily prefer creams and gels. \n\nI just get really sad when people who aren't familiar leave reviews like \"THIS IS USELESS\" for these wonderful gel-type first steppers!

I just want them to get the positive attention they deserve, too. ;-; \n\nAnother great, popular first step cleansing gel popular in Japan is the [Nursery Makeup & UV Cleansing Gel](https://www.amazon.com/Nursery-Cleansing-Gel-Yuzu-180ml/dp/B007HHE2KS/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1520869103&sr=8-3&keywords=nursery%2Bgel&th=1).

I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#✨️ First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#✨️ Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\".

Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ☺️\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out 🙃)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench – 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure.

I've spent a lot of time researching what would be most effective for myself, and have determined that the must have ingredients for my pre-workout are beta-alanine, l-arginine, taurine and caffeine.  By buying the ingredients separately and in bulk, you can save a lot of money.  \n\n\n**My blend contains:**\n\n\n3.2g of beta-alanine, 4.6g of l-arginine, 3g of taurine, and 400mg of caffeine.  Flavoring is additional, I'll probably throw a crystal light packet in there.\n\n\n**My reasoning:**\n\n\nThe non essential amino acid beta-alanine raises muscle carnosine levels, which allows you to perform at higher intensities by preventing  a buildup of H+ ions, which helps prevents lowering of pH in your muscles.  In addition, beta-alanine gives you that famous tingling feeling that gets you psyched to lift.\nBeta-alanine and taurine compete for uptake, so in order to prevent long term health complications from a lack of taurine, I'm stacking it with the beta-alanine.  Aside from that, taurine itself has many benefits.\nThe semi-essential amino acid arginine is a precursor to nitric oxide, which causes vasodilation.  \nThen of course, caffeine is essential for me to have energy to workout after a long day.\n\n\n[Here](http://imgur.com/kty1or7) are the cheapest prices I could find for the ingredients.

Eventually every single of the 16 virus databases managed by the WIV was taken offline.\n\nhttps://archive.is/i79eW\n\n\n\n**Here's former CDC director Robert Redfield under oath before the Congress on Wuhan Lab September 2019 events:**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/aXXWRaM-sWQ?feature=share\n\n\n>I will say if you go back and look, it's declassified now, and I'm sure you all have your classified briefings, but the declassified information now: \n\n>In September of 2019, three things happened in that lab, one is they deleted the sequences, that was highly irregular, researchers don't usually like to do that\n\n>Second thing they did was they changed the command and control of the lab from the civilian control to the military control. Highly unusual, and I've been involved in dual use labs when I was in the military.\n\n\n>And the third thing they did which I think is really telling is they let a contractor redo the ventilation system in that laboratory. So I think  clearly there was strong evidence that there was a significant event that happened in that laboratory in September. It's now been declassified, you can read it. I'm sure there's more classified information around it.\n\n**Scientist Richard Ebright**\n\n>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction. And here is a proposal from the beginning of 2018 [from Fauci/Gates-funded EcoHealth Alliance] proposing explicitly to engineer that sequence at that position in chimeric lab- generated coronaviruses.\n\n- Richard Ebright, an eminent molecular biologist at Rutgers University, https://archive.is/cCBUw\n\n**Eminent Virologist David Baltimore of CalTech**\n\n>When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.\n\n- David Baltimore, an eminent virologist and former president of CalTech, https://archive.is/yalCe\n\n\n**Former CDC Director Robert Redfield:**\n\n>I was concerned because of the presence of the furin cleavage site that we've talked about and I think it's important to understand what that cleavage site does. That cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of COVID, so where before it could not see the ACE2 receptor which is the human receptor, it totally changes the orientation now so it has high affinity for human receptors. So that furin cleavage site bothered me, it didn't seem like it belonged there. \n\n>And then if you look at the sequences they use in those 12 nucleotides for arginine, where the arginine sequence nucleotide triplet were coded for humans. So why did it have the arginine coding for humans and not bat? It was very disconcerting to me. It looked like this virus was engineered.\n\n\n>It's not scientifically plausible that this virus went from a bat to humans and became one of the most infectious viruses that we have for humans. \n\n\n\n**Scientist Valentin Bruttel:**\n\n>I tried to raise awareness to this for a year now.\nWIV use BsaI and BsmBI/Esp3I sites before to make synthetic WIV1 variants.\nAnd exactly those sites appear in a \"silently introduced, perfect for synthetic assembly\" pattern in SARS2, but non of its nat. relatives.\n\n>seriously, what is the chance that exactly those type IIs restriction appear or disappear through random evolution in a Banal-20-52 like virus?\n5-6 precise mutations in 30000bp?\nabout 1 in 10^20!\nSARS2 is clearly synthetic!\n\n**Type Ils restriction sites prove a synthetic origin**\n\nSynthetic RNA viruses are assembled at the DNA level and later transcribed. 30,000 nucleotides cannot be synthesized in one go. These viruses are therefore assembled from smaller, 2- 8,000 nucleotide long pieces. Specific DNA restriction sites are often added to later reassemble the individual building blocks in the correct order. It is also technically possible to hide these interfaces (No See'em), but this was not done in the WIV.\n\nIn a 2017 paper, two very specific, particularly suitable type Ils restriction enzymes were used at the WIV. These have the advantage that they can produce different DNA overhangs (sticky ends), which are crucial for a correct assembly of the complete genome: Bsal and BsmBI.\n\nSARS2 shows a Bsal and BsmBI restriction site pattern which is ideal for assembling synthetic viruses and to later replace the spike protein or furin cleavage site.\n\nBsal and BsmBI restriction sites also exist in closely related viruses (Banal20-52, RaTG13), but these are distributed in such a way that an artificial virus could never be generated using the methods established at WIV 2018/19. \n\n**The probability that the required 5 synonymous mutations, which enable a synthetic assembly of SARS2, arose purely by chance is less than 1 in 10^20 or about as likely as winning the lottery jackpot 3 times in a row.**\n\nDr. Valentin Bruttel\n\nhttps://twitter.com/VBruttel/status/1566365635680124929?t=koDQ9poynY6I9qSchgQAnw&s=19\n\nAlina Chan NY Times article:\n\n\"Why the Pandemic Probably Started in a Lab, in 5 Key Points\"\n\n>Dr. Chan is a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of M.I.T. and Harvard, and a co-author of “Viral: The Search for the Origin of Covid-19.”\n\n>1. The SARS-like virus that caused the pandemic emerged in Wuhan, the city where the world’s foremost research lab for SARS-like viruses is located.\n\n>2. The year before the outbreak, the Wuhan institute, working with U.S. partners, had proposed creating viruses with SARS‑CoV‑2’s defining feature.\n\n>3. The Wuhan lab pursued this type of work under low biosafety conditions that could not have contained an airborne virus as infectious as SARS‑CoV‑2.\n\n>4. The hypothesis that Covid-19 came from an animal at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan is not supported by strong evidence.\n\n\n\n\n>5. Key evidence that would be expected if the virus had emerged from the wildlife trade is still missing. Despite the intense search trained on the animal trade and people linked to the market, investigators have not reported finding any animals infected with SARS‑CoV‑2 that had not been infected by humans. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html\n\n\"No one can find the animal that gave people covid-19\"\n\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/26/1021263/bat-covid-coronavirus-cause-origin-wuhan/\n\n\"10 reasons we KNOW that COVID-19 leaked from the Wuhan Lab\"\n\n>One of the only labs in the world manipulating coronaviruses was right next to where we can trace the beginnings of the pandemic.

It took much longer than other lists because of all the info I had to gather. That and me rage quitting for a while after computer decided to delete all the ingredient lists I typed out.  :I***\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**General Info (That I got questions about):**\n\n*The reason I typed out some of the ingredient lists is bc I can't find the list in English online that I can easily copy and paste, or the ingredients aren't up to date.*\n\n*I bolded some ingredients that are helpful for skin/skin-identical for healthy skin barrier.*\n\n*The dollar cost is the converted retail price of what it would cost in Korea, without sale/promo.*\n\n*I also looked up all the common plant names from their scientific names because it annoys me when I look at ingredients and I have no idea what that plant is..*\n\n***PEG -*** *something* *means something has been altered or made to be water soluble. It is useful for that but some people avoid it due to microplastics (I don't know a whole lot about it, but have heard people say this).*\n\n[***You don't need to be SUPER DUPER concerned about visible light/blue light protection***](https://labmuffin.com/blue-light-computers-phones-damage-skin/) ***and whatnot, even though some of these products claim to protect against them.***\n\n***TINTED sunscreens are lightly tinted usually in beige or peach color.

As always,* ***YMMV.***\n\n*Many of these companies* ***claim*** *that their product is the* ***gentlest*** *for the most sensitive skin because of EWG (Environmental Working Group) rating of 1, but* ***EWG is NOT a reliable source, especially for sensitive skinned folks***\\*\\*, *as they can be very biased and promote skin-sensitizing things just because an ingredient sounds more \"natural\".\\** ***Natural*** *things usually contain much more possible* ***skin triggers*** *than lab-isolated,* ***single*** *ingredients.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Potentially Irritating Filters (From Lab Muffin Beauty Science Blog)***\n\n>**Avobenzone** is a common irritant and allergen, so it tends to be unsuitable for sensitive skin, and you’re left with inorganic sunscreens only.  \n>  \n>If you’re elsewhere in the world, the newer UVA1 filters aren’t particularly irritating or allergenic.  \n>  \n>A few other organic sunscreens also tend to cause allergic and irritant reactions: **octocrylene, oxybenzone, avobenzone, PABA, Padimate O and enzacamene.**\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SUNSCREEN**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.\\[A24\\] Premium Sun Protection Cream -

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

The drug allegedly reduces hospitalisation by 50%, and could generate $7 billion in revenue due to Merck charging $712 for a 5-day course. Compare this to its estimated $17.74 cost to the company and the fact that it is a result of $29m of public funding provided to Emory University, with Merck only funding the last stages of development. Also, as it is a new drug, we are still not sure about its long-term safety.\n\n[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-merck-covid-pill-cost-b1933100.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-merck-covid-pill-cost-b1933100.html)\n\nHowever, there are almost no private financial incentives to repurpose off-patent drugs and nutraceuticals/dietary supplements to treat new diseases because it is not possible or very difficult to enforce a monopoly price using patents by preventing off-label competition - the \"tragedy of the commons.\"\n\nIf payers could back a pay for success contract with only 1% of what the US govt agreed to pay for molnupiravir, this would solve the tragedy of the commons. By creating a $12m reward to incentivise a private company to fund the Phase 3 clinical trials required to repurpose an off-patent drug or nutraceutical to achieve regulatory approval, it would help millions of people have access to additional low cost, safe and effective therapeutics.",

    "body": "\\*if done correctly (keep reading?). Note: This idea is quite possibly certifiably batshit crazy. I've never heard anyone else mention a similar perspective. Take me with a grain of salt here? Yes, there is an idea in there - it's down a few paragraphs. This idea is so batshit it actually \\_needs\\_ that much preamble.\n\nThis is probably a very unpopular idea - I'm about 99.9% sure I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this one. Basically everyone I've talked to has had such an issue with it they haven't let me go into detail on *why* I believe this, though, so I kinda just want to get it off my chest. I'm going to guess you probably got angry just looking at the title. I get it; before, I would have felt the same way - but I've spent a long time thinking about this since then. Before you impulse-downvote me, I'd ask that you please look at my reasoning. *Pretty please, with a cherry on top?* It's pretty long, I know, but that's because I've spent over a decade thinking about this, and have basically kept it to myself. Maybe I have things wrong (I am human after all) but... I tried my best to understand the issue objectively, and that's all I can do. With that being said, here goes:\n\nWe're really handing the next generation a raw deal, as things stand. They're going to have a ton of problems to deal with: climate change, sea level rise, freshwater shortages, acidified oceans full of plastic, persistent organic pollutants everywhere messing with hormones, oil reserves running out, desertification of many regions, overpopulation, probably famines, and a lot more I probably haven't thought of yet. Maybe Kessler Syndrome in orbit, too?\n\nThey don't have a choice in the matter. We're bringing them into a world that us and the generations that came before us have made a royal mess of, whether they like it or not. They also don't have a choice as to what genes they get from us - they get our genes whether they like them or not. For a lot of people, that could mean their kids are getting genetic diseases, strong tendencies towards character flaws (though nurture also plays a role in this), physical deformities, and/or other problems. Even if a child gets lucky and doesn't have any of those issues, they could still end up being physically weak, not particularly intelligent, unattractive, clumsy, or having any number of other non-disease but still undesirable traits. Again, they don't have a choice in this - they're born the way they're born, and that's it. Think of it this way: imagine your parents could made you better in pretty much any way - healthier, longer-lived, stronger, smarter, prettier, less prone to injury, faster, and/or even just happier with life - but they chose not to, because they didn't want to for some reason. If you have a genetic disease - imagine if your parents could have chosen to ensure you never get that genetic disease, to make sure you were born healthy, but they didn't. How would you feel about that?\n\nWe could make our children stronger, smarter, quicker-learning, faster, kinder, more compassionate, less violent, more patient, less likely to cheat on their partners (yes, this is possible - if you're curious read about oxytocin receptors and arginine vasopressin receptors), longer-lived, healthier, resistant to developing diabetes, less likely to develop cancer, less susceptible to radiation, less prone to addiction, tougher, more resistant to pain, sharper-eyed, more ambitious, less anxious, happier, and *a lot* more. If we're worried about overcrowding, we could maybe look into how to slightly decrease sex drive, or even just make it slower for them to have kids (if it takes 2x as long to have children, maybe they won't have so many?). Maybe we don't know how to do some of those things just yet - but that's only because nobody's really trying right now, due to the fact we've pretty much just decided as a species not to \"do\" genetic modification. With enough time, money, and effort, we could figure out how to do all of those things safely, and make life better for everyone over the long run.\n\nObviously, there are reasons not to, as things stand - if only the rich had access to it, it would make inequality worse, and would almost certainly make the world worse rather than better. However, if **everyone** had access to it, then wouldn't that be fair and equal, and solve that problem? There is a way. We could heavily publicly fund / subsidize research to figure out how to do all these things completely safely, and then we could make ALL the different \"proven safe\" genetic modifications **available for free** (maybe under socialised healthcare, or maybe through a purpose-built program) to **any parents who want their child to have them**.\n\n\"But that'll be hugely expensive!\" I hear you saying already, and sure, you're right, it probably will be. There are at least two reasons that's not necessarily a problem (there are probably others I don't know about): Economies of scale, and increased lifetime productivity. Economies of scale are pretty simple - if you are only doing something a handful of times, each time is expensive because you have to do all the research and work to develop a process, all to use it only a few of times; if you're doing something a million times the cost of the research and setup (which you only really need to do once) is divided over all those million times, so each one ends up costing a lot less. Increased lifetime productivity is pretty simple too - if you have a population of happier, healthier, longer-lived, smarter, stronger people, they can and will get a lot more done over their lifetimes than we ever could, and that increase in productivity will probably pay for the cost of the program a thousand times over, so even if it's massively expensive... it should still be worth it.\n\nIt would be the ultimate in \"investing in our future\" - giving the next generation a huge leg up, and giving them a fighting chance of actually surviving the big problems on the horizon like climate change, pollution, acidification of the oceans, overcrowding, water shortages, and all the other problems we've (well not just us - past generations too) created for them. I would argue that NOT doing it is more unethical than doing it - we're effectively saying \"we could potentially make you able to live a happier, more productive, healthier, longer life... but nah, we decided not to to because we had feeeeeeeeeelings about it\". They don't have a choice in the matter even if we DON'T genetically modify them - they just end up getting our shitty unmodified genes whether they want them or not anyway - so it's not like the natural way is fairer. I'd bet you would have wanted to be born smarter, stronger, faster, healthier, longer-lived, and better-looking if you could... and so will they. In that way, I think NOT using the tools of genetics to (with the utmost of caution and care, making sure we do no harm) make life better for our children however we can is *straight up wrong*. It certainly isn't in accordance with the Golden Rule, which is \\[paraphrased\\] \"Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself.\". If we would rather be better in some way, then the way I see it, we have an obligation to do our best to make that happen for our children.\n\nIf you've gotten this far, **thank you so much for taking the time to read all that**. Sorry it ended up being so long; I've been thinking about this for a very, very long time, and I've rarely talked about it because it really is a very unpopular opinion. It's been over a decade of mulling it over, in fact. I would be very interested in hearing what you all have to say about it; I hope you didn't find this topic uncomfortable, and I hope you found my thoughts on the matter interesting - or at least, not horribly offensive.\n\n**As an addendum**, for certain groups of religious people, since I know you'll probably have a lot to say about this (which is fine, I totally understand): I don't actually think this is \"playing God\" at all. On the contrary, from that perspective, I think it could actually play an important role in being good stewards of the Earth - perhaps it's even something we're meant to do. After all, Genesis even says \"let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\" and \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it\". I'd say we are not taking good care of our planet; \"replenishing the earth\" could be a metaphor for using our (present) ability to alter life to repair our devastated environment (slowly and carefully). As we are right now, we've wholeheartedly failed to do what we were supposed to. Maybe that's a sign that our first job is to... fix ourselves so we can be better stewards, and perhaps try to undo some of the damage of the original sin. We are said to be the \"image of God\", the New Testament says that the Holy Spirit is inside all of us, and that Christ will return eventually (it's often said in 2000-ish years, which interestingly lines up pretty well with us developing the science of genetics). What if the whole idea is that **we** are supposed to *help* bring about the second coming, and what if the science of genetics was meant to play a role in that? I mean, it's often said that God/the Holy Spirit works through people according to His plan. I'd be interested in hearing what you think of my interpretation.",

(Ie does a machine with free will and a conscience have the same rights as a human? What is the definition of sentience and if a machine were capable of meeting the requirements, would we consider it as an equal?)\n\nGenetic modification (and the ethics/consequences of implementing it) is a topic which is brought up several times across different series. Deep Space 9 in particular has several episodes that focus on exactly what you are talking about.\n\nOne of the main issues that are discussed: What is the line between normal and deficient? I'm not talking about severe disabilities, but like you said, why not give people a little more intelligence, or make them more capable of building muscle? Is it fair to the people just above the cut that they are being held back by not qualifying for the procedures?\n\nIn the Federation, genetic modification has been made largely illegal except where the person would not be able to live any sort of normal life (they correct severe disabilities, but modifications without a severe disability is banned).\n\nIn the TNG era timeline (the shows are set around 2400) there is a period known as \"The Eugenics Wars\". It was basically a period of low regulation on genetic modifications, and it resulted in a global arms race to genetically modify the perfect super soldier. It was WW III being fought with superhumans. An approximate quote from the show \"For every Ghandi or Mother Theresa, there are 10 Genghis Khan's\". Giving someone superpowers is only good if they are good, otherwise you create a villain, and the implication is that there are very few truly good people. The Eugenics War is the major event which outlawed the practice of using genetic modification on the general public.\n\nAnother thing: Parents will always want their children to be the best they can be.

All the laws in the world can't prevent a determined person from doing something if it's possible.

Also take into account that humans are always seeking something better; ergo, in this case, better looks, better strength, and what not. Now for the actual problem, genetically modifying those \"undesirable traits\" to be better, means that some people inherently have an advantage. Considering, lastly, that genetic modification will also be expensive—at least at the beginning—which implies that ony the elite wpuld have access to it; you have both a concoction for \"super\"humans and a recipe for an even bigger wealth gap. And if everyone had this option instead, you have a great recipe for abrupt societal disaster, where everyone seeking to have stronger and stronger traits is at an impasse at once, due to there always being someone with better traits, or better worded, there is always a version of you who has worse traits. Seems familar? That is because the dynamic of \"good\" and \"bad\" traits, and their relative existence in numbers, is already the case. It would not be a smart to have this exact relativity of traits, just at a different level (i.e. in strength, beauty, etc) than what we have today.\n\nThe other problem (no quotes this time: an actual fundamental issue), is a trait commonly found in human societies. Trash a place, cry about why it's trashed, and move on to trashing other places. One good example that comes to mind is that since we've littered the planet so much, we send the garbage into space instead—hence littering the next most easily available thing. Where is this point going...? Well, instead of trying to fix or even halt reversible damage, we simply ignore the issue of this trait of human societies, and just artificially inflate our kids with genetic prowess, in order for them to stand a chance. This is an unhealthy mindset that is directly targeted at silencing mass complaints that environmental problems exist, but most importantly, it appeases the masses—that nobody needs to worry about environmental problems, because they can simply ignore them, keep littering all over the place, and augmenting themselves. Eventually some people will be left behind as they cannot even survive a trashed out place. New health issues are created all the time, more effective treatments/modifications will be needed, and everyone will be at an impasse, again. Seems familiar? That is because the inability to adapt to any possible and unimaginable environmental issue that arises, and its relative existence in numbers, is already the case. It would not be smart to have this exact relativity of inability to adapt to environmental issues among different humans, but with environmental issues just artificially inflated.\n\nThe purpose of medicine is to help people. Not be a service to augment ourselves. Genetic modification should be used to treat actual medical conditions, not \"treat\" flaws. If anything, society's stance on flaws needs to change, not the flaws themselves, but it is unfortunate that this idea is more utopian than genetic modification. There is a very strong proponent against genetic modification as a service. And I damn well hope its proponents, support, and arguments *for*, do not reach our governments without the proponents, opposition, and arguments *against*.",

We are getting stronger.\n\nWhen I look back on myself, I see how emotional unstable I was. Like child crying for lollipop.\n\nNow, I am the most disciplined version of me till now. I can feel peace in my soul. Bliss in my body.\n\nMy endurance in workouts is brutal. Last week I did 65 sets of 10 pull ups below 2 hours. People in gym looked at me strangely.\n\nA lot of energy. Sometimes I cant sleep at night because I am not tired. I am in best shape in my life so far.\n\nLove silence now, I feel beautiful peace. Sometimes feel strange tingeling. I am writing this with smile on my face, and that is one of my biggest victories.\n\nI am receiving a lot of compliments every day. They think I am on steroids. One man today told me, that my face is somehow more clear. People like to tell me everything about themselves. One lady told me that I have very nice nature.\n\nWorkouts are almost everyday. Reading Bible everyday (this is the most important). Coldshowers. Almost no social media, news, negative informations... Sugar almost zero. No alcohol. A lot of protein, less carbs. Supplements: zinc, tribulus, D3, C, arginine, protein, creatine, taurine.\n\nMy connection with God is better every single day.\n\nEverything is true. But true is one more thing. Battle for your mind. Spiritual battle.\n\nYou must practise to be aware of your thoughts, and to eliminate the first negative thought. If you dont do that everything can be opposite. Days can be dark, again emotional unstable, restless. With time you become better with this.\n\nAttacks are sometimes at night during sleep. Dreams with girls and that stuff, but I refuse them. So, reading Bibile is a must !!!\n\nMy eyes are strong now. Sometimes good looking girls are around me, in gym, on my job, but I dont care about that.\n\nBattle with lust is never ending. We must be disciplined our entire life. We can fall every single moment.\n\nI am trying to find my purpuse. I'd like to help other people somehow. Sometimes, the desire for family (wife and children) is strong. I hope that feeling is from God, and my faith is that he will provide best for me.\n\nIntuition is also level up. First day I think about somebody, the next day I see him.\n\nI am going into swimming classes now. (I had fear of water). Getting better and better every training.\n\nMy next goal is to conquer my emotions. I think i am on half way to that.\n\nDesire to do new things is here. Sometimes I am sad because my entire life I was doing against myself.\n\nI am 29 now, 30 is coming... My promise to myself is to become disciplined warrior in this battle called life, fighting for better life for me and people around me.\n\nSPARTANSSS, PREPARE FOR GLORY !!!!!",

Acne prone. Daily Tretinoin use. \n \nREVIEW:\nI got this a few days ago and am very pleased with it so far. It replaced my Pyunkang yul ato cream blue label in the tube. The packaging is very sleek hard plastic and the wording is imprinted on the outside-they say this is to make it easier to recycle and save from extra plastic labeling. I have also used the gel cream and this is really night and day and not comparable at all imo. It comes in a pump bottle and pumps about a pea size each. I use 2 pumps for my whole face and neck. I struggle with very dry skin that is dry in the morning if I don’t use a very thick moisturizer at night. This keeps my face dewy and moist all night. It’s not thick like a shea butter cream and it spreads very easily. It smells exactly like oats like if you get a handful of ground oats and smell it, that’s what this smells like. It leaves a nice glow but not a greasy finish. My hair doesn’t stick to my face when I use this if that makes sense. It’s a great price point the bottle is bigger than it looks the photos. \n\nThis is my first time doing a review so let me know if I missed something and I’m also happy to answer any questions!",

It takes me a min to write down all 20 no structures just the names.\n\nSo, I write down 1,2,3,4. If you’re wondering why it’s like that it’s bc it helps me remember how many times each letter has a word that starts with each letter. So, the mnemonic I created was HIV CUMS LIKE P*SY GOES TO ANYONE. I remember mnemonics if they’re sexual or flirty. Ignore the U in cums I only put it there so you get what I’m trying to say (hiv —> anyone can get it , my thought process lol) \n\nFor number 1. HIV CMS .. I remember there’s only 1 amino acid that starts with an H = histidine, 1 amino acid that starts with and I = isoleucine & so on for each other letter, etc\n\nFor number 2. LP .. 2 amino acids start with L , Lysine & Leucine , etc \n\nGet my flow? I wrote it out ahha \n\nFor the amino acids that are POLAR I created the mnemonic with their 1 letter codes. \nYour Not Suppose To Quit Commitment. —>\nTyrosine, Asparagine, Serine, Threonine, Glutamine, Cysteine \n\nFor the acids I just memorized those bc those are the only 2 amino acids out of 20. \n\nFor Basic/Positive Amino Acids I created : \nKiss Real Hard —-> Lysine, Arginine, and Histidine \n\nI memorized everything else Non polar bc I have everything else memorized. Like for polar I memorized all 6 , acids 2, basic 3 = 11 which means the other 9 left is non polar & I look at my little cheat sheet of the names & know like that which 9 are non polar. Also, if you forget the abbreviation letter for Leucine and Lysine I remembered Lysine as LyK (as in I like you) and Leucine = Loser , pretty loser name if that’s your name yk lol. I write everything in that pic in less than a min before I do any practice questions or anything. \n\nI hope you guys get it & it can help anyone , even 1 person! Lmk if you guys have any questions or want me to share other mnemonics. :) !!\n",

    "body": "Massive Attack\nBy Chuck Palahniuk\n\n\"If everybody jumped off a cliff,\" my father used to say, \"would you?\" This was a few years ago. It was the summer a wild cougar killed a jogger in Sacramento. The summer my doctor wouldn't give me anabolic steroids.\n\nA local supermarket used to offer this special deal: if you bought fifty bucks worth of receipts, you could buy a dozen eggs for a dime, so my best friends, Ed and Bill, used to stand in the parking lot asking people for their receipts. Ed and Bill, they ate blocks of frozen egg white, 10-pound blocks they got at a bakery supply house, egg albumin being the most easily assimilated protein. Ed and Bill used to make these road trips to San Diego, then cross the border on foot at Tijuana to buy their steroids, their Dianabol, and smuggle it back. This must've been the summer the D.E.A. had other priorities.\n\nEd and Bill are not their real names.\n\nWe were road-tripping down through California, and we stopped in Sacramento to visit some friends. At this point the cougar was still running wild. This was the countryside, but not. The wilderness platted into 2.5-acre mini estates. Somewhere was a female cougar with cubs, squeezed in among the soccer moms and swimming pools. This was less of a vacation than a pilgrimage from one Gold's Gym franchise to the next along the west coast. On the road, we bought water-packed tuna and ate it dry, tossing the empty cans in the back seat. We washed it down with diet soda and farted the length of Interstate 5.\n\nEd and Bill shot the pre-loaded syringes of D-ball, and I did everything else. Arginine, Ornithine, Smilax, DHEA, saw palmetto, selenium, chromium, free-range New Zealand sheep testicle, Vanadyl, orchid extract... At the gym, while my friends bench-pressed three times their weight, pumping up, shredding their clothes from the inside, I'd hover around their giant elbows. \"You know,\" I'd say, \"I think I'm putting on real size with this yohimbe bark tincture.\"\n\nYah, that summer.\n\nThe only reason they let me hover was for contrast. It's the old strategy of choosing ugly bridesmaids so the bride looks better. Mirrors are only the methadone of body-building. You need an audience. There's that old joke: \"How Many Bodybuilders Does It Take to Screw in a light bulb?\" Three: one to screw in the bulb and two to say, \"Really, dude, you look massive!\" Yeah, that joke. That's not really a joke.\n\nThe Sacramento people we visited, on our way home from Mexico, we stopped by their house again, and they pulled us inside and locked the doors. They were throwing a barbecue for some friends who'd been away at a men's retreat. On this retreat, somebody explained, each man was sent out into the desert to wander until he had a revelation. Now while the tiki torches flickered and the propane barbecue smoked, one man stood clutching some kind of shriveled baseball bat. It was the desiccated skeleton of a cactus he'd found on his quest, but it was more. \"I realized,\" he said, \"that this cactus skeleton was me. This was my manhood, abrasive and hard on the outside, but brittle and hollow.\" Everybody else around the deck closed their eyes and nodded. Except my friends, who turned the other way with their jaws clenched to keep from laughing. Their huge arms folded across their chests, they elbowed each other and wanted to walk up the road to see some historical rock. The hostess stopped us at the gate and said, \"Don't! Just don't.\" Clutching her wine cooler and looking into the darkness beyond the steam of the whirlpool and the light of the tiki torches, she said a cougar had been prowling around.\n\nThe cougar had been right up next to their deck, and she showed us in the shrubs, a scattering of short, coarse, blond hair. That year, everywhere we drove, that whole trip, there were already fences and property lines and names on everything.\n\nEd juiced and lifted for a couple more years until he blew out his knees. Bill, until he ruptured a disk in his back. It wasn't until last year when my father died, my doctor finally came across. I lost weight and kept losing weight until he whipped out a prescription and said, \"Let's try you on 30 days of Anadrol.\"\n\nSo I jumped off the cliff, too.\n\nPeople squinted at me and asked what was different. My arms got a little bigger around, but not that much. More than the size, the feeling was enough. Anadrol is an anabolic steroid, a synthetic derivative of testosterone. Possible side effects include: testicular atrophy, impotence, chronic priapism, increased or decreased libido, insomnia, and hair loss. One hundred tablets cost eleven-hundred bucks. Insurance does not cover it. But the feeling does. Your eyes are popped open and alert. The way women look so good when they're pregnant, glowing and soft, and so much more female, Anadrol makes you look and feel that much more male. The raging priapism part - that was the first couple weeks. You are nothing but the real estate between your legs. It's the same as those old illustrations in Alice in Wonderland where she's eaten the cake marked \"eat me\" and frown until her arm sticks out the front door. Except it's not your arm that sticks out, and wearing bicycle pants is totally out of the question.\n\nAbout the third week, the priapism subsided or seemed to spread to my entire body. Weightlifting gets better then sex. A workout becomes an orgy. You're having orgasms, cramping, hot, rushing orgasms in your delts, your quads, your lats and traps. You forget about that lazy old penis. Who needs it? In a way it's a peace, an escape from sex. A vacation from libido. You might see a hot woman ant think, \"Grrrrrrr,\" but your next egg white omelet or set of squats are a lot more attractive.\n\nI didn't go into this stupid. This is a kind of weird aside, but a friend in medical schoolmate me a deal that if I introduced her to Brad Pitt, she'd sneak me in to help her dissect some cadavers. She met Brad, and I spent a long night helping her disassemble dead bodies so first-year pre-med students could study them. Our third cadaver was a 60-year-old physician. He had the muscle mass and definition of a man in his twenties, but when we opened his chest, his heart was almost the size of his head. I held his chest open and my friend poured in Formalin until his lungs floated. My friend looked at his freaking big heart, and his equally freaky big dick, and she told me: testosterone. Self administered for years. She showed me the coiled little wires and the pacemaker buried in his chest and told me he had a history of heart attacks.\nAbout this time, a bodybuilder magazine ran an occasional little feature in its back pages, a catch-up profile about a star bodybuilder from the 1980s. Back then, these stars posed and gave interviews swearing they were blessed with great genetics and determination, they just worked hard and ate well, they never used steroids. They swore. In the update features, these same guys were pale and doughy, battling health problems from diabetes to cancer. And they admitted they had been using steroids.\n\nI knew all this, and I still jumped off the cliff.\n\nMy father was dead, Ed and Bill were a mess, and I was fast losing faith in tangible shit. Here I'd written a story, a make-believe book, and it was making me more money than any real work I'd ever done. I had about a 30-day window of free time between my book obligations and the opening of the Fight Club movie. Here was a 30-day experiment, an updated Jack London adventure in a little brown bottle. My friends didn't stop me. They only told me to eat enough protein to make the investment worthwhile. Still, I didn't buy the 10-pound blocks of egg white. I never filled my fridge with rows and rows of foil-wrapped boneless, skinless chicken breasts and baked potatoes the way Ed and Bill used to. I just took the little white pills and worked out and one day in the shower, I noticed my nuts were disappearing.\nOkay, I'm sorry. I promised a lot of friends I wouldn't go here, but this was the turning point. When the old goose eggs shrink to ping-pong balls, then to marbles, then your doctor asks if you want a refill on your Anadrol script, it's easy to say no. Here you are looking great, bright and alert, pumped and ripped you're looking more like a man than you ever have, but you're less of a man where it counts. Besides, the appeal of being a freaky, massive pile of muscle had already started to wane. Sure, at first it would be fun, like owning a rambling Victorian mansion, but after the first couple weeks the constant maintenance would eat up my life. I could never wander very far from a gym. I'd be eating egg protein every hour. All this and the whole project would still collapse some day.\n\nI jumped off the cliff because it was an adventure.\nAnd for 30 days I felt complete. But just until the tiny white pills ran out. Temporarily permanent. Complete and independent of everything. Everything except the Anadrol. the woman in Sacramento, hosting that barbecue all those years ago, she'd said, \"Those friends of yours, they're crazy.\" Beside the swimming pool, the man cradled the brittle cactus skeleton of his masculinity, the woman still stared at her clumps of bleached \"cougar fur.\" Pumped and huge in their tanktops, Ed and Bill disappeared, lumbering down the road. Out in the dark was the cougar. Or other cougars.\n\nEd used to wear a T-shirt that said, \"Fuck Moderation.\"\n\nThe hostess said, \"Why do men have to do such stupid things?\" \"As long as America has a frontier,\" Thomas Jefferson used to say, \"there will be a place for America's misfits and adventurers.\"\nNow Ed and Bill are fat eyesores, but that summer, really dude, they were massive. A good pump, my father, the Anadrol, all that's left is the intangible story. The legend. And okay, that thing about frontiers, maybe it wasn't Thomas Jefferson, but you get the idea.\n\nThere will be cougars outside. It's such a chick thing to think life should just go on forever. ",

    "body": "When I mean lots, I do mean lots; I sorta went overboard this week. The only 'major' update is yohimbine though, and it is a hard guy to study.\n\n[Muira Puama](http://examine.com/supplements/Muira+Puama/) (Marapuama, Potency Wood) is an aphrodisiac and boner pill with very weak evidence of both of those claims. However, it appears to be a potent adaptogen in preliminary studies (no anxiety-changing effects *per se*, but abolished the increase in stress associated with chronic stress in rats). Preliminary, but very promising as the effects seen in those studies outperform some reference drugs, Ashwagandha, Panax Ginseng, and Rhodiola Rosea.\n\n^ This was probably my favorite update this week, although I am currently doing Vitex Agnus Castus and this anti-PMS pill is sort of winning\n\n[Damiana Leaf](http://examine.com/supplements/Damiana+Leaf/). Upon re-evaluation I see absolute nothing good I can say about this compound. I mean, Gamma-Oryzanol last week at least had some promise as an anti-inflammatory, there is just no convincing evidence for Damiana Leaf. Disregard pls.\n\n[Asparagus Racemosus](http://examine.com/supplements/Asparagus+Racemosus/) is not the veggie eaten at dinner. This herb appears to have a wide range of putative benefits, but the benefits are putative at best. Some aphrodisiac and erectogenic effects, but they are mild and outperformed by Safed Musli all the time. No human studies on aphrodisia, but apparently well recieved in Ayurveda?\n\n[Chlorophytum Borivilianum](http://examine.com/supplements/Chlorophytum+Borivilianum/) is safed Musli, you can just Examine search for Safed Musli without remembering the herb name. This has no human studies except two where it was confounded with another herb and funded by USPLabs for their product PowerFUL (which is this product and the other one at 325mg each). It does appear to be quite an aphrodisiac and erectogenic agent in animals, and a single macrophage cell study noted increased secretion of nitric oxide measuring at 1004%. Whether this actually means anything is unknown, but preliminary evidence suggests this could be a good boner pill and immune support agent.\n\n[Pycnogenol](http://examine.com/supplements/Pycnogenol/) is procyanidins form Pine Bark. For many intents and purposes, consider it similar to Grape Seed Extract. It has definitely been shown to enhance blood flow and improve erection quality and frequency in men with organic erectile dysfunction, and does not show many properties of aphrodisia per se. The downside of this compound is that it was elevated to human studies way too soon (almost a third of hits in Pubmed are human interventions) and due to using 'Pycnogenol' rather than 'Maritime Pine Bark Extract' makes me worried that there is a lot of undisclosed industry influence on this one. Regardless, it does appear to be an effective blood flow enhancer via nitric oxide.\n\n[Aronia Melanocarpa](http://examine.com/supplements/Aronia+Melanocarpa/) is black chokeberries. I have been warned that they are going to be the next 'Acai' berry due to their high anti-oxidant content (which is indeed remarkable), but a lot of this amazingness is lost after oral ingestion. It appears to make unhealthy people slightly less unhealthy, but doesn't do much of anything in healthy people thus far. Basically, this is a denser blueberry.\n\nOk then, major one; [Yohimbine](http://examine.com/supplements/Yohimbine/). This was a bitch to look into since it is used in any animal system or human study that merely wants to see the effects of noradrenaline; Yohimbine *very* reliably enhances noradrenaline for a week or two before it goes back down to normal (although the direct 'stop fat loss inhibition' double negative effect on fat cells is preserved). I'll just outline the main things I want to get across:\n\n- Yohimbine per se increases noradrenaline, and noradrenaline per se increases anxiety. Whether or not you suffer anxiety depends on metabolism of yohimbine and your individual susceptibility to yohimbine; those with clinical conditions related to anxiety such as PTSD or Manic-Depressive symptom can very well be induced into a manic and anxious state with anything that increases noradrenaline and this *has* been noted with yohimbine\n\n- Start of slow, to assess individual response, work up accordingly. Fat loss with yohimbine is more dependent on alpha-2-adrenergic antagonism than it is dependent on noradrenaline, and avoiding excessive levels of yohimbine inducing anxiety and elevated heart rate should be key.\n\n- Studies use 0.2mg/kg bodyweight yohimbine most of the time (18mg for a 200lb person) and this dose appears to be safe *if used in isolation*; ingestion of other stimulants may require a lowering of the dose of yohimbine\n\n- Yohimbine is a good erectogenic agent for healthy people but a poor medication for erectile dysfunction; the increase in blood pressure and simultaneously antagonism of A2A (preventing catecholamines from preventing an erection)  make for harder boners, but A2A receptors are not really involved in erectile dysfunction pathology. Studies pairing Arginine or Citrulline with yohimbine show more promise\n\n- It burns fat. However, this may be almost completely dependent on exercise being conducted (with one very promising study in soccer players) and could be quite hindered if not taken in a fasted state. The leangains protocol of morning cardio with yohimbine in a fasted state appears to be quite valid in this regard. Taking yohimbine without exercise or diet appears to be nothing more than a cardiac liability\n\n- Yohimbine **lowers inhibition**. Very novel, very alcohol-like. This may underlie the benefits on erectile dysfunction (which seems to only be psychogenic erectile dysfunction) and could be useful for people with social anxiety disorders (myself included). However, it could be very bad for people with addictions including food addiction. It has been shown to increase relapse rates in animal models of drug rehabilitation, and I fear that people starting a diet and trying to kick a sugar habit would be subject to this as well\n\nTl;Dr: Yohimbine is a potent and effective fat burning compound for healthy people who have tested its effects on neurology (inhibition and anxiety), and can work in thin people effectively to bring you into single digit bodyfat. Its usage in obese or overweight persons is really a cost-benefit analysis since more harms are associated with the unhealthy state. Nothing about yohimbine is really 'healthy', but it is effective.",

I hope the time is spaced correctly between taking it and the shake/food.\n\nSo far I have not felt any negative effects, the only thing I take with it in the morning is a cup of coffee, and everything feels normal as ever. \n\nLast day will be next Friday, the following Monday I'll gauge the results.

Verbatim here \n\nInterview By https://unite.live/the-way-forward/the-way-forward/19-jul-12-00-clarifying-the-viral-narratives-with-david-martin-phd-alec-zeck\n\n( The Ruling Class and its shadow government) “were building  things that would ultimately toxify the environment to make human life more unattainable so that they could have greater control. They used  a series of biological weapons …to create a branded terror campaign…that included the term sarscovi2, which is a term that was necessary because they had declared sarscovi1 eradicated. …So it kind of sucks if you are going to sell a fear narrative  the sarscovi1 was eradicated,  because  that would declare  science was wrong. And obviously you can’t do that if you are trying  to do a terror campaign. So sarscovi2 was a branding campaign conducted during the month of February 2020. The ICTV which is the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses , published on March 2, 2020, their official brand said there  was a novel pathogen ,to be branded SarsCovi2,…and there was a ‘disease causes by this thing . They branded the disease covid 19  but they were very clear to stipulate there was no disease ; there was a set of symptoms and those symptoms were associated with influenza like illness and have been associated with these symptoms for 55 years …..so this idea that there was a novel disease was a branding campaign , so for purpose of this conversation we can stipulate that the entirety of the last for years was a premeditated act of domestic and international terrorism, and most importantly the perpetrators admitted to that very fact in 2015. They said they were going to make an event where the media would create such a hype the public would demand a medical  countermeasure called a ‘vaccine.’  The unambiguous nature of what this is was domestic and international terrorism collusion , racketeering . They admitted they were going to commit the crime in 2015 and they executed the crime on schedule. “",

Eventually every single of the 16 virus databases managed by the WIV was taken offline.\n\nhttps://archive.is/i79eW\n\n\n\n**Here's former CDC director Robert Redfield under oath before the Congress on Wuhan Lab September 2019 events:**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/aXXWRaM-sWQ?feature=share\n\n\n>I will say if you go back and look, it's declassified now, and I'm sure you all have your classified briefings, but the declassified information now: \n\n>In September of 2019, three things happened in that lab, one is they deleted the sequences, that was highly irregular, researchers don't usually like to do that\n\n>Second thing they did was they changed the command and control of the lab from the civilian control to the military control. Highly unusual, and I've been involved in dual use labs when I was in the military.\n\n\n>And the third thing they did which I think is really telling is they let a contractor redo the ventilation system in that laboratory. So I think  clearly there was strong evidence that there was a significant event that happened in that laboratory in September. It's now been declassified, you can read it. I'm sure there's more classified information around it.\n\n**Scientist Richard Ebright**\n\n>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction. And here is a proposal from the beginning of 2018 [from Fauci/Gates-funded EcoHealth Alliance] proposing explicitly to engineer that sequence at that position in chimeric lab- generated coronaviruses.\n\n- Richard Ebright, an eminent molecular biologist at Rutgers University, https://archive.is/cCBUw\n\n**Eminent Virologist David Baltimore of CalTech**\n\n>When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.\n\n- David Baltimore, an eminent virologist and former president of CalTech, https://archive.is/yalCe\n\n\n**Former CDC Director Robert Redfield:**\n\n>I was concerned because of the presence of the furin cleavage site that we've talked about and I think it's important to understand what that cleavage site does. That cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of COVID, so where before it could not see the ACE2 receptor which is the human receptor, it totally changes the orientation now so it has high affinity for human receptors. So that furin cleavage site bothered me, it didn't seem like it belonged there. \n\n>And then if you look at the sequences they use in those 12 nucleotides for arginine, where the arginine sequence nucleotide triplet were coded for humans. So why did it have the arginine coding for humans and not bat? It was very disconcerting to me. It looked like this virus was engineered.\n\n\n>It's not scientifically plausible that this virus went from a bat to humans and became one of the most infectious viruses that we have for humans. \n\n\n\n**Scientist Valentin Bruttel:**\n\n>I tried to raise awareness to this for a year now.\nWIV use BsaI and BsmBI/Esp3I sites before to make synthetic WIV1 variants.\nAnd exactly those sites appear in a \"silently introduced, perfect for synthetic assembly\" pattern in SARS2, but non of its nat. relatives.\n\n>seriously, what is the chance that exactly those type IIs restriction appear or disappear through random evolution in a Banal-20-52 like virus?\n5-6 precise mutations in 30000bp?\nabout 1 in 10^20!\nSARS2 is clearly synthetic!\n\n**Type Ils restriction sites prove a synthetic origin**\n\nSynthetic RNA viruses are assembled at the DNA level and later transcribed. 30,000 nucleotides cannot be synthesized in one go. These viruses are therefore assembled from smaller, 2- 8,000 nucleotide long pieces. Specific DNA restriction sites are often added to later reassemble the individual building blocks in the correct order. It is also technically possible to hide these interfaces (No See'em), but this was not done in the WIV.\n\nIn a 2017 paper, two very specific, particularly suitable type Ils restriction enzymes were used at the WIV. These have the advantage that they can produce different DNA overhangs (sticky ends), which are crucial for a correct assembly of the complete genome: Bsal and BsmBI.\n\nSARS2 shows a Bsal and BsmBI restriction site pattern which is ideal for assembling synthetic viruses and to later replace the spike protein or furin cleavage site.\n\nBsal and BsmBI restriction sites also exist in closely related viruses (Banal20-52, RaTG13), but these are distributed in such a way that an artificial virus could never be generated using the methods established at WIV 2018/19. \n\n**The probability that the required 5 synonymous mutations, which enable a synthetic assembly of SARS2, arose purely by chance is less than 1 in 10^20 or about as likely as winning the lottery jackpot 3 times in a row.**\n\nDr. Valentin Bruttel\n\nhttps://twitter.com/VBruttel/status/1566365635680124929?t=koDQ9poynY6I9qSchgQAnw&s=19\n\n#Alina Chan NY Times article:\n\n\"Why the Pandemic Probably Started in a Lab, in 5 Key Points\"\n\n>Dr. Chan is a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of M.I.T. and Harvard, and a co-author of “Viral: The Search for the Origin of Covid-19.”\n\n>1. The SARS-like virus that caused the pandemic emerged in Wuhan, the city where the world’s foremost research lab for SARS-like viruses is located.\n\n>2. The year before the outbreak, the Wuhan institute, working with U.S. partners, had proposed creating viruses with SARS‑CoV‑2’s defining feature.\n\n>3. The Wuhan lab pursued this type of work under low biosafety conditions that could not have contained an airborne virus as infectious as SARS‑CoV‑2.\n\n>4. The hypothesis that Covid-19 came from an animal at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan is not supported by strong evidence.\n\n\n\n\n>5. Key evidence that would be expected if the virus had emerged from the wildlife trade is still missing. Despite the intense search trained on the animal trade and people linked to the market, investigators have not reported finding any animals infected with SARS‑CoV‑2 that had not been infected by humans. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html\n\n\"No one can find the animal that gave people covid-19\"\n\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/26/1021263/bat-covid-coronavirus-cause-origin-wuhan/\n\n\"10 reasons we KNOW that COVID-19 leaked from the Wuhan Lab\"\n\n>One of the only labs in the world manipulating coronaviruses was right next to where we can trace the beginnings of the pandemic.

It provided support for businesses, individuals, and governments through measures such as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), direct stimulus payments, and expanded unemployment benefits.\n\nWhile the bill aimed to provide critical relief to struggling businesses and workers, some analysts argue that much of the financial support ended up reinforcing the wealth of large corporations and private equity firms. This occurred as these entities accessed vast loans and bailout funds with minimal restrictions, enabling them to maintain stock buybacks and executive compensation while consolidating smaller competitors. Consequently, critics suggest the act indirectly exacerbated wealth inequality by funneling a significant portion of the relief to those already in strong financial positions.\n\nJimmy Dore (THE MF GOAT) has many a video explaining this in great detail with humor, I recommend checking him out.",

HA forms a  water retention film on the skin surface and exerts a high moisturizing effect, but at the same time, its very large molecular size hinders  penetration into the stratum corneum after application. With the new  technology, HA shrinks via the addition of magnesium ions (Mg ions) and dramatically increases its penetration into the stratum corneum compared to normal HA. In addition, this technology re-expands the shrunken HA  (“Compact HA”) via the addition of sodium metaphosphate, a type of chelating agent(\\*1), resulting in restoration of the original properties of HA and increasing the water content in the stratum corneum.  \n\n**\\[PROBIOTICS\\]** [**Anti-Melanogenic and Antioxidant Effects of Cell-Free Supernatant from Lactobacillus gasseri BNR17**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9027439/)\n\n>April 8, 2022 -  In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the use of cell-free supernatant of probiotics culture for nutritional and functional applications.

Based on the  genetic analysis, a novel formula against retinol-induced irritation was  developed, which mitigated the molecular pathogenesis—as indicated by  the genetic markers—of the retinol-induced irritation. In human tests, this formula effectively decreased retinol-induced irritation. Furthermore, a polygenic risk score model for irritation was constructed  and validated. Our comprehensive approach for the analysis of  retinol-induced irritation will not only aid the development of  anti-irritation strategies to ensure higher user compliance but also  contribute to improving the current knowledge about the biological  effects of retinoids.    \n>  \n>...the series of in vitro experiments revealed that glucosamine,  sucralfate, trehalose, ectoine, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, and omega-9 fatty  acid could mitigate the irritation-associated molecular pathogenesis  for COL6A2, EGFR, and IL-4R.  Our developed formula against retinol-induced irritation decreased skin  redness and TEWL in the objective analysis, and it also decreased the  individuals’ degree of irritation on a subjective analysis in both  small-scale pilot studies and large-scale human tests. An anti-irritant  strategy was developed, and a polygenic risk score model for the  prediction of individual irritation was developed.\n\n**\\[SKIN FUNCTION\\]** [**Shiseido Elucidates Skin’s Adaptation Mechanism to Dry Environment**](https://corp.shiseido.com/en/news/detail.html?n=00000000003402)\n\n>May 31, 2022 -  Shiseido Company, Limited has revealed that in a dry environment, the skin promotes the production of Peptidyl Arginine Deiminase 1 (PAD1), an enzyme that produces Natural Moisturizing Factor (NMF). This suggests that the skin has the ability to retain moisture, coexisting with the environment. In addition, we have found a new  ingredient that enhances PAD1 expression and supports the skin’s  moisture retention ability. These findings are expected to be applied to  the development of cosmetics that boost the skin’s abilities to adapt  and resist to a dry environment.  \n\n**\\[TECH\\]** [**Beauty at the fingertips: Home-based radiofrequency devices might be more effective than anti-ageing cosmetics**](https://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Article/2022/05/31/home-based-radiofrequency-device-more-effective-for-skin-rejuvenation-than-cosmetics?utm_source=copyright&utm_medium=OnSite&utm_campaign=copyright)\n\n>May 31, 2022 - A home-based radiofrequency (RF) beauty device was found to be a safe and effective solution for skin rejuvenation, and could be more effective than commercially-available anti-ageing cosmetics, according to a new study. \n\nStudy: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9021338/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9021338/)\n\n>Thirty-three  women aged 35–60 years were enrolled in this randomized, controlled,  split-face trial.

One side of the face was randomly selected to be part of the experimental group and treated  with the RF beauty device, while the other side was considered as  control and was treated with an anti-aging cosmetic. Treatment safety  was evaluated.

    "body": "I posted [The Beginner's Guide to Working Out](https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/ihz264/beginners_guide_to_working_out/) on Reddit a little while back and got lots of positive feedback, so I decided to write a guide on nutrition too. Enjoy! :)\n\n# Nutrition Guide\n\nWhen it comes to achieving a healthy lifestyle, exercise is just one side of the coin - the other is nutrition. If you want to make any real progress towards meeting your fitness goals (regardless of what they are), you’re going to need to focus just as much attention on it. \n\nUnfortunately, the health & fitness industry is full of conflicting information regarding what’s healthy or unhealthy, or what will make you gain or lose weight. In this guide, you’ll find some basic information about the 3 macronutrients in the diet (carbohydrates, protein and fat), what foods to eat more of and what to avoid, and guidelines about how to adjust your diet for different body composition goals. There’s also a few meal ideas included, as well modifications for those trying to lose fat or gain muscle.\n\n# Carbohydrates\n\nCarbohydrates are the main source of fuel used by the body (especially during exercise), and are heavily preferred by the brain and nervous system.   \nIf carbohydrates are lacking during physical activity, there is a high risk of muscle mass (protein) being broken down to be used as energy in its place.  \nAll carbohydrates are broken down into glucose (sugar molecules) during digestion. Each gram provides 4 calories of energy, regardless of the source.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two types of carbohydrates: simple and complex. Simple carbohydrates consist only of one or two sugar units. They are digested and absorbed quickly into the bloodstream, making them a fast energy source. Examples include sucrose (table sugar), glucose (found in fruit, honey, syrups, soft drinks, etc.) and fructose (found mainly in fruit).  \nComplex carbohydrates, on the other hand, consist of many sugar units. They are digested and absorbed more slowly into the bloodstream, which increases feelings of satiation. The main dietary complex carb is starch, which is found predominantly in grains (eg. rice, wheat, maize) and root vegetables (eg. potatoes)\n\n## Glycemic Index\n\nThe glycemic index is a tool used to rank carbohydrates based off of how much they raise blood sugar after consumption. Foods which are rapidly digested and absorbed are on the high end of the scale. Glucose has the highest rating of 100, whereas most non-starchy vegetables have the lowest ratings (less than 15).  \n\n\nBelow are some examples of low (0-55), medium (56-69) and high (70+) GI foods.  \n\n\n**Low Glycemic Index Foods (0-55)**  \n Non-starchy vegetables **<15**  \nTomatoes **15**  \nCherries **22**  \nGrapefruit **25**  \nApple **36**  \nGrapes **43**  \nPineapple juice **46**  \nLong-grain rice **47**  \nGrapefruit juice **48**  \nOld-fashioned porridge **49** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Medium Glycemic Index Foods (56-69)**  \nCanned kidney beans **52**  \nBanana **53**  \nPotato chips **54**  \nBrown rice **54**  \nPopcorn **55**  \nWhite rice **56**  \nIce cream **61**  \nRaisins **64**  \nQuick-cooking porridge **65**  \nWhole wheat bread **68**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**High Glycemic Index Foods (70+)**  \nBagel **72**  \nWatermelon **72**  \nHoney **73**  \nMashed potatoes **73**  \nDoughnuts **75**  \nWhite bread **79**  \nJelly beans **80**  \nRice cakes **82**  \nParsnips **97**  \nDates **100**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Fiber\n\nFiber is a type of complex carbohydrate which is composed of largely indigestible plant structures. There are two main types of dietary fiber:   \n**Soluble fiber**: Dissolves to form a thick paste, and is partially absorbed in the large intestine. It can interfere with the absorption of LDL cholesterol (“bad” cholesterol), and slow the digestion of carbohydrates into the bloodstream, thus preventing rapid blood sugar spikes after eating (and increasing satiety).  \n**Insoluble fiber**: This type of fiber passes through the body intact, and is not dissolved or absorbed. Its primary function is to help speed up the movement of food through the digestive system, and provide bulk for stool.  \nGood sources of fiber include fruit skins, leaves, stalks, and outer coverings of grains, nuts, seeds and legumes. Green vegetables, lentils & beans, and whole grains are some examples.  \n\n\n## Dietary Intake\n\nIdeally, a healthy carbohydrate intake should focus on eating a variety of vegetables and whole grains, while minimizing simple processed sugars (baked treats, candy, soft drinks, etc.). This will increase intake of fiber, vitamins & minerals, as well as increasing satiety and preventing blood sugar spikes.\n\nIt’s also recommended that you try to stick to foods with a lower GI rating (especially if weight loss is your goal). This will result in more even blood sugar levels throughout the day, more energy, and increased satiety.   \nA good baseline is to aim for 40% of your daily calories to come from carbohydrates. This macronutrient generally has the most leeway for variance, and is usually where the bulk of calories are added or removed when the goal is to gain or lose weight. For weight loss, carbs might drop to around 25% of daily calories, and for weight gain, they might raise to around 60% of daily calories.  \nThe daily recommended intake of fiber is 14 grams for every 1000 calories consumed. For a 2000 calorie diet, this equals 28 grams of fiber per day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Protein\n\nProtein is a vital part of any diet, as it plays many important roles in the body. These include aiding in the growth, maintenance and repair of cells, producing enzymes and hormones, and  supporting the immune system (to name just a few).  \nNormally, proteins are not used as a primary source of energy (unless nutrition is inadequate, or one is engaging in intense physical activity). Each gram of protein provides 4 calories of energy.  \nThe basic building blocks of proteins are called amino acids. Many different types exist, but only around 20 are considered biologically important. Of these, 9 are “essential” - the body cannot produce them, so they must be consumed in the diet. Of the 9 essential amino acids, 3 are further classified as “branched chain amino acids” (BCCAs), which are used in disproportionately high amounts during periods of stress, injury or exercise.   \nThere are also “conditional” amino acids, which can be produced by the body, but still have an important place in the diet under certain circumstances (such as during illness or intense physical activity).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|NON-ESSENTIAL|CONDITIONAL|ESSENTIAL| BCAAs |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|  Alanine | Alanine | Histidine | Isoleucine |\n|Arginine| Arginine |  Isoleucine| Leucine |\n| Cysteine | Cysteine | Leucine | Valine |\n| Citrulline | Glutamine | Lysine ||\n| Glutamic Acid | Glycine | Methionine ||\n| Glutamine | Proline | Phenylalanine ||\n| Proline | Serine | Threonine ||\n| Serine | Tyrosine | Tryptophan ||\n| Taurine || Valine ||\n| Tyrosine ||||\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough the body tends to prefer using carbohydrates and fat as energy sources, it will use amino acids in certain circumstances. This often includes instances when carbohydrate stores are limited, such as during states of severe calorie restriction or during intense or prolonged exercise. Because BCCAs are the body’s favoured source of amino acid fuel, it’s important to include a steady supply of them in the diet - especially in active individuals. If any one of them becomes in short supply, this may begin to restrict multiple bodily functions (including growth and repair of muscle tissues).   \n\n\n# Complete and Incomplete Proteins\n\nComplete proteins are those which include all 9 essential amino acids in sufficient amounts for growth and development. Animal sources of protein (such as meat, eggs and milk) are complete, and have the added benefit of being highly bioavailable (our body can digest and metabolise them easily).   \nIncomplete proteins are lacking one or more of the essential amino acids. Most plant proteins are considered incomplete, but can be combined in ways that make their amino acid profiles complement each other. For example, this can be achieved by mixing nuts with whole grains, (eg. peanut butter and whole wheat toast) or whole grains with beans (eg. beans and rice). \n\n## Dietary Intake\n\nThe recommended minimum protein intake needed to prevent deficiency in sedentary, healthy adults is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body mass. However, higher amounts are needed to accommodate the increased growth, maintenance and repair needs of active individuals - research suggests 1.6 to 2.0 grams per kilogram of body mass is more ideal.   \nDue to protein’s vital role in immune function, metabolism, satiety, weight management and performance, many experts recommend the higher intake (2 grams per kilogram of body mass, or even slightly more). Note that these amounts are assuming the person is at a healthy bodyweight.  \nBecause your body can only absorb around 30 grams of protein in one sitting, it’s best to try to incorporate around 15-30 grams of protein into every meal. This has the added benefit of increasing satiety throughout the day. Try to get your protein from a variety of food sources, only using supplements like whey protein powder to fill in the gaps as needed.  \n\n\n# Fats\n\nAlthough often demonized by the health and fitness industries, fats (also known as lipids) are an important part of any diet. They serve many vital roles in the body, including manufacturing hormones, forming cell membranes, brain tissue and nerves, and transporting fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K).  \nThey are also the most energy-dense macronutrient, providing 9 calories per gram (this is why eating too many fats can quickly lead to weight gain).   \nThe basic building block of fats is the fatty acid, of which there are two general types: saturated, and unsaturated. Saturated fatty acids are generally in a solid form at room temperature, and include most animal fats and coconut oil. Unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature, and are further broken down into monounsaturated fatty acids (olive oil, avocado oil, nut oils) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (flax, hemp, canola, safflower, and fish oils).   \nUnsaturated fats have been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health, cholesterol levels, inflammation, and metabolism.  \nAlthough widely viewed as unhealthy, recent research suggests that saturated fats are safe to eat in moderation, as long as they are balanced with an adequate consumption of unsaturated fats, and a lower intake of sugar and processed carbohydrates.   \nThere are also trans fatty acids, which are produced by synthetically hydrogenating vegetable oils to prolong their shelf life (usually found in baked goods, margarine, fried foods, etc.). Trans fats are linked with an increased risk for coronary heart disease, cancer, and other chronic diseases, and should be avoided when possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Omega-3 and Omega-6 Fatty Acids\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids are a polyunsaturated fatty acid, and found mainly in fish oils, flaxseed oil, walnuts and chia seeds. Omega-6 fatty acids, also polyunsaturated, are abundant in safflower, sunflower, corn, and soybean oils. Throughout history, due largely to our diet of marine life and inland plants, our ratio of consumed omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids has been around 1:1 to 4:1 - and this is what is considered healthy.  \nHowever, due to the recent overconsumption of vegetable oils, this ratio has shifted disproportionately in favour of omega-6 fatty acids - sometimes as high as 20:1.  \nTherefore, to shift the balance back towards what is conducive to good health, it is recommended to actively consume more foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids when possible, and reduce consumption of omega-6 fatty acids. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Essential fatty acids\n\nThere are two fatty acids which cannot be produced by the body, and therefore must be consumed via the diet: linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid.   \nLinoleic acid is an omega-6 fatty acid found in safflower, corn, and soybean oils. In modern diets, deficiency is rare.   \nAlpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is an omega-3 fatty acid, and found in inland plants such as chia, flax, hemp and walnuts.  \nIt’s important to note that ALA can be used by the body to produce eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which in turn can be used to produce docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). However, this conversion in the liver is limited, which means EPA and DHA are also important parts of the diet. They are recognized as the most beneficial omega-3 fats, and are predominantly found in marine sources such as fish oils and algae.  \nAdequate consumption of essential fatty acids promotes healthy cardiovascular function, nervous system function, and immune health.   \n\n\n# Cholesterol\n\nCholesterol is a type of lipid which is produced in the body, and found largely in animal products such as liver, egg yolks, red meat, whole milk, and cheese. It is a component of cells, a precursor of bile acids, various hormones, and vitamin D, and an important part of nervous system tissues.  \nThere are two types of cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein (HDL), also known as “good” cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as “bad” cholesterol. A constant supply of HDL cholesterol is needed for proper health and performance, whereas too much LDL cholesterol is correlated with a risk of narrowed arteries, heart disease and stroke.\n\n## \n\n## Dietary Intake\n\nIt is recommended to keep fat at around 30% of your daily caloric intake. Staying closer to 20% will help with weight loss, simply due to how densely packed fat molecules are with calories.   \nAs previously stated, a healthy diet should focus on consuming unsaturated fats - especially the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, which can most easily be found in fatty fish. Be mindful of your saturated fat intake, and try to eliminate trans fats altogether.  \n\n\n# Calculating Caloric Expenditure \n\nYour Daily Calorie Expenditure (DCE) is a cumulation of all the calories you burn throughout the day. This is also sometimes referred to as your “maintenance level” of calories, because eating this amount every day will lead to you staying at approximately the same bodyweight.   \nYour DCE is usually calculated by combining your Basal Metabolic Rate (the calories your body uses to keep you alive, performing vital functions such as breathing and pumping blood) by a measure of how much activity you do throughout the day.  \nAn approximation of your BMR can be calculated using your weight, gender and age.   \nYour activity level is the factor you have the greatest control over in increasing (or decreasing) your DCE. While sessions of exercise certainly are one way of achieving this, it must be noted that far more calories are often burned during activities of daily living - walking, standing, doing chores, etc. This is due to the fact that, while intense, exercise sessions usually only last around an hour, while activities of daily living can take up the majority of the day.   \nWhile it’s almost impossible to perfectly factor in one’s activity when trying to estimate how many calories they burn, it must be noted that, if the goal is weight loss, trying to move around as much as possible can be surprisingly helpful. This can include things like choosing to walk instead of drive whenever possible, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or getting a standing desk at work.\n\nMALE              metric:         **DCE = ALF x ((13.75 x WKG) + (5 x HC) - (6.76 x age) + 66)**  \nimperial:       **DCE = ALF x ((6.25 x WP) + (12.7 x HI) - (6.76 x age) + 66)**\n\nFEMALE         metric:          **DCE = ALF x ((9.56 x WKG) + (1.85 x HC) - (4.68 x age) + 655)**  \nimperial:       **DCE = ALF x ((4.35 x WP) + (4.7 x HI) - (4.68 x age) + 655)**\n\n**ALF** = Activity level factor    \n**DCE** = Daily caloric expenditure   \n**HC** = Height in centimeters  \n**HI** = Height in inches  \n**WKG** = Weight in kilograms  \n**WP** = Weight in pounds\n\n**Sedentary:** ALF = 1.2 (little or no exercise, desk job)  \n**Lightly active:** ALF = 1.375 (light exercise 1-3 days/week)  \n**Moderately active**: ALF = 1.55 (moderate exercise 3-5 days/week)  \n**Very active**: ALF = 1.725 (hard exercise 6-7 days/week)  \n**Extremely active:** ALF = 1.9 (hard daily exercise and physical job, or 2x a day training)\n\n# \n\n# Losing Weight\n\nThe rule which underlies all weight loss is simple: burn more calories than you eat.  \nTo put it into numbers, it takes a net loss of 3500 calories to lose one pound of weight. That means that if you ate 500 calories per day under your maintenance level, you’d lose one pound a week; if you ate 250 calories under, you’d lose one pound every two weeks.   \nWhile it is possible to also achieve this daily net loss in calories via increased activity (as opposed to eating less food), it’s recommended not to rely solely on this method.  \nThere are a couple of reasons for this:  \n1. It’s almost impossible to accurately calculate how many calories you burn via activity. This number can vary based on workout intensity, bodyweight, body composition, fitness level, and many other factors. The number that pops up on the cardio machine is usually greatly exaggerated. Which brings us to our second point...  \n2. You don’t burn nearly as many calories during exercise as you might think. An average person will only burn around 250 calories after spending 30 minutes on an elliptical. Do that every single day, without fail (and never overeat), and you will lose around 2 pounds a month. Compound this with the fact that exercise usually increases your appetite, and you can see why most people give up on their weight loss efforts quite quickly.  \nIt is therefore better to focus mainly on reducing the calories from your diet, and supplementing with exercise as necessary.  \nWhen choosing how much to reduce your daily caloric intake by, I would personally recommend starting on the smaller side (around 250 calories per day). This allows you to transition into your new eating habits much easier, and you can always reduce the calories further if you’re not seeing any progress.  \nAs far as exercise is concerned, how much you should do depends on your current activity level. If you’re already quite active, stick with that. If you’re just starting out, begin with 2-3 times a week. Try to also move around throughout the day as much as possible (walking, standing, doing chores, etc.).  \nI would highly recommend doing resistance training for the majority of your exercise (using weight lifting, resistance bands, kettlebells, etc. for several sets of around 8-12 repetitions). Doing small bouts of intense exercise not only raises your metabolism for the next 24 hours, but it also ensures your body holds on to the muscle that it currently has. This is how you achieve that “toned” look. Without resistance training, your body is (unfortunately) not too choosy about where the weight loss is coming from when you are in a caloric deficit. You’ll start to lose muscle along with fat, and never quite achieve the physique you are likely looking for.  \n**Here are the steps to follow in order to successfully lose fat:**\n\n1. Calculate your Daily Caloric Expenditure (using the activity level factor which best fits your current situation).\n2. Subtract around 250 calories from that number. That is your new daily goal.\n3. Do resistance training at least twice a week, trying to increase movement throughout the day wherever possible.\n4. Weight yourself at the end of the month. If your weight isn’t going down, subtract your calories by another 250, and repeat. Continue until you start seeing progress.\n\nNote that it’s rarely necessary to reduce your calories to much less than around 1500. If you’re consistently eating this amount and still not losing weight, you may be logging your food inaccurately.\n\n## \n\n## Macronutrient Breakdown\n\nWhile eating a correct ratio of carbs, proteins and fats doesn’t lead to weight loss by itself, it can help you reach your goals quicker and easier.   \nHere’s a rough breakdown of how to do it:  \n\n\n1. Calculate your daily caloric goal (let’s use 1800 calories/day as an example).\n2. Calculate your daily protein intake. For healthy individuals, this should be roughly 1.6g per kg of body mass - if you’re overweight, use the body mass you would have at a healthy weight. If you weigh 82kg (180lbs), that would be 130g of protein per day. There are 4 calories in each gram of protein, so that equals 520 of your daily calories from protein (around 30%).\n3. Calculate your daily fat intake. A good rule of thumb is to aim for around 20% of your diet if your goal is weight loss.\n4. Calculate your daily carbohydrate intake. This is the macronutrient that allows for the most variation, depending on your goals, and different people function better with different amounts of carbs. In this example, 50% of your calories would come from carbs. \n\nThe most important macronutrient to consume enough of is protein, because this prevents muscle loss, and leads to increased satiation throughout the day.\n\n## \n\n## Dietary Tips\n\nWhile maintaining a caloric deficit is the most important thing for weight loss, having a generally healthy diet makes this far easier to accomplish.\n\nHere are a few guidelines to help you out:\n\n* Eat 15-30g of protein at every meal. \n* Avoid carbs that are high on the Glycemic Index. This will prevent blood sugar spikes (which create energy crashes and subsequent hunger), increase satiation, and provide more stable energy throughout the day.\n* Eat several smaller meals throughout the day (as opposed to a couple large ones),which  will also lead to more stable blood sugar levels. \n* Eat at least one serving of vegetables during every meal. This will increase fiber and nutrient intake. Non-starchy vegetables are also great at filling you up with very few calories.\n* Drink lots of water (at least 2L per day). Try to limit drinking fluids with calories.\n* Try to stick to fruit if you are craving something sweet. It’s digested more slowly than candy or chocolate, and provides fiber and nutrients. \n* Limit the amount of fat and oils you cook with or add to meals throughout the day (this includes butter, olive oil, peanut butter, etc.) Only one tablespoon is usually close to 100 calories, and this can add up quickly without you even noticing it. \n\n# \n\n# Gaining Weight\n\nThe rule which underlies weight gain is, intuitively, the opposite of weight loss: eat more calories than you burn.\n\nThe tricky part of weight gain is ensuring the majority of the mass is coming from muscle, and not fat.\n\nMany people think “bulking” entails simply eating as much as you can every day, and, while this certainly can lead to muscle gain, it will also ensure your muscles are covered in a thick layer of fat. It takes around 2500 calories to build one pound of muscle. Considering that most men can build, at maximum, 2 pounds of muscle a month, and most women can build about 1 pound of muscle a month, that really doesn’t lead to many more calories required per day - usually no more than 200-300. \n\nOf course, you also need to account for the calories burned by your increased activity level, which will ideally be 3-5 times a week of resistance training. \n\n**Here are the steps to follow in order to successfully gain muscle:**\n\n1. Calculate your Daily Caloric Expenditure (using the activity level factor that best fits your current situation, which should be at least moderate exercise 3-5x a week).\n2. Add around 250 calories to that number. That is your new daily goal.\n3. Follow a resistance training plan, focusing on progressive overload.\n4. Weigh yourself at the end of the month. If your weight has increased by around 1-2 pounds, continue what you’re doing. If it’s increased by much more than that, reduce your daily calories slightly. If it’s stayed the same, increase your daily calories until you start to see progress.\n\n## \n\n## Macronutrient Breakdown\n\nMaking sure you are eating a good ratio of carbs, proteins and fats doesn’t lead to weight gain in itself, but it can help ensure the weight gain is coming from muscle, and that you have enough energy during your workouts.  \nHere’s a rough breakdown of how to do it:  \n\n\n1. Calculate your daily caloric goal (let’s use 2500 calories/day as an example).\n2. Calculate your daily protein intake. For healthy individuals, this should be roughly 2g per kg of body mass - if you’re overweight, use the body mass you would have at a healthy weight. If you weigh 82kg (180lbs), that would be 164g of protein per day. There are 4 calories in each gram of protein, so that equals 650 of your daily calories from protein (around 25%).\n3. Calculate your daily fat intake. A good rule of thumb is to aim for around 20-30% of your diet. \n4. Calculate your daily carbohydrate intake. This is the macronutrient that allows for the most variation, depending on your goals, and different people function better with different amounts of carbs. In this example, 45-55% of your calories would come from carbs. Bodybuilding diets usually have higher carbohydrate ratios, because this is the macronutrient which is used to fuel your intense workouts (and spares protein to be used towards building and repairing muscles).\n\nThe most important macronutrient to consume enough of is protein, because this is what muscle is built out of. Your protein turnover rate will also be higher, due to the nature of your workouts. \n\n## \n\n## Dietary Tips\n\nSuccessfully gaining muscle (and avoiding gaining fat) depends on a number of factors, including eating enough calories, eating enough protein, and working out hard enough.   \nHere are a few guidelines you can use to maintain a healthy diet, which will make these goals easier to accomplish: \n\n* Space your protein consumption out throughout the day, as your body can only absorb around 30-40g at once.\n* Make sure you are eating proteins with a complete essential amino acid profile. This is most easily achieved with animal products (meat, eggs, whey protein powder, etc.)\n* It’s actually okay to eat foods higher on the Glycemic Index now and then (especially around an hour before a workout), as your muscles rely on this type of energy during exercise. However, try to stick to whole foods (white rice, mashed potatoes, fruits, etc.) as opposed to sugary processed options.\n* Similar to a fat loss diet, try to eat at at least one serving of vegetables during every meal. Higher fiber and nutrient intake is good for any diet, and more nutrients will help your muscles repair and grow.\n* Drink lots of water (at least 2L per day). \n\n# \n\n# Meal Ideas\n\n## Breakfast\n\n#### Protein Oatmeal\n\n* ⅓ cup of oatmeal\n* Scoop of whey protein powder\n* Handful of blueberries\n* 1 teaspoon of honey\n\nCalories: 251 Protein: 29g Carbs: 27g Fat: 4g  \n**Modifications for Weight Gain**: \n\n* Use ½ cup of oatmeal\n* Add 1 tablespoon of peanut butter\n* Add 1 banana\n\nCalories: 522 Protein: 35g Carbs: 70g Fat: 13g  \n\n\n#### Eggs & Toast\n\n* 2 pieces of multigrain toast\n* 2 tablespoons of guacamole\n* 3 scrambled egg whites\n* 2 strips of turkey bacon\n\nCalories: 341 Protein: 26g Carbs: 38g Fat: 10g\n\n**Modifications for Weight Gain**:\n\n* Use 3 whole scrambled eggs\n* Use 3 pieces of toast\n* Add 1 tablespoon of guacamole\n\nCalories: 595 Protein: 37g Carbs: 56g Fat: 25g\n\n#### \n\n#### Protein Smoothie\n\n* 1 cup of almond milk\n* 1 scoop of protein powder\n* Frozen banana\n* ½ cup of frozen strawberries\n\nCalories: 314 Protein: 27g Carbs: 45g Fat: 4g\n\n**Modifications for Weight Gain**:\n\n* Use regular 2% milk\n* Use 2 frozen bananas\n* Add 1 tablespoon of peanut butter\n\nCalories: 594 Protein: 38g Carbs: 81g Fat: 15g\n\n## \n\n## Lunch\n\n#### Tuna & Cheesy Rice\n\n* ⅓ cup of rice\n* ½ can of tuna\n* ½ tablespoon of light mayonnaise\n* 15g shredded cheese\n\nCalories: 300 Protein: 22g Carbs: 36g Fat: 8g\n\n**Modifications for Weight Gain**:\n\n* Use ½ cup of rice\n* Use whole tablespoon of light mayonnaise\n* Use whole can of tuna\n* Use 30g shredded cheese\n\nCalories: 500 Protein: 37g Carbs: 49g Fat: 17g\n\n#### \n\n#### Chicken Wrap (weight loss)\n\n* 1 whole wheat wrap\n* ½ chicken breast (shredded)\n* 15g shredded cheese\n* ½ tablespoon of light mayonnaise and mustard\n* Diced tomato, cucumber and green pepper\n\nCalories: 365 Protein: 35g Carbs: 28g Fat: 13g\n\n#### \n\n#### Burrito (weight gain)\n\n* 1 whole wheat wrap\n* 115g lean ground beef (with seasoning)\n* 1 tablespoon of guacamole\n* 1 tablespoon of sour cream\n* 15g shredded cheese\n* ¼ cup of black beans\n* ¼ cup of rice\n\nCalories: 605 Protein: 37g Carbs: 63g Fat: 24g\n\n## \n\n## Dinner\n\n#### Grilled salmon\n\n* 4 oz. grilled salmon fillet\n* ¼ cup of rice\n* Baked carrots, broccoli and green beans\n\nCalories: 314 Protein: 24g Carbs: 26g Fat: 12g\n\n**Modifications for Weight Gain**:\n\n* Use ⅓ cup of rice\n* Fry veggies in 1 tablespoon of butter\n\nCalories: 466 Protein: 25g Carbs: 37g Fat: 23g\n\n#### \n\n#### Homemade Chili (4 servings):\n\n500g lean ground beef (with chili seasoning)\n\n* 1 can of diced tomatoes\n* 1 can of kidney beans\n* 1 small can of tomato sauce\n* Onion and garlic\n\n**For Weight Loss**:\n\n* 1 serving\n\nCalories: 446 Protein: 39g Carbs: 60g Fat: 9g\n\n**For Weight Gain**:\n\n* 1 serving\n* Add bun or ⅓ cup of rice\n\nCalories: 596 Protein: 42g Carbs 95g Fat: 9g\n\n#### \n\n#### Chicken & Veggies\n\n* One chicken breast fillet (seasoned)\n* One large sweet potato\n* Brussels sprouts\n* ½ tablespoon of butter\n\nCalories: 373 Protein: 30g Carbs: 45g Fat: 7g\n\n**Modifications for Weight Gain**:\n\n* Use 2 skinless chicken thighs (seasoned)\n\nCalories: 528 Protein: 34g Carbs: 45g Fat: 23g\n\n## \n\n## Snack Ideas\n\nNote that these can be interchangeable; the snacks under “weight gain” just tend to have more fat (and more calories)\n\n#### Weight Loss:\n\n* Hummus & veggies\n* Cottage cheese & fruit\n* Hard Boiled eggs\n* Unsweetened yogurt & berries\n* Kale chips\n\n#### Weight Gain:\n\n* Greek yogurt & honey\n* Nuts or seeds\n* Bagel & cream cheese\n* Avocado on toast\n* Peanut butter & banana sandwich\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis guide was written for healthy individuals with no medical conditions or special dietary requirements.

    "body": "Right guys...this is going to be a lengthy post as I want to take you all through my journey from start to present. I'm a 28 year old very active and overall pretty fit male who had been suffering from ED for years. I'd avoid sexual encounters with girls and when I did have them I'd be soft. I couldn't maintain an erection, I had no spontaneous erections and no morning wood....basically my dick was dead. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced, I didn't even feel like a man and it caused me to be depressed, however I never gave up.\n\nOctober 2020 is when I decided to do something about it. After researching on Reddit and the Internet I came to the conclusion that I had PIED (Porn Induced Erectile Dysfunction) and positional ED as I only could get semi hard to porn lying down and never when I was standing up. I quit porn for 3 months as recommended and whilst it did allow for me to be 40% hard from the slightest touch or kiss due to the mind connection been broken from porn and getting hard, I still couldn't maintain a erection or get hard enough for intercourse.\n\nI tried all sorts. Viagra and Cialis couldn't even get my penis to stand up. I tried all the remedies that it says on the net. I tried Yohimbe, Arginine, Nitric, Zinc, Magnesium, Pycnogenol, Ashwagandha, Vitamin B,C and D and NONE OF IT WORKED. IT'S ALL BULLSHIT.\n\nI hopped back onto reddit and came to the conclusion that I had venous leak as it was literally posted everywhere. I was panicking and so depressed about it. It made sense though, as I couldn't get hard it was probably due to the blood leaving my penis at a rapid rate due to leaks.\n\nAnyways a few weeks passed after self diagnosing myself with Venous Leak and I decided to give it one last shot before actually going to professional to find out what the hell is wrong with me. I ordered home a blood test kit to see what my Testosterone levels were. Now normally nobody wants to see bad results from a test they've taken but on this instance I was praying that they'd be disastrous so at least I knew why this was happening to me. Few days pass and I receive my results and it shows that my T levels are within the normal range but on the really low end. After I got these results I took a blood test for a full male hormone test and once again it showed my T levels on the low end along with some other readings. I was so ecstatic as I finally had some hope that i didn't have ED due to a physical problem. \n\nI contacted my doctor who referred me to an Endocrinologist. I told him about my ED and how I've always been feeling fatigued every single day. He took some bloods and the same results were obtained. My Testosterone levels were super low. I was given a gel to use which has Testosterone in it. I applied it every morning on my stomach. First 3 weeks I felt nothing and the panic started to set in as I thought there's no saving my penis....however 4th week of using the gel and I finally got spontaneous erections, something which I've not experienced in years. I finally started to get morning wood and erections in the night. I mean like rock hard erections even when I stood up, I felt like the fucking man after this. After the 5th week I attempted to have sex with my wife and was successful. No limp penis no problems at all and ever since then it's been amazing. I've had no problems at all. \n\nSo what I'm trying to say is please don't take what you read online too seriously. Every one has a different body. Dont waste your money on bullshit pills, don't try and self diagnose yourself. Get help from a professional and they will help you so quick you wont even have time to be depressed over your situation. Also quit porn, that stuff isn't good for anyone. If anyone wants anymore info please reach out. Don't lose hope! 9/10 your ED isn't a physical problem. Get your bloods checked as well as it's not only Testosterone that's a boner killer. There's a lot more hormones that can affect it.",

If I did get one it was always at about 70 percent and my morning wood if ever present was always weak. Would avoid having sex with girls because I knew I could not maintain an erection.\n\nI went to a urologist who suggested I do a full sex blood test panel like the one described here. Everything pretty much came normal apart from prolactin which was almost 4 times higher than the upper reference range (it was 1578 umol/L). I then got referred to do a contrast MRI which simply inolves injecting a contrast dye and getting your brain scanned in an MRI machine. Following this I was found to have the growth of a clear but small prolactinoma (7mm in diameter). This is apparently a very common but benign tumour which is easily treated in most cases by dopamine agonist treatment. I think the first line treatment is Cabergoline which you take 1-2 every week. Im scheduled to have my prolactin levels measured on three separate time points next to confirm my prolactinoma is driving enhanced prolactin secretion before I am to be pescribed this medication. The main sympyoms of high prolactin in men is low sex drive and ED. If people are interested Ill let you know whether the treatment will revert my ED but until then I wanted to post this incase someones ED wasn't simply driven by low testosterone!!",

        "body": "Sharing my story because I think it will be helpful to many. For the past 1 week my little chief was refusing to act. I was not getting hard with my favorite porn also. Lost my morning wood suddenly and it seemed at one point that it will never come back. A blood test before had already revealed that my testosterone was low but still I had no problems until the last week. Even Though I was horny all the time my dick was never fully hard. I was masturbating with a semi hard dick and I was worried all the time. My job performance was also getting affected. Finally I went to see my doctor who prescribed a Vitamin D tablet once a week after dinner. I took the tablet on that night, and in the next morning I was experiencing faster heartbeat all the time, I was sweating even when I was resting. On the 2nd day i got my morning wood back suddenly, I can't describe the feeling of happiness in words. It has been 4 days since I took the Vitamin D and I am getting random boners out of nowhere now. I took a nap in the evening and woke up with an evening wood (if that's what they call it) which was not going down. Please guys try to keep a healthy lifestyle and see your doc first before taking any pills. Good Day .",

    "body": "Edit: Hi you guys!! i did not realize this post is the #1 result on google SEO when you search sulwhasoo reviews!! I have an updated post out now if you wanna check it, and my instagram is also @lonelyblep if you wanna ask questions there because Reddit i so bad at notifying me about your messages lul\n\nHello you guys I am back with another total brand guide, this time for Sulwhasoo. Many of you have requested one for Sulwhasoo ever since I did the one for Whoo. And I am happy to tell you that I know Sulwhasoo VERY WELL. As a skincare curator I always try to seek out new and innovative products for my clients to try, and Sulwhasoo is good old and reliable every time, yet they still embrace innovation. So the basics about every line, you have 5 phases of skincare: cleansing, awakening (First Care Activating Serum EX), balancing (water and emulsion for water-oil balance before any serum or special product is applied, treatment (these are where your serums and creams go, and finish (Luminature Essential Finisher, sunscreen or a sleeping mask) Their system is different, emulsion goes right after toner instead of after all serums / ampoules like other brands. The system is the same for all skincare from AmorePacific apparently. \r\n Anyways let's cut the crap and get to the guide, also l am going to do a mini review of each product\r\n\n\r\n-Essential: Introduction series to Sulwhasoo, meant for skin that is slightly aging but not too much, and for those who have water – oil balance issues. It is also meant to have a glowing effect and is good for dry, combination and normal skin.\r\n\r\n+First Care Activating Serum EX: Their bestseller. You can easily see why it is. 5 Korean herbs that make up Jaumdan, the main ingredient in this serum help to improve skin on all aspects and help to just upgrade your skin. To me it is a life changing product. Use before toners but after actives. (A special Plum Blossom version of FCAS was launched in April and has real plum blossom extract and fragrance) \r\n\n+First Care Activating Serum Mist: A mist with the active ingredients of FCAS and a layer of olive oil on top for emollience. I like this on top of makeup because it makes my skin look glowing. \n\r\n+First Care Activating Mask: When the people love something so much, it's logical that you'll have a spin off of it. This mask is soaked up to one third of a bottle of FCAS with all the good stuff and no alcohol so you use this after FCAS since FCAS has alcohol and it's an absorption boosting agent. Also if you want the goodness of FCAS in times of skin compromise (compromised skin stings from the alcohol in FCAS) this should be perfect. Gives my skin a radiant glow, softness, smoothness and clarity in one application, something your Dermal or Mediheal masks can't do in one use #whenwillyourfave\r\n\r\n+Essential Balancing Water EX: Their bestselling toner for it's cheap price and effectiveness. This toner is thicker than most toners you'll see in Western beauty. It has a light herbal scent, signature to the Essential line. It hydrates to no end, if Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion is a 10, this is a 20 \r\n\r\n+Essential Balancing Emulsion EX: Their bestselling emulsion. I feel like oily skin would love this. I don't really. Because I feel like it's only as goood as the toner at moisurizing. But oily people swear by this, lightweight moisture that does not fuck around, plus some nice antioxidants. I heard Liah Yoo raving about AmorePacific’s The Essential Crème Fluid but I actually think iff you pack on 2-3 layers of this stuff you can get the same moisture as you with the Crème Fluid, not to mention it's almost twice as cheaper.\r\n\r\n+Essential Revitalizing Serum EX: I always recommend this serum for people who are starting to see the signs of aging or do not see it yet but want to prevent it. It is a fresh, light gel texture that packs a heavy moisture punch. Oily people love it, but it would definitely be enough for dry people like me as well (of course with moisturizer on top, I am not a savage). Definitely an investment type of product if you're just stepping into the world of luxury Korean skincare. I do not believe in drugstore brands but some people just have to make do with what they have, but having this serum would definitely help their routine more efficient. \r\n\r\n+Essential Revitalizing Eye Cream EX: The smell of this product is definitely different from the other products from the Essential line. It smells faintly of white ginseng, and not the signature earthy-sweet Sulwhasoo base scent. It is more of an emulsion really and it's good for people who are starting with eye cream because this thing can't create milia due to it's extremely thin texture.\r\n\r\n+Essential Firming Cream EX: A lovely texture shifting cream that melts from a thick and smooth cream to a light emulsion, wrapping your skin in Hanbang goodness. Oily people might want to avoid this but combo skin should be fine.  It does firm up really. \r\n\r\n-Ginseng: Their signature line that started in 2000. Their Ginseng cream is so popular it practically became legendary. The line had a total revamp in 2017 (revamp was completed in 2018 with addition of the new Ginseng serum) including packaging and formulation improvements. Essential does not work on wrinkles while Ginseng works on almost every facet of aging care: Wrinkles, Elasticity, Tone, Texture, and Density. To remove any confusion and further enhance the line, Sulwhasoo launched Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Water and Emulsion.\r\n\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Water: An oil like toner that provides intensive conditioning moisyure to the skin, resulting in increased elasticity and overall health. The toner is highly moisturizng, smoothing and oily people can use this as an essence step.\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Emulsion: It smells strongly  of ginseng (a characteristic of the line) and the texture is similar to the Timetreasure emulsion (which we will get to later). It is intensely moisturizing and some say it might be a dupe to the lightweight version of the Ginseng cream. I confirm this.\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Serum: A serum with Ginsenisphere ( a patented encapsulation technology in capsules that lies within the base for maximum protection of the antioxidants and immediate release upon the skin). The updated version I heard removed Macro Ginsenisphere, the visible beads in the serum. This serum feels just like it's predecessor, a stretchy gel that does not feel oily or tacky but still leaves a smooth film on your skin. A lot of my clients reported better elasticity and smoothness. There are mixed reviews from people who have tried it's predecessor. \n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Facial Oil: A facial oil containing real ginseng seed oil blended in a mix of highly stable skin friendly oils such as Squalane, Sunflower, Jojoba, Korean Pine, Sesame and Apricot to lock in the effects of the serum and acts as a powerful moisturizing product on it's own with anti oxidative properties. This oil is used after serum before cream. The old version has meadowfoam seed oil which I LOVE but it's gone  but anyways the new one is the same so AmorePacific got lucky that I didn't try to burn their HQ. Oh and this is my HG facial oil. Ps: The oil blends sound like they have way tooo much oleic acid so as much as I am an advocate for oily skin using facial oils, oily skin should stay away.\r\n\r\n+100% Ginseng Facial Oil: An ultra rare limited edition product that consisted of pure Ginseng seed oil grown by AmorePacific themselves. I could never get it tho \r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Eye Cream EX: The renewed version has a stronger ginseng scent with a creamier consistency. This eye cream spreads like a dream and diffuses wrinkles in a month. \r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX: The star product of the brand. Smells strongly of ginseng, so you might wanna be careful with this baby. It is richly moisturizing yet being too thin in texture for my liking. It also contains mostly Ginseng extract which is a powerful antioxidant. My clients who do other beauty procedures like laser resurfacing or dermarolling swear by this. I personally think the texture is too thin but maybe that's just me, you can't even make a soft peak with this cream. I love how it actually makes my skin stronger and help calm it down whenever I use actives (which I stopped long ago)\r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX Light: A lighter version of the OG ginseng cream for those with combination to oily skin or those who dislike the scent of ginseng. Some dedicated people have went as far as using this as a day cream with the original Ginseng cream at night. This smells like fresh ginseng flowers and has a lighter, fresher texture. I would not say it's a gel cream, it does still have a tackiness to it, but it moisturizes efficiently for me and does not cause breakouts for oily people. You technically get less ginseng extract per jar for the same price but technically you still get the same one-night-after miracle. It still calms skin down and have anti oxidative properties.\r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Creamy Mask: A mask contains 8 times the power of the ginseng cream, the sheet mask is doused inside the miraculously repairing ginseng cream and double wrapped with another occlusive layer on top . The mask CAN transform your skin completely if you have dry lackluster skin, just give it 20 minutes and then you’ll be amazed. Oily skin stay a mile away from this stuff.\r\n\r\n-Hydro Aid: For younger and oiler skin, meant to be used in conjunction with the Essential line. I think they made this line since they noticed their sales plummeted during summer :v\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid Moisturizing Soothing Water: A Korea exclusive product I think. I can't say much about this.\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid Moisturizing Soothing Cream: A lightweight gel cream, it smells super nice and provides abundant hydration. But I suppose you can get something cheaper for just hydration purposes alone. But it does smell amazing though.\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid UV Protection Cream: A good physical sunscreen that provides a nice amount of moisture with minimal white cast. But overall kind of boring?\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid Moisturizing Soothing Mist: It smells amazing and hydrates like a dream. HG mist. \r\n\r\n-Snowise: Brightening line with anti aging effects that help increase collagen synthesis and brighten skin through the use of sexy ingredients like licorice and white ginseng saponins. It has a unique take on brightening, called Volume Brightening. It increases the volume / plumpness of your skin so it can reflect light better, something not any brightening product can do. The range smells like ginseng + herbs + pine forest.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Cleansing Foam: Every beauty blogger's hanbang bae. It's actually a lot of people's first love from Sulwhasoo. I mean pH 5.5, luxurious creamy foam, and a scent that is to die for. Plus it's one of Sulwhasoo's cheapest products. Of course it's an instant hit!\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Exfoliating Gel (New version: Snowise Brightening Exfoliationg Mask) : I thought I heard it wrong. An exfoliating product? From Sulwhasoo? And a physical exfoliant? “A scrub. “ I thought. I cringed at that word ever since two disasters named Lancome and St. Ives happened on my face in my pre AB years. But oh well, it is Sulwhasoo after all. The gel is stretchy and contains BETA GLUCAN *FANBOY SCREEECH* and the scrub particles are made from ground WHITE GINSENG *DOUBLE SCREECH* and walnut shell (this is the same shit is in that Equate scrub but whatever it's much more gentle in this scrub) The smell is vastly different from the rest of the line, it's a straight up white ginseng smell. The particles are so small I can't even feel like it's doing anything on my skin, but actually my skin became TRANSLUCENT every time I use this. I swear that this is the only physical scrub I will ever put on my skin. [This review is for the old product,  I have yet to try the new one] \n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Water: A fresh and light toner with brightening extracts. This is WAY too light for me, I do not feel like it is giving me moisture that actually lasts. But other other hand it actually really helped with my pores. I consider this like the holy water for large pores.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Serum: The bestseller of the line and the entire brand. This serum skips all that proven actives and just goes for the extracts, in true Sulwhasoo spirit. I was a bit skeptical at first but I FINALLY SAW THE LIGHT. It gave me a bright complexion that is so plump, moisturized and transparent no other brightening serum can give me. \r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Mask: I use this mask twice weekly on top of the serum to seal it in and fuse with my skin. My skin is noticeably brighter after just one box. And mind you, the effect is NOT temporary. I can tell because my friends ask me what BB Cream / Cushion I'm using but I said it's just my bare skin. THEY WERE SHOOOK. \n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Spot Treatment: This concentrated gel to water correcting spot treatment penetrates deeply and suppresses melanin. Although the claims weren't supported by any study whatsoever, I can see that my dark spots around my cheeks have disappeared, and my bigger spot faded slightly so I can see there's a definite change. I admit that I love bright, fair skin (not related to Asian standards at all, just preference) but I hate the spots and imperfections that go with it tbh I’d rather have darker skin with less imperfections than spending MY YOUTH to treat these little shits.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Emulsion: A hydrating emulsion infused with brightening extracts that make for a lovely day moisturizer if you have oily skin. It smells amazing and for some, it really helps with water – oil imbalance. What I have noticed about emulsions is that they give your skin an instant surge of moisture and sink into your skin instantly but your skin's moisture levels plummet down to zero in about an hour. And you need a thicker cream to lock it in and hold that down for a timed release through out the day. And for dry skinned people, a cream alone is not enough since the emulsion 6orms a slippery layer on the skin, making the cream apply better and you can use less while still having a nice layer of it on your face. You might think that's counter intuitive but emulsion are far cheaper and you get much more for the price you pay. And the cream itself is thicker and with higher oil content while the emulsion is higher in water so you'll get a nicer balance of both elements.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Eye Serum: A lightweight eye serum meant to correct dark circles and puffiness with the included Zamak applicator. My clients love this because it really helps with their dark circles and it's the perfect choice for those who gave up on eye creams altogether because it the milia it causes.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Cream: A beautifully textured cream that is thick yet melts down into a milky texture and sinking into your skin, anchoring down everything you've put on your skin before. It gives your skin instant hydration but also provides some lipids as well.  I might say it's not enough for a night cream but for a day cream it is amazing. I can definitely see some plumpness even when used alone (with products from other brands, come on I can't use this product ONLY and expect a miracle, skincare is supposed to be a system)\r\n+Snowise Brightening UV Protector: A color correcting hybrid sunscreen with two shades (#1 Soft Glow for darker skin tones, #2 Soft Peach for skin that is pale but not bright or radiant) This sunscreen's texture is soft and creamy, smells like a dream and applies like a dream. They have turned the weakness of any physical filter into a strength. This sunscreen gives a subtle tone up effect that does not alsst long but should last long enough until you reapply again (2 hours)\r\n\r\n-Bloomstay: Launched in April to replace Innerise,  the line consists of a water,  serum and cream to provide a healthy dose of essential nutrients and antioxidants for skin to transition from late 20s to early 30s. \n\n+Bloomstay Vitalizing Water: *Cardi B voice* OKURRRR ZAMN they got the scent right!!!!  Ugh to die for!  This water is made from 5 types of germinated fruits and seed extracts, hardy orange, plum blossom extracts and the Jaumdan complex. It hydrates my skin very well. Reminds me of the Huxley Essence: Grab Water but much more fragrant. \n\n+Bloomstay Vitalizing Serum: Super smooth and soft, it has the same extracts as the water albeit more condensed + Niacinamide for brightening and soothing benefits. My skin feels amazingly calm and translucent after using this. Ugh.  Ugggghhhhh. \n\n+Bloomstay Vitalizing Cream: A thick smooth cream that makes people with dry skin HOWL. I am gagged by how much I love it. Spreads like butter and moisturizes deeply through the night. I can't comment on it's effects on fine lines because I don't have any.  (I use Sulwhasoo for as long as I can remember so duh) \r\n\r\n-Everefine: Previously the Goa line (until Sulwhasoo decided black was too goth for their brand). Meant for women in menopause experience hormonal shifts. The Goa line used to consist of an ampoule, an eye cream, a facial cream and a neck cream. The new Everefine line only has 2 products which are the ampoule and the cream. The neck cream has moved to the basic line, a line of optional add on products which can be used along with every line. You are expected to use the eye cream of the Ginseng line to accompany Everefine products from now on. \r\n.+Everefine Lifting Ampoule Serum: Quite a confusing name there. Basically the power of a serum on steroids (ampoules) with the absorption speed of a regular gel serum. It does not sound too much of a gel to me with Murumuru butter being the 4th ingredient. That and a lot of silicones and jojoba esters (yes in love with that shit), so I feel like this will be a very thick and richly moisturizing serum. It also contains coumestrol (a proven an Maseondan complex which is made of replenishing ingredients such as Gingko Biloba, Soy leaf extract, Shiitake mushroom extract, Adenosine (Proven anti aging ingredient) and of course, their signature Jaumdan mixture decocted in Honey. There is Jaumdan at the heart of every Sulwhasoo product. Maybe that’s why these products and the FCAS work together so well since they work in synergy. \r\n\r\n+Everefine Lifting Cream: This is a cream that is EVEN MORE emollient than the serum (ok I am a whore for emollient things so hmu please), it has the same Maseondan and Jaumdan complexes but now with cocoa extract + two super nourishing oils, Squalane and Meadowfoam seed oil. I'm seriously gonna try this because why the heck not.\r\n\r\n-Men: Range for men. Smells like pine. Manly.\r\n\r\n+Refreshing Cleansing Foam: A thick cleansing foam that can be used two ways. One you lather it up into a poof and wash your face. Two rub directly on a wet face as a scrub. Nothing impressive about the ingredients, it contains ginseng powder as the last ingredient and walnut shell powder as an exfoliant. I use this in the shower or on trips. It does remove makeup nicely when my oil cleanser isn’t around.\r\n\r\n+Inner Charging Serum: Ok you can't put a toner in a fancy bottle and call it a serum. That's cheating! Used this, smells nice and is basically Essential Balancing Water EX with a nice manly scent. It's not way too manly like cheap aftershave. It's very subtle and sophisticated. Speaking of aftershaves, this could be used as one.\r\n\r\n+Skin Reinforcing Emulsion: My favorite product of the range. Quick, no frills moisture on the go, a must have in my bag. Really good makeup primer. HG.\r\n\r\n+Age Defying Cream: Good for men who don't know what they want and want a bit of everything. This is for age prevention.\r\n\r\n+Relaxing UV Protector: A sunscreen FOR MEN and IN BLACK. Smells MANLY like MAN STUFF. Nice sunscreen, no frills, physical so u can apply and go and not wait 30 mins because MEN DON'T WAIT, WE ARE IMPATIENT.\r\n\r\n-Timetreasure: Their priciest complete anti aging line, might I even say, age reversal. Previously called Extra Refining, the line revolves around the power of the Red Pine, a type of pine so rare it is one of the most endangered species. AmorePacific cultivates it their own since harvesting wild red pine would be illegal. It would cost you $80 for just a bottle of red pine oil, but wait, don't Timetreasure products cost way more than that? You're right, but that’s because Timetreasure uses red pine extract, not oil, therefore it contains more of the actual essence of the tree bark. And you're paying for the fact that they know how to mix certain ingredients together so that it would work even better. Also did I mention red pine bark extract is the 1st ingredient in every Timetreasure product? (Not including the cleansing foam) I can not stress enough as a person with super dry skin even instagram  humid weather that this line is my HG (especially when used with Harmonizen) and with concerns for aging skin (people say I'm better off with Innerise but no hoe I know what I'm doing). Also to clear any misunderstanding, Timetreasure is more expensive than Ginseng (with both being anti aging lines) because Timetreasure also works on brightness more and prevents sagging, age spots, and smoothes out wrinkles in the long run (unlike some cheap collagen cream that seem to work instantly), something Ginseng couldn't do. I tested this on my self + my mom + my grandma and yes we all love it. \r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Extra Creamy Cleansing Foam: A newly launched product, and let me set the record straight, this is my mother of all HG cleansing foams. A thick cream that lathers up into clouds of extra creamy foam that cleanses even foundation effectively with no oil cleanser (just not eye makeup), it smells dreamy (different from the other products in the range, which are still dreamy btw) and my skin feels more MOISTURIZED than before using it, sometimes I leave the foam on my face as a mask. Since most cleansers only go as far as not stripping my skin, but this one actually ADDED MOISTURE to my skin while removing all of the nasties. One pea sized drop makes enough foam for 4, sleepover tested. This thing feels like I am washing my face with a moisturizer. If you want a taste of the Timetreasure line without paying the price, try this.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Water EX: This toner is probably the best toner from Sulwhasoo, it's a liquid toner with a slightly tacky finish that gives your skin an amazing glow and intense moisture and when used with the emulsion provides an amazing complexion not even a Siberian winter could ruin.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Emulsion EX: The unskippable product responsible for most of the moisture of this line. I use two pumps every day and night and the deep, warm scent of red pine just embraces my skin and lulls me to sleep, something I do not appreciate in the morning lol. This emulsion is super fast-spreading and is the same texture as the Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX. When used with the water my skin is super soft, glowy and smooth and ready for the next treatment step. Tbh if I ever go home at 3AM and feel not even human, I just double cleanse, use the water and this. And I wake up to dewy skin, albeit at 11AM.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Serum EX: Containing the highest amount of red pine extract in the entire Timetreasure range, this serum is thick and creamy and smells lovely, one pump is enough for your face and neck. I am too young to see any wrinkle improvement but I can say that it gives my skin that extra 5 hours of sleep and I don't wake up with pillow marks on my face any more. It's amazing and it's such a rescue for dry skin. My mom actually saw some brightening and wrinkle reduction, her smile lines have softened, her forehead lines are gone (mine can never be because I tend to move my forehead a lot, she doesn't), and she has glowy skin even though she sleeps 4 hours a day. After a month, I'd say she looks at least 5 years younger. As for my grandma, her skin improved as well. She has super dry skin and the Timetreasure range is exactly what she needed. Her skin became firmer, her sagging was minimized and the skin looked brighter.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Eye Serum: This was launched along with the Timetreasure cleansing foam, a new eye product for better anti aging effect around the eye contour, the serum is meant for dark circles and loss of elasticity, it also provides some lifting as well and gives a “wide awake” effect, while the eye cream is meant for moisture, wrinkle correction and to increase the effectiveness of the eye serum. This comes with a golden eye care massager and with an instruction video to use both the eye serum and cream. The serum is thinner in texture compared to the Timetreasure facial serum. It sinks in quickly and when used with the accompanying massager and following all the steps, my eyes do look lifted and awake. My mom refused to use this as she thinks it's too much work though, my grandma enjoyed it though.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Eye Cream: I have noticed that this eye cream might come off as thick, but it's actually some sort of patented manufacturing process that makes this cream fluffy, not thick. Thick is like O Hui The First's eye cream, this one is actually just really fluffy, that’s why it melts down into an oil around your eyes which feels reallllly good. This when used alone provides firmness to my eyes. But when used with the serum, it's a life changing experience. My eyes have never looked this good. I could hold a baby next to my face and actually see no difference between our eyes. I truly love this product and the eye serums. My HG.\r\n\r\n+Sulwhasoo Timetreasure Renovating Cream: This cream has the most intense red pine scent of all the Timetreasure products. This is a thick rich cream that has a slightly brownish-red tint and actually DOES NOT go on smooth. It is tacky as hell. Do not even dream of using this without an emulsion. But when you use it, oh boy, it just locks everything in and gives such long lasting moisture without clogging pores (But common sense is required, this range is not for oily people!) It works even better with the serum, it made my skin so plump and radiant. And everytime my S.O kisses my cheek he always say that I smell like herbs, which is a good thing (I hope lol). The entire range as whole has changed my skin, I can't say the same for any skincare range (the two exceptions are Whoo's Hwanyu and Guerlain's Orchidee Guerlain, they are exceptional in their own way, and probably the skin I have today is the result of rotating between really expensive skincare and not sticking to just one brand.)\r\n\r\n-Harmonizen: If you think Timetreasure is pretty intense, this is not the end of it. Harmonizen is the mother of all Sulwhasoo intense-ness. And when I say my skin has an obnoxiously expensive taste for skincare, boy do I mean it. This line has one product and one product only, the holy Harmonizen Regenerating Cream EX. The cream is loaded with beneficial ingredients that I challenge you to read without gasping for air, and is meant to be used with the Timetreasure line in place of the Timetreasure Renovating Cream EX for ultimate anti aging. Some use it as a night cream due to the price (650,000 won, broooo, bro. Bro.) and texture. Also if it makes you feel any better paying an extortionate price for a 60ml jar of facial cream, some also use it in place of eye cream and serum \r\n\r\n+Harmonizen Regenerating Cream EX: Sulwhasoo's most expensive item out of all of their offerings. Formulated with Dermosul™ technology, and loaded with powerful extracts such as salvia miltiorrhiza (danshen) which is actually clinically proven to have an anti wrinkle effect, ginseng extract, red and white ginseng saponin, murumuru and shea butter, angelica actiloba, mugwort, cnidium officinale, two types of licorice extract (glycyrrhiza uralensis and glycyrrhiza glabra for brightening), broussonetia kazinoki and oldenlandia diffusa for extra brightening (please see http://www.google.com/patents/US8647683 for a patent of a whitening ingredient composed of these ingredients), powerful humectants such as Sodium PCA, natural moisturizing factors (NMFs): ( Squalane , Beta Glucan, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Glucosamine, Cholesterol),  green tea leaf extract, meadowfoam oil, quinoa seed extract, vitamin E (tocopherol, tocopheryl linoleate), red pine extract (hello there Timetreasure), allantoin (for soothing benefits), fatty acids (arachidic acid, behenic acid), amino acids  (serine, alanine, glutamic acid), vitamin CG (ascorbyl glucoside), arginine, and finally the legendary Jaumdan decocted in honey. Wow. That was a mouthful. Anyways, the cream smells like herbs and stuff, very Sulwhasoo-y, but it is very faint and will disappear the moment you put it on your skin. But according to the website, the scent is composed of “Mugwort, pine, clove, Frankincense, white sandal wood, Agastache rugosa” or whatever the hell that is. It is SUPER SUPER SUPER thick, about the thickest cream I have ever witnessed in my life and goes on super smooth, it melts into your skin and then you'll have this sort of waxy finish for the first 5 minutes then it shifts into a smooth, silky finish. You are meant to use the accompanying obsidian spatula as an applicator / massage tool.  After two jars, I can conclude that this is indeed my HG cream out of all creams. My mom and grandma loved it as well. My skin was glowing and radiant, I think it actually made my skin one tone whiter, not brighter and my biggest dark spots shrank into tiny ones that you can't see without closing up on my face like a maniac, and it kind of makes my skin feel like when I was using the Whoo Hwanyu Ampoule (which is way more expensive than this tho) so maybe I can save some moolah after all :> My mom said her skin was so much brighter and her wrinkles have faded (not all of course). And she loves the fact that she can skip serum and eye cream with this product because she is a lazy bean :v My grandma said she thinks that it makes her face more vibrant and more rosy, which none of the products she tried done for her. I think this is definitely worth the money )) if it’s good, it’s worth it, it's not expensive, just high priced :v If you pay a shit ton for something with poor ingredients and does not work, then you can call it expensive.\r\n\r\n-Essentrue: Signature body care line from Sulwhasoo. It has a anti aging and moisturizing effect with honey and schizophyllum commune, pine nut oil, lotus fruit oil, prunus mume oil, apricot kernel oil and camellia oil\r\n\r\n+Essentrue Silky Body Serum: This lives true to it's name, it goes on so fresh and silky smooth and leves my body glowing as if I used a body oil, but this is not half as heavy. \r\n\r\n+Essentrue Deep Nourishing Body Cream EX: A lovely product to layer on top of the body serum in colder months. This feels so nice and luxurious and I can feel it wrapping my body in pure goodness. My mom said it also helps with her flabby arms.\r\n\r\n+Essentrue Hand Cream: It exists but almost nobody knows about it. And I can't get my hands on it no matter where I inquire. Must be discontinued.\r\n\r\n-Basic and Special: A line of miscellaneous products to accompany your regimen\r\n\r\n+Gentle Cleansing Oil EX: God damn do I love this oil, it deletes 9 layers of makeup in one go and moisturizes to no end. I recommend this to people who have blackheads as well and they find that it makes extractions easier and it helps minimize pores. I sometimes do musical plays so I tend to wear a lot of makeup, face painting and what not. And this removes everything :o I love it! And it smells amazing!\r\n\r\n+Gentle Cleansing Foam EX: A gentle cleansing foam that does not strip skin while effectively cleansing. I use this in the shower, mostly to get rid of the excess conditioner lying around on my skin. It smells good. pH 6.5-7\r\n\n+Gentle Cleansing Water: Gentle,  smells good. I wouldn't pay this much though?\n\r\n+Herbal Soap: My HG during breakouts. This smells strongly of ginseng (me likey) and foams like a dream. My breakouts cleared overnight. Bigger breakouts? 3 days. Remember to moisturize though as this is really drying, like really, but is it worth it? Hell yes. \r\n\r\n+Benecircle Massage Cream EX: This upgraded twice a week massage cream has a cream to oil formula plus the scent of plum blossom instead of the old signature Sulwhasoo base scent. I like the older one tho as it gives more control, while this is too slippery and makes massaging a bit harder. I also prefer the old scent. But I have to admit it moisturizes better than the old massage cream. Both give me a rosy glow due to increased circulation. I actually use this everyday. The oil emulsifies beautifully so if the pump bottle of the oil is too hard for travelling for you then try this since it's in a convenient tube and it removes makeup nicely, not as well as the oil but it wasn't designed for that anyway. If you have dry skin then use after FCAS and wipe excess off with tissue. If you have any other skin type other than dry, rinse after using and then apply FCAS.\r\n\r\n+Clarifying Mask EX: A twice a week peel off mask used after the emulsion step to help it absorb better and brightening + exfoliating. This smells so good and texture is honey like yess. My skin is so smooth and soft after using this. The only peel off mask I like. But the only con is that it takes 9 lives to dry a.k.a 30 minutes. \r\n\r\n+Overnight Vitalizing Mask EX: A thick, rich creamy sleeping mask that compliments your Sulwhasoo moisturizer perfectly without suffocating skin, it can be used as a night cream for oiler skin types. I love the smell and it feels like my skin is reborn every time I use it. \r\n\r\n+Radiance Energy Mask: Containing real white jade, this sleeping mask purifies skin for a brighter tone. AND BOY, SHE THICK. SHE THICK. Wow. Like this is so nice for dry skin and I feel like I am so blessed with this baby :o\r\n\r\n+Herblinic Intensive Infusion Ampoules: This baby is so good at calming down breakouts. A surefire anti acne combo is Herblinic + Herbal Soap + FCAS.. Use this after water and before emulsion. An anti aging ampoule that helps with acne? WOW. I AM SHOCKED. The miraculous anti acne effect isn't even advertised so I guess it's a beneficial side effect lol. My skin is way softer and smoother btw.\r\n\r\n+Microdeep Intensive Filling Cream and Patch: My mom uses this and I could visibly see her smile lines soften and it lasts! Just do your regular skincare after you do this treatment and the lines shouldn't come back. Sure it's not Botox but I mean it's something lol\r\n\r\n+Luminature Essential Finisher EX: This is created with Locsamhyo, a complex of ginseng and green tea for superior anti oxidative properties and is meant to be a long term preventive measure to prevent free radicals in an urban environment. This goes on as the last step of skincare (before sunscreen in the AM and before sleeping mask in the PM) to lock in the effects of your skincare and give your skin an antioxidant boost. I feel like my skin is fresher and brighter vs. just using skincare alone, and it helps my cushion / BB cream stay brighter for longer. Over years of using this product, I’d say that the benefit it give me (smaller pores, smoother skin, rosy glow) are far beyond what I paid for.\r\n\r\n+Firming Neck Cream: Originally from the Goa line, this neck cream promises to firm up neck skin and increase elasticity. My mom is using this but she is not getting much results  what a bummer. It smells nice though.\r\n\r\n+Renodigm Dual Care Cream EX: Pronounced “ren-no- dime”, it's a sunscreen / day cream if you're lazy. It not only contains SPF but also TPF to protect your skin from UV rays and heat, the causes for hyperpigmentation. It smells lovely and it's my HG sunscreen because it is so nice and so rich in moisture. It is a ridiculous price to pay for sunscreen though. Fun fact I used to call this “ren-no-dig-um”. Also did yall know AmorePacific own the patent to the TPF measurement? Shook.\r\n\r\n+Trufresh Soothing Mask: Meant to be used with Renodigm Dual Care Cream EX at night as part of thei heat protection solutions. You can use this as a rinse off mask (before FCAS) or a sleeping mask / night cream if u got oily skin. I smell Laneige Water Sleeping Mask vibes.\r\n\r\n+Essential Balm: Multi purpose moisturizing balm for eyes, lips and cuticles. Smells nice and keeps my lips soft. Some people put it on insect bites and split ends apparently. \r\n\r\n+Camellia hair oil: Smells lovely and tames frizz. Would not pay this much for a hair product if it ain't Goldwell though.\r\n\r\n-Hollistic Care: A series of products that embodies the Sulwhasoo spirit of tranquility. \r\n\r\n+First Peace: This home fragrance collection is inspired from the First Peace Essential Oil used in Sulwhasoo SPA. It has a candle, a potpourri, a fragrance sachet in the lineup and can only be bought in the Flagship store of Sulwhasoo. Therefore I will not mention this in the Flagship store section again. The candle can be bought outside the Flagship Store with another design though. \r\n\r\n+Plum Blossom: Just like the First Peace collection, but it also features a perfume oil for use on the body. None of the products from this collection can be bought outside of the Flagship Store. There is also a hand cream duo set that has the Plum Blossom and First Peace hand cream attached so you can't buy them separately. They make my hand so soft but I like First Peace more tbh.\r\n\r\n+Invigorating Ginseng  Extract Ampoule: A 4-week supply of supplement ampoules with ginseng extract. I haven't tried this as I feel like they might benefit old people more. I'm going to get my dad a box of this for Lunar New Year.\r\n\r\n+Lantern Collection: A golden-glazed version of their bestsellers: Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX, Essential Balancing Water EX, Essential Balancing Emulsion EX, First Care Activating Serum, Perfecting Cushion Intense. Perfect for any die hard Sulwhasoo fan and collectors as well. Having this full lantern collection is just about as much of a feat as owning every Shineclassic compact from every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Lunar Zodiac Sign Collection: First Care Activating Serum EX in 12 designs featuring the lunar zodiac sign of your choice. All 12 zodiac signs can be bought at the Flagship Store at any time of day and any year , however the representative zodiac sign for the current year will be sold everywhere worldwide, not limited to the flagship store. (For example Sulwhasoo's FCAS has a dog on it this year and sold worldwide, but the other 11 zodiac signs are only sold in the Flagship Store)\r\n\r\n+Herbal Tea: Teaming up with Osulloc (Korea's #1 premium tea brand also from AmorePacific), Sulwhasoo releases 4 kinds of herbal teas to complete the holistic beauty experience. The range has Red Ginseng Blended Tea, Samdayeon Jeju Tangerine Tea (my fave), Sejak Green Tea, Plum Blossom Herb Tea. These tea actually taste really good and I asked my friend to get me like 5 boxes of Samdayeon Jeju Tangerine Tea lol I am addicted. Good for sipping when drama and conflicts happen. Sip sip bitch.\r\n\r\n+Herbal Soap: They also launched a new Herbal Soap collection with 4 facial soaps: Pine (for stressed, acne prone skin), oldenlandia diffusa (for brightening), licorice (for abundant moisture), red ginseng (original formula for skin lacking vitality and polluted with toxic substances)\r\n\r\n+Balm Series: Contains the Essential Balm with redesigned packaging and two other balms. Deep Relax Balm (Haven't tried this yet, supposed to be the Essential Balm but with a more relaxing scent), and Lip Tint Balm (lovely color that adds a rosy touch while not being too obvious about it)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is it for my post, 40k char max",

    "body": "My hobby over the last year of has been researching pre workout ingredients, why they are used, dosing and interactions.\n\nI’ve done it for my own personal being it and curiosity to make the “perfect” pre workout formula for my self.\n\nI've gauged interest from some other subreddits but talking about supplements over there is frowned upon... regardless I got some interest so I went ahead and did an initial write up on l-citruline.\n\nEverything you need to know about L-Citruline\n\nIf you are reading this blog then you, like me are probably obsessed with trying to eke out that little extra in the gym by abusing various pre workouts. I am going to be covering a popular but often chronically under dosed, overly mixed pre workout ingredient, L-citrulline. To see if it's worth picking up or leaving by the wayside.\n\nThis blog post will be a results focused analysis of L-citrulline with little to no focus on the bio chemical mechanisms of how it works, if a deeper dive into its mechanisms is wanted then I'll make one later down the line.\n\nWithout further ado, let's get into it.\n\n**What is it:**\n\nL-citrulline is an non-essential amino acid, meaning it can be made from other amino acids present in the body. But unlike some amino acids, L-citrulline is not used to make protein, it is instead has a role in protein homeostasis[\\[1\\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00726-015-1932-2) and as an intermediary in the urea cycle, the process in which our bodies handle ammonia.\n\n**What does it do:**\n\nl-citrulline increases NO biosynthesis indirectly by increasing l-arginine synthesis, which in turn leads to improved blood vessel vasodilator function, aka increased pumps. [\\[2\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073798/#B12-nutrients-10-00921)[\\[3\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073798/#B24-nutrients-10-00921)[\\[4\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073798/#B44-nutrients-10-00921) l-citrulline is not processed in the liver, unlike other amino acids like BCAA's which are poorly metabolised [\\[5\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2857013/), but synthesised in the intestine and kidneys preventing hepatic uptake of precursor amino acids (arginine, glutamine) activating the urea cycle preventing amino acid catabolisation. The preserving nature of l-citrulline in this cycle has a down stream effect in protein synthesis, content and functionality. [\\[6\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4309748/)\n\n**Practical application:**\n\nWhat it does is all well and good, but what about practical application and real word efficacy.\n\n**Reduced blood pressure and cardio vascular health**[\\[2\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073798/#B12-nutrients-10-00921) [\\[7\\]](https://academic.oup.com/ajh/article/23/1/12/149449) \\[[11\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21154265) \\[[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26863234)\\]\n\nblood pressure reduction from 4-15% after 8 weeks of supplementation at a very low dose. Though L-citrulline should not be used as a replacement for medication, if you are looking for something to help manage your blood pressure then L-citrulline may add benefit here. I did not track my blood pressure during my time using only L-citrulline.\n\n**Muscle Pumps** [\\[2\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073798/#B12-nutrients-10-00921)[\\[3\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073798/#B24-nutrients-10-00921)[\\[4\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073798/#B44-nutrients-10-00921)[\\[5\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28940638)\n\n📷📷\n\nIncreased muscle blood flow induced by L-citrulline has been shown to be as high as 11% in one study at 6g per day. I couldn't find studies measuring intramuscular vassal dilation at higher does of L-citrulline unfortunately. However anecdotally when supplementing with 10g of pure L-citrulline not the malate mix over a period of 8 weeks I measured a consistent visual pump that was greater than when experimenting with 6g as touted in the study.\n\n**Gym Performance** [\\[8\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20386132/)\n\nthe cited study showed a 52.92% increase in total work done with pectoral loading with 8g of L-citrulline malate, the mix ratio was not specified, though the most common is 1:2 giving roughly 5-6g of L-citrulline per serving. Though anecdotally I can give credence to the muscular endurance properties of L-citrulline, because this was mixed with malic acid that can help with lactic acid build up, the 53% increase in work load may be a byproduct of this mix.\n\n**Better erections** [\\[9\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21195829/)\n\nsupplementing at 1.5g for 1 month men with mild erectile disfunction reported hardened erections while supplementation occurred. Like with the blood pressure L-citrulline should not be used as a replacement for any medication being used with ED, however it may be useful as a potential adjunct. Anecdotally I don't have an issue here so didn't notice anything above and beyond what is normal, if you're looking for a replacement for viagra, you wont find it here.\n\n**Protein synthesis** [\\[6\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4309748/)[\\[12\\]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcsm.12435)\n\nsupplementing from 10-22g of L-citrulline directly relating to the participants body mass showed a significant increase in protein synthesis which is a potential reason why an increase in lean mass in trainees has been observed in other studies.\n\n**Muslce recovery** [\\[10\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33308806/)\n\nPost resistance training participants reported greater reduction in muscular soreness 24-48 after. So if you are fairly new to the gym or changing up your routine and getting DOMS then L-citrulline may help.\n\n**Lean mass** [\\[11\\]](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-018-0235-x)\n\n📷📷\n\nLean mass was shown to increase over a period if 8 weeks in a group supplementing with 2.5g of L-citrulline in comparison to those who supplemented with L-citrulline malate at 2.5g or the placebo. An average of 2.4lb lean massed gained was observed over the 8 weeks which is pretty significant. Anecdotally I used L-citrulline during a body recomp training block and though made changes to my physique I cannot purely attribute this to L-citrulline.\n\n**Dosing:**\n\nClinical dosing of L-citrulline has ranged from as low as 0.5g to as high as 22g, making it fairly hard to directly pin point the dose at which we start to get diminishing returns or no increase benefit at all. Some studies suggest scaling L-citrulline intake to lean body mass as you would do with measuring protein intake. Anecdotally I found most success at 10g at 110kg of body weight at a roughly 11% ratio, though some may find more or less is beneficial.\n\n**When to take**\n\nNo studies that I can find suggest an optimal time to ingest L-citrulline in a pre workout context, though inferring from popular opinion anywhere between 30-60 mins pre workout seems fine. Anecdotally 10g 30 mins pre workout has worked well for me.\n\n**Side effects**\n\nL-citrulline has been shown to have no negative side effects with doses as high as 15g and past that there hasn't been any effort to ascertain what, if any, side effects present themselves.\n\n**The bottom line**\n\nL-citrulline is fairly expensive as a supplement so I suggest going for a milder dose initially and slowly titrate the dose until you find what works for you.\n\nPersonally I would highly recommend L-citrulline if you have some cash to spare and want to get the most out of your training.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease leave any questions have below and ill be sure to answer them.\n\nTake care.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSocials:\n\ntwitter - [https://twitter.com/neekbod](https://twitter.com/neekbod)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWebsite - [https://neekbodtogreekgod.wixsite.com/supplement-review](https://neekbodtogreekgod.wixsite.com/supplement-review)",

In the wake of the pandemic, that is a noteworthy detail.\n\n>Ebright, along with many other scientists, has been a vocal opponent of gain-of-function research because of the risk it presents of creating a pandemic through accidental release from a lab.\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/dr-fauci-backed-controversial-wuhan-lab-millions-us-dollars-risky-coronavirus-research-1500741 - https://archive.is/UUkl9\n\n**Scientist Richard Ebright**\n\n>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction. And here is a proposal from the beginning of 2018 [from USAID/DARPA/CIA/Fauci/Gates-funded EcoHealth Alliance] proposing explicitly to engineer that sequence at that position in chimeric lab- generated coronaviruses.\n\n- Richard Ebright, an eminent molecular biologist at Rutgers University, https://archive.is/cCBUw\n\n**Eminent Virologist David Baltimore of CalTech**\n\n>When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine [humanized] codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.\n\n- David Baltimore, an eminent virologist and former president of CalTech, https://archive.is/yalCe\n\n\n**Former CDC Director Robert Redfield:**\n\n>I was concerned because of the presence of the furin cleavage site that we've talked about and I think it's important to understand what that cleavage site does. That cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of COVID, so where before it could not see the ACE2 receptor which is the human receptor, it totally changes the orientation now so it has high affinity for human receptors. So that furin cleavage site bothered me, it didn't seem like it belonged there. \n\n>And then if you look at the sequences they use in those 12 nucleotides for arginine, where the arginine sequence nucleotide triplet were coded for humans. So why did it have the arginine coding for humans and not bat? It was very disconcerting to me. It looked like this virus was engineered.\n\n\n>It's not scientifically plausible that this virus went from a bat to humans and became one of the most infectious viruses that we have for humans. \n\n\n\n**Scientist Valentin Bruttel:**\n\n>I tried to raise awareness to this for a year now.\nWIV use BsaI and BsmBI/Esp3I sites before to make synthetic WIV1 variants.\nAnd exactly those sites appear in a \"silently introduced, perfect for synthetic assembly\" pattern in SARS2, but non of its nat. relatives.\n\n>seriously, what is the chance that exactly those type IIs restriction appear or disappear through random evolution in a Banal-20-52 like virus?\n5-6 precise mutations in 30000bp?\nabout 1 in 10^20!\nSARS2 is clearly synthetic!\n\n**Type Ils restriction sites prove a synthetic origin**\n\nSynthetic RNA viruses are assembled at the DNA level and later transcribed. 30,000 nucleotides cannot be synthesized in one go. These viruses are therefore assembled from smaller, 2- 8,000 nucleotide long pieces. Specific DNA restriction sites are often added to later reassemble the individual building blocks in the correct order. It is also technically possible to hide these interfaces (No See'em), but this was not done in the WIV.\n\nIn a 2017 paper, two very specific, particularly suitable type Ils restriction enzymes were used at the WIV. These have the advantage that they can produce different DNA overhangs (sticky ends), which are crucial for a correct assembly of the complete genome: Bsal and BsmBI.\n\nSARS2 shows a Bsal and BsmBI restriction site pattern which is ideal for assembling synthetic viruses and to later replace the spike protein or furin cleavage site.\n\nBsal and BsmBI restriction sites also exist in closely related viruses (Banal20-52, RaTG13), but these are distributed in such a way that an artificial virus could never be generated using the methods established at WIV 2018/19. \n\n**The probability that the required 5 synonymous mutations, which enable a synthetic assembly of SARS2, arose purely by chance is less than 1 in 10^20 or about as likely as winning the lottery jackpot 3 times in a row.**\n\nDr. Valentin Bruttel\n\nhttps://twitter.com/VBruttel/status/1566365635680124929?t=koDQ9poynY6I9qSchgQAnw&s=19",

    "body": "I try to guide my decisions on science (you know the stickers, \"science is real\").\n\nVindicta is gone, IDK how ppl here feel about long and boring research, but I still like to share my findings - so why not here? If it bother anyone, let me know and I'll post somewhere else.\n\nHere's why I eat gelatin, and why you may want to do the same.\n\n# Evidence\n\nFor maximum skin health, collagen helps, as proved in one of the gold standard of science, systematic reviews: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30681787/\n\n> Findings: Eleven studies with a total of 805 patients were included for review. Eight studies used collagen hydrolysate, 2.5g/d to 10g/d, for 8 to 24 weeks, for the treatment of pressure ulcers, xerosis, skin aging, and cellulite. Two studies used collagen tripeptide, 3g/d for 4 to 12 weeks, with notable improvement in skin elasticity and hydration. Lastly, one study using collagen dipeptide suggested anti-aging efficacy is proportionate to collagen dipeptide content. Conclusions and Relevance: Preliminary results are promising for the short and long-term use of oral collagen supplements for wound healing and skin aging. Oral collagen supplements also increase skin elasticity, hydration, and dermal collagen density. Collagen supplementation is generally safe with no reported adverse events. Further studies are needed to elucidate medical use in skin barrier diseases such as atopic dermatitis and to determine optimal dosing regimens\n\nOnly a meta analysis could be of higher degree of proof.\n\nIt's not just collagen, some other things might help, as this is also found in \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6835901/ where added things like Vitamin C and E, Zinc and Biotin:\n\n> The test product significantly improved skin hydration, elasticity, roughness, and density. The differences between the verum group and the placebo group were statistically significant for all test parameters. These positive effects were substantially retained during the follow-up. The measured effects were fully consistent with the subjective assessments of the study participants.\n\nIDK about you, but I take these supplements anyway. However, most people don't consider collagen or even gelatin, so this post is about it.\n\nGelatin is the same amino acids as in collagen, cf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin\n\n>    The amino acid content of hydrolyzed collagen is the same as collagen. Hydrolyzed collagen contains 19 amino acids, predominantly glycine (Gly) 26-34%, proline (Pro) 10-18%, and hydroxyproline (Hyp) 7-15%, which together represent around 50% of the total amino acid content.[11] Glycine is responsible for close packing of the chains. Presence of proline restricts the conformation. This is important for gelation properties of gelatin.[12] Other amino acids that contribute highly include: alanine (Ala) 8-11%; arginine (Arg) 8-9%; aspartic acid (Asp) 6-7%; and glutamic acid (Glu) 10-12%.[11]\n\n# But why gelatin? Why not collagen gummies?\n\nFirst, it absorbs better. It's been studied and proved not just to increase blood levels, but to be included in the skin 2x as much as the separate amino acids: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5183725/\n\n> Mouse studies that used 14C-labeled gelatin hydrolysate (33) further demonstrated that, although tracer from proline could be incorporated into skin collagen at the same rate as tracer from gelatin, tracer from the gelatin was incorporated into the collagen of cartilage and muscle twice as much as tracer from proline \n\nSecond, it's cheaper - way cheaper, and safer that supplements: you can have it twice a day if you don't do OMAD, in larger amounts, and not just glycine or proline, but 4 amino acids:\n\n> Here, we show that after ingestion of gelatin in humans, glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine peak in the blood after 1 h\n\nAlso, even if supplements company may do some tests, I'm sure Kroger (and the FDA) takes the quality of the gelatin they sell in supermarket even more seriously than ShadyCompany that sells on Amazon.\n\nThird, eating jello is fun! If you make flavored jello (no need for sugar if you use rose water and/or orange blossom water from your local indian supermarket), you can eat a fun food instead of swallowing pills - same reason why I prefer Kimchi or Natto to vitamin K pills. I've included a few recipes below.\n\nFourth, it's easy to make and you can add stuff to it, like vitamin C or the other supplement powders you take. I prefer to take my vit C separately as I'm afraid the heat would have a bad effect.\n\nFinally, it's super fast: Once I'm done eating my jello, it takes me 1 min to boil water in the microwave, add gelatin powder, the orange blossom water, then put the container in the fridge so that it's ready next time I need it. That's nothing compared to meal prep.\n\n# Dose and timing jelly with exercice\n\nIf you some form of exercice, consider eating gelatin 1h before: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5183725/\n\n> Supplementation with increasing amounts of gelatin increased circulating glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine, peaking 1 h after the supplement was given. Engineered ligaments treated for 6 d with serum from samples collected before or 1 h after subjects consumed a placebo or 5 or 15 g gelatin showed increased collagen content and improved mechanics. Subjects who took 15 g gelatin 1 h before exercise showed double the amino-terminal propeptide of collagen I in their blood, indicating increased collagen synthesis.\n\n15g is like 3 doses of the gelatin I get at my local supermarket. It takes about one bowl of water. I prefer to take the vitamin C separately, but at the same time.\n\n# Possible recipes\n\nIf you're not as much of a health freak as I try to be, and want to make gelatin very fun, there are many recipes:\n\nMatcha jelly:\nhttps://kirbiecravings.com/matcha-jelly/\n\nCoffee jelly:\nhttp://julesfood.blogspot.com/2013/06/vietnamese-coffee-jelly-desserteasy.html\n\nJuice flavored:\nhttps://www.food.com/recipe/fruit-juice-knox-blox-196761#activity-feed\n\nYou can also do savory recipes with bone broth jelly. Gelatin is fun (and wiggly)\n\n# Limits\n\nIt won't do if you are vegan: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/gelatin-source/\n\n> JELL-O is made from gelatin, an animal product rendered from the hides and bones of animals, typically pork skins, pork, horses, cattle bones, and split cattle hides.\" per Snopes.\n\nAs gelatin is made from leftover parts, it's unlikely to be why animals are butchered. So I don't feel bad about that.\n\nAnd when I feel bad about meat, I try to remember these funny 3 rules in life:\n\n1) if it's alive, kill it\n\n2) if it's dead, cook it\n\n3) rinse and repeat if it was yummy!\n\nI hope it was informative, and it may cause you to start adding gelatin to your meals!",

    "body": "There was more pretty-speak in the [examine blogpost](http://examine.com/blog/numerous-delicious-updates/) and that, as well as the page, should be enough to satisfy your taste buds. I'm just going to do a very quick overview here:\n\n- **Lavender**: Reduces anxiety, oral supplementation with 40-80mg of the oil appears effective for GAD based on two well controlled but still preliminary studies and there is a magnitude of aromatherapy research (meh, take the quality for what you want) suggesting it is effective for anxiety there. We do, however, have one study in rats noting that the aroma molecule (linalool) was detected in the blood following exposure to the aroma, so I use that as a *suck it* to anybody who says there is no physical basis for aromatherapy\n\n- **Hemp protein**: No evidence to say it is better than whey protein (Rogan?) and it has a nice fiber content. I have been warned it tastes like ass and a texture of what comes out of it after psyllium ingestion\n\n- **Psyllium**: This will make you poop the fountain of youth and reincarnate corpses because your poops are so soft and passable while also being bigger. It might also reduce flatulence while being healthy, you can just use metamucil if you want it flavored\n\n- **Nattokinase** oh honey no... (just eat natto)\n\n- **Coconut oil**: This one is pretty cool, there is indeed evidence that replacing other fatty acids in your diet with coconut oil increases the rate of fat loss and this may be secondary to being slightly thermogenic and/or creating ketone bodies. That being said, it isn't magically potent by any means\n\n- **Noopept** is indeed piracetam 2.0 but is equally unsupported in otherwise healthy humans for the purpose of cognitive enhancement. Nice for brain damage though?\n\n- **7-keto DHEA** it has really cool mechanisms and is great mind candy but I cannot say there is enough evidence to support its usage. If you want to get it anyways because of the phrase \"reduces the rate of which your metabolic rate lowers during dieting\" then go right ahead. I look forward to future research on 7-keto and neurology though, shits interesting and might be anti-PMS, anti-addicting, and a cognitive enhancer!\n\n- **Nitrate** and beetroot are beta-alanine 2.0; if you crossfit, snort lines of these and if you do endurance exercises like cycling or running *consider* snorting lines of them. Seriously, these are pseudovitamin-ish-kinda-maybe and are cardioprotective, increasing nitric oxide by means that citrulline/arginine do not and are possible additive. Definitely consider making a beetroot smoothie or using nitrates for preworkout or for reducing blood pressure\n\nNote: do not actually snort nitrates, things might explode\n\nAlso, nitrates do not increase acute power output... sorry powerlifters (they might help during GPP or some hypertrophy work?)",

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

    "body": "**Here's former CDC director Robert Redfield under oath before the Congress on Wuhan Lab September 2019 events:**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/aXXWRaM-sWQ?feature=share\n\n\n>I will say if you go back and look, it's declassified now, and I'm sure you all have your classified briefings, but the declassified information now: \n\n>In September of 2019, three things happened in that lab, one is they deleted the sequences, that was highly irregular, researchers don't usually like to do that\n\n>Second thing they did was they changed the command and control of the lab from the civilian control to the military control. Highly unusual, and I've been involved in dual use labs when I was in the military.\n\n\n>And the third thing they did which I think is really telling is they let a contractor redo the ventilation system in that laboratory. So I think  clearly there was strong evidence that there was a significant event that happened in that laboratory in September. It's now been declassified, you can read it. I'm sure there's more classified information around it.\n\n**Scientist Richard Ebright**\n\n>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction. And here is a proposal from the beginning of 2018 [from USAID/DARPA/CIA/Fauci/Gates-funded EcoHealth Alliance] proposing explicitly to engineer that sequence at that position in chimeric lab- generated coronaviruses.\n\n- Richard Ebright, an eminent molecular biologist at Rutgers University, https://archive.is/cCBUw\n\n**Eminent Virologist David Baltimore of CalTech**\n\n>When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine [humanized] codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.\n\n- David Baltimore, an eminent virologist and former president of CalTech, https://archive.is/yalCe\n\n\n**Former CDC Director Robert Redfield:**\n\n>I was concerned because of the presence of the furin cleavage site that we've talked about and I think it's important to understand what that cleavage site does. That cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of COVID, so where before it could not see the ACE2 receptor which is the human receptor, it totally changes the orientation now so it has high affinity for human receptors. So that furin cleavage site bothered me, it didn't seem like it belonged there. \n\n>And then if you look at the sequences they use in those 12 nucleotides for arginine, where the arginine sequence nucleotide triplet were coded for humans. So why did it have the arginine coding for humans and not bat? It was very disconcerting to me. It looked like this virus was engineered.\n\n\n>It's not scientifically plausible that this virus went from a bat to humans and became one of the most infectious viruses that we have for humans. \n\n\n\n**Scientist Valentin Bruttel:**\n\n>I tried to raise awareness to this for a year now.\nWIV use BsaI and BsmBI/Esp3I sites before to make synthetic WIV1 variants.\nAnd exactly those sites appear in a \"silently introduced, perfect for synthetic assembly\" pattern in SARS2, but non of its nat. relatives.\n\n>seriously, what is the chance that exactly those type IIs restriction appear or disappear through random evolution in a Banal-20-52 like virus?\n5-6 precise mutations in 30000bp?\nabout 1 in 10^20!\nSARS2 is clearly synthetic!\n\n**Type Ils restriction sites prove a synthetic origin**\n\nSynthetic RNA viruses are assembled at the DNA level and later transcribed. 30,000 nucleotides cannot be synthesized in one go. These viruses are therefore assembled from smaller, 2- 8,000 nucleotide long pieces. Specific DNA restriction sites are often added to later reassemble the individual building blocks in the correct order. It is also technically possible to hide these interfaces (No See'em), but this was not done in the WIV.\n\nIn a 2017 paper, two very specific, particularly suitable type Ils restriction enzymes were used at the WIV. These have the advantage that they can produce different DNA overhangs (sticky ends), which are crucial for a correct assembly of the complete genome: Bsal and BsmBI.\n\nSARS2 shows a Bsal and BsmBI restriction site pattern which is ideal for assembling synthetic viruses and to later replace the spike protein or furin cleavage site.\n\nBsal and BsmBI restriction sites also exist in closely related viruses (Banal20-52, RaTG13), but these are distributed in such a way that an artificial virus could never be generated using the methods established at WIV 2018/19. \n\n**The probability that the required 5 synonymous mutations, which enable a synthetic assembly of SARS2, arose purely by chance is less than 1 in 10^20 or about as likely as winning the lottery jackpot 3 times in a row.**\n\nDr. Valentin Bruttel\n\nhttps://twitter.com/VBruttel/status/1566365635680124929?t=koDQ9poynY6I9qSchgQAnw&s=19",

    "body": "#Congressman Larry McDonald, 1976: \n\n\"The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies (Bill Gates) is to create a one-world government combining supercapitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control. Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent.\"\n\n#Chapter entitled \"The Rockefeller-Gates Nexus\" from the book \"The Real Anthony Fauci\" by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n>A century earlier, America’s first billionaire, John D. Rockefeller, had blazed his own wildly successful exit ramp from public loathing, bad press, and antitrust prosecution by launching a medical philanthropy. John D. Rockefeller’s consigliere, Frederick Taylor Gates, served as John D.’s chief business confidant and philanthropic adviser. Frederick Gates helped Rockefeller structure his foundation, advising the mogul that “judicious disposal of his fortune might also blunt further inquiry into its origins.” \n\n>Practically from his nativity, Bill Gates began coordinating his own foundations’ giving with the Rockefeller organization. In 2018, Bill Gates made the salient observation that “Everywhere our foundation went, we discovered the Rockefeller Foundation had been there first.”\n\n>At the twentieth century’s dawn, Rockefeller’s sanguinary maneuvering—including bribery, price-fixing, corporate espionage, and creating shell companies to conduct illegal activities—had won his Standard Oil Company control of 90 percent of US oil production and made him the richest man in world history with a net worth of over half a trillion in today’s dollars. Senator Robert Lafayette excoriated Rockefeller as “the greatest criminal of the age.” The oil magnate’s father, William “Devil Bill” Rockefeller, was a marauding con artist who supported his family by posing as a doctor and hawking snake oil, opium elixirs, patent medicines, and other miracle cures. In the early 1900s, as scientists discovered pharmaceutical uses for refinery by-products, John D. saw an opportunity to capitalize on the family’s medical pedigree. At that time, nearly half the physicians and medical colleges in the United States practiced holistic or herbal medicine. Rockefeller and his friend Andrew Carnegie, the Big Steel robber baron, dispatched educator Abraham Flexner on a cross-country tour to catalog the status of America’s medical colleges and hospitals.\n\n>The Rockefeller Foundation’s 1910 Flexner Report recommended centralizing America’s medical schooling, abolishing miasma theory, and reorienting these institutions according to “germ theory”—which held that germs alone caused disease— and the pharmaceutical paradigm that emphasized targeting particular germs with specific drugs rather than fortifying the immune system through healthy living, clean water, and good nutrition. With that narrative in hand, Rockefeller financed the campaign to consolidate mainstream medicine, co-opt the burgeoning pharmaceutical industry, and shutter its competition. Rockefeller’s crusade caused the closure of more than half of American medical schools; fostered public and press scorn for homeopathy, osteopathy, chiropractic, nutritional, holistic, functional, integrative, and natural medicines; and led to the incarceration of many practicing physicians.\n\n\"Billionaires Try to Shrink World's Population, Report Says\"\n\n>The New York meeting of billionaires Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, David Rockefeller, Eli Broad, George Soros, Ted Turner, Oprah, Michael Bloomberg and others was described by the Chronicle of Philanthropy as an informal gathering.\n\n>**Gates in February outlined a plan to try to cap the world's population at 8.3 billion people.**\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-WHB-1322\n\n\"Moderna Wins Initial $20M Grant from Gates Foundation\" \n\n>Moderna Therapeutics said today it received an initial $20 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a new affordable combination of **messenger RNA–based antibody therapeutics.**\n\nhttps://www.genengnews.com/news/moderna-wins-initial-20m-grant-from-gates-foundation/\n\n\"20 Million Global Deaths Directly Attributed to the Covid Vaccines and 2.2 Billion Serious Adverse Reactions\"\nhttps://archive.is/Eu5QK\n\n\"FDA adds a warning to Covid-19 vaccines about risk of heart inflammation\" https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/25/health/fda-covid-vaccine-heart-warning/index.html\n\n\nBill Gates, Fauci's boss. DARPA. CIA. More importantly, the Rothschild-Rockefeller Mafia NWO at the top who runs the central banks, intelligence agencies, owns all governments and media, and runs the world. Gates is a creation of David Rockefeller. Gates dad was BFF with Rockefeller.\n\n\nHere's why I believe Bill Gates was involved with COVID:\n\nHe invested $55 million in COVID-19 mRNA vaxx creator BioNTech on September 4, 2019 which is 8 days before Wuhan Lab deleted their lab-made coronavirus sequences and COVID-19 began:\n\n\nBill Gates 9/4/19 $55 million BioNTech mRNA vaxx creator investment: https://archive.is/IP0b9 \n\nElon/Grimes 9/4/19 tablet (🧫🧬🦠+💉💉💉=🛸): https://archive.is/s7kJT\n\nFormer EcoHealth VP Andrew Huff September 2019 DARPA weird job offer: https://twitter.com/AGHuff/status/1492249880546398215\n\nFormer EcoHealth VP Dr. Andrew Huff legal declaration confirming EcoHealth funded by Bill Gates and CIA (In-Q-Tel) and that Peter Daszak told him he was working with CIA: https://archive.is/iZL1N\n\n\n\"Redfield: COVID-19 Was in Wuhan in September or October 2019: Former CDC director also tells CNN that the virus likely escaped from a lab\" - https://archive.is/YsEui\n\n\"COVID-19 might have started to spread in September 2019 in the United States: study\"https://archive.is/NpOqY\n\n\n>On the 12th Sep 2019, the main database of samples and viral sequences of the Wuhan Institute of Virology went offline. Eventually every single of the 16 virus databases managed by the WIV was taken offline.\n\nhttps://archive.is/i79eW\n\n\n\n**Here's former CDC director Robert Redfield under oath before the Congress on Wuhan Lab September 2019 events:**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/aXXWRaM-sWQ?feature=share\n\n\n>I will say if you go back and look, it's declassified now, and I'm sure you all have your classified briefings, but the declassified information now: \n\n>In September of 2019, three things happened in that lab, one is they deleted the sequences, that was highly irregular, researchers don't usually like to do that\n\n>Second thing they did was they changed the command and control of the lab from the civilian control to the military control. Highly unusual, and I've been involved in dual use labs when I was in the military.\n\n\n>And the third thing they did which I think is really telling is they let a contractor redo the ventilation system in that laboratory. So I think  clearly there was strong evidence that there was a significant event that happened in that laboratory in September. It's now been declassified, you can read it. I'm sure there's more classified information around it.\n\n**Scientist Richard Ebright**\n\n>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction.

CIA funded EcoHealth and EcoHealth president Peter Daszak is a confirmed CIA asset. Confirmed by former EcoHealth VP Andrew Huff. And Huff says he got a strange job offering by DARPA in September 2019, when COVID was released. He believes it was to lock in him in a classified status so he couldn't share what he knew about EcoHealth being a CIA front company.\n\n#Rothschild-Rockefeller Council on Foreign Relations\n\nWeaponized migration has been used by the elites forever to bring down nations. They need a global one world order where everyone is poor. Rothschild agent Council on Foreign Relations member DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas literally is building illegal migrant base camps in Panama and funneling tens of millions of illegals in via HIAS, a Rothschild-Soros NGO he was a board member of. Council on Foreign Relations is a think tank that dictates US policy and was created by David Rockefeller and Rothschild agent Paul Warburg \n\n#From Michael Yon https://x.com/Michael_Yon/status/1749489596826518007?t=YXPRe2zeti-kz9ul6_gxQA&s=19:\n\n>A HIAS facility is just beside China Camp. HIAS is the Hebrew Immigration Assistance Society. @SecMayorkas was a HIAS board member before he came to higher position in US Government invasion operations. Mayorkas is himself a migrant and a traitor. Much as Hitler was. Yes, I went there, without shame or apology. Mayorkas has stood on the exact ground from which I made this photograph.\n\n\n\n#From @AbsoluteWithE https://x.com/AbsoluteWithE/status/1749978689264111646:\n\n>EXPOSED: @Michael_Yon shares exclusive footage of an NGO tied to @SecMayorkas helping to funnel illegals from all over the world across our southern border known as the Hebrew Immigration Assistance Society (HIAS).\n\n\n\n#From Laura Loomer https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/1759916140568928375?s=19:\n\n>JEWISH NGO @HIASrefugees GIVES DETAILED MAP TO INVADERS WITH INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO INVADE THE UNITED STATES ONCE THE “MIGRANTS” ARRIVE IN PANAMA🚨🚨\n\n>HIAS @HIASrefugees map inside the Bajo Chiquito invader camp in Darien Gap, Panama is giving “migrants” instructions and maps on how to illegally enter the United States with printed instructions on how to reach each bus station, medic, and what the weather is going to be like on the way to the US.\n\n>While I was recording this video, there were thousands of invaders walking around inside the camp, waiting to be processed upon arriving from their jungle trek in the Darien Gap. I encountered invaders inside this camp from all over the world, including Afghanistan, Angola, Iran and Morocco. \n\n>There is so much irony in the fact that a JEWISH NGO (HIAS) is helping Muslims from terror tier countries and other places in Africa and the Middle East get to the United States illegally. \n\n>I disavow @HIASrefugees. HIAS stands for “Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society”. \n\n>How dare these people help facilitate the invasion of America under the guise of “Judaism”. \n\n Look at the sign I saw inside the camp. HIAS is literally providing a service of “route information”. \n\n>There needs to be legal accountability for HIAS, which is giving the illegals maps and information on the best routes to take so they can get to the United States. \n\n>I also saw the same type of maps with instructions for the invaders with the United Nation’s @UN logo, and the logo for Doctors Without Borders @MSF. \n\n>HIAS IS FACILITATING THE INVASION OF AMERICA AND THE GREAT REPLACEMENT! \n\n>EVERY SINGLE NGO THAT IS GIVING AID TO INVADERS NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN, AND THEIR STAFF SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKING! \n\n>SHUT IT DOWN!",

Unfortunately for me, it would likely be the motel 6 down the street because IVF has taken all my money and I’m still not pregnant. And while at the motel 6 I’ll likely sleep the whole time as I’ve been mentally and physically exhausted for the amount of time I’ve been trying to have a child naturally, spending months injecting my body with needles, and while also surviving life itself. But maybe I’ll take a swim at some point and have a chance to observe the happy families on holiday with their children and reflect with my spouse after our 1,000th roll in the hay which feels somewhat numb now because of how often we’ve hoped it result in our child. But then I can go to bed feeling refreshed from this vibrant vacation so maybe that’ll be enough to relax my stressed out uterus and ovaries, and look forward to the trip back home where I wait two weeks on pins and needles that maybe *this* time the pregnancy test will say positive! Boy oh boy, why didn’t I think of that!?”\n\nSigned, 😑",

    "body": "**QUICKFX Vita Sunscreen** *[SPF50 PA+++]*\n\nP499 for 200mL. This has been my day-to-day body sunscreen so far. There are times na I use it for my face but mostly for body talaga. Claims are non-sticky and fast-absorbing; I find them to be true naman.\n\n\n**Equate Ultra Sunscreen** *[Broad Spectrum SPF50]*\n\n9-10 usd (ata) for 470 ish mL. This has been a pleasant surprise for me, although, it's unfortunate na hindi siya local. But yeah, consistency-wise, ang weird na para siyang sunscreen na hindi mable-blend nang mabilis or magl-leave ng whitecast...pero it's the opposite talaga.\n\nWater resistant for 80 mins: I haven't checked if 80 mins exactly pero for my coron trip and my hiking trip (both last month lang nangyare), siya yung gamit ko. Very sportsy, outdoorsy-friendly na sunscreen. \n\nI also love its tropical scent hehe. \n\n\n**Luxe Organic Whitening Repair Ultra Light Glow Toner** *[Niacinamide, Licorice Extract, Arginine]*\n\nP349 for 150mL. I mostly use this toner for my underarms — effective kasi when it comes to keeping it smooth and free from body odor. Parang bonus point nalang na evened out yung skin tone. I use this as well sa butt cheeks, inner thighs and underboobs. \n\nIt's been 2 years or so na rin na ginagamit ko siya.\n\n\n**Luxe Organix Intensive Whitening Underarm Cream** *[10% Niacinamide, Alpha Arbutin, Tranexamic Acid, Licorice Extract]\n\nP299 for 40mL. I use this right after the LO toner. Also, I'm not sure bakit cream ang tawag sa kanya pero more like serum yung consistency niya. Same exact sentiments with the toner na I use this mainly to address yung body odor (underarms and underboobs). \n\nI wouldn't really say na nakakaputi siya per se. So that was definitely misleading. Brightening/even out the skin, though? Yes.\n\nAlso, may unique tangy but refreshing smell itong underarm cream and yung toner. Usually, ayaw ko yung strong perfume-y scent ng Luxe Organix pero I like talaga yung scent nitong dalawang products.\n\n\n**WATSONS Aloe Hydrating After Sun Soothing Body Gel**\n\nP209 for 100 mL. Very simple and straightforward na product - I use it as a soothing gel after a day na I've had more prolonged exposure sa sun. Or whenever certain areas of my body are red from heat/friction. Like kapag buong araw akong naka-bra and may red marks na yung band ng bra ko sa underboobs ko.\n\n\n**Hello Glow All-Natural Papaw Balm**\n\nP165 for 25g. I initially use this for lips lang talaga. And personally, siya pinaka-effective na lip balm. Simple and straightforward na product as well. \n\nHowever, I've learned through my sister na she would use this as an actual all-in-one balm. Specifically, sa mga dry patches niya all over her body. And it worked the same sa akin. I'm being careful nalang sa pag gamit to observe proper hygiene pa rin syempre hihi.\n\n\n**Luxe Organix Bye Bye Bum Bumps White and Clear Booty Cream** *[AHA-BHA, Niacinamide, Cupuacu Butter]*\n\nP229 for 230g. Newest favorite from LO!!! Paubos na actually ito pero first buy palang naman yang nasa pic. Sobrang bangooooooo—smells like natunaw na vanilla ice cream. I practically use it everywhere sa body: butt cheeks, inner thighs, underarms, underboobs. \n\nMedyo di ako sure kung may significant na brightening effects siya pero I do know na effective siya against texture (esp if acne related).\n\n\n**Snake Brand Wild Thanaka Prickly Heat Cooling Powder** *[Anti-acne & Brighter Skin]*\n\nP75 for 50g. Ever since, hindi talaga ako mahilig sa body care products in powder form. Pero I'm convinced well by this one. Effective sa cooling sensation. It doesn't necessarily last long pero it's fairly okay for instant relief. \n\nI used this sa mga outdoorsy activities ko last month. And even if bulky, boxy container siya, tinatyaga kong dalahin just to re-apply. \n\nI even use this sa face ko—and it didn't even break me out. \n\n\n**DR. SENSITIVE Sweat Shield Antiperspirant Deodorant Roll On** *[3% Niacinamide, Alpha Arbutin]*\n\nP149 for 50 mL. Been using this for 3-4 consecutive nights na so it's the newest addition sa body care ko. Bibili ko ito last week when I remembered na ni-review ni Jan Angelo sa tiktok haha. \n\nPersonally, yung go-to roll on deo ko, which was not included in this picture (naubos na), was the only deo/antiperspirant na hindi nag cause ng pangingitim ng kilikili. But this one, so far, didn't cause one as well. Very promising alternative for my go-to deo. \n\nSiguro, I would follow-up nalang eventually if it's something na could be effective rin against intense ish physical activity.",

    "body": "Welcome to Step 2 of treating severe constipation disorders. Please make sure you work your way through **[Step 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ConstipationAdvice/comments/inylod/step_1_lets_identify_your_issue_start_here/)** before reading this post.\n\n\n--------------\n\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** \n\n\nI. Am. Not. A. Doctor. \n\n\nThis guide is to help you *consult your doctor* more effectively about treatment options.\n\n\nDo not try these medicines without your doctor's approval, *especially* if you are a special case, like if you've had your gallbladder removed or if you have severe dietary restrictions, etc.\n\n\n------------\n\n\n**TREATMENTS AND MEDICATIONS**\n\n\nCycle through these home remedies and request these medications from your doctor, in roughly the following order:\n\n\n* Do all the **stupid fiber crap** just so you can tell your doctor to shut up about it. Fiber does not help people with motility disorders (people like you, probably). It will not help you - unless you have a lack of the *Prevotella* bacterium in your gut microbiome. Increasing your roughage intake and eating a plant-based diet will increase your *Prevotella* count, and might alleviate your condition. If the extra fiber constipates you more, move on.\n\n\n* Cut out all **dairy** immediately for a month. Dairy is delicious and makes live worth living, but it is disgusting and terrible for you. Almond milk, almond milk ice cream, rice milk, dark chocolate...get used to it.\n\n\n* Cut out all **gluten** for a month and stick to it. Wheat is insanely hard to digest for almost all people and it causes nothing but problems for people with bowel disorders. Even if your Celiac panel comes back negative, you still might have Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity, which is still being researched but quite prominent. Many people immediately see results after cutting gluten. But look out - the shit's in BBQ sauce, soy sauce, it's in the air, it's in the water, it's in your pillow, it's *everywhere*. It's as if the USDA has an agreement with US farmers to sprinkle wheat in literally every f*cking food product.\n\n\n* Try the [FODMAP diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/low-fodmap-diet) and stick to it. Eliminate all potential dietary causes of your constipation, then reintroduce them one at a time to identify the culprit. For 90% of you, diet has nothing to do with your constipation. You have a nerve disorder. As a rule of thumb, grains are all difficult to digest and should be avoided, but I've found that potato and corn are easiest, rice is a bit harder, and wheat and oat are the worst. No idea about quinoa. I strongly recommend sweet potato as a healthy filler replacement for breads. It doesn't even need butter!\n\n\n* Try a few high-quality **probiotics**. People with intestinal motility disorders have different gut microbiota than normal people, but scientists aren't sure which is the cause and which is the result. A [2015 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4288092/) showed that *Bifidobacterium*, *Lactobacillus*, and *Prevotella* are significantly reduced in people with functional constipation disorders, and their *clostridia* counts were higher. (*Clostridia* is bad and requires antibiotics. You can determine if you have this by asking your doctor for a Clostridia-specific stool culture test.) Try [Visbiome](https://www.visbiome.com/), VSL#3 if you can find/afford it. Also, try one of [these](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-3-best-probiotics-for-constipation-17940859). You want enteric-coated capsules that are not broken down by your stomach acid so they make it to your intestines.\n\n\n* **Miralax (polyethylene glycol)** is your first line of defense. It's a chemically inert (non-reactive) substance that you mix in water and chug. It's an osmotic laxative, meaning it does not stimulate the nerves/muscles in the intestines. It draws water into the bowel and flushes you out. It works slowly; it might take several days to work. The mainstream medical consensus is that polyethylene glycol is extraordinarily safe and can be used in babies, the elderly, etc. It can be used for years and years. However, there is some evidence now that it's bad for the environment and probably not as good for people as we thought. I'm ignorant of chemistry, but polyethylene sure sounds like plastic to me.\n\n\n* If you need fast relief, go to a health food store with a supplement section and buy a bottle of **Magnesium Citrate powder**. It must be citrate, and it must be powder. Mix 450mg (usually a heaping teaspoon) into a tall glass of water and chug it as fast as you can. Do this on an empty stomach in the morning before breakfast. If your disorder is mild, you will have to take a dump *immediately*. Don't get in the car to go to work for a little bit. MagCit is extremely safe and effective. Doctors prescribe it to old people for years and years with no side effects. But if you have renal disorders (kidney problems) talk to your doctor before trying this.\n\n\nI find that MagCit works best for me right before bed. I have to wake up in the middle of the night to pee out all the water I chugged, but in the morning, I generally am able to empty. By the way, MagCit is also an osmotic laxative.\n\n\n* **Cayenne pepper capsules** have been used in combination with magnesium citrate with great success in some people. The pepper stimulates peristalsis in the large intestine, and the magnesium draws water to the large intestine. Combined, they propel your gut's contents along. These capsules can be obtained at any health food store with a supplement section; you can get them and magnesium citrate in the same store usually. Be warned, some people report a mild burning sensation both in their esophagus and their rectum (basically like when you eat some really spicy food and it gives you the runs). The regimen I've read that works best is a heaping teaspoon of magnesium citrate in a large glass of water, chased with 1 or 2 Cayenne capsules before bed produces a BM the next morning. Start with a low dose. When you buy the capsules, they'll have a heat rating, usually between 40,000 - 90,000 HU. \n\n\n* Request **Lactulose** from your pharmacy. It's basically a sugar that helps with bowel transit. Didn't work for me, but it works for some. \n\n\n* **Docusate** is an OTC stool softener that makes me nauseous and does nothing else, but maybe it'll work for you. MagCit beats its brains out.\n\n\n**The following 2 drugs are stimulant laxatives. Please read my important note about stimulant laxatives [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ConstipationAdvice/comments/inz25u/step_2_treatments_and_medications/g4amdqk/).**\n\n\n* **Bisacodyl** this is your go-to OTC stimulant laxative. In the US it's known as Dulcolax, but there are off-brand boxes that are cheaper and similarly effective. Use this carefully. It can exhaust the muscles in your intestines, so while you get relief one day, the next two days you're in a refractory period where constipation starts up again. Use 10mg 2x per week if you have insanely bad constipation like me. Don't exceed twice per week. Use 5mg if you're underweight. Safe to use with MagCit. I like using it in the morning on an empty stomach and I'll skip breakfast that day. The more food you have in your digestive tract, the longer it takes. Empty stomach = 2-4 hours, full = 8-12. Long-term use is frowned upon but there's no actual evidence whatsoever that it causes a problem. Read the case studies if you don't believe me.\n\n\n* **Senna / Sennosides** is another stimulant laxative that is slightly weaker than bisacodyl, and generally preferable due to the lower intensity of muscle contractions. You can find it in the pharmacy in bottles labeled ExLax or Senna, or in the tea section of a grocery store, by the name \"Smooth Move.\" Take it right before bed.\n\n\n**End of stimulant laxative section**\n\n\n* **L-Arginine** is an over-the-counter supplement available at health food stores. It is used by athletes to increase cardiovascular health, but it has a magic side effect: diarrhea! Why? Because it breaks down into nitric oxide synthase, which regulates bowel transit time, and researchers recently discovered is [deficient in people with motility disorders](https://bit.ly/2WuGrCV). See [this conversation](https://www.ibsgroup.org/forums/topic/352542-unexpected-cure-slow-transit-colonic-inertia/#entry1449238) for more details. Also, taking this supplement with a small amount of baking soda might increase its effect, according to some athletes who experienced intense diarrhea after doing so (they like baking soda because it reduces acid production / muscle soreness). Oral dosages vary from 2-6 grams but some people go higher. Be careful and talk to your doctor first. L-arginine is also available in suppository form and there is good evidence to believe these are safer and much more effective.\n\n\n* **Amitiza (lubiprostone, prescription):** Your doctor might prescribe this first. It's an expensive prescription osmotic laxative. It causes nausea in a lot of people and it didn't work for me, but it's a godsend for some. Try it. Take with a great deal of water. DO NOT TAKE AMITIZA WITH LINZESS, MIRALAX, OR MAGCIT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL OSMOTICS (or behave like osmotics).\n\n\n* **Linzess / (linaclotide, prescription, \"Constella\" in Canada):** This is the most powerful prescription \"osmotic\" (it's actually a Guanylate cyclase-C agonist) in the world, and it will make your ass explode the first time you take it. It comes in strengths of 72mcg (that's micrograms), 145, and 290. I have a lot to say about this medication so read carefully. Also, if you've tried Linzess and it didn't work, please read my **[how to make Linzess work guide](https://www.inspire.com/groups/agmd-gi-motility/discussion/guide-why-linzess-fails-and-how-to-make-it-work-again/)**.\n\n\nFirst of all, it has a mild prokinetic effect (meaning it stimulates your nerves) in addition to its osmotic effect. This is a good thing. Amitiza does not have this.\n\n\nYour digestion is on a schedule. Some of you go every day. Some every other day. Some once a week. Whatever your normal clockwork is, this medication will sometimes work and sometimes not, depending on how much fecal obstruction there is in your intestine on the day. There were times when 290mcg did absolutely nothing for me, and other times 145 made me run wide-eyed to the bathroom fifteen times in thirty minutes. You will figure out how to make this medication work after a lot of trial and error. Don't just dismiss it the moment it doesn't work. \n\n\nI'm of the mind that no human being should ever take 290mcg and it has got to cause long-term damage to the intestines, but all my specialists disagree. They prescribe this dose to women quite frequently for some reason. \n\n\nLinzess has a penchant for working very well for a few weeks, and then ceasing to work at all. Keep it refrigerated (there's a rumor that it goes bad if it gets warm, but pharmacists will not confirm this). Take it with a large glass of water and stay super hydrated all day. Water is key; it cannot work if you don't drink a ton of water with it. If this medication dehydrates you (it will), grab a bunch of those vitamin/mineral powder packets from the health food store and chug one or two a day. If you get bad headaches/migraines/weak pulse/sweats/nausea, you need to just quit the medication and talk to your doctor. Ask him to reduce the dosage.\n\n\nAlthough the prescription for Linzess is once daily, I find it works best for me taken twice per week with another medicine like Motegrity (Prucalopride) or Bisacodyl. I take it on an empty stomach in the morning and don't eat anything until it starts kicking in (which is quite fast...usually under two hours).\n\n\nLINZESS HAS A [BLACK BOX WARNING](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxed_warning) against its usage in persons under 18. It is extremely dangerous to children. If you don't hydrate enough on a regular basis, it is also dangerous to you. It is illegal to give it to your kids. **If you don't have a gallbladder, mention this to your doctor before taking Linzess. I once heard that's an issue, but I can't find a source online. DO NOT TAKE LINZESS WITH AMITIZA, MIRALAX, OR MAGCIT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL OSMOTICS (or behave like them).**\n\n\n* **Motegrity (prucalopride, prescription):** This is a brand new drug, the first in its class, and it's a 5-HT4 agonist. It works similar to some antidepressants, by targeting specific serotonin receptors in your intestines. Except Motegrity is a highly specific agonist, meaning it has a narrower range of side effects and typically won't affect your mood. This drug actually works for me, it worked immediately, it still works. Zero side effects. I take it in the morning on an empty stomach, although it can be taken without regard to food. \n\n\nMost doctors in the US don't even know about Motegrity so ask them to look it up. It's brand new, meaning it's expensive. But don't worry. *All* of these drugs are insanely expensive. As far as I can tell it is safe to take with osmotics like Linzess but I have not confirmed this with a doctor. In my reading, I see no relevant contraindications between the two. \n\n\nThere is a warning in the box that some people committed suicide or experienced suicidal ideation while participating in clinical studies for Motegrity. There is no statistically significant relationship established here, but the company is by law required to make this information public. Frankly, Motegrity has zero side effects on me, and I expect these people killed themselves or thought about it simply because constipation disorders are f*cking horrible and make you depressed.\n\n\nIf you live in the UK, Europe, or Canada, your doctor will know this medication as Resolor or Resotran.\n\n\n* **Zelnorm/Zelmac (tegaserod, prescription):** This drug is similar to Motegrity (insofar that it is also a 5-HT4 agonist). It is older than Motegrity, and considered less safe because it interacts with receptors in a less specified way; there is some evidence that it interacts with cardiac receptors. In plain English this means it *might* be responsible for causing strokes and heart attacks in some patients. The evidence is debatable. 0.11% of people who used Zelnorm in a study experienced cardiac events, compared to 0.01% who took the placebo. That's 13 out of 11,500 people. The drug is available in the US only to women, although your doctor can order it \"off-prescription\" if he deems you low risk. Basically don't try this drug if you are overweight or have any notable cardiac family history.\n\n\n* **Trulance (plecanatide, prescription):** This is the main competitor of Linzess (linaclotide) and has a smaller side effect profile. It appears to work pretty well if osmotics work for you, but I haven't tried it. It also has a mild prokinetic effect (meaning it stimulates the nerves in your intestines). I assume, like Linzess, it is also dangerous to children. Give it a try.\n\n\n* **Mestinon (pyridostigmine, prescription):** This is where it gets weird. Mestinon is a drug that treats myasthenia gravis, which is a nerve disorder similar to MS. But, it can be used to treat constipation in some cases. It's an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, meaning it *increases* your body's levels of acetylcholine. This is a neurotransmitter that is partly responsible for telling your intestines to squeeze. Most doctors will be hesitant to put you on it, but you can give it a try if all else fails. It has a strange side effect profile and causes fainting/blood pressure drops in some people. I never tried it.\n\n\nAn interesting story...there is a woman who did a bit of basement chemistry and figured out that she could spike her acetylcholine levels by literally sticking a nicotine patch on her stomach below the belly button. It caused her bowels to empty after a week of constipation. She then invented [Parasym Plus](https://secure.vagusnervesupport.com/products/parasym-plus%E2%84%A2), a supplement that allegedly does the same thing. I bought this and I cannot figure out if it actually worked. Maybe it did a little.\n\n\nThere are many acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting drugs on the market. Prostigmin (neostigmine) is one of them. Ask your doctor if he thinks it's a good idea. He'll say it isn't. But if all else fails...\n\n\n* **Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate, prescription), or any related SSRI antidepressant:** Antidepressants are now being used to treat constipation. Some clever fellow figured out that the majority of serotonin (the mood-regulating neurotransmitter) is manufactured in your intestine, not your brain, and that antidepressants were giving people diarrhea for some reason. I haven't tried Lexapro but it's next on my list and my doctor likes it because of its small side effect profile relative to other antidepressants. This drug has a wider side effect profile than related constipation meds like Motegrity/Tegaserod, meaning you could have mood swings or drops/spikes in energy, etc.\n\n\nDespite our overwhelmingly negative public opinion about antidepressants, they are rather safe* and effective for many people. It's just that they're over-prescribed. A low dose does help some people normalize bowel function without causing mood/personality changes.\n\n\n*edit: A redditor linked me to [this article](https://rxisk.org/bladder-and-bowel-problems-after-antidepressants/) explaining that some SSRIs can cause long-term GI problems. The comments are worth reading. As with all pharmaceutical drugs, you are weighing your current problem versus the potential side effects of its treatment. Talk to your doctor about the risks and do your own research. Talk to friends and family members who have taken SSRIs.\n\n\n* **Erythromycin:** This is an OTC (I believe) antibiotic with a very odd side effect: it speeds up gastric emptying and gut motility. Hooray! The case studies are kind of back and forth on its efficacy for constipation, but some doctors swear by it. The problem is that it's an antibiotic.\n\n\nHere's the thing about antibiotics. They should not be overused or used unnecessarily. They can *seriously devastate* your gut flora and cause SIBO and worsen your condition. On the other hand, your condition could have already been caused by antibiotics, or by a pathogen that will killed with antibiotics. Proceed with extreme caution.\n\n\n* **Colchicine:** This is an anti-inflammatory derivative of the autumn crocus plant. In large doses it's highly toxic, but in small doses it's used to treat Gout. However, [a recent study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19705134) determined that it's an effective treatment for Slow Transit Constipation / Colonic Inertia (basically any constipation disorder that does **not** involve physical blockage like tumors, obstructions, etc). I haven't tried this but my specialist claims it is quite safe in low doses and he would be happy for me to try it out.\n\n\n* **For those of you who are diagnosed with slow-transit constipation / colonic inertia:** \n\n\n[Here is my personal treatment for STC](https://www.reddit.com/r/ConstipationAdvice/comments/kvzttf/the_treatment_for_slow_transit_constipation_stc/)\n\n\n[Here is a master list of treatments](https://www.inspire.com/groups/agmd-gi-motility/discussion/masterlist-of-remedies-for-colonic-inertia-slow-transit-constipation/).\n\n\n---------\n\n\n**MY PERSONAL REGIMEN:**\n\n\nI have a moderate-to-severe case of Slow Transit Constipation, confirmed not to be true colonic inertia or Hirschsprung's disease. Here is how I treat it, with 95% efficacy:\n\n\n[The treatment for Slow Transit Constipation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ConstipationAdvice/comments/kvzttf/the_treatment_for_slow_transit_constipation_stc/?)\n\n\n**History of my condition:**\n\n\nNotice how my condition has evolved over time, and has required different medications and doses. Your condition is likely to change over time too. It's important to document this change. Intestinal diseases typically are very transient and change over the years. What works for you today might not work in a few years:\n\n\n2012: Senna laxative once per month\n\n\n2014: Senna laxative once per week\n\n\n2016: Bisacodyl and Miralax twice per week\n\n\n2017: Magnesium citrate 450mg each morning before breakfast\n\n\n2019: \n\n\n* 2mg Motegrity (prucalopride) daily in the morning\n\n\n* 145mcg Linzess (linaclotide) every other morning\n\n\n* 450mg Magnesium citrate before bed\n\n\nMy current regimen appears to be quite stable; I think I've hit rock-bottom and the disorder won't get any worse. At least I hope.\n\n\n**September 2020 update:** my condition appears to have improved and my natural intestinal activity has increased. I'm shocked by this. I have been able to reduce my Linzess dosage! My current regimen is:\n\n\n* Smooth Move tea (senna) once a week\n\n\n* 2mg Motegrity (prucalopride) + 72mcg Linzess (linaclotide) once or twice per week in the morning\n\n\nI also attribute this success to switching my breakfasts away from eggs / toast to apple + banana + handful of nuts, quitting gluten, walking and running regularly, using a standing desk at work, and for some reason hot weather appears to help my guts even though I prefer the cold. Since this update was written during the COVID shutdown, I am unable to go to the gym, so I've been running more instead of lifting.\n\n\n-----------\n\n\n**EXERCISE**\n\n\nOf all the treatments I've tried, exercise is near the top on the list of effectiveness. Exercise is a conduit for getting all of that stress and potential energy out of your body and away from your guts.\n\n\nGet a standing desk at work (a good company will accept a doctor's note and buy one for you). Stand for half the day, intermittently. Go on jogs in the morning and walks in the evening. Get to the gym and get your knees above your waist - stairmaster, yoga, squats, etc. Just MOVE MOVE MOVE. By doing so you are stimulating the vagus nerve and increasing motility. You will literally shake the poop out.\n\n\nIf you live an incredibly sedentary life, you will suffer much more.\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n**SURGERY FOR EXTREME CASES**\n\n\nThere are a few surgical procedures to for treating the most extreme constipation disorders. You will not be a candidate for any of these surgeries unless all conservative treatments have failed.\n\n\n**Warning:** \n\n\nFor those of you who end up with a diagnosis of colonic inertia or slow-transit constipation, BEWARE that some people who have these surgeries end up developing upper-GI motility disorders later in life. It is as if the body realizes the colon is missing, so it simply manifests the motility disorder higher up in the GI tract. If your specialist recommends one of these surgeries, tell him you want to confirm without any shadow of a doubt that the nerves in your colon are 100% inert. Have your doctor review the research cited in [this article](https://www.healio.com/news/gastroenterology/20151007/researchers-question-benefit-of-colectomy-for-refractory-slow-transit-constipation). I personally was advised by my motility doctor that because I had slow-transit, I am absolutely not a candidate for these surgeries and anyone who wants to perform them on me is a butcher.\n\n\n* For those of you diagnosed with true CI, you might be considered for the [TAR IA surgery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180598/), (total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis). This is the laproscopic removal of your entire large intestine and the attachment of your small intestine to your rectum. The nice thing about this surgery is that you still get to go to the bathroom normally, except you have mostly diarrhea for the rest of your life (because your large intestine is the thing that turns diarrhea into solid stool by absorbing water).\n\n\n* The other option is one of many variants of the colectomy (resection or removal of the large intestine) with colostomy or ileostomy. These are both [ostomies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma_(medicine), which is the surgical creation of a hole in your lower abdomen. A medical bag is affixed to that hole, and your small intestine drains into it instead of down into your rectum. This is a much bigger life change, but from the people I've talked to, it's surprisingly not that big a deal.\n\n\nIf you are interested in these surgeries you will have to have a great number of conversations with many doctors and jump through a lot of hoops.\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\n**VEGANISM**\n\n\nI am not a vegan or a vegetarian, but I am generally convinced by the science of plant-based, whole-foods diets. The idea is you remove all animal products *and* all heavily processed foods from your diet, so you're left with plant-based foods that have a shelf-life and spoil. Fruits, nuts, vegetables, tubers, whole grains, and legumes are the food groups that make up this diet. Imagine eating just those things for one year. Imagine removing all of that animal fat, refined sugar, preservatives, and other chemicals from your body, and what affect it might have on your mood, digestion, weight, and well-being. Regardless of your position on veganism, the simple fact is that meat is slow to digest, and therefore replacing it with faster-digesting plant-based foods might increase your transit time / reduce dysmotility.\n\n\nThere is a ton of philosophy behind veganism and the community itself is actually fragmented into several warring factions. But, ignoring that, I find their diet recommendations to be pretty sound, and I am wholly convinced that the amount of meat and refined sugar consumption in the US is completely out of control, and our consumption is encouraged / reinforced by large industries with vested financial interest in preventing people from changing their diets. \n\n\nI eat a lot of plant-based whole foods, but I'm still doing meat a few times a week. I'd say I've reduced my meat consumption by about 1/3 and my refined sugar consumption by 1/2, and I've never felt better. If you are interested in this subject, do some critical viewing / reading of [Dr. Klaper](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJRelOFC3i5aJBobazfaonA) and [Mic the Vegan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGJq0eQZoFSwgcqgxIE9MHw). Please note, I do not agree with either of these guys on a range of subjects, but I *generally* agree with their dietary advice.\n\n\n-------------------\n\n\n**A FEW FINAL NOTES**\n\n\n* Read. You aren't going to effectively communicate or convince your doctor of anything unless you have some introductory knowledge of your body. Learn about your [digestive anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract) and understand the difference between your small and large intestine. Simply knowing this information will help you come up with questions about what could be causing your issue.\n\n\n* Save yourself the remarkable headache and get physical and digital copies of the results of every single test you have performed, even simple blood tests. When you inevitably get transferred to a different specialist, having this stack of files will make your life so much easier.\n\n\n* Your insurance company is going to fight you on some of these medications. Tell your doctor to tell your insurance it is an *urgent medical necessity* that they cover this medication. They will fold. \n\n\n* Do not give up. Write down your next steps. Follow up on calls, appointments, etc. I keep lists of all my medical to-do's and I cross them off line-by-line. It gives me a great sense of accomplishment and control over this whole situation.\n\n\n* Relax and get your mind off your condition. This is hard. But there is absolutely a psychological component to your condition. For some people, it's *entirely* psychological (this is called Chronic Idiopathic Constipation or Functional Constipation). **People who suffered sexual abuse in childhood often develop constipation disorders in adulthood.** Google this and investigate it with your doctor!\n\n\nI go on long nature walks with my headphones. This is how I unwind. Some people do Ju Jitsu. Some people do music. Spend time with family and engage in your hobbies. This will absolutely help, especially if your condition is idiopathic in nature.\n\n\n* Intractable constipation is often the result of extreme stress. Have a serious brainstorm about whether you need to quit your high-stress job. Are you in an abusive relationship? GET THE FUCK OUT OF IT. Can you afford a week-long spiritual retreat where you take a vow of silence and eat a vegetarian diet and sit in a garden with a pen and paper? DO IT. Now is the time to try all the weird stuff.\n\n\n* Cry whenever you have to; don't bottle anything up.\n\n\n* Talk to other sufferers about it. Reach out and get involved in a community. Support is everything.\n\n\n-------------------\n\n\nYour enemy has a name. You very likely have a [lower-GI motility disorder](https://www.iffgd.org/motility-disorders.html). It can be caused by an underlying nerve disorder, blood vessel disorder, mechanical muscle failure, neurotransmitter imbalance, hormone imbalance, or bacterial imbalance. Once you get your diagnosis, you will not feel so confused and lost about how to treat it.\n\n\nGood luck.",

I saw a GI doctor last fall, and she tried me on different drugs, many of which you mentioned (trulance, motegrity, amitiza, and Linzess). Some worked, but def not an everyday kind of “work.” \nWithout drugs, I will sometimes go 7-14 days with no BM. I’m bloated, of course, but not dying. Still, I know that it’s not good for my body to be holding on to this shit (literally). I also had a colonoscopy in the beginning of this year and it came up empty- everything fine. \nQuestions: Do you recommend taking the Visbiome + another probiotic? I wonder if I should revisit motegrity in conjunction with taking the probiotics? I checked the link for a motility specialty and there were no results in my state. Any ideas.\nI am going to try the magnesium citrate chugging & cayenne pepper capsules. It’s time!",

        "body": "Wanted to add a couple things that may help someone or at least are worth a try.\n\n1. Diet. Lowering or eliminating fiber can actually help some people or at least help with pain/bloating. Low FODMAP may not always be enough. There are examples of people who switch to carnivore type diet and completely fix long-term constipation. If you are miserable, it’s worth a shot I think. Remember to eat a lot of fat if you go that route. Especially rendered fat. Look up anti nutrients in plants. \n\n2. Upper GI. For some people constipation can stem from the issues someplace else in the GI tract, like gallbladder or stomach. Supplementing with bile salts/tudca a may help thin out the bile. There’s actually a new medication for constipation in the research phases in the US which works by forcing more bile into the colon thus causing a BM. It’s already available in Japan.\nLots of people also have low stomach acid which impairs digestion in many ways. Long term use of PPIs can cause this. \n\n3. Vitamin B1. There are anecdotal stories of people fixing STC with high doses of more bioavailable forms of this vitamin (benfotiamine or TTDF). There’s a nutritionist on youtube who talks a lot about it Eliot EONnutrition. Again, with all\nThe misery we go through, it’s worth a try. \n\n4. Probiotics. For those with methane sibo/imo, lactobacillus Reuteri DSM 17938 may help. You can look up some studies about this strain lowering methane in the gut. \nAs far as trying other probiotics, I think it’s better to try 1 strain at a time. Everyone is different and you don’t want to bombard your gut w many strains at a time. For constipation, usually they recommend L.Ramnosus and bifidobacteria strains. Some swear by spore based probiotics. But it’s a trial and error. No one can say what may or may not help. \n\n5. Bovine colostrum. Didn’t do anything for me but maybe will help someone. Supposed to be good for other things too. \n\n6. Herbal antibicrobial for methane sibo. I tried xifaxan/ neomycin and they did nothing. I think xifaxan actually aggravates constipation in some people. I found high dose Alicin to be more effective. But unfortunately for me it only helped while I was taking it. Maybe I need to do a longer course, not sure… I also had some relief w iberogast and oregano/horse chestnut combo but also only while I was taking them. \n\n7. Chlorella/spirullina/quercetin. Again, some anecdotal stories that they helped.  \n\n8. Stress reduction/lifestyle improvement. Obviously, good sleep is important. Also spending more time outside, getting some sun, following circadian rhythms, as well as reducing screen time, blue light at night, EMF, etc. Red light therapy can supposedly also increase nitric oxide. \n\n9. Electrolytes. Again, worth a shot. Increasing sodium or potassium can help via better fluid regulation. Some people have dilutionally low sodium from drinking too much water. I’ve heard stories of people improving constipation by increasing salt and/or potassium in the diet. And everyone can benefit from supplementing magnesium. Our soils are very depleted and not much is found in modern food. And if you add caffeine and anti nutrients in plants, those deplete magnesium even more. Good old magnesium oxide works better for some people because it’s poorly absorbed in the gut. But there are other forms of magnesium that may work better for some people.",

        "body": "Awesome resource + a bit in mental health\n\nThank you for putting this together! This is such an amazing entry that covers so much!  \n\nI did want to add in a bit about the stress-mental health aspects of constipation-digestion, as this may help some.\n\nAlso, I am not a therapist or mental health professional.\n\nMental health, stress, emotions, feelings, they all can play a significant role with how digestion functions. \n\nI emphasize those things as a lot of the time thoughts/cognition get all of the focus when mental health is a part of the equation. \n\nBut when mental health is a factor with digestive disorders, focusing on emotions and feelings can can have a positive impact over time.\n\nFor those with IBS, it is sometimes referred to as a Functional Somatic Syndrome. Somatic, as in the body.\n\nSo the “Bottom-up” approaches to therapy can really help with the body/bodily functions.\n\nHere is a short breakdown of Just a few different forms of Therapy:\n\nSomatic Therapy/Somatic Experiencing -\nSomatic therapy is a body-centered therapy that focuses on mind - body connection. It uses both psychotherapy and physical therapies. Somatic Therapy was developed to address incomplete immobilized biological feelings. This is more of a bottom-up approach.\n\nInternal Family System (IFS) -\nIFS is an approach that identifies and addresses the wounded “parts” found in a person, as well as the painful emotions attached to these parts. These parts are typically frozen in time. The goal is to lead with one’s core “True Self”. The Self/True Self is a concept that describes the confident, compassionate, whole-person that is at the core of every individual. This is more of a bottom-up approach.\n\nEye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) -\nEMDR involves focusing simultaneously on (A) associations of difficult thoughts, images, emotions, and bodily sensations, while (B) experiencing bilateral stimulation, which is commonly looking at a moving visual pattern (causing repeated eye movements). The positive outcomes can entail safety, empowerment, and resilience. \n\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) -\n​​ACT is an action-oriented method to therapy, and can also be applied to sports, nutrition, and business. It's an offshoot from traditional behavior therapy. The goal of ACT is to become more Psychologically Flexible. \n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) -\nCBT is meant to be used as a short-term form of therapy, focused on present-time issues. The target is problem-solving, and the goal is to change thought patterns in order to change the elicited future evade response to difficult situations. This involves re-labeling the thoughts that are being assigned to feelings and situations. This is more of a top-down approach (aka thought based).\n\nBecause there are so many forms of therapy, I decided to only highlight a few of the more popular forms that are gaining a bit more buzz lately.\n\nAlso, I believe all of the above therapies have subreddits.\n\nTherapy is not always easily accessible and is rarely affordable. However, there are many new Therapy services popping up online. Some of these contain the ability to see a Therapist in person, but most of them utilize video sessions exclusively now.\n\nHere are a few that can help you search for extremely specific therapists so that it’s easier to obtain services related to Somatic/body based/bottom-up approaches.\n\nOpen Path - https://openpathcollective.org/\nAffordable Counseling Collective. Pay a fee upfront for lifetime access to the database, And then lock in a discount on each session moving forward. Their database of therapists is large.\n\nHeadsway - https://headway.co/ Online Therapy network that accepts insurance in the US. If your state is included and insurance is accepted, you can pay as little as $20 per session.  You can still use this service without insurance.  New States are being added each month.\n\n*Psychology Today: Types of Therapy\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/types-of-therapy\n\n[Crisischat.org](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/) - If you need to chat with someone immediately.",

        "body": "Thanks so much for this and part 1, it’s been incredibly helpful while I’ve tried to work out constipation issues. I started an anti-CGRP migraine injection two months ago and have had chronic constipation that has gotten progressively worse to the point where I now cannot have a bowel movement without stimulant laxatives. Constipation is a known side effect because the injection can block CGRP function in the bowels (the most severe cases have ended up needing surgery for fecal compaction), so I think it’s effectively a medication-induced motility disorder? Working through the guide (and other stuff I’ve read) I’ve tried increasing fibre, water, magnesium oxide and magnesium glycate supplements - did nothing. Laxido (macrogol) and dulcoease (docusate sodium) make me feel more bloated and sick and didn’t help with BM. Bisocodyl suppositories don’t do anything because nothing is low down enough. Sodium picosulfate taken at night works the next morning, but makes me feel faint before the BM (I’ve fainted once) and causes huge, watery BM. I tried senokot but after three days nothing had happened so I took picosulfate again and that worked. What I’m not clear on is whether there’s anything else (EDIT to clarify: off prescription) that might work, and especially on how often I should take the picosulfate. Once a week? Twice? There’s no movement at all without taking it. I’ve asked my GP but they were pretty useless, and are trying to get some advice but it will take a couple of weeks at least. I’m in the U.K. Thanks again. \n\nPs I should mention that I’m also on a restricted diet because of some other medication, so am not eating a huge amount of food. But when I have eaten more that hasn’t helped with BM. I’m also taking peppermint oil capsules to help with the bloating (unclear if it’s doing anything).",

Some are \"osmotic,\" meaning they draw water into your colon. Some are lubricative, meaning they just slick down your colon wall with lubricant. Some are \"stimulant\" laxatives, meaning they actually increase muscle contractions in the intestines. Stimulant laxatives are the strongest type of laxative, and it usually hurts when you take them.\n\n\nThere is a lot of unnecessary hysteria about stimulant laxatives. People keep messaging me and saying they've been constipated for 14 days but they haven't tried a stimulant laxative, because they heard it's dangerous to the intestines and habit-forming. This is *a myth.* Stimulant laxatives are incredibly safe, even long-term, when taken as directed. General practitioner doctors circulate this myth that stimulant laxatives are dangerous and habit-forming, but there is *no strong evidence* suggesting this is true, and most motility experts agree that they are safe.\n\n\n**It is critically important that you try a stimulant laxative** if you have severe chronic constipation because your body's reaction to it is a clear indicator of whether you have TRUE colonic inertia. A lot of doctors conflate slow-transit constipation and colonic inertia, but they are completely different. A patient with STC has a slow-moving bowel whose myenteric nerve network is intact and functional, albeit just sluggish. Stimulant laxatives *do* work on these patients. \n\n\nConversely, a patient with true CI *will not respond* to stimulant laxatives. This is a very serious situation and requires a battery of tests to confirm, including the [Full Thickness Biopsy](https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/conditions-and-treatments/procedures-and-treatments/full-thickness-bowel-biopsy#:~:text=there%20any%20alternatives%3F-,A%20full%20thickness%20bowel%20biopsy%20is%20the%20only%20way%20of,for%20diagnosing%20some%20bowel%20conditions.). If diagnosed with CI, you very well might have your colon surgically removed and an ostomy bag put in place.\n\n\nStimulant laxatives are available at any pharmacy without prescription, but talk to your doctor first to make sure it's right for you.",

        "body": "Hi there…I’m new to Reddit and need help.  I’m a 77-y.o. longtime fitness nut who suffered from diverticulosis due to eating too much fiber…it wore out my sigmoid colon.  That led to a laparoscopic resection of my sigmoid colon this past August. Throughout my recovery I had increasing issues with constipation.  I assiduously kept my fiber intake low to between 8-12 g. daily but it never helped.  My GE here in South Carolina has diagnosed it as CIC or STC.  \n\nOver the past several months, I’ve been prescribed in turn Lizness for which I had a nasty allergic reaction (hives), then a course of using Amitiza; then Ibsrela and now, Trulance. They all worked for the first few days but then their effects diminished because (my educated guess) I was stacking up fecal matter in my proximal colon which could not be borne along due to some reason.  My GE thus labeled my condition as CIC and/or STC.  \n\nAfter every 10-14 days of suffering through this, I found it necessary to periodically clean myself out using MiraLax combined with Gatorade Zero.  My GE nurse even suggested it. I always held out hope that with each successive clean-out, my colon would reset itself. This actually did happen back in 2021 and I was fine until this year in the lead up to my surgery band in its aftermath. Dulcolax or senna works to propel along my stools but not very robustly, so I assume I don’t have colonic inertia/issues with enteric nerves.\n\nWe have no motility specialists in my city (Columbia) and all of the closest ones are in Augusta, Charleston or Charlotte.  These doctors are all booked solid but I snagged an appointment in mid-April over in Augusta.  How I will deal with my problems until then frankly worries me. \n\nMy local GE saw me a few days ago on 12/27 and directed me to start packing in food…because I’ve lost 14 pounds in the past 18 months.  His attitude all along has been to deal with me as an old guy with standard functional constipation….until he got a good look at me and clearly saw how thin I’d become. All these MiraLax cleanouts were done on days when I couldn’t eat food and take in nutrients. In addition to being bloated all the time, I simply didn’t want to eat a normal serving size as I had in the past. He also wants me to quickly increase fiber up to 25-30 grams. He’s sure these changes will enable my feeble digestive system to work again. Against my intuition I went along with it and now as I write this, I’m really blocked up once again and Trulance has stopped working after two days of initial success.  I’m back in the same boat with nothing to show for it except a lot of drug copays for medicines that didn’t work.\n\nI apologize for the length of this epistle, but would really value any helpful advice from fellow Redditors.  Thank you kindly.",

So that furin cleavage site bothered me, it didn't seem like it belonged there. \n\n>And then if you look at the sequences they use in those 12 nucleotides for arginine, where the arginine sequence nucleotide triplet were coded for humans. So why did it have the arginine coding for humans and not bat? It was very disconcerting to me.

Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent.\"\n\n#Chapter entitled \"The Rockefeller-Gates Nexus\" from the book \"The Real Anthony Fauci\" by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n>A century earlier, America’s first billionaire, John D. Rockefeller, had blazed his own wildly successful exit ramp from public loathing, bad press, and antitrust prosecution by launching a medical philanthropy. John D. Rockefeller’s consigliere, Frederick Taylor Gates, served as John D.’s chief business confidant and philanthropic adviser. Frederick Gates helped Rockefeller structure his foundation, advising the mogul that “judicious disposal of his fortune might also blunt further inquiry into its origins.” \n\n>Practically from his nativity, Bill Gates began coordinating his own foundations’ giving with the Rockefeller organization. In 2018, Bill Gates made the salient observation that “Everywhere our foundation went, we discovered the Rockefeller Foundation had been there first.”\n\n>At the twentieth century’s dawn, Rockefeller’s sanguinary maneuvering—including bribery, price-fixing, corporate espionage, and creating shell companies to conduct illegal activities—had won his Standard Oil Company control of 90 percent of US oil production and made him the richest man in world history with a net worth of over half a trillion in today’s dollars. Senator Robert Lafayette excoriated Rockefeller as “the greatest criminal of the age.” The oil magnate’s father, William “Devil Bill” Rockefeller, was a marauding con artist who supported his family by posing as a doctor and hawking snake oil, opium elixirs, patent medicines, and other miracle cures. In the early 1900s, as scientists discovered pharmaceutical uses for refinery by-products, John D. saw an opportunity to capitalize on the family’s medical pedigree. At that time, nearly half the physicians and medical colleges in the United States practiced holistic or herbal medicine. Rockefeller and his friend Andrew Carnegie, the Big Steel robber baron, dispatched educator Abraham Flexner on a cross-country tour to catalog the status of America’s medical colleges and hospitals.\n\n>The Rockefeller Foundation’s 1910 Flexner Report recommended centralizing America’s medical schooling, abolishing miasma theory, and reorienting these institutions according to “germ theory”—which held that germs alone caused disease— and the pharmaceutical paradigm that emphasized targeting particular germs with specific drugs rather than fortifying the immune system through healthy living, clean water, and good nutrition. With that narrative in hand, Rockefeller financed the campaign to consolidate mainstream medicine, co-opt the burgeoning pharmaceutical industry, and shutter its competition. Rockefeller’s crusade caused the closure of more than half of American medical schools; fostered public and press scorn for homeopathy, osteopathy, chiropractic, nutritional, holistic, functional, integrative, and natural medicines; and led to the incarceration of many practicing physicians.\n\n\"Billionaires Try to Shrink World's Population, Report Says\"\n\n>The New York meeting of billionaires Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, David Rockefeller, Eli Broad, George Soros, Ted Turner, Oprah, Michael Bloomberg and others was described by the Chronicle of Philanthropy as an informal gathering.\n\n>**Gates in February outlined a plan to try to cap the world's population at 8.3 billion people.**\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-WHB-1322\n\n\"Moderna Wins Initial $20M Grant from Gates Foundation\" \n\n>Moderna Therapeutics said today it received an initial $20 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a new affordable combination of **messenger RNA–based antibody therapeutics.**\n\nhttps://www.genengnews.com/news/moderna-wins-initial-20m-grant-from-gates-foundation/\n\n\"20 Million Global Deaths Directly Attributed to the Covid Vaccines and 2.2 Billion Serious Adverse Reactions\"\nhttps://archive.is/Eu5QK\n\n\"FDA adds a warning to Covid-19 vaccines about risk of heart inflammation\" https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/25/health/fda-covid-vaccine-heart-warning/index.html\n\n\nBill Gates, Fauci's boss.

These viruses are therefore assembled from smaller, 2- 8,000 nucleotide long pieces. Specific DNA restriction sites are often added to later reassemble the individual building blocks in the correct order. It is also technically possible to hide these interfaces (No See'em), but this was not done in the WIV.\n\nIn a 2017 paper, two very specific, particularly suitable type Ils restriction enzymes were used at the WIV. These have the advantage that they can produce different DNA overhangs (sticky ends), which are crucial for a correct assembly of the complete genome: Bsal and BsmBI.\n\nSARS2 shows a Bsal and BsmBI restriction site pattern which is ideal for assembling synthetic viruses and to later replace the spike protein or furin cleavage site.\n\nBsal and BsmBI restriction sites also exist in closely related viruses (Banal20-52, RaTG13), but these are distributed in such a way that an artificial virus could never be generated using the methods established at WIV 2018/19. \n\n**The probability that the required 5 synonymous mutations, which enable a synthetic assembly of SARS2, arose purely by chance is less than 1 in 10^20 or about as likely as winning the lottery jackpot 3 times in a row.**\n\nDr. Valentin Bruttel\n\nhttps://twitter.com/VBruttel/status/1566365635680124929?t=koDQ9poynY6I9qSchgQAnw&s=19\n\nBill Gates, Fauci's boss.

Gates dad was BFF with Rockefeller.\n\n\n#Here's why I believe Bill Gates was involved with COVID:\n \n- He funds EcoHealth, the lab that made and released COVID\nhttps://www.ecohealthalliance.org/2018/06/ecohealth-alliances-data-analytics-lab-announces-ai-earth-grant-microsoft - https://archive.is/n4Lse\n\nhttps://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2020/08/inv002838 - https://archive.is/qZK9Z\n \n- He funds Wuhan University \n\nhttps://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2018/11/opp1199760 - https://archive.is/NQCkk\n\nHe funds Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, which created SARS-COV-2 via Wuhan Lab\n\nhttps://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2020/05/inv006377 - https://archive.is/K62mG\n\n\n - He’s BFF with and handler of Anthony Fauci, they admit they talk regularly \n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/02/11/bill-gates-and-dr-anthony-fauci-talk-regularly-about-covid-pandemic.html - https://archive.is/jZ123\n \n- Fauci, the servant of Bill Gates, also funded EcoHealth/Wuhan Lab.

SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction.\n\nhttps://theintercept.com/2021/09/23/coronavirus-research-grant-darpa/ \n \n-\n\nBill Gates 9/4/19 $55 million BioNTech mRNA vaxx creator investment: https://investors.biontech.de/news-releases/news-release-details/biontech-announces-new-collaboration-develop-hiv-and - https://archive.is/cCBUw\n\n\n\"Gates Earns 10X on BioNTech in Just Two Years: $55m Investment Now Over $550M\" https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/gates-earns-10x-on-biontech-in-just-two-years-55m-investment-now-over-550m - https://archive.is/H9TBc\n \n- Bill Gates did Event 201 in October 2019, a tabletop exercise which predicted a coronavirus pandemic\n \n- Bill Gates starred in Netflix show \"The Next Pandemic\" in November 2019 with Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth, the lab that made COVID. In the show, Gates predicted a coronavirus pandemic originating in a Chinese wet market and promoted mRNA vaccines for the first time ever.\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7951293/Bill-Gates-Predicted-Coronavirus-Like-Outbreak-2019-Netflix-Documentary.html - https://archive.is/u4ZxW\n \n\nCOVID was announced one month later, in December 2019.\n\nKeep in mind, DARPA also funded EcoHealth for the virus and funded Moderna/Pfizer for the mRNA death shot. CIA funded EcoHealth and EcoHealth president Peter Daszak is a confirmed CIA asset. Confirmed by former EcoHealth VP Andrew Huff. And Huff says he got a strange job offering by DARPA in September 2019, when COVID was released. He believes it was to lock in him in a classified status so he couldn't share what he knew about EcoHealth being a CIA front company.\n\n",

Eventually every single of the 16 virus databases managed by the WIV was taken offline.\n\nhttps://archive.is/i79eW\n\n\n\n**Here's former CDC director Robert Redfield under oath before the Congress on Wuhan Lab September 2019 events:**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/aXXWRaM-sWQ?feature=share\n\n\n>I will say if you go back and look, it's declassified now, and I'm sure you all have your classified briefings, but the declassified information now: \n\n>In September of 2019, three things happened in that lab, one is they deleted the sequences, that was highly irregular, researchers don't usually like to do that\n\n>Second thing they did was they changed the command and control of the lab from the civilian control to the military control. Highly unusual, and I've been involved in dual use labs when I was in the military.\n\n\n>And the third thing they did which I think is really telling is they let a contractor redo the ventilation system in that laboratory. So I think  clearly there was strong evidence that there was a significant event that happened in that laboratory in September. It's now been declassified, you can read it. I'm sure there's more classified information around it.\n\n**Scientist Richard Ebright**\n\n>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction. And here is a proposal from the beginning of 2018 [from Fauci/Gates-funded EcoHealth Alliance] proposing explicitly to engineer that sequence at that position in chimeric lab- generated coronaviruses.\n\n- Richard Ebright, an eminent molecular biologist at Rutgers University, https://archive.is/cCBUw\n\n**Eminent Virologist David Baltimore of CalTech**\n\n>When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.\n\n- David Baltimore, an eminent virologist and former president of CalTech, https://archive.is/yalCe\n\n\n**Former CDC Director Robert Redfield:**\n\n>I was concerned because of the presence of the furin cleavage site that we've talked about and I think it's important to understand what that cleavage site does. That cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of COVID, so where before it could not see the ACE2 receptor which is the human receptor, it totally changes the orientation now so it has high affinity for human receptors. So that furin cleavage site bothered me, it didn't seem like it belonged there. \n\n>And then if you look at the sequences they use in those 12 nucleotides for arginine, where the arginine sequence nucleotide triplet were coded for humans. So why did it have the arginine coding for humans and not bat? It was very disconcerting to me. It looked like this virus was engineered.\n\n\n>It's not scientifically plausible that this virus went from a bat to humans and became one of the most infectious viruses that we have for humans. \n\n\n\n**Scientist Valentin Bruttel:**\n\n>I tried to raise awareness to this for a year now.\nWIV use BsaI and BsmBI/Esp3I sites before to make synthetic WIV1 variants.\nAnd exactly those sites appear in a \"silently introduced, perfect for synthetic assembly\" pattern in SARS2, but non of its nat. relatives.\n\n>seriously, what is the chance that exactly those type IIs restriction appear or disappear through random evolution in a Banal-20-52 like virus?\n5-6 precise mutations in 30000bp?\nabout 1 in 10^20!\nSARS2 is clearly synthetic!\n\n**Type Ils restriction sites prove a synthetic origin**\n\nSynthetic RNA viruses are assembled at the DNA level and later transcribed. 30,000 nucleotides cannot be synthesized in one go. These viruses are therefore assembled from smaller, 2- 8,000 nucleotide long pieces. Specific DNA restriction sites are often added to later reassemble the individual building blocks in the correct order. It is also technically possible to hide these interfaces (No See'em), but this was not done in the WIV.\n\nIn a 2017 paper, two very specific, particularly suitable type Ils restriction enzymes were used at the WIV. These have the advantage that they can produce different DNA overhangs (sticky ends), which are crucial for a correct assembly of the complete genome: Bsal and BsmBI.\n\nSARS2 shows a Bsal and BsmBI restriction site pattern which is ideal for assembling synthetic viruses and to later replace the spike protein or furin cleavage site.\n\nBsal and BsmBI restriction sites also exist in closely related viruses (Banal20-52, RaTG13), but these are distributed in such a way that an artificial virus could never be generated using the methods established at WIV 2018/19. \n\n**The probability that the required 5 synonymous mutations, which enable a synthetic assembly of SARS2, arose purely by chance is less than 1 in 10^20 or about as likely as winning the lottery jackpot 3 times in a row.**\n\nDr. Valentin Bruttel\n\nhttps://twitter.com/VBruttel/status/1566365635680124929?t=koDQ9poynY6I9qSchgQAnw&s=19",

I am going to be covering a popular but often chronically under dosed, overly mixed pre workout ingredient, L-citrulline. To see if it's worth picking up or leaving by the wayside. \n\nThis blog post will be a results focused analysis of L-citrulline with little to no focus on the bio chemical mechanisms of how it works, if a deeper dive into its mechanisms is wanted then I'll make one later down the line.\n\nWithout further ado, let's get into it.\n\n**What is it:**\n\nL-citrulline is an non-essential amino acid, meaning it can be made from other amino acids present in the body. But unlike some amino acids, L-citrulline is not used to make protein, it is instead has a role in protein homeostasis[\\[1\\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00726-015-1932-2) and as an intermediary in the urea cycle, the process in which our bodies handle ammonia. \n\n**What does it do:**\n\nl-citrulline increases NO biosynthesis indirectly by increasing l-arginine synthesis, which in turn leads to improved blood vessel vasodilator function, aka increased pumps. [\\[2\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073798/#B12-nutrients-10-00921)[\\[3\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073798/#B24-nutrients-10-00921)[\\[4\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073798/#B44-nutrients-10-00921) l-citrulline is not processed in the liver, unlike other amino acids like BCAA's which are poorly metabolised [\\[5\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2857013/), but synthesised in the intestine and kidneys preventing hepatic uptake of precursor amino acids (arginine, glutamine) activating the urea cycle preventing amino acid catabolisation. The preserving nature of l-citrulline in this cycle has a down stream effect in protein synthesis, content and functionality. [\\[6\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4309748/)\n\n**Practical application:**\n\nWhat it does is all well and good, but what about practical application and real word efficacy.\n\n**Reduced blood pressure and cardio vascular health**[\\[2\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073798/#B12-nutrients-10-00921) [\\[7\\]](https://academic.oup.com/ajh/article/23/1/12/149449) \\[[11\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21154265) \\[[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26863234)\\]\n\nblood pressure reduction from 4-15% after 8 weeks of supplementation at a very low dose. Though L-citrulline should not be used as a replacement for medication, if you are looking for something to help manage your blood pressure then L-citrulline may add benefit here. I did not track my blood pressure during my time using only L-citrulline.\n\n**Muscle Pumps** [\\[2\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073798/#B12-nutrients-10-00921)[\\[3\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073798/#B24-nutrients-10-00921)[\\[4\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073798/#B44-nutrients-10-00921)[\\[5\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28940638)\n\n📷📷\n\nIncreased muscle blood flow induced by L-citrulline has been shown to be as high as 11% in one study at 6g per day. I couldn't find studies measuring intramuscular vassal dilation at higher does of L-citrulline unfortunately. However anecdotally when supplementing with 10g of pure L-citrulline not the malate mix over a period of 8 weeks I measured a consistent visual pump that was greater than when experimenting with 6g as touted in the study. \n\n**Gym Performance** [\\[8\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20386132/) \n\nthe cited study showed a 52.92% increase in total work done with pectoral loading with 8g of L-citrulline malate, the mix ratio was not specified, though the most common is 1:2 giving roughly 5-6g of L-citrulline per serving. Though anecdotally I can give credence to the muscular endurance properties of L-citrulline, because this was mixed with malic acid that can help with lactic acid build up, the 53% increase in work load may be a byproduct of this mix. \n\n**Better erections** [\\[9\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21195829/) \n\nsupplementing at 1.5g for 1 month men with mild erectile disfunction reported hardened erections while supplementation occurred. Like with the blood pressure L-citrulline should not be used as a replacement for any medication being used with ED, however it may be useful as a potential adjunct. Anecdotally I don't have an issue here so didn't notice anything above and beyond what is normal, if you're looking for a replacement for viagra, you wont find it here.\n\n**Protein synthesis** [\\[6\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4309748/)[\\[12\\]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcsm.12435) \n\nsupplementing from 10-22g of L-citrulline directly relating to the participants body mass showed a significant increase in protein synthesis which is a potential reason why an increase in lean mass in trainees has been observed in other studies. \n\n**Muslce recovery** [\\[10\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33308806/) \n\nPost resistance training participants reported greater reduction in muscular soreness 24-48 after. So if you are fairly new to the gym or changing up your routine and getting DOMS then L-citrulline may help.\n\n**Lean mass** [\\[11\\]](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-018-0235-x) \n\n📷📷  \n\n\nLean mass was shown to increase over a period if 8 weeks in a group supplementing with 2.5g of L-citrulline in comparison to those who supplemented with L-citrulline malate at 2.5g or the placebo. An average of 2.4lb lean massed gained was observed over the 8 weeks which is pretty significant. Anecdotally I used L-citrulline during a body recomp training block and though made changes to my physique I cannot purely attribute this to L-citrulline. \n\n**Dosing:**\n\nClinical dosing of L-citrulline has ranged from as low as 0.5g to as high as 22g, making it fairly hard to directly pin point the dose at which we start to get diminishing returns or no increase benefit at all. Some studies suggest scaling L-citrulline intake to lean body mass as you would do with measuring protein intake. Anecdotally I found most success at 10g at 110kg of body weight at a roughly 11% ratio, though some may find more or less is beneficial. \n\n**When to take**\n\nNo studies that I can find suggest an optimal time to ingest L-citrulline in a pre workout context, though inferring from popular opinion anywhere between 30-60 mins pre workout seems fine. Anecdotally 10g 30 mins pre workout has worked well for me.\n\n**Side effects**\n\nL-citrulline has been shown to have no negative side effects with doses as high as 15g and past that there hasn't been any effort to ascertain what, if any, side effects present themselves.\n\n**The bottom line**\n\nL-citrulline is fairly expensive as a supplement so I suggest going for a milder dose initially and slowly titrate the dose until you find what works for you. \n\nPersonally I would highly recommend L-citrulline if you have some cash to spare and want to get the most out of your training.",

    "body": "Here are all my thoughts and advice based on my personal experiences, other people’s insight and helpful experiences, and research I have done on and off about pelvic floor issues from the past eight years or so. There is still a lot left to learn, but I am putting everything I know currently here. I am not claiming that any of this is revolutionary, but I hope it can help some of you out there to give you a headstart on healing and advance our understanding of these conditions. As I am a 27 year old male with previous major problems with pelvic floor issues and hard flaccid, some of my advice may be biased towards my condition. However, I believe everyone can benefit from a lot of this because I really do think that all of these conditions that I mentioned are linked in at least some way, especially by pelvic floor dysfunction and sex hormone desensitization. I try not to come to these forums because it increases anxiety and negative emotions which leads to worse pelvic floor symptoms, so my apologies if I do not respond to your questions. For hard flaccid and pelvic floor affected people, follow my advice and I am confident you can heal and reach a place where your symptoms barely affect your life, if at all, which is where I am at now. The mentality of trying to find a 100% “magic cure” solution just leads to anxiety and catastrophic thinking if you have a set back which will only worsen your symptoms. You can and will heal. I know this is a lot of information, but try to implement just one or two things at a time. Focus on the present, and take it one day at a time. Don’t get overwhelmed. \n\n[Post Finasteride Syndrome (PFS)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7231981/), [Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction (PSSD)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34627736/), [Hard Flaccid Syndrome (HFS)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7271516/), Pelvic Floor Dysfunction, and Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome all can have some similar symptoms. I believe that they are all either caused or can be exacerbated by androgen and estrogen receptor insensitivity and are triggered by medication, genital injury, and pelvic floor inflammation and dysfunction. The pelvic floor is rich in androgen receptors and estrogen receptors. However, without proper androgen receptor activation and sensitivity, the pelvic floor muscles don’t have enough DHT which line the tissues of the pelvic floor, genitalia, and lower urinary tract. DHT is vital for healthy sexual functioning in both sexes - it provides an anabolic effect to tissues to provide strength, stability, healing, and relaxation to tissues. As a result of androgen receptor insensitivity and lack of DHT, the pelvic floor can become chronically weakened, tight, and inflamed which reduces blood flow to the region leading to even more androgen receptor insensitivity and thus less DHT. These symptoms can cause psychological stress to the individual which tightens the pelvic floor further leading to more symptoms and less blood flow. One study found that androgen sensitivity has raised the possibility that androgens can be used to rebuild the weakened and/or damaged muscles comprising the pelvic floor - [source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcb.25751). Some people may also have normal sex hormone levels in the blood when tested, but these hormones cannot reach or be effective in the pelvic floor tissues or brain due to sex hormone insensitivity and the lack of the blood flow in the region caused by pelvic floor tightness and dysfunction. \n\nDesensitized estrogen receptors leading to decreased estrogen levels in local pelvic floor and genital tissues may be causing a similar mechanism of dysfunction in some people like androgen receptor insensitivity and DHT because estrogen is important for pelvic floor and sexual health in both sexes. [This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4854098/) says that “Estradiol in men is essential for modulating libido, erectile function, and spermatogenesis. Estrogen receptors, as well as aromatase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen, are abundant in brain, penis, and testis, organs important for sexual function. In the brain, estradiol synthesis is increased in areas related to sexual arousal. In addition, in the penis, estrogen receptors are found throughout the corpus cavernosum with high concentration around neurovascular bundles.” Steroid users report that low estrogen causes decreased or numb penile sensitivity, shrunken flaccid penis, dull orgasm, urinary hesitancy, urinary frequency, low sex drive, and erectile dysfunction. [Here is a paper from a PSSD community member that hypothesizes, as do an increasing amount of people, that the main issue of PSSD, PFS, and Post-Retinoid Sexual Dysfunction is estrogen receptor insensitivity](https://osf.io/jxnbu/). PSSD and PFS sufferers often have similar hard flaccid and pelvic floor issues, so if those conditions are caused by estrogen insensitivity, then perhaps our pelvic floor dysfunction, HFS, and CPPS, is also impacted by a lack of estrogens in the pelvic floor tissues, not just androgens. The most important element to remember to help start the healing process for these disorders is to boost blood flow through supplements, stretches, and exercises which will increase both androgen and estrogen receptor sensitivity over time.\n\nPost Finasteride Syndrome (PFS) caused by Finasteride, a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (5-ARI), plummets DHT levels in the body to try to help hair loss causing sexual dysfunction and pelvic floor issues. Androgen receptors that surround the pelvic floor, genitals, and brain become desensitized due to the Finasteride leading to less DHT binding to these receptors causing dysfunction and a tight, weak pelvic floor. The tight, dysfunctional pelvic floor now restricts blood flow which impacts healing and the delivery of testosterone to this area that further exacerbates androgen insensitivity leading to less DHT in these tissues. Since androgen receptors are found in the brain and androgens have neuroprotective effects, this could be one reason why some PFS and PSSD sufferers are also impacted cognitively. An herbal supplement called Saw Palmetto has also been reported to cause a disorder similar to PFS because it is also a 5-ARI that blocks the conversion of testosterone into DHT. Another disorder called Post Accutane Syndrome (PAS) is also similar to PFS and it reduces DHT as well through being a 5-AR.\n\nFor Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction (PSSD), [SSRIs are also known to decrease androgens](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28179152/) and [down regulate androgen receptors](https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1016/j.juro.2015.02.1371). This [study shows that SSRIs can have an anti-estrogenic effect as well and can even reduce the expression of estrogen receptors (ER), including in the hypothalamus.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632899/#!po=1.16279). As androgen and estrogen receptors get desensitized in the pelvic floor, genital region, and brain, it causes localized DHT and estrogen levels in these tissues to decrease causing emotional blunting, sexual dysfunction, pelvic floor issues, hard flaccid syndrome, and more. The pelvic floor dysfunction can then prevent the sex hormone receptors from being reactivated and sensitized in this area due to restricting oxygen and sex hormone rich blood flow to the tissues. SSRIs can cause androgen receptor insensitivity and estrogen receptor insensitivity by severely inhibiting the serotonin transporter (SERT) leading to increased serotonin levels which desensitizes those receptors throughout the body.  It is also interesting that some PSSD community members are trying to restore estrogen receptor sensitivity via boosting estrogen in various ways including by taking hops extract which is a potent phytoestrogen. [Check out the PSSD Network for more information on this condition as they are helping to give a voice to the unheard.](https://www.pssdnetwork.org/).\n\nHard Flaccid Syndrome (HFS) - There are many men suffering from HFS and pelvic floor issues due to PSSD, PFS, heavy weight lifting, excess kegeling, or in the case I’m presenting here, physical damage to the genitals from excessive, vigorous sexual activity (my case) or penis enlargement exercises. When the genitals get damaged, an inflammatory process starts and the pelvic floor contracts to protect itself. Since the pelvic floor is now in a chronic, contracted state, it limits oxygen and sex hormone rich blood flow to the genitals and pelvic floor which leads to sex hormone insensitivity and negatively impacts healing, muscle relaxation, and DHT production in these tissues. Finasteride, Accutane, and SSRIs also desensitize sex hormone receptors in the genitals and pelvic floor tissues leading to hard flaccid and pelvic floor dysfunction. Since the pelvic floor tightness restricts blood flow, it is difficult for hard flaccid sufferers to reactivate and sensitize their pelvic floor muscle androgen receptors again to regain relaxation and strength in their pelvic floor muscles, including the ischiocavernosus (IC), bulbocavernosus (BC), and pubococcygeus (PC) which are in a contracted state; the IC muscle in particular is thought to be the most implicated in the cause of hard flaccid. We first need to promote relaxation in the pelvic floor by boosting blood flow through supplements and stretches because tight muscles are weak muscles. Once the pelvic floor is in a chronic state of tension, it is hard to heal from pelvic floor issues because you likely already had bad habits such as poor posture, unhealthy sexual practices, stiff muscles, sedentary lifestyle, unchecked anxiety, and other negative lifestyle factors. Along with supplements, exercises, and stretches, correcting these bad habits is necessary to heal to have an even healthier pelvic floor than you ever had before because it likely was already tight and dysfunctional to begin with before developing obvious issues, but it was more subtle and you had no awareness of your pelvic floor muscles until now. You have the potential to now become a much healthier person overall than you ever would have been without being affected by pelvic floor dysfunction and hard flaccid.\n\n32% of women will develop a pelvic floor disorder in their lifetime which is double that of men. While childbirth and pregnancy plays a role in this discrepancy, women also have far less testosterone and DHT levels than men which I believe plays a major factor. Since women have less testosterone, their androgen receptors that line the pelvic floor don’t make enough DHT to adequately support these tissues compared to men. This makes them more prone to pelvic floor dysfunction that causes them a disparate amount of pain, tightness, and inflammation. Androgen receptors and their ability to convert testosterone into DHT play such a vital role in pelvic floor health and sexual functioning. This is mentioned in a research study: [Prevailing scientific literature has indicated the presence of androgen receptors in the levator ani muscle and pelvic fascia. The existence of androgen receptors in the vaginal wall can play an essential role in the development of pelvic floor disorders in women.Thus, androgen-related disorders may interfere with the function of pelvic floor muscles.](https://www.dovepress.com/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-and-pelvic-floor-dysfunction-a-narrative-rev-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-RRU). Many people mistakenly believe that androgens are only important for male sexual health: [Androgens have a three-fold action on female sexual function. They (1) increase libido by providing the fuel for a woman’s psychosexual stimulation, (2) increase sensitivity and blood flow to the external genitalia, and (3) increase the intensity of sexual gratification.](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/sexualmedicine/patientinformation-physicians/androgen-insuffiency-in-women/).\n\nWhat I see in all these conditions is that sex hormone receptors become desensitized in the pelvic floor and genital tissues either from a drug, pelvic tightness, or inflammation from injury leading to less localized sex hormones causing sexual and pelvic floor dysfunction. The pelvic floor now goes into a chronic tightened state as a response, leading to more inflammation and less oxygen and testosterone rich blood flow to the genital and pelvic region which leads to more androgen insensitivity and subsequently less DHT. This all explains why many people who have these conditions are helped by supplements that improve androgen receptor sensitivity and blood flow, and why pelvic floor therapy and exercises are so helpful to many of them. Estrogen receptor insensitivity in the pelvic floor also appears to have a similar mechanical negative effect by leading to less estrogen levels in the pelvic floor and genital tissues. It is also possible that some people with PSSD/PFS may have subtle or no pelvic floor symptoms, but the medication still desensitizes sex hormone sensitivity in their genitals and pelvic floor tissues that is leading to sexual dysfunction. \n\n[Another study linking androgens and the pelvic floor:](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8359898_Anabolic_effects_of_androgens_on_muscles_of_female_pelvic_floor_and_lower_urinary_tract) Levator ani and other muscles of the pelvic floor and lower urinary tract are sensitive to the anabolic effects of testosterone. Androgen receptors are also expressed in the pelvic floor and lower urinary tract of both animals and humans. Anabolic effects of androgens may play an important role in the female pelvic-floor and lower-urinary-tract disorders. The action of androgens in the lower urinary tract and pelvic floor is complex and may depend on their anabolic effects, hormonal modulation, receptor expression, interaction with nitric oxide synthase, or a combination of these effects.\n\nMy solution to help heal and improve the well-being of people with these issues is to try to improve sex hormone receptor sensitivity and pelvic floor function through supplements, stretches, exercises, and boosting blood flow which will hopefully restore normal levels of estrogens and androgens in pelvic, genital, and brain tissues. The body has a tremendous capability of self-healing, but we need to support it through active recovery methods.\n\n**We will first start with supplements (this is not professional medical advice - talk with your doctor before taking):**\n\nL-citrulline - This is the precursor to l-arginine, and it will improve blood flow and levels of nitric oxide to help get oxygen and testosterone rich blood to the pelvic floor and genital tissues to increase androgen sensitivity. Nitric oxide can also induce smooth muscle relaxation which is important for relaxing the pelvic floor. [Herein we report on a young man affected by PSSD who regained sexual functioning after 3-month treatment with EDOVIS, a dietary supplement containing L-citrulline and other commonly used aphrodisiacs.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30640584/). I recommend taking at least 6000 mg daily by taking 2000mg three times throughout the day. The max dose is 10,000mg. Even potentially better, people report great results using Cialis to improve blood flow and healing rather than L-citrulline and some doctors will even prescribe it to women if you show them the evidence - talk with your doctor. [“Tadalafil (Cialis) reversal of sexual dysfunction caused by serotonin enhancing medications in women”](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16234221/). L-Citrulline and Cialis are not recommended to be taken together. \n\nL-Carnitine - This will improve the number of androgen receptors and their sensitivity to testosterone to increase levels of DHT in the pelvic floor, genital tissues, and brain. I recommend taking 2000mg daily. Acetyl-L-Carnitine can pass through the blood-brain barrier, while Propionyl-L-carnitine has a high degree of interaction with testosterone. Propionyl may be better for sexual and pelvic floor dysfunction, while Acetyl might help people suffering from the mental effects of PSSD. [This study used each at 2000mg daily to improve erectile dysfunction along with Viagra.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16286128/). I would work up to 2000mg each of Acetyl and Propionyl L-Carnitine along with Cialis instead of Viagra as it lasts in the body for much longer (36 hours) for increased blood flow healing purposes. You can also use L-Citrulline instead of Cialis as mentioned earlier. Discuss with your doctor before taking them.\n\nVitamin D - This vitamin, which acts more like a hormone, works directly with the endocrine system. It has its own receptors throughout the body and they are often in close proximity to androgen receptors. Deficiency in vitamin D is associated with a stunting of testosterone's effects on androgen receptors and a decline in testosterone levels. Vitamin D will encourage androgen receptor resensitization. [One study found that higher vitamin D levels are associated with a decreased risk of pelvic floor disorders in women](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20308841/), and [The levator ani and coccygeus muscles are skeletal muscles that are critical components of the pelvic floor and may be affected by vitamin D nutritional status](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3691097/).  I recommend 4000IU of vitamin D daily or whatever gets your levels to 60 - 80 ng/ml. I would also take 100mcg of vitamin K2 to ensure that any excess calcium from vitamin D is deposited into the bones and not arteries.\n\nMagnesium Glycinate - This will help relax your pelvic floor muscles to help restore function and blood flow. I recommend starting with 300mg.\n\nIf you have inflammatory issues or pain due to pelvic floor dysfunction, I recommend a fish oil supplement daily. I take fish oil, and I find that it helps limit pelvic inflammation. Take quercetin and bromelain as needed if you experience pelvic inflammatory flare ups, pain, and bladder issues, but just be careful as quercetin can also inhibit the production of DHT from testosterone as well. Some say fish oil blocks DHT too, but experiencing chronic pelvic floor pain and inflammation will do more harm to you than minimal DHT blocking.\n\nI also recommend doing some form of yoga or pelvic floor stretches daily to improve blood flow for pelvic floor relaxation and sex hormone receptor sensitivity. You also need to request to see a pelvic floor therapist for an evaluation and treatment. Learn how to do reverse kegels. Doing reverse kegels will be difficult at first because your pelvic floor is tight and you have little to no awareness of these muscles, so just focus on lengthening and relaxing the pelvic floor through stretches for now. Do not do regular kegels for pelvic floor issues. Learn how to diaphragmatically breathe in 360 degrees to create expansion in your rib cage and abdomen to encourage pelvic floor relaxation. Do not breathe through your chest, and “belly breathing” isn’t the right term because the ribs need to expand as well. You can learn how to diaphragmatically breathe through an exercise such as 4-7-8 breathing. [Here is a great video on diaphragmatic breathing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auca88tmUu8&ab_channel=MichelleKenway) and [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx_k5T6Gie0&t=). Retraining yourself to properly breathe diaphragmatically is the single most important thing that you can do to heal from pelvic floor issues. \n\n**Stretches/Yoga poses I recommend:**\n\nHold the Malasana/hindi/yoga squat pose for at least 5-10 minutes at least twice a day, but doing it morning, mid-day, and at night would be the best. Some get great results holding it for 15-20 minutes.This is one of the most important things for your pelvic floor because it will help lengthen and release it. Doing them barefoot is also very beneficial to strengthen your ankles and feet which are connected to your pelvic floor. Again, remember to breathe deeply down into your belly and pelvic floor for all these stretches. \n\n\nBegin your stretching routine with an [Exercise ball ab stretch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhQfzFBylv4&ab_channel=AcademyAthleticTherapyInc.) and Upward-facing dog/cobra pose. This will help stretch your lower abs and psoas muscles so that you can get more breath deeper down into your pelvic floor for the rest of your stretches. Some people say that these types of stretches aren’t great for people who have Anterior Pelvic Tilt, which we should fix, but I still do them as it is important to stretch the lower abs that are hard to get to. You can experiment with doing them sporadically instead of every time you stretch.\n\n\nThis is my current personal complete stretch routine I do in order 3+ days a week:\n\n\n[Myofascial release on my glutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t3OuH0i9rQ) with an orb massage ball but you can use any small hard ball (don’t do this if glutes are currently sore) > [Calf stretch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5ZWOJ34v6Y&ab_channel=PhysiYogawithDr.KatiePT) against a wall or a yoga block which is what I use > exercise ball ab stretch  > upward facing dog > (optional) Do a handful of cat cows > [Supine hamstring stretch with yoga strap or an IdealStretch tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlDYgYkUzoY&ab_channel=AspenBackBody) which is what I use > [Kneeling hip flexor stretch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqoPYLUgP48&ab_channel=%5BP%5Drehab) > flat on back supine single knee to chest stretch > then bring knee to opposite shoulder stretch > supine figure four >  [I do this stretch next right after figure four](https://youtu.be/ntP8eQY74Cw?t=660) > Reclined bound angle pose > (optional) butterfly stretch > (optional) A little bit of downward facing dog to stretch the calves > (optional) Lizard Pose) > (optional) Half split stretch/Half monkey pose with yoga blocks > Half-pigeon pose > Child’s pose >  [Wall quad hip flexor stretch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQr-yE86AHk&ab_channel=UprightHealth) > Wall figure four stretch > Wall straddle pose > Wall happy baby pose >  [Flat on back while pulling knees apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W23bSJzEhzE&t=728s&ab_channel=Dr.MelissaOleson) > [kneeling with one leg, other leg out to side for adductors](https://youtu.be/Vr0Us9LPGRg?t=96) > (optional) [Frog pose with feet together](https://youtu.be/L_xrDAtykMI?t=709) > regular Frog pose with feet separated in line with the knees > Yoga squat/malasana > Corpse pose\n\nAll these stretches are the ones I found most useful in a routine. See what works for you and develop your own routine. Consistency is the most important. This long stretching routine may not be possible for you to complete regularly so make adjustments, but doing this routine at least 3 days a week is ideal. Stretches such as the yoga squat, supine hamstring stretch, hip flexor stretches, and wall stretches are vital and should be done most days to help relax the pelvic floor. For how long you should hold each stretch, just go by how you and your body feels. Really let go, breathe, and sink into every stretch. On rest days, doing some deep breathing in child’s pose, reclined bound angle pose, [flat on back while pulling knees apart](https://youtu.be/W23bSJzEhzE?t=728), and the happy baby wall pose is really great while trying to do gentle reverse kegels.\n\nYou can also work on more individualized stretches for posture to correct anterior pelvic tilt, muscle imbalances, and to release other tight muscles, such as the upper body. Listen to your body if you need to give yourself a rest day from stretching. Adding in a 30-60 minute walk/swim on rest days is incredibly beneficial as well. Eventually, you can also try to learn isometric PNF stretching to incorporate it into some of the stretches such as the kneeling hip flexor stretch and hamstring stretch. \n\n\n**Exercises I recommend:**\n\nAfter working to relax and lengthen your pelvic floor through yoga and stretches, I would begin gentle body strengthening exercises that are pelvic floor safe. The pelvic floor is a master compensator. So, if the glutes, adductors, deep hip rotators, transversus abdominis, and other supportive muscles are weak, then the pelvic floor is in the prime position to pick up the slack which leads to a lot of strain on the pelvic floor which results in tightness and dysfunction. You need to strengthen the surrounding muscles to relieve tightness in the pelvic floor. This is where working with a pelvic floor therapist would be helpful to point out safe individualized exercises for you. Yoga will help strengthen your muscles in a safe way too. \n\n\nThe glutes and transversus abdominis in particular are very important to strengthen. Glute bridge, single glute bridge, side lying leg raises, lateral band walks can help build up glute strength. Deadbugs, [Bird Dog](https://mdkphysio.com/exercises/bird-dog-series/), 8- point planks, or planks with pelvic floor-friendly modifications, can help to strengthen the transversus abdominis (TVA). Abdominal work may be triggering to your pelvic floor symptoms, especially the 8 point plank, so you can instead look into [hypopressive exercises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYMezjFpmVo&ab_channel=HypopressiveswithAlice) to work the TVA without overworking the pelvic floor. These exercises will help you bring more awareness to your breathing, diaphragm, TVA, and pelvic floor which are all important for recovery. [Here is how to find and become aware of the TVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8O04WLXFt8&ab_channel=PhysicalTherapyNation). Do side planks for your oblique ab muscles.\n\n\nFor hip/abductors do the [side lying hip abduction exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxWissvKVj0), fire hydrants, and the shinbox lunge. For the adductors, do Copenhagen adductor exercise, cossack squats, and an [exercise where you squeeze a soft ball between the knees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaDL_zBnFlY&ab_channel=JamesDunne) just don’t do any crunch movements with pelvic floor issues. For hamstrings, Nordic hamstring curl/glute ham raises, and single leg bridge. For the back, do supine pelvic tilt. One person even reported that dorsiflexion exercises and stretches were one important element to solve his pelvic floor issues; this is most likely because the ankle bone, like everything else including even our jaw, is connected to the pelvic floor.  \n\n\nLike with anything, do all these exercises in moderation and stop if you sense your pelvic floor is not responding well to them - do them one at a time to see which ones your pelvic floor can handle for now. [Here is an exercise routine from another poster that has helped many people](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hard_Flaccid_Syndrome/comments/o27zmh/instense_hfcppsed_routine_3rd_edition/). Just be careful of the ab exercises such as the ab wheel and 5 minute planks with your pelvic floor issues - don’t over do it or avoid it if they cause too many symptoms. \n\n\nMyofascial release and foam rolling to release trigger points also helps a lot of people to relax their pelvic floor muscles and improve blood flow. The glutes are the most important area to target for pelvic floor issues when foam rolling in my experience if you only had limited time. Using a soft ball to lay on and breathe deeply can help release trigger points in the abdominal muscles and psoas which can help you breathe better and relax the pelvic floor. I haven’t done it, but you can also try out a massage gun for myofascial release; just be careful and don’t use it in sensitive pelvic areas. Some men and women also report success using a therawand to release internal trigger points that are causing them pelvic floor dysfunction symptoms.\n\n\nWalking and swimming for 30-60 minutes are some of the best exercises to lengthen, relax, stretch, and release your pelvic floor, boost blood flow, and help to retain and build strength in muscles that give support to the pelvic floor. Walk or swim for 5+ days a week for the best results. The breaststroke and freestyle are very helpful for pelvic floor sufferers. Along with swimming, people also use an elliptical at a low resistance to help provide a cardio workout that is safer for your pelvic floor. \n\n\nFix your posture. Pelvic floor issues and hard flaccid syndrome are closely associated with Anterior Pelvic Tilt and other postural issues. Get evaluated by a physical therapist so that they can give you exercises and stretches to fix it. You could also look into the Postural Restoration institute and see one of their providers and try to implement some of their exercises. In the meantime, [here is one video playlist on how to fix APT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O-pnhwqReE&list=PLfKNSz5BBcBG2Ah4uY99nl-oPD0cUApXv&index=1). Another [video to fix APT says to stretch the hip flexors, lower back, while focusing on strengthening the abs, glutes, and hamstrings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-CrEi0ymMg). Make sure that you sit and walk with good posture - [watch this to learn how to walk correctly - activate your glutes during each step and push off with your back foot!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fD2TSL2s7I&ab_channel=RehabandRevive). I also recommend getting a standing desk to try to avoid sitting for long periods of time. \n\n\nWeight training can be effective for boosting active androgen receptors in the body to increase  testosterone and DHT levels. However, you need to make sure that it isn’t making your pelvic floor symptoms worse which defeats the purpose. If you are going to lift weights with pelvic floor issues, don’t lift heavy, do any intensive ab workouts, or any other exercises that can put extra strain on your pelvic floor. Do lifts where you can sit down instead of standing up. Start with yoga, stretching, and gentle body exercises to relax your pelvic floor and strengthen surrounding muscles before incorporating consistent weight training. I highly recommend, however, just sticking with yoga and pelvic floor safe body weight exercises to build strength instead. Remember to see a pelvic floor therapist to get evaluated first before starting any weight lifting.\n\n\nWork on your mental health. Anxiety can worsen pelvic floor issues. Just as dogs tuck and tense their tails when stressed, we tense our pelvic floors which are directly connected to our tailbone where we used to have tails ourselves in our evolutionary history. As we are impacted by sexual dysfunction and pelvic floor dysfunction symptoms, we become anxious along with other negative emotions which leads to more pelvic floor tension symptoms due to the fight or flight mode response causing even more anxiety leading to more symptoms. It is a vicious cycle that needs to break by not becoming anxious and negative when we experience pelvic floor symptoms or hard flaccid and instead let go, accept, and realize that it is a normal process when trying to heal because sometimes our muscles that are used to that tightness don't want to let go of the tension we hold in our pelvic floors. Daily yoga, meditation, stretching, and walking will help with anxiety. I would also see a mental health therapist because all of these issues are deeply traumatic and we cannot go through this alone. We often hold tension in the form of emotions and trauma in our bodies, especially our pelvic floor and genital areas. By openly talking about these issues with a therapist, it will help us process and release our emotions and trauma that we are holding inside our bodies to improve our anxiety, relax our pelvic floor, and to let go of all of our tension. Many people who healed their hard flaccid and pelvic floor issues said that solving their anxiety and negative thoughts by talking to a mental health counselor was vital in recovery. The mind-body connection is so powerful, and it directly impacts our pelvic floor. Those who are stuck in the cycle of experiencing pelvic floor symptoms leading to anxiety and negative thoughts will also benefit from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy you can do by yourself [like in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VIL1L_ypMg&ab_channel=BarbaraHeffernan) or preferably with a trained therapist. Here is an [informative mini lecture on how stress impacts the pelvic floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6tvUoDh8V8&ab_channel=Dr.Bri%27sVibrantPelvicHealth).\n\n\nI would also definitely go on a healthy anti-inflammatory diet. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, marijuana, and other substances. Avoid foods and liquids that can trigger pelvic floor inflammation such as highly acidic fruits and veggies, carbonated beverages, very spicy foods, and artificial sugars. To maintain a healthy gut to reduce inflammation in your body I recommend trying a [low-histamine probiotic supplement](https://www.factvsfitness.com/blogs/news/probiotics-histamine-intolerance) along with eating healthy. You should also work on preventing or fixing constipation; eat a lot of soluble fiber to not get constipated - take a supplement such as metamucil if you have to. Check the [Bristol stool shape chart](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/bristol-stool-scale#stool-types) to identify if you are constipated because even mild constipation can contribute to pelvic floor tension. This is because the constipation leads to a lot of pressure being put on your rectum and pelvic floor leading to the muscles becoming weak and dysfunctional. I am willing to bet many of you are constipated and don’t know it because it isn’t just whether you go regularly, it is also how your stool is shaped. People with pelvic floor disorders are at a high risk of constipation which makes their tension and dysfunction worse which then worsens the constipation, another cycle to fix. I recommend getting a Squatty Potty to reduce strain on the pelvic floor during elimination.\n\n\n**Sexual health advice:**\n\n[This is a good reddit guide on how to reverse kegel](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrematureEjaculation/comments/xvor8y/reverse_kegels_guide/). \n\n\nHowever, I will also give a shot at explaining how to reverse kegel because it is one of the most confusing things for people about this healing pelvic floor issues, and many people unfortunately do it wrong. This is why visiting a pelvic floor therapist would be helpful.\n\n\nIf you know how to do a kegel, the reverse kegel is the opposite feeling of that. I describe the kegel as a pull feeling, while the reverse kegel is a pushing out feeling. The reverse kegel helps to lengthen the pelvic floor through the front using the penis (front rk) and the back (back rk) using the perineum behind the testicles near the anus, but not the anus itself. I learned to reverse kegel by diaphragmatically breathing down into the belly and pelvic floor. On the inhale, inflate your diaphragm and belly, breathe down into your pelvic floor area and feel a gentle pushing movement out the front of the penis and out the back of the perineum. You can then gently release this pushing feeling on the exhale. Never force any movements - it should be a gentle process guided by the diaphragmatic breath. You can also try to do the front rk and back rk separately to try to concentrate on each better. To give another perspective, one person described the reverse kegel as like blowing up a balloon in the whole front area between the perineum and pubic bone inside out - so to me this means blowing up the balloon with your diaphragmatic breath into your pelvic floor and making a pushing feeling out the front of the penis and out the back of the perineum. You should also reverse kegel during sexual activities to help keep your pelvic floor relaxed and prevent involuntary kegels that lead to a tight, imbalanced pelvic floor and premature ejaculation. Reverse kegeling when erect may be difficult at first, but it will become easier to understand during sexual stimulation when you get the feeling of wanting to involuntary kegel, but doing the opposite of that and gently doing the push feeling through the front reverse kegel. \n\nI would stay away from regular kegels when dealing with pelvic floor and hard flaccid issues - it will only lead to contraction and tightening. The kegel (BC) muscle works plenty involuntarily on its own without us needing to exercise them. Once again, the reverse kegel helps to counterbalance the pelvic floor that has been overusing regular kegels leading to hypertonic pelvic floor dysfunction. Positions that I am most able to feel the reverse kegel the most in are the wall happy baby pose, [lying flat on my back while spreading my knees apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W23bSJzEhzE&t=728s&ab_channel=Dr.MelissaOleson), child’s pose, and the yoga/malasana squat. Do not be discouraged if you have no awareness of your pelvic floor or the concept of reverse kegeling just yet. Your pelvic floor is tight and dysfunctional giving you little to no feeling of the proper movements. Once your pelvic floor becomes relaxed and lengthened through pelvic floor stretches, you will have an easier time gaining awareness. Learning how to reverse kegel is often the hardest part of recovery for men. It may take many months, so have patience with your body while it is healing. \n\nTo help heal pelvic floor and hard flaccid issues, never watch pornography again (this is vital). Go on NoFap for 90+ days to help heal your brain and body from any unhealthy pornography and sexual habits you have partaken in. Pornography leads to involuntary kegels, a tight pelvic floor, desensitizes you, and messes up the dopamine and arousal circuitry in your brain. Don’t climax too often. Use lube and a very gentle gliding motion if you are going to self-pleasure, no more tugging on your penis that is then pulling on your pelvic floor muscles, and avoid masturbation positions that puts you into an anterior pelvic tilt - stick to neutral/posterior pelvic tilt positions. Sex is much healthier compared to masturbation for the penis and pelvic floor muscles because the head of the penis is stimulated by the vaginal walls which creates a reflex that helps activate the ischiocavernosus (IC) muscle, which is vital for erection health and is likely in a contracted state causing hard flaccid - [thank you to this thread for this information](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hard_Flaccid/comments/jlyv22/in_this_post_i_will_write_my_theory_about_hard/). If you do have a partner, only climax through sex. Make sure you have proper erection quality during sexual activities - take supplements or medications if you have to. Climaxing flaccid or semi-flaccid is what causes many people to develop hard flaccid and pelvic floor issues in the first place. This is likely due to a complicated process of the IC muscle being improperly activated due to flaccidity during climax leading to a cramping of the muscle leading to hard flaccid and causing dysfunction across the pelvic floor muscles causing a cascade of inflammation. Only partake in sexual activities when you have relaxed your pelvic floor enough through stretching and the rest of the techniques. Again, I do recommend abstaining from masturbation as long as possible while healing and preferably after as well. \n\nRemember that you are not alone. So many people have pelvic tension, muscle imbalances, sexual deficits, posture issues without realizing it and never will heal due to their lack of awareness. Since we now have the great gift of awareness over our issues, we can start to heal our whole body and minds to become healthier than ever before, including our pelvic floor! Everyone’s journey is different due to our unique bodies and needs so that is why I gave you all the information I had regarding stretching, strengthening, supplements, nutrition, mental health advice, etc. to empower you to form your own plan to heal.\n\nYou can and will heal. Stay strong and never give up. Thank you for reading.",

    "body": "I have **combination skin with an oily T-zone and dry acne prone cheeks laden with PIH**, an aftermath of 2020 and some wrong skincare choices. Since I am acne prone, I try to avoid perfume/fragrance, alcohol and essential oils in my products. \n\n*Processing img thx4k3izjnf61...*\n\nI have tried a bunch of sunscreens and these are the **best ones** I have settled on after a long 2 years of trial and error and time/money/effort invested. I have tried to include the swatches of all the four sunscreens and the white cast whereever it was possible (suncros) for the camera to capture. Lets begin.\n\nProduct Name: **Suncros Soft Matte Finish Gel, SPF 50, PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave\n\nAvailability in India: Easily Available in India, offline and online.\n\nIngredient list: Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nSunscreen type: Physical / Mineral \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zgtf9w6knf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0796b78286edcc7126df7421f34ae34c3ae1c7c8\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using this sunscreen since almost one year. I used to use UV Doux before this for as long as I can remember, but had to stop using it as my skin got really sensitive and I had damaged my skin barrier. \n\nYou definitely cannot use the recommended two fingers of sunscreen with this one as it gets really heavy and suffocating. I tried layering it in small amounts (maybe just one fingertip at a time), let that settle and then apply another fingertip. I could only do two fingertips with this one. It did work for my extremely sensitive skin at that time and miraculously it was even calming and healing for my active acne and the PIH post acne was really minimal. The texture is in between a cream and a gel as can be seen in the picture. I totally understand why people detest it so much, the heavy suffocating feeling is a put off. I am not going to lie, it is heavy, feels like a suffocating layer on your face and is uncomfortable but you get used to the feeling once you see that its actually working for your extremely sensitive skin when nothing else does. You have to properly blend it in, take a minute or two to actually spread it on the skin. I have tried to photograph the white cast this one gives immediately post application. but once it settles in 30 minutes or so, the white cast is almost negligible and gives a primer finish (I am NC 43-45 for reference). I don't use makeup so I don't know how it would perform under makeup. The reapplication is difficult. I blot my face a lil before I apply this and again it takes a while to settle which is irritating if you are out and about. I could never reapply this more than once. It is sweat proof, tested it in peak of summer. This is the only zinc oxide based sunscreen that did not dry out my cheeks. \n\nAll said and done, I can't seem to make it work as my stand alone sunscreen as two fingertip amount is just not going to cut it when you are on all sorts of actives. Hence, since I have healed my skin barrier now and can use chemical sunscreens again, I use it over my cheeks (an area where my PIH is the worst) layered over my chemical sunscreen, after it completely dries. It's the perfect sweet spot for me and helps with PIH.\n\nRepurchase Status: Holy Grail (HG). Already repurchased twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Bello Photostable Emugel Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Easily available offline and online.\n\nIngredient list:\n\nKey Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, Ethylhexyltriazone Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyltriazine, Diethyl amino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate.\n\nOther ingredients: Purified water, Dimethicone and Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl phosphate, Ceteth-10 phosphate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Myristyl Myristate, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic Triglyceride, Pentaerythirtyl distearate, Phenyl trimethicone, Vitamin E acetate, Carbomer copolymer, Disodium Edetate, Trolamine, Sodium polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Methyparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr24pvoaknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f726d323339bee404855990ab043e2a3b051acc2\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using it everyday since approximately 4 months. The texture is creamy and you have to work it in for like 2 minutes into the skin. Immediately post-application, the sunscreen feels greasy to touch and looks oily but it gets absorbed into the skin in about 10 minutes and leaves a dewy finish which never goes away. I really like the dewy healthy glow it gives me. I can actually use 2 finger amount of sunscreen and it doesn't leave a white cast on my dark skin tone. If it gets into your eyes, it does sting. I can assume that dry skinned people would loooooove this in the winters. If you are combination or oily, I feel you can completely skip the moisturiser step when using this in summers. Would be perfect for inclusion in a minimal routine in the AM. On reapplication, it does leave a little bit of white cast on the sides of the face where we tend to have the peach-fuzz which will go away with a little bit of rubbing. Overall, this is the best budget sunscreen easily available in India which doesn't make us look like we have dressed up for a meme.\n\nRepurchase Status: HG, WRP. Already repurchased thrice. I will be trying out Photostable Gold SPF 55 in the summer, maybe it will replace this one. If not, I will always come back to this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Biore UV Smooth Kids Milk Spf 50 PA++++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Availability is a serious issue. Used to get it from Dokodemo pre-pandemic. Haven't been able to source since.\n\nIngredient list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Glyceryl Behenate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Distearate, Sodium Acrylate/​Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Paraffin, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Ceresin, Isohexadecane, Arginine, Lauryl Methacrylate/​Sodium Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 80, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Dextrin Palmitate, Agar, Petrolatum, Succinic Acid, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, BHT.\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjsnx8acknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e3e74e3ba70e6471b63c4d83bd3d41c2e876eab\n\nExperience & opinion: I had been using it everyday in dry summer days. Where I live is not very humid and that's why I think this one works so well for me. The texture is very aptly described as milk since it feels like a thick emulsion and spreads into nothingness into the skin. I can use the recommended amount of sunscreen with this one and it doesn't leave a white cast at all. It gets absorbed into the skin within 2 minutes and leaves behind a comfortable breathable layer of moisture on your skin. It does not dry down matte. It doesn't irritate my eyes. Its just so perfect for my combination skin even on my oily T-zone in peak summer days.  Reapplication is such a breeze. I have reapplied it in a taxi, in my office, before a meeting without any downtime. I just absolutely love everything about this sunscreen except that I think it has been discontinued and I am crying over the loss of my only true HG sunscreen. If anyone from Biore is reading this, please accept my plea and bring this back into production!!!!!\n\nRepurchase Status: HG forever. Although on the look out yet again for something that would match this one's status!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **The Blessing Tree Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rant\n\nAvailability in India: Available on Amazon.\n\nIngredient list: \n\nKey Ingredients: Octyl Methoxy Cinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide.\n\nOther ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1, 3, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates /​ C10-30 Alkyl Acrylare Cross Polymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Sryngylidene Melonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside (and) Anhydroxylitol (and) Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume.  That was a task to type!!!!!\n\nSunscreen type: Hybrid\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52ec0gwdknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8dd848f71d4a3939aa1b3ea6f13df4428170a9b\n\nExperience & opinion: I have had this for around 1 1/2 years now. But I never had the courage to put it on my face due to the infamous \"perfume\" in the inci list as I had a compromised barrier and could tolerate only physical sunscreens. All said and done, this has served well as an excellent body sunscreen which doesn't break the bank and provides me excellent protection. It is non-greasy unlike the other body sunscreens on the market. The white cast disappears within 5-10 minutes and you are good to get dressed and head out of the house. I apply it on all the exposed areas of my body - neck, upper shoulders, arms, hands (I don't feel guilty reapplying it even with the frequent hand washing as its relatively affordable + acts as a moisturiser for me) and feet. \n\nHowever for the sake of this review, I mustered all the courage I had to try it on the face but alas it did not suit me and caused me CC's by evening. It spreads well, leaves a white cast on skin which disappears in about 5-10 minutes, although the white residue along the hairline just doesn't disappear. I had to rub it excessively, almost rubbed it out to get it out of my peach fuzz! The finish on this sunscreen is not ultra matte and nor is it dewy to touch, its almost in between which is comfortable for combination and oily skin types. I was worried that this might get drying on my cheeks as the day progressed due to the zinc oxide content but it did not get dried at all. While I was typing the inci list, I realised it has Niacinamide in it!!! Yet another amazing ingredient to be present in this sunscreen. All in all, I would say if you don't have sensitive/sensitized skin and are okay with the \"O\" sunscreen filters, this is an excellent sunscreen.  \n\nRepurchase Status: Might repurchase for body. Not suitable for my face.\n\nThis review took me almost a month to write and photograph, but I am ultimately happy with the final write-up. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this! I have tried to include everything based on the rules of this sub, but still if you have any questions, do hit me up.\n\nI will make another post of the sunscreens which didn't work for me and would include the likes of Cipla Rivela tint sunscreen, Hada Labo UV Perfect Gel, Skin Aqua UV Moisture Gel, Photostable Insta,  Aroma Magic Mineral Sunscreen and The Mom's Co. Mineral Based Sunscreen.",

    "body": "INTRO\nI have made a list of useful tips and information I have researched and tried out myself. This is specific to woman with genital herpes however some tips can be used for men and for cold sores. When I got diagnosed I was really sad and worried as imagine you are if you’re reading this. I just had my first outbreak and it’s now starting to heal, still very painful but I can see progress. Here’s what I have learned and recommend for everyone. \n\nESSENTIAL OILS 🍯\nYou will need a jar of raw coconut oil and some tea tree oil. Mix a few drops of tea tree oil with a tablespoon of coconut oil and apply to the affected area. This will NOT cause a UTI as they are natural organic oils. This will numb, soothe and cleanse the area as both products have antiseptic and antibacterial properties. I recommend doing this once a day as soon as you wake up. \n\nSALT BATHS 🧂\nYou may think salt will cause a sting, but it’s quite the opposite. Run a shallow bath with warm water and sprinkle table salt into the bath, sit down and soak for 15 minutes. Salt is a natural healer and it also removes the sting from the sores. \n\nDRINK WATER 🥤\nWhen you have an outbreak it really burns to pee. If you drink water and water only, it means your pee will be very diluted and will not burn as bad.\n\nCUP OF SALT WATER 🚰\nEvery time you pee, bring a large cup with 1 tablespoon of salt water to the toilet. As you pee, tip the water onto the vagina, this stops the sting while you pee and the extra water directs the pee away from the sores. \n\nANTI VIRALS 💊\nYour doctor or gyno can prescribe antiviral pills which will prevent futher out breaks and help clear up the initial one. \n\nPAIN KILLERS 🩹\n(Consult your doctor first and read directions on the back of the box) \nYou can take 2 500mg paracetamol and 2 256mg ibuprofen at the same time every 4 hours as the two drugs do not contain the same ingredients they dont react together. The combined strength of the two different pain killers will help you through the day. \n\nMULTIVITAMINS 🔬\nOutbreaks often occur when the immune system is compromised. Sometimes vitamins seem like a gimmick- but taking a  multivitamin containing zinc and vitamin B will help boost the immune system which will prevent outbreaks. Take one every day along with a meal.\n\nLYSINE 🧬\nLysine is a vitamin which can be taken several times a day, 1000mg-3000mg is recommended. Lysine works by blocking arginine which the virus requires to develop. Blocking this means it’s unlikely the sores will break out. You can take this every day, or you can take this when you feel an outbreak coming on. \n\nICE CUBES 🧊 \nWrap some ice in a cloth or bag and apply to the affected area. I recommend this before bed to numb the pain. Do NOT fall asleep with this on as you can damage the skin with ice burns. \n\nFRESH AIR 🌬\nThe herpes survive in moist warm environments. While you sleep, lay on your back with your legs open and underwear off. This helps the area to stay dry and cool, and will also reduce friction pain. \n\nRELAX 😌\nOutbreaks are triggered by stress, try to take some time off work where possible, take relaxing baths and eat your favourite food. Watch a funny movie and get plenty of sleep. Do anything you can to reduce stress and anxiety during or before an outbreak. Your life is not over, herpes in no big deal it just f*cking hurts lol. \n\nTHANKS everyone for reading and I really hope this helps people, I’ll list down below everything again if you want to screenshot this or put it in your notes :) \n\n- Essential oils; coconut oil, tea tree oil \n- Salt baths, soak for 15 mins\n- Drink water \n- Pour salt water while peeing\n- Take antivirals \n- Take painkillers \n- Take multivitamins \n- Take lysine \n- Ice cubes on affected area \n- Fresh air on affected area \n- Relax and don’t worry \n\n*bonus info* \n80% of people will get affected by herpes. Only around 10% will have symptoms. Most cases of herpes only affect you within the first 4 months to a year. After this your body builds up immunity and less outbreaks occur. Many people only get 1 initial outbreak then never see it again. Some people get one outbreak, then another 10 years later. I promise you’ll be fine and you will be loved exactly the same as before.\n\n(source - my gyno)",

I don’t know what it is, but I just vibe with that brand so much (except their sunscreens, which fall a bit short for me personally). I say this all the time, too, because I know people get so suspicious of comments on Reddit and people being paid plants or something, but I’m absolutely not affiliated with them at all! LOL Shit, I wish they supplied me with products! \n\nAnyway, Half & Half is my new favorite thing!! I’m really loving it. I do run oily, so I can use it alone during the day and be good. Or, I layer it under a heavier moisturizer at night just to amp up hydration and moisture. \n\nThe Multi Acid Milk Peel is interesting as well. I haven’t used it as frequently yet, since I just finished a procedure, so I’ve been pretty gentle and boring lately. But I do like it for a nice exfoliator. \n\nMulti-Quench I’ve been using for awhile and it’s great as well. But I think I love Half & Half better!

Been using these for a couple years). Now I’ve been using the Prequel on my face and body since January and plan on sticking with it. My skin looks and feels incredible. More hydrating than the DDG pads but still leaves that beautiful glow, pores are looking good, and my skin just looks nice and bouncy. AND it hasn’t irritated my rosacea (I also use Tret every other night). And for my body- no reappearance of KP on my legs or backs of arms, no booty acne, no ingrown hairs on my bikini line or underarms, knees and elbows are super soft, all of my skin texture in general is smooth af. And as long as it’s not crazy hot out, I can skip deodorant as long as I pat a bit of it under my arms. It’s light years better than the Ordinary acid\n\nAnd I was thinking about picking up these other two products.

This is the ONLY brightening serum I’ve tried that lightened my acne spots in a matter of 2-3 months rather than 1.5-2 years. I just finished my 3rd bottle last night, lol. Tryyying to go on a no buy for all of May, but if I start breaking out into new zits, I will 100% buy this to take care of the hyperpigmentation.\n\nI went through 1.5 bottles of the Inkey List Tranex Serum and saw zero results. My acne marks showed absolutely no change over the few months that I was using this. Then I went back to the Good Molecules, boom 2 weeks and the spots were basically gone. Also the texture of the Good Molecules is slightly thinner, and doesn’t make my moisturizer pill the way the Inkey List does.\n\nEdit: Another product with TXA is the Murad Replenishing Multi-Acid Peel. It’s a biphase acid toner with tranexamic, salicylic, glycolic, lactic, and malic acids. I don’t believe they disclose the % of any of the acids.\n\nEdit #2: I just saw your reasoning for not including the Murad on the list!",

However the Inkey List one sometimes causes my moisturizer to pill, which is annoying. I only use it at night, so it's less of an issue I guess!\n\nI was wavering between this one and the Good Molecules tranex serum. I'm betting (hoping) the Good Molecules formula has at least 2-3% tranexamic acid and probably 5% niacinamide. I'm also interested in the JJLabs formulas. A youtuber I follow knows the founder/chemist behind the brand and swears by some of his products, so I do think they are legit. I figure it's kind of like going to a compounding pharmacy to get a specific drug combination custom formulated for you, but instead it's skincare. I agree it's unusual.\n\nMy questions about tranexamic acid that I can't seem to find much on are the side effects - I was really worried if this would cause irritation because I'm sensitive to most acids (bha, aha, even ascorbic acid), so I didn't know if this would be something like hyaluronic acid or more like an exfoliating acid.

    "body": "I am 28 f and was previously very healthy and fit. I would like to preface this by saying that this is the second time I have recovered 100% from long covid - I had it from April to Nov of 2020, fully recovered from that, and then got long covid again from an Omicron infection in January of 2022 and suffered for almost the rest of the year. I was 25 when I got long covid for the first time. Both bouts my main symptom was debilitating fatigue/PEM leaving me housebound and unable to attend college. Now I am back in school, working my way through my last semester, and exercising without issue.\n\nWhat worked the first time I got long covid was purely time. There were certain supplements that helped somewhat based on correcting deficiencies (severe iron deficiency and mild vit D deficiency) but time was definitely the biggest factor. \n\nThe second time around, time was not as kind to me. I felt like I was mostly better about five months in, but I overdid it and crashed so badly that I spent the next six months in a horrible state totally couch bound, feeling like I could barely digest my food and struggling through each day. It was hell. I would describe the feeling as feeling like my muscles and whole body were just suffocating. I honestly fought through feeling like I wanted to die every day. \n\nI credit my recovery solely to pycnogenol. I didn't expect that to be the thing that brought me out of this - I read probably hundreds of scientific articles on long covid and chronic fatigue syndrome. I tried dozens of supplements over the last six months of my long haul - nattokinase, which ultimately didn't to anything for me, and lots of supplements targeted at the mitochondria that gave me marginal benefit but ultimately didn't significantly raise my energy levels. I tried COQ10, PQQ, vit B1, vit B2, vit B5, nicotinamide riboside, MCT oil, oxaloacetate, l-carnitine, and alpha lipoic acid. The ones that gave me some benefit were vit B1, oxaloacetate, alpha lipoic acid, and MCT oil. I also tried some anti - inflammatory and antioxidant supplements including glutathione, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and epicatechin. Those three also gave me some marginal benefit and I would guess that they helped my body deal with some of the oxidative stress caused by my metabolism basically not functioning for six months.\n\nThe reason why I say my metabolism wasn't functioning is because I really feel that the root of my issue was endothelial dysfunction in my small blood vessels, causing them to be so constricted that barely any blood was making its way to my tissues. This was found in a couple long covid studies of people with similar symptoms to mine. If blood can't make it to your tissues, it can't deliver oxygen or sugar in high enough quantities and your mitochondria can't function at nearly the rate they usually do. So basically your tissues are starving and you feel the need to rest all the time just to keep existing. This creates a ton of stress on the body and releases all kinds of free radicals, which would make the endothelial dysfunction even worse over time. \n\nPycnogenol is known to be good for blood vessel health, but what's so important about it is that it stimulates eNOS. This is what produces the nitric oxide in blood vessels, causing them to dilate. In endothelial dysfunction, the body doesn't produce enough nitric oxide. Without enough nitric oxide, the blood vessels will remain in an overly constricted state and the tissues won't get enough blood. L-arginine is something that people often try because it works similarly - eNOS turns it into nitric oxide, so giving the body more of it causes it to make more nitric oxide. I did try this first and it worked very well for me, but it also feeds viruses and I started to feel weirdly sick after taking it for a couple days. So pycnogenol was what I tried next and it was the best of both worlds.\n\nI started feeling better immediately after starting the pycnogenol. I first tried it around November 20th, 2022. It was literally a sensation of my tissues feeling like they were suddenly getting oxygen. I felt brain fog lift that I didn't even know I had. I went from being pushed in a wheelchair whenever I left the house to walking around large stores in the span of a month. My reconditioning was gradual and difficult, but the pycnogenol immediately eliminated my PEM and I never had a crash again. Reconditioning after a year of inactivity is no small task, but using a recumbent bike in the initial stages helped a lot. \n\nIn the few months since I started taking the pycnogenol, I have been on 2 hour long hikes, lots of walks, lifted weights a few times, and I ran my first straight mile today since the weather was nice. I am not back to my full strength quite yet, but with my total lack of PEM and crashes I'm comfortable saying I'm 100% recovered. I've regained my independence, being able to drive and walk long distances again. I'm back to doing chores and finishing college while looking to the next stage of my life. \n\nI'm still taking the pycnogenol, but I've started to skip certain days and feel that I may not need it as much anymore. I think this is at least partly due to the fact that I'm also on my second month of taking Endocalyx Pro (very expensive, but I think that this is probably really good for my endothelial function long term - it has to do with the endothelial glycocalyx so ask me about that if you want to know more). \n\nI know this was really long and it was kind of a deep dive into endothelial dysfunction so sorry if it was confusing. But a couple other people have told me that pycnogenol seemed to also help them a lot with their long covid fatigue, so I really wanted to present what I've learned in a way that will convey just how helpful I think it could be for others. If you have any questions about anything I'd be more than happy to answer - I basically made it my part time job to dive into the science behind all of this when I was sick, so I could explain certain aspects more in depth or point you to sources that put the info above in greater context.",

Thank you so much again and I wish you the best!\n\nShort version of my background story:\n\nI am 36 m infected in December of 2020. Struggled with loss of taste and smell, PEM, fatigue, muscle weakness, tinnitus, numbness of teeth, POTS, poor sleep, brain fog and most recently headaches. The headaches and general fatigue have been the most draining mentally and physically. The headaches started about nine months into LC. The migraines we brutal and pretty debilitating however the severe ones started to wane about 4 months later. It has been the persistent fatigue, head pressure, and come to realize now brain fog that have been the hardest to shake and really discouraging. I had tried numerous supplement regimes with little success. I was getting pretty down about it again and popped on reddit at 4 am to see if I could find some new direction. Found your post and ordered some pycnogenol that day. Waited until the weekend to start taking it but within hours I noticed a difference. I finally felt some relief. It felt as though the cloud just suddenly lifted. I began to think much more clearly and had energy back that I had not had for years. It felt as if my old self was back. I could also feel when it wore off and needed to take another dose. As with my experiences from before I didn't want to get my hopes up but after the first month it seemed to have been working. Now I've been doing this for a couple months now and there have been some ups and downs but am overall back to feeling in good health again. I realize it's going to be a long road yet, as  much as it feels like it went away overnight I also recognize that it doesn't go away overnight.",

    "body": "Eat adequate protein and take a multivitamin is something that sounds so basic, but most people I know (I’m in the MCAS cohort, and have friends with hEDS, CFS, long COVID, fibro) are not giving their body adequate raw materials for recovery and I thought it would be worth sharing some info since I spend en extraordinary amount of time holed up studying this stuff.\n\nWhile we all have had different triggers that caused our chronic-illness this advice applies universally(CFS, long covid, POTS, hEDS, MCAS, & fibro cousins too just to name a few) since it is foundational biology stuff.\n\nWithout trying to sound like a sales-pitch for big protein, I want to stress why this is so important.\n\nAmino acids are the building blocks of proteins and essential for the body to function and repair itself.  If your house is on fire you not only need to put out the fire but also have the adequate materials to rebuild.\n\nHospital nutrition guidelines:\n1.2-1.5g/kg (~0.55-0.68 g/lb) is the target for daily protein intake \n(https://www.espen.org/files/ESPEN-Guidelines/ESPEN_guideline_on_hospital_nutrition.pdf)\n\nIf you’ve never weighed or counted calories this is roughly a palm sized portion of chicken, Greek yogurt, whatever 3-4 times a day if you weigh 120 lbs.\n\nThis is the MINIMUM recommended protein intake to make sure your body has enough energy to fuel tissue repair, mitochondria, and immune cells, so you aren’t running on fumes.\n\nIf you are not getting enough, or having difficulty eating this much protein your body will struggle to heal. With inadequate protein intake the importance of taking a full 20-22 amino acids supplement (not just bcaa’s or essentials) so your body has enough of the right Legos to build everything it needs goes up significantly.\n\nSo now in groups with long covid (a great flashlight for things that also show up in other chronic illness) the amino acids lysine and leucine ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39929875/ ) are two that are drained the fastest and a shortage of these two aminos in particular affects all sorts of stuff contributing to POTS type symptoms, post exertion malaise, brain fog and more.\n\nNot only that but research shows more than half of vegan eaters are already low on these two (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0314889). So if you’re vegan it’s even more likely you might not have enough of the right Legos your body needs.\n\nAssuming you have this covered once you are getting enough amino acids there’s still the cofactors, which in our house analogy would be all the other tools needed to do the building, manage, and cleanup the construction site. These can largely be covered by a multivitamin with one caveat.\n\nThe b vitamins, especially methylated forms are especially important for many because certain relatively common gene mutations (MTHFR C677T and A1298C) cause a bottleneck for your body using regular b vitamins which means you can’t keep up with clearing improperly folded proteins which contributes to systemic inflammation.\n\nSo ideally you want the active forms P-5-P (B6) R-5-P (B2) 5-MTHF (B9) Methyl-B12\n\nOther cofactors include magnesium zinc copper selenium etc (basically take your multivitamin and pay a little extra for the methylated versions of the b vitamins if you want to be safe).\n\nNow this alone is not a magic healing bullet, but it will help to eliminate a very important bottleneck that will make everything else you stack on top of it have a better chance of working. Necessary, but not itself sufficient.\n\nTLDR eat enough protein or supplement with aminos and a methylated b multivitamin or you’re making whatever else you do less likely to work from the ground floor up.\n\nI hope this helps. I’ve got plenty more if people are interested but gotta start with the basics.\n\nEdit: gut, liver, kidney problems? Ask doctor about Ketosteril if you aren’t already on it. Essentially bulk of the nitrogen’s have been snipped off a bunch of the amino acid molecules so they don’t cause your body to dump more ammonia or urea to into your system.\n\n(My intuition says you’d probably see significant benefits just supplementing lysine lucine and maybe carnitine (better than arginine probably) too but I’ll have to double check all this to be sure)\n\nFor vitamins if the digestion is a problem an option might be transdermal vitamin patches. I’ve never used but I learned of their existence recently. Here’s a study you can use any search engine to find some companies. I’d love feedback if anyone has experience.\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8318979/\n\n(Apparently physician-compounded liposomal creams exist too with better efficacy)",

I think so many of us have gotten the 'you should eat better' from our environment, with it often sounding judgemental or at least unhelpful, but the specifics you've written down are very useful to me! /gen\n\nI ate vegetarian for a long time, with periods of flexitarian inbetween and after a big decrease in energy due to PEM a few months ago, I switched back from veggie to eating meat and mainly chicken again and I noticed a significant change in my wellbeing. As hard as it is for me to accept right now, because on moral grounds I'd love to be vegetarian or vegan, the intake of plant-based protein is too much of an effort for me to plan into my diet right now.",

    "body": "Okay, you clicked, no hiding the cheese, it's Berberine. That's right, a supplement probably most of you know all about. You probably know it for its blood sugar lowering effects and other metabolic health improvements that it can bring, but read on to find out exactly how it downregulates PDE5 expression, why this is different from inhibiting PDE5 activity (what Tadalafil, Sildenafil and so on do) and how to actually use it to reap these benefits.\n\n***First a quick recap of Berberine’s clinically proven benefits*** \n\n# 1. Blood Sugar Control and Diabetes\n\nBerberine activates **AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)**, a key enzyme involved in regulating glucose metabolism. This leads to improved insulin sensitivity, enhanced glucose uptake by cells, and reduced glucose production in the liver.\n\n# 2. Improving Cholesterol and Heart Health\n\nIt increases the expression of LDL receptors in the liver, promoting the clearance of **LDL** from the bloodstream. It also improves **triglyceride** levels and may raise **HDL** \n\n# 3. Weight Loss and Metabolism\n\nThrough its activation of AMPK, berberine improves metabolic efficiency, enhances fat burning, and reduces fat storage. It also reduces insulin resistance, which is linked to weight gain and metabolic disturbances.\n\n# 4. Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant Properties\n\nBerberine suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduces oxidative damage by neutralizing free radicals. It modulates several pathways, including **NF-kB**, which plays a central role in inflammation.\n\n# 5. Gut Health and Antimicrobial Effects\n\nIt is effective against a range of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. It can also restore balance in the gut microbiome, improving digestive health and reducing symptoms of infections like diarrhea.\n\n# 6. Liver Health and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)\n\nBerberine reduces fat accumulation in the liver by improving lipid metabolism and reducing insulin resistance. It also exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that help prevent liver damage.\n\n# 7. Cancer Research\n\nIt has been shown to inhibit the growth and spread of cancer cells by inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death), suppressing cell proliferation, and interfering with tumor-promoting pathways.\n\nI am not gonna link all the studies as it this not the main focus of the post\n\n***How does Berberine improves erectile function***\n\n# 1. PDE5 Inhibition\n\nAs we know **PDE5** breaks down cyclic guanosine monophosphate (**cGMP**), which is crucial for smooth muscle relaxation and blood flow to the penis. We are still not talking about the MAIN mechanism this post is dedicated to.\n\n# 2. PDE4 Inhibition\n\n**PDE4** regulates cyclic adenosine monophosphate (**cAMP**), which is another signaling molecule involved in smooth muscle relaxation. \n\n# 3. Inhibition of Arginase\n\n**Arginase** is an enzyme that breaks down **L-arginine**, the amino acid necessary for producing **nitric oxide (NO)**. By **inhibiting arginase**, berberine can boost L-arginine availability, leading to increased NO production and better erectile function.\n\n# 4. eNOS Activation (Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase)\n\n**eNOS** is the enzyme responsible for producing nitric oxide in blood vessels. Berberine enhances **eNOS activity**, boosting nitric oxide levels, improving endothelial function, and promoting the vasodilation needed for erections.\n\n# 5. Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) Enhancement\n\n**SOD** is an enzyme that reduces oxidative stress by neutralizing superoxide radicals. Berberine’s ability to boost SOD activity helps protect the endothelium from oxidative damage, improving overall vascular health and supporting better erectile function.\n\n# 6. ACE Inhibition (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme)\n\nBy **inhibiting ACE**, berberine reduces **angiotensin II** levels, a molecule that constricts blood vessels and raises blood pressure. ACE inhibition can improve vasodilation, reduce blood pressure, and enhance blood flow to the penis, contributing to better erections.\n\n# 7. Inhibition of SPHK1/S1P/S1PR2 Pathway\n\nThe **sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1)/sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)/S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2) pathway** is involved in vascular smooth muscle contraction and inflammation. By **inhibiting this pathway**, berberine can reduce excessive contraction of blood vessels, improve blood flow, and alleviate inflammation, all of which support erectile function.\n\n# 8. Inhibition of MAPK Pathway (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase)\n\nThe **MAPK pathway** is involved in cellular responses to stress and inflammation. By **inhibiting the MAPK pathway**, berberine can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, protect endothelial cells, and improve vascular health, which contributes to improved erections.\n\n# 9. eNOS mRNA expression Upregulation\n\nBerberine **upregulates eNOS mRNA expression** at transcription level\n\n**And most importantly….**\n\n# 10. PDE5 mRNA expression downregulation\n\n…which is what I want to talk about today. \n\n# [Effect of berberine on the mRNA expression of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in rat corpus cavernosum]\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15638014/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15638014/)\n\nBerberine has been found to downregulate the expression of PDE5 at the mRNA level, which means it reduces the transcription of the PDE5 gene, leading to decreased levels of the enzyme specifically in the corpus cavernosum (of rats, yes). \n\nHow is this different from directly inhibiting PDE5 enzyme activity by PDE5 inhibitors like sildenafil and tadalafil? They inhibit the enzyme **directly** leading to acute decrease of degradation of cGMP. Berberine reduces the expression of the gene encoding PDE5 at the transcriptional level. This means less PDE5 enzyme will be produced in the first place. \n\n***Differences between inhibiting the PDE5 enzyme directly and downregulating the mRNA expression***\n\n* **Onset:** Direct inhibition of the PDE5 enzyme has a fast onset taking minutes to hours for the effect to take place. Reducing the mRNA expression has a slow onset taking days and maybe several weeks\n* **Duration:** Temporary. The effect lasts for a few hours or longer (tadalafil for up to 36 hours), but once the drug is metabolized and excreted, PDE5 activity returns to normal levels. Reducing the mRNA expression has  long-term effects. They can last for days or even longer, as it affects the production of new PDE5 enzyme molecules, not just the activity of existing enzymes. As long the expression is being downregulated semi-regularly production of the enzyme will remain permanently low.\n\nSo, basically, taking Berberine will never have the acute, powerful effect of taking a PDE5 inhibitor, but taking it regularly, weeks on end, will actually reduce the production of the PDE5 enzymes. This will improve erections over time and will absolutely make PDE5 inhibitors hit harder when you take them. I have personally felt it and have even quantified it to an extent (more on that in future posts). Now, Berberine has also been shown to actually upregulate the eNOS mRNA expression in the rats' corpus cavernosum, so that's a double whammy. \n\n# Effect of berberine on the mRNA expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in rat corpus cavernosum\n\n[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02873556](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02873556)\n\nSimilar to the PDE5 analogy, it won't have the strong acute effect of taking something that upregulates eNOS activity on the spot, but over time, taking Berberine will actually allow your body to produce more of the eNOS enzyme, so you probably will need less of these eNOS promoters, or when you take them, they will actually hit harder. \n\nAnother interesting thing that I found is that **icariin, which you all know, also downregulates PDE5 mRNA expression**, which I find extremely peculiar for a few reasons. \n\n# Effect of icariin on cyclic GMP levels and on the mRNA expression of cGMP-binding cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE5) in penile cavernosum\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17120748/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17120748/)\n\nIcariin, the active ingredient of Horny Goat Weed (HGW) that has been heavily promoted as an erectogenic compound, is actually 82 times less potent than sildenafil. Yeah, that's right, it's that weak compared to pharmacological solutions, so there is no wonder that taking 1000 mg of HGW with 10% icariin, doesn't actually give you great erections, and for absolutely sure, it doesn't give them on its own, on the spot. It doesn't have this acute effect. Now, HGW has some other flavonoids and other components in itself that actually affect libido. So I would say taking HGW is actually a good strategy to affect the erections and libido. But even taking pure icariin doesn't have a potent effect. I have taken up to a few grams of icariin, and I still cannot say that when I take 80 times more of it than sildenafil that I am getting an equivalent reaction. For example, taking 1600 mg of icariin should be equal to 20 mg of sildenafil. I would say I still feel sildenafil is stronger at that dosage than 1600 mg of icariin. But the interesting thing is that taking HGW with icariin in it over time actually improves erections. I was always curious how it could improve erections if it's not powerful enough, so this is how it improves erections with prolonged use IMO.\n\n***Practical Applications*** \n\nTake 500 to 1500 milligrams of Berberine, divided into 2-3 doses. Based on the studies, this is a dose that should absolutely be clinically relevant. Take it for a few weeks at least, let's say two months. Ideally, if you don't have any problem taking it, you should just keep taking it. But after, let's say, a few weeks, you can assess if your erections have improved in some way or if you maybe now respond better to PDE5 inhibitors.\n\nBerberine’s **absorption is heavily limited by** \n\n* **P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) Efflux.** After oral administration, a significant portion of berberine that is absorbed by intestinal cells is pumped back into the intestinal lumen by P-gp, effectively reducing the amount that reaches systemic circulation\n* **Poor Passive Permeability.** Even without the action of P-gp, berberine has difficulty passing through the intestinal barrier due to its hydrophilic nature, further limiting how much of it enters the bloodstream.\n* **Extensive First-Pass Metabolism. B**erberine undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, where it is rapidly transformed into metabolites, including berberrubine and demethyleneberberine. While some of its metabolites might be bioactive, they may not have the same potency or activity as the parent compound.\n\n**How to remedy all that?**\n\n1. Inhibit P-gp and enhance absorption  -  **piperine** is perfect for that.  \n2. Use lipid based delivery systems like **liposomal Berberine or phytosome formulations** \n\n***Any drawbacks?***\n\nTaking Berberine could lead to gastrointestinal discomfort to some small percentage of people. You've maybe heard that Berberine is called nature's Metformin. Metformin is notorious for causing gastrointestinal issues. So if you've taken it, don't think Berberine is going to do the same. It's way milder. And also, there is a theory that if you're actually experiencing discomfort on Berberine, it might actually be correcting for something that is going on with your microbiome. This is totally unscientific as the microbiome is sort of an unknown universe still. But many people who take Berberine for SIBO for example experience this increased discomfort, which is known as the die-off period. This happens in the beginning of the course and is then usually followed by huge improvements. Another drawback is that Berberine, much like Metformin, lowers IGF-1 production. Not in the same magnitude as Metformin does, but it does lower it. So theoretically, it could make putting on muscle mass a bit harder. Not sure how relevant that is going to be, really. If you're someone who blames Berberine for not putting on muscle mass, I would probably bet you're not training hard enough. But hey, no judgment.\n\nThat’s it boys. I feel the effects. Others I have talked to feel them too. The worst case scenario nothing happens down there but you improve your blood sugar and lipid levels. Life could be way worse. \n\n====================================\n\nFor research I read daily and write-ups based on it - [https://discord.gg/q7qVZVCamp](https://discord.gg/R7uqKBwFf9)",

First hand experience taking berberine for about a decade, both on and off Anabolic/androgenic steroid compounds, I've noticed, pretty much Everytime, with my particular biology, (as I'm not the only one who has noticed in my industry) when taking berberine, there is a noticable increase and general noticeability that when taking berberine in the 750-1500mg range, most notably on lower carb diets, erections not only have more quality but seem to be more stable and enduring.

Nathan Wolfe dedicated his book \"Viral Storm\" to Israeli spy Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Gates and is BFF with Israeli spy Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nHere's the archived website for Ghislaine Maxwell's TerraMar company listing Nathan Wolfe and David de Rothschild as Founding Citizens: https://web.archive.org/web/20120715091022/https://theterramarproject.org/\n\nHere's the Nathan Wolfe biography from the University of Houston website (https://archive.is/NOoIZ) which confirms Wolfe works for DARPA, EcoHealth, and Bill Gates: \n\n>He has received research support totaling over $20 million in grants and contracts from the **Google.org, The Skoll Foundation, NIH, the National Science Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation**, the National Geographic Society, Merck Research Laboratories and various branches of the **U.S. Department of Defense, including: the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance & Response System (GEIS), HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP), and the U.S. Military HIV Research Program (USMHRP).** He has extensive consulting experience and has served on a number of advisory and editorial boards, including, since 2004, the editorial board of **EcoHealth** and since 2008, **DARPA's Defense Science Research Council (DSRC).**\n\nGood short documentary on Nathan Wolfe showing his Google-funded \"Global Viral\" company commissioned Wuhan Bat Lady Shi Zhengli to collect bat coronaviruses as early as 2013 for genetic engineering\nhttps://youtu.be/Q8UgtUtDDp8?si=rtVbLNeSElmDwTkz\n\nMe exposing Nathan Wolfe for creating COVID-19 on Alex Jones show: https://rum ble.com/v4tpk46-keeny-on-alex-jones-show-562019-round-2.html\n\nPresident Joe Biden's former stenographer Mike McCormick exposing Nathan Wolfe for creating COVID-19 on Alex Jones show a month after me: https://banned.\nvideo/watch?id=668c748b1c5e795c46db9ff3\n\n\"Did virus hunters cover up a lab leak?\" (Good article about the Global Virome Project headed by Nathan Wolfe and Peter Daszak and which began in a Rockefeller Foundation establishment)\nhttps://archive.is/G8Lp8\n\n\"Hunter Biden's Ukraine BioLab Partner (Nathan Wolfe) Was Partners With Ghislaine Maxwell\"\nhttps://archive.is/0BxQM\n\nProof \"The Global Virome Project\" was directed by Nathan Wolfe and Peter Daszak https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29472471/\n\n\n\n\nBill Gates 9/4/19 $55 million BioNTech mRNA vaxx creator investment: https://archive.is/IP0b9 \n\nElon/Grimes 9/4/19 tablet (🧫🧬🦠+💉💉💉=🛸): https://archive.is/s7kJT\n\nFormer EcoHealth VP Andrew Huff September 2019 DARPA weird job offer: https://twitter.com/AGHuff/status/1492249880546398215\n\nFormer EcoHealth VP Dr. Andrew Huff legal declaration confirming EcoHealth funded by Bill Gates and CIA (In-Q-Tel) and that Peter Daszak told him he was working with CIA: https://archive.is/iZL1N\n\n\n\"Redfield: COVID-19 Was in Wuhan in September or October 2019: Former CDC director also tells CNN that the virus likely escaped from a lab\" - https://archive.is/YsEui\n\n\"COVID-19 might have started to spread in September 2019 in the United States: study\"https://archive.is/NpOqY\n\n\n>On the 12th Sep 2019, the main database of samples and viral sequences of the Wuhan Institute of Virology went offline. Eventually every single of the 16 virus databases managed by the WIV was taken offline.\n\nhttps://archive.is/i79eW\n\n\n\n**Here's former CDC director Robert Redfield under oath before the Congress on Wuhan Lab September 2019 events:**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/aXXWRaM-sWQ?feature=share\n\n\n>I will say if you go back and look, it's declassified now, and I'm sure you all have your classified briefings, but the declassified information now: \n\n>In September of 2019, three things happened in that lab, one is they deleted the sequences, that was highly irregular, researchers don't usually like to do that\n\n>Second thing they did was they changed the command and control of the lab from the civilian control to the military control. Highly unusual, and I've been involved in dual use labs when I was in the military.\n\n\n>And the third thing they did which I think is really telling is they let a contractor redo the ventilation system in that laboratory. So I think  clearly there was strong evidence that there was a significant event that happened in that laboratory in September. It's now been declassified, you can read it. I'm sure there's more classified information around it.\n\n**Scientist Richard Ebright**\n\n>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction. And here is a proposal from the beginning of 2018 [from Fauci/Gates-funded EcoHealth Alliance] proposing explicitly to engineer that sequence at that position in chimeric lab- generated coronaviruses.\n\n- Richard Ebright, an eminent molecular biologist at Rutgers University, https://archive.is/cCBUw\n\n**Eminent Virologist David Baltimore of CalTech**\n\n>When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine [humanized] codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.\n\n- David Baltimore, an eminent virologist and former president of CalTech, https://archive.is/yalCe\n\n\n**Former CDC Director Robert Redfield:**\n\n>I was concerned because of the presence of the furin cleavage site that we've talked about and I think it's important to understand what that cleavage site does. That cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of COVID, so where before it could not see the ACE2 receptor which is the human receptor, it totally changes the orientation now so it has high affinity for human receptors. So that furin cleavage site bothered me, it didn't seem like it belonged there. \n\n>And then if you look at the sequences they use in those 12 nucleotides for arginine, where the arginine sequence nucleotide triplet were coded for humans. So why did it have the arginine coding for humans and not bat? It was very disconcerting to me. It looked like this virus was engineered.\n\n\n>It's not scientifically plausible that this virus went from a bat to humans and became one of the most infectious viruses that we have for humans.\n",

Climate: hot and humid (SC, USA).\n\n**Product info:** Japanese, SPF 50+ PA+++, free of alcohol, fragrance, essential oils, and niacinamide. Truly a milky texture. Combination sunscreen (meaning both mineral and chemical filters).\n\n**Ingredient list:** Cyclopentasiloxane, Water, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, BG, Diethylhexyl Succinate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Hydrated Silica, Lauryl PEG-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Lauroyl Lysine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Triethoxysilylethyl Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Hexyl Dimethicone, Methylparaben, EDTA-2Na, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Arginine, Bis-Ethylhexyl Hydroxydimethoxy Benzylmalonate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Acrylates Copolymer, CI 73360, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Talc, Ethanol, Iron Oxides, Tin Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Tocopherol, Mica \n\n**My experience with it:** This is the best SPF I've ever tried! I've tried quite a few in my search of the perfect SPF, and nothing has been able to beat this. No white cast on me. I've never experienced pilling or any sort of irritation from it. It wears beautifully under makeup. Easy to blend as it is a truly milky texture. This is truly fragrance free - smells like nothing to me. Natural finish on me but I've read some people have a matte finish with it. I have used this since January of this year (2023). \n\n**Potential con:** I've read some people anecdotally notice getting sun with this product. I haven't noticed this, but I honestly avoid the sun as much as possible. I'd love to hear from those who experience this!\n\n**A true con:** the wimpy size of the bottle. 40 mL is so small! Alas, I'll continue to repurchase. The price is affordable for me (\\~$11 a bottle).\n\n**Another SPF I also love:** Canmake Mermaid Skin UV Gel SPF 50+ PA++++.",

I’ve had good experiences with several Asian products. Most of which I become aware of in this group. There are a few serious YouTuber’s (one who is a derm in Houston) who breaks the ingredients down during her vids and is sensitive to those with sensitivities (ex- niacinmide). Her name is Dr.Dray. I recommend giving a listen. She also covers many Asian products both chemical, mineral & hybrid. She also puts links( to sites and stores and is not compensated). And this is big - She is very price conscious! \nNote: am not related or compensated for this shout out). \nHope this was sorta helpful for your information arsenal.",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?  You are probably more geared up than most to recommend?  Thanks again.  Bev",

    "body": "I posted in this subreddit about 5 months ago detailing my experience with fungal acne which you can [read for context](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/6ohgsx/discussion_fungal_acne_my_experience_and_how_i/) as well as lot more specifics regarding what it is and intro into how to treat it. Now that I'm almost 6 months from that initial breakout I thought it might be helpful to share my experiences with fungal acne since and my current routine.\n\nI have read experiences with some people who cured their bout of fungal acne in a couple days and never had any issues with it ever again. I have also heard about people where it takes months to resolve and have a constant struggle afterwards. I honestly have fallen somewhere in the middle.\n\nI would say I cleared up my first (huge) breakout of fungal acne in about 2 weeks (which I detail in the aforementioned post), and did not have any new resurgences as I stuck to a strict fungal-acne-safe routine. About 3 months after my huge breakout of fungal acne I decided it was time to start experimenting with products that weren't explicitly 'fungal acne safe' e.g. products with oils, polysorbates, etc. I wish I could tell you that my skin reacted great and I'm back to using every ingredient under the sun as I used to, but alas that was not my experience. At first I thought everything was on the up and up and my skin was 'back to normal' but after a couple weeks those telltale subdermal bumps all over my chin and jaw began rearing their ugly heads. Granted my skin's reaction was not as severe as it was with products with ferments in them (if you are fungal acne sensitive I would honestly recommend cutting out any products with ferments indefinitely, you don't even want to take the risk), but my skin was explicitly telling me it was not time to venture out yet so I reset my routine once again to be (almost completely) fungal acne safe.\n\nI've been using this routine for about 2 and half months now and my skin has been doing amazingly. Even as it has been transitioning into colder weather I have not found this routine to be too lacking in moisture or hydration, and any fungal acne has been kept at bay. Below I detail all the products I have been using on the daily that have been working very well for me, as well as some FA-safe masks that have been working wonders for me:\n\n- **CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**: A really great gentle cleanser, I go in quite heavy with acids so I find having a nice non-stripping cleanser is perfect for me. \n- **CosRx AHA (AM)**: Has been great in improving skin texture/scarring from past breakouts. \n- **Stridex pads (PM)**: Hands down the best BHA product I've ever tried - these have honestly been life-changing in terms of hormonal acne breakouts. I know some find these too drying so if you are more dry I would recommend the CosRx BHA Power Liquid (also FA safe).\n- **Hada Labo Gokujyon Lotion**: Do I even have to talk about this?\nAmazing hydrating toner, will do a couple layers of this when my skin is feeling extra dry!\n- **Sidmool Niaten Serum**: Has been amazing replacement to my Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence since they changed the formulation (grrr), has niacinamide and arbutin and has been great in helping fade PIH and PIE from past FA breakouts\n- **CosRx Snail 96 Essence**: I absolutely slather this stuff on my face and I love it. I find it very calming and hydrating, I will usually use just this and my Hada Labo in the morning under make-up\n- **CosRx Honey Overnight Mask**: This is not strictly FA safe (contains Arginine and Castor Oil) but for some reason my skin just loves this stuff, which I hypothesize is because Honey is amazing for FA. Super moisturizing but non-heavy which has been great as the weather gets colder.\n\n\n**Masks**\n\n- **Sulfur Masks (Sunday Riley or De La Cruz)**: Sulfur masks (and sulfur in general) are straight up amazing for acne in general and for fungal acne. I find these are amazing for keeping an emerging FA breakout at bay. I find the Sunday Riley Sulfur Mask slightly more effective personally but the De La Cruz one is about 7x less expensive so I would probably recommend that one.\n- **Queen Helene Mint Julep Mask**: a very simple (and cheap) clay mask with a bit of sulfur (can you tell I love the stuff?) and I find amazing for dealing with clogged pores and blackheads. Very strong mint smell though so if you don't like that smell or sensitive to fragrance I wouldn't pick this up.\n- **Manuka Honey**: great for soothing/moisturizing the skin if you need a pick-me-up the is anti-bacterial and anti-fungal\n- **TO AHA/BHA Peeling Solution**: Another product that is not strictly FA safe but I found my skin has been okay with. I use it every week and a half and this (along with daily AHA use) has completely re-texturized my skin which had been decimated from my aforementioned FA breakout.\n\nThe thing is, the reason most people get fungal acne is they have a sensitivity and predisposition for it in the first place, so even if you get rid of it for a time, that sensitivity still remains. That's why I would recommend being extremely careful with any non-FA-safe products that you use branching out if you have experienced FA, because you really don't want to poke that hibernating bear. That said, everyone's skin is different so maybe you will be good to go, but I think better safe than sorry.\n\nAnyway, sorry for this post being so long, but I would love to hear how other current or past FA sufferers are fairing in their own skincare journeys! Any recommendations that I haven't mentioned? Your own advice and experiences?",

Eventually every single of the 16 virus databases managed by the WIV was taken offline.\n\nhttps://archive.is/i79eW\n\n\n\n**Here's former CDC director Robert Redfield under oath before the Congress on Wuhan Lab September 2019 events:**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/aXXWRaM-sWQ?feature=share\n\n\n>I will say if you go back and look, it's declassified now, and I'm sure you all have your classified briefings, but the declassified information now: \n\n>In September of 2019, three things happened in that lab, one is they deleted the sequences, that was highly irregular, researchers don't usually like to do that\n\n>Second thing they did was they changed the command and control of the lab from the civilian control to the military control. Highly unusual, and I've been involved in dual use labs when I was in the military.\n\n\n>And the third thing they did which I think is really telling is they let a contractor redo the ventilation system in that laboratory. So I think  clearly there was strong evidence that there was a significant event that happened in that laboratory in September. It's now been declassified, you can read it. I'm sure there's more classified information around it.\n\n**Scientist Richard Ebright**\n\n>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction. And here is a proposal from the beginning of 2018 [from Fauci/Gates-funded EcoHealth Alliance] proposing explicitly to engineer that sequence at that position in chimeric lab- generated coronaviruses.\n\n- Richard Ebright, an eminent molecular biologist at Rutgers University, https://archive.is/cCBUw\n\n**Eminent Virologist David Baltimore of CalTech**\n\n>When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine [humanized] codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.\n\n- David Baltimore, an eminent virologist and former president of CalTech, https://archive.is/yalCe\n\n\n**Former CDC Director Robert Redfield:**\n\n>I was concerned because of the presence of the furin cleavage site that we've talked about and I think it's important to understand what that cleavage site does. That cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of COVID, so where before it could not see the ACE2 receptor which is the human receptor, it totally changes the orientation now so it has high affinity for human receptors. So that furin cleavage site bothered me, it didn't seem like it belonged there. \n\n>And then if you look at the sequences they use in those 12 nucleotides for arginine, where the arginine sequence nucleotide triplet were coded for humans. So why did it have the arginine coding for humans and not bat? It was very disconcerting to me. It looked like this virus was engineered.\n\n\n>It's not scientifically plausible that this virus went from a bat to humans and became one of the most infectious viruses that we have for humans. \n\n\n\n**Scientist Valentin Bruttel:**\n\n>I tried to raise awareness to this for a year now.\nWIV use BsaI and BsmBI/Esp3I sites before to make synthetic WIV1 variants.\nAnd exactly those sites appear in a \"silently introduced, perfect for synthetic assembly\" pattern in SARS2, but non of its nat. relatives.\n\n>seriously, what is the chance that exactly those type IIs restriction appear or disappear through random evolution in a Banal-20-52 like virus?\n5-6 precise mutations in 30000bp?\nabout 1 in 10^20!\nSARS2 is clearly synthetic!\n\n**Type Ils restriction sites prove a synthetic origin**\n\nSynthetic RNA viruses are assembled at the DNA level and later transcribed. 30,000 nucleotides cannot be synthesized in one go. These viruses are therefore assembled from smaller, 2- 8,000 nucleotide long pieces. Specific DNA restriction sites are often added to later reassemble the individual building blocks in the correct order. It is also technically possible to hide these interfaces (No See'em), but this was not done in the WIV.\n\nIn a 2017 paper, two very specific, particularly suitable type Ils restriction enzymes were used at the WIV. These have the advantage that they can produce different DNA overhangs (sticky ends), which are crucial for a correct assembly of the complete genome: Bsal and BsmBI.\n\nSARS2 shows a Bsal and BsmBI restriction site pattern which is ideal for assembling synthetic viruses and to later replace the spike protein or furin cleavage site.\n\nBsal and BsmBI restriction sites also exist in closely related viruses (Banal20-52, RaTG13), but these are distributed in such a way that an artificial virus could never be generated using the methods established at WIV 2018/19. \n\n**The probability that the required 5 synonymous mutations, which enable a synthetic assembly of SARS2, arose purely by chance is less than 1 in 10^20 or about as likely as winning the lottery jackpot 3 times in a row.**\n\nDr. Valentin Bruttel\n\nhttps://twitter.com/VBruttel/status/1566365635680124929?t=koDQ9poynY6I9qSchgQAnw&s=19",

    "body": "Apologies, long post!\n\nAs also shared in r/pots and r/dysautonomia \n\n*Disclaimer — this is my experience and not medical advice. Please always seek appropriate medical advice before attempting self treatment,*\n\nJust a mere month ago, I continued to tirelessly scour Reddit and every other resource I could find, desperately searching for a cure to the troubling condition that an alarmingly growing number of us are struggling with.\n\nIn that window of time since then, I've miraculously achieved a complete (and I hope sustained) recovery. Something that, despite my efforts over the past 1-2 years, felt impossible. I wanted to ensure that I shared my experience, in hope that it might help or at least give hope to others.\n\nIn terms of my condition, I found myself leaning toward, dare I say, long COVID, viral fatigue, and POTS. It felt nearly impossible to determine which, if any, or perhaps a combination, was truly responsible.\n\nMy symptoms were, cardiovascular deconditioning, exercise intolerance, PEM and orthostatic tachycardia and feeling hot in evening. Interesting my BP (despite feeling high) was always optimal. My biggest complaint was the orthostatic tachycardia that would see my heart rate rise from around 80 to 114+ on standing and would tire me out and make daily tasks feel impossibly exhausting! Recreational running would result in extremely poor recovery, activated SNS and often moderate PEM crashes — this was incredibly frustrating.\n\nI found healthcare in the UK to be inadequate, unable to offer meaningful help. Even private cardiologists would turn away POTS sufferers, viewing them as too much trouble. As a result, I became determined, not just to manage my conditions, but to beat them entirely.\n\nIt's hard to pin-point exactly was the primary success factor but I'm sure it was an accumulative combination of most of the things I tried, which I will try to detail below.\n\n**Early Interventions**\n\n*— management but little to no recovery.*\n\n* Beta-blockers were suggested to help manage my symptoms, but the standard Propranolol offered in the UK just didn’t cut it. Eventually, I was prescribed Bisoprolol, but what truly worked for me was Nebivolol 5 mg. I had to source it myself privately, as it could only be prescribed by approved specialists, mostly for heart failure. It’s absurd, considering Nebivolol is more effective and better tolerated than Propranolol. Regardless, taking it quickly promoted the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS), helped manage my heart rate, and even improved my sleep. In the end, I tapered off it, not wanting to rely on medication to simply mask the problem.\n* Vitamin B12, Methyl cobalamin injections to raise my levels from average to upper-high.\n* Daily supplement stack (highest-quality): Magnesium Complex, Methylated B-Vitamins, Vitamin D, Alpha GPC, EPA/DHA, Resveratrol, Quercetin, Curcumin Iron, Vitamin C, Electrolytes\n* Specialist supplements: Nattokinase (Fibrinolytic), NMN-H (new reduced form of NMN)\n\n**Break-through Interventions**\n\n*— within last 3 months that I saw improvements with.*\n\n* I underwent an iron infus (500 mg) privately, as after regularly checking my blood work, I noticed that despite supplementation, my ferritin levels had actually decreased slightly to 82 µg/L. My red blood cell parameters also remained low or suboptimal, considering my size and activity level (6'2\", 86 kg): HB 136 g/L, HCT 0.418 L/L, Count 4.42, MCV 94.4 fL, MCH 30.7 pg, MCHC 325 g/L, and RDW 14.6%. Although these values weren’t clinically low, I suspected that my body might be craving more ferritin, perhaps indicating a form of subclinical anaemia.\n* After reviewing various studies, I found that the sodium chloride recommendation for hypovolemic POTS was surprisingly high, around 3-6 g. The electrolyte tablets I was using only provided 200 mg, which was minimal in comparison. Since I sweat heavily during exercise, I suspected I wasn’t replenishing enough electrolytes. I began supplementing with table salt, taking a teaspoon at a time, which provided 2,300 mg of sodium. I also incorporated BCAA and pre-workout drinks (caffeine-free!) to add additional amino acids like arginine, citrulline, and beta-alanine.\n* I added in high quality Ubiquinol (high absorption CoQ10) to support mitochondrial activity.\n* I introduced Metformin 500 mg, cycling it only on non-workout days for associated benefits\n* I added in higher quality Zinc picolinate and also Copper.\n\nFollowing the interventions mentioned above, combined with consistent exercise, I began to see significant improvements over the course of 8+ weeks. I felt stronger and more capable while running, achieving Zone 2 stability much more easily. Recovery became more normal, with reduced post-run stress and a lower sustained heart rate. My resting heart rate has dropped to its lowest in years at 58 BPM, and my heart rate while upright is now as low as 75 BPM, which I find incredible.\n\nI’m now genuinely excited about my improved tolerance to running and look forward to reaching levels of performance I couldn’t achieve before. I believe that the increased exercise has played a crucial role in my recovery, conditioning my cardiovascular system and mitochondria in ways that were previously impossible\n\nHope this might help, or inspires others.\n\n— — edit — —\n\nI forgot to mention creatine , 5g daily. I think this was really important to me and provides cellular benefits. Look-up Chris Masterjohn’s ‘Your Cells are Starving for Creatine.\n\nAlso, GlyNAC supplement (Glycine and NAC). This promotes Glutathione.\n\nPotassium, as part of my electrolytes has good cardiac benefits and helps post exercise. \n\nTreadmill was crucial to help me maintain and control low intensity zone 2 steady state. Also with a chest strap HR monitor linked to my Garmin watch.\n\n— — edit — —\n\nI forgot about Trimethylglycine (TMG) too! That’s for methylation as part of Chris Masterjohn’s Methylation protocol.",

I saw positive effects pretty quickly in terms of fatigue and general activity tolerance, and have also noted that being able to exercise more is helping. I also had to get my mast cells more stabilized first before exercising, and have been on 3 H1 blockers per day for a while.\n\n\nI'm definitely not recovered, but I'm definitely a lot better than I was 6-7 months ago. \n\n\nNow I just have to see how badly I'm still affected by heat intolerance this summer....\n\n\nSo glad to hear of your success!",

        "body": "I am on Nebivolol and Guanfacine XR for my HyperPOTS and they help immensely. I can’t function without them.\n\nThere are many therapeutic options for POTS/OI dysautonomia, which often remain ignored by drs taking care of LC patients. \n\nFirst reason is likely that many will not fulfill criteria for POTS, while still having some of the Orthostatic intolerance type of dysautonomias, which are all underlined by the same pathological reaction to being upright, through inappropriate blood pooling in the lower part of the body and central hypovolemia, ie not enough blood returning to the heart => low preload => low stroke volume => brain hypoperfusion \n\nWhat differs between OI dysautonomias is the compensatory mechanism ANS employs to compensate for brain hypoperfusion in orthostasis. But therapy will remain similar for all OIs and one can consult POTS literature in spite of not having POTS, but OI dysautonomia.\n\nSecond reason why POTS/OI dysautonomias are unjustly ignored in the LC community is probably bc many of per se POTS/OI symptoms (such as orthostatic symptoms, unrefreshing sleep, fatigue, brain fog) are shoved under ME umbrella and given no treatment whatsoever. And while virtually all ME pts indeed have some form of OI dysautonomia, they’re often not given treatments bc they don’t fulfill POTS criteria.\n\nAnd this is criminal, bc it is POTS/OI treatments that can improve quality of life for LC/ME pts significantly.\n\nHere’s [a nice overview of current POTS/OI therapeutics](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-med-041818-011630;jsessionid=K2Tj3VVTgy43lWdTr-ydZaLEm91_E4k1v8hR2ps1.annurevlive-10-241-10-107) by one of the world’s leading POTS experts Satish R Raj. \n\nI also highly recommend [Dysautonomia International YT](https://youtube.com/@dysautonomiainternational?si=_tFIuSnB8FebIjM4) channel as a great resource. \n\np.s.: standard recommendation for salt intake for POTS is around 8-10grams of salt per day. I was afraid to take additional salt, as I have HyperPOTS and my BP spiked from 110/70 to 170/120 on tilt. Turns out that I need 8-15grams of additional salt per day + 4-6liters of water to keep my BP from falling, bc it’s BP falling due to hypovolemia that causes hyperadrenergic compensatory reaction with BP spike.",

        "body": "I would supplement with a wide variety of nutrients. Saturate your body with good food, lots of fats, good protein, stay away from processed carbs and gluten, and sugar even if it comes from fruit. Eggs are great. Blood tests are garbage for testing lots of nutrients but especially many minerals. Reason why is your blood is the last place typically a skewed mineral ratio will occur because it can kill you. So your body will leach nutrients from your tissues and organs and you will have chronic issues yet your blood will show you are fine. Also the body uses a combination of nutrients for zillions of enzymatic reactions in the body. So you may be low in iron but you might actually be deficient in copper because your body cant activate the process to utilize iron because it doesnt have the co factor. I would recommend taking a quality multi, take the fish oil but enough so that you get atleast a couple or more grams of omega 3s a day. Fish oil and omega 3s are not a 1:1 ratio. If it's the common fish oil it's only 300 mgs per cap. Take a trace mineral supplement, should be a liquid you add to water etc. Everything your taking is good but you wanna try and get everything in enough quantities so the body can balance everything out. Typically excess of a nutrient only occurs from the lack of its cofactors to utilize everything properly. Hope this helps. Good luck.",

        "body": "**Abstract**  \n_____  \nLong COVID, a condition characterized by symptom and/or sign persistence following an acute COVID-19 episode, is associated with reduced physical performance and endothelial dysfunction. Supplementation of l-arginine may improve endothelial and muscle function by stimulating nitric oxide synthesis. A single-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in adults aged between 20 and 60 years with persistent fatigue attending a post-acute COVID-19 outpatient clinic. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive twice-daily orally either a combination of 1.66 g l-arginine plus 500 mg liposomal vitamin C or a placebo for 28 days. The primary outcome was the distance walked on the 6 min walk test. Secondary outcomes were handgrip strength, flow-mediated dilation, and fatigue persistence. Fifty participants were randomized to receive either l-arginine plus vitamin C or a placebo. Forty-six participants (median (interquartile range) age 51 (14), 30 [65%] women), 23 per group, received the intervention to which they were allocated and completed the study. At 28 days, l-arginine plus vitamin C increased the 6 min walk distance (+30 (40.5) m; placebo: +0 (75) m, p = 0.001) and induced a greater improvement in handgrip strength (+3.4 (7.5) kg) compared with the placebo (+1 (6.6) kg, p = 0.03). The flow-mediated dilation was greater in the active group than in the placebo (14.3% (7.3) vs. 9.4% (5.8), p = 0.03). At 28 days, fatigue was reported by two participants in the active group (8.7%) and 21 in the placebo group (80.1%; p &lt; 0.0001). l-arginine plus vitamin C supplementation improved walking performance, muscle strength, endothelial function, and fatigue in adults with long COVID. This supplement may, therefore, be considered to restore physical performance and relieve persistent symptoms in this patient population.  \n  \n____  \n____  \n**Conflict of interest statement**  \nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest. The l-arginine plus vitamin C supplement and placebo were donated by Farmaceutici Damor, Naples, Italy. The supplier had no role in the design of the study; in the collection, analyses, or interpretation of the data; in the writing of the manuscript; or in the decision to publish the results.",

It seems somewhat promising but it's not a well-written or well-documented report - par for the course for an MDPI article published days after acceptance. \n\nThe groups looking at this specific formulation are a bit odd - tight knit group of Italian researchers, with drug always gifted by the company but no COIs declared. \n\nThe editor who handled this paper, Bruno Trimarco, declared he had no COIs in the [eCM trial of this formulation](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589-5370\\(21\\)00405-3), but the paper was [then corrected to declare he *did* have COIs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537022003662?via%3Dihub), including with the company providing the formulation. The company otherwise tout a patented wheat germ extract for wound healing (and this paper has some [dodginess with the figures](https://pubpeer.com/publications/CAAD76E23DDA05DEF0D15CD867A340)). Then, the primary contact listed on the trial record we are now discussing is the [Head of R&D at the company](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04947488). Not something you'd see if the company had just donated a trials-worth of drug. All of this COI stuff isn't necessarily a reason to discount the trial, but not being transparent about this is not a good start.\n\nDetails regarding trial conduct in the methods are a bit limited. They confuse IQR and SD when reporting the results and I can't get the p values they report. Statements like the below are confusing - I wish they'd explicitly describe who was masked to what in the methods.\n\n>Because a data safety monitoring board was not appointed, we opted for a single-blind approach to maximize participant safety. As mentioned earlier, to preserve the trial integrity, all outcome measures were assessed by investigators who were blind to the participant group assignment.\n\nAnd, why no DSMB?\n\nThere are some inconsistencies in the information in the NCT record versus the paper that could just be sloppyness, but would be good to see a proper protocol and SAP. The registration details are too vague, however. The primary endpoint is presented and analysed only as change from baseline, [which is inefficient.](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-1-6)",

Its cousin, the first SARS doesn't have it.\n\nIt's an old enemy that we have tried to address years ago because the Anthrax toxin also needs this Furin enzyme to be activated.\n\nSo far, the search for a molecule that could block this Furin enzyme hasn't been of much success. \n\nThe most potent compound is phenylacetyl-Arg-Val-Arg-4-amidinobenzylamide, which availability I am unaware of. The usable candidates list is scarce, most of them being large proteins that would need genetically modified bacteria to produce it (a long and expensive process), except for the only one readily accessible, the andrographolide family of molecules derived from de plant Andrographis Paniculata, which may be very useful either for weakening the virus by themselves or leading to the creation of new compounds.\n\nRead:\n>[Synthetic small molecule furin inhibitors derived from 2,5-dideoxystreptamine](https://www.pnas.org/content/103/52/19707)\n\nAnother substance is mentioned in the researches, called Agmatine (a chemical substance which is naturally created from the amino acid arginine), that seems to block Furin, but not with the same strength.\n\nThere are also some metallic compounds which have Zinc and Copper in their structure that have some Furin blocking abilities.\n\n>[Potent inhibitors of furin and furin-like proprotein convertases containing decarboxylated P1 arginine mimetics] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2834293/)",

The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing. A little bit on the heavier side so oily skin may not like it, but all the dry skinned people seemed to really, really love this. It's cheap, very hydrating, absorbs well. However, a few oily people said it takes a little bit to sink in for them.*\n\n[BIG](https://preview.redd.it/d2pcet1rc8731.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4fac533d2f3f52e206e338e85a10c33fc69df5)\n\nB I G\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. \\[Manyo Factory (Witch Factory)\\] Bifida Complex Ampoule - 4.21/5 (5,368 Reviews)**\n\n50ml/35,000 KRW\n\nBifida Ferment Lysate, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Fruit Ferment Filtrate, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Glycerin, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Caffeine, Hydrolyzed Algin, Red Ginseng Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Methyl Gluceth-20, Epigallocatechin Gallate.\n\n*This is a very popular product. This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things.

    "body": "After my recent posts about [recovering from PEM](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1k271r7/the_best_evidence_for_long_covid_no_more_pem/), [fixing my shortness of breath (mostly)](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1jdbmvd/this_9step_protocol_fixed_my_shortness_of_breath/), and the [dozens of different treatments I've tried](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1jb6xdg/ive_tried_25_treatments_for_long_covid_heres_what/) rated by effectiveness... I've received a lot of questions about my exact \"supplement protocol\".\n\nFor context, I've been dealing with long covid for 18+ months. After 6 months of hoping & praying for a recovery, but getting nowhere - I began rigorously researching & testing treatments to get my health back. Lots of discoveries were made between month 8-14, and the last months have been spent removing unnecessary things & refining my stack. I've been working out in the gym 5+ days a week for about 4-6 months now. Seeing consistent improvements, and even hitting new personal records this past week, out-lifting pre-covid 2023 me. Hope this helps.\n\n*Disclaimer: This is purely my personal experience, for entertainment purposes & should not be construed as medical advice.*\n\n\\---------\n\n**1) My Supplement Philosophy:**\n\nBefore I jump into my protocol, let me start off by saying that my approach to supplements seems to be very different from most other people on this subreddit.\n\nPersonally, I **do not** take supplements in search of instant *\"magical effects\"*.\n\nSupplements are simply **one** of the useful tools I use to slightly optimize my recovery. Not magic pills or cures.\n\nI view it the same as supplementing protein-powder after going to the gym...\n\n*Are you going to feel your muscles grow after drinking a single protein shake? Definitely not.*\n\n*How about after a month of protein shakes? Nope, still definitely not.*\n\nYet, we clearly know adequate protein intake is required for muscles-protein-synthesis (muscle growth), and over a long enough time frame.... the person who is consuming proper amounts of protein alongside proper progressive overload in their weight training sessions...  will see faster/greater performance improvements than the person who isn't.\n\nI believe the body can eventually heal itself (it does so for 90% of people who didn't develop long covid). So by providing proper nutrients & supplements that target the proper pathways - we can hopefully accelerate & kickstart our body's healing process.\n\n\\---------\n\n**2) Why I consider these supplements \"essential\":**\n\nOver the past 18ish months I've tested 100's of different supplements, many of which have come & gone....\n\nThere are only 2 qualifiers I follow to curate my protocol & decide which supplements I take.\n\n1. The science is extremely compelling (regardless of whether I feel it or not).\n2. OR, I actually feel the difference.\n\nThose are the 2 qualifiers for the following supplements in my protocol below.\n\n... and yes, I've tried many more supplements... but if the evidence isn't strong enough, AND I also don't feel a difference. Those get phased out.\n\nSo, the following list is ONLY comprised of supplements I believe have strong evidence targeting the underlying mechanics or Long Covid, OR have provided me a noticeable boost.\n\nTherefore, I consider all of these \"non negotiable\" and \"must have\" for optimizing my Long Covid recovery as quickly as possible.\n\n\\---------\n\n**3) My Long Covid Supplement Protocol:**\n\n*PS. The only supplements on this list that DO have noticeable immediate benefits are the Nootropics (moderate-high effects) & Mitochondrial Supplements (mild-moderate effects)*\n\n**a) Brain Function & Cognitive Enhancement (Nootropics):**\n\n* **Nicotine** (optional, but potent cognitive boost)\n* **CDP Choline (500mg)**\n* **Noopept** (10-20mg orally, or 1mg via Nasal Spray)\n* **Fish Oil** (High Dose, 4 Capsules Daily. 3-4grams EPA/DHA)\n\n>**Explainer:** Nicotine functions as a nootropic by acting on the cholinergic system which enhances cognition. Choline is a primary source of fuel for the brain which helps form short & long term memory. Noopept is a nootropic that increases acetylcholine signaling, increases the expression of BDNF and NGF, and protects from glutamate toxicity. Fish oil is one of the most well established & beneficial supplements, helping support healthy fats for the brain & support cell-membrane health.  \n**Studies:**  \n\\- [Is the post-COVID-19 syndrome a severe impairment of acetylcholine-orchestrated neuromodulation that responds to nicotine administration?](https://bioelecmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42234-023-00104-7)\\- [Nicotine and the nicotinic cholinergic system in COVID‐19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7436654/)  \n\\- [Neuroprotective effect of noopept](https://jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12929-014-0074-2)\\- [Noopept modulates persistent inflammation by effecting spinal microglia dependent BDNF throughout apoptotic process](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7895721/)\\- [Citicoline and COVID-19-Related Cognitive and Other Neurologic Complications](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782421/)  \n\\- [Long COVID – a critical disruption of cholinergic neurotransmission?](https://bioelecmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42234-025-00167-8)  \n\\- [Imbalanced Brain Neurochemicals in Long COVID and ME/CFS: A Preliminary Study Using MRI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000293432400216X)\n\n**b) Mitochondrial Support** *(helpful against PEM & fatigue)*\n\n* **CoQ10** (250-500mg)\n* **Methylene Blue** (10mg)\n* **PQQ** (20-40mg)\n* **NAD+** injected subcutaneously (50mg)\n* **Benfotiamine or TTFD** 100-200mg (B1)\n* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** (250-500mg)\n\n>**Explainer:** CoQ10 is a vital part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, playing a crucial role in ATP production (energy). Methylene Blue acts as an backup electron carrier in the mitochondrial transport chain, bypassing complex I & III dysfunction to improve ATP production (if you have dysfunctional mitochondria). PQQ stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis by activating PGC-1α, leading to creation of new, healthy mitochondria. NAD+ is another essential coenzyme in cellular metabolism, ATP production, & DNA repair. Vitamin B1 (Benfotiamine or TTFD) support the Krebs cycle by converting pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. Without B1, pyruvate accumulates and is shunted to lactate, impairing energy production and leading to fatigue and lactic acid buildup.  \n**Studies:**  \n\\- [Methylene blue as a mitochondrial enhancer and neuroprotector](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3740501/)\\- [Potential use of methylene blue in viral infections, including COVID-19](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32479530/)\\- [Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in post-viral fatigue syndromes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-30328-4)  \n\\- [NAD+ replenishment and chronic fatigue syndrome](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32179900/)\\- [Low-dose naltrexone and NAD+ for the treatment of patients with persistent fatigue symptoms after COVID-19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10862402/)  \n\\- [Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in Long Covid](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-30328-4)  \n\\- [PQQ enhances mitochondrial function and biogenesis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20147331/)\n\n**c) ATP Support** *(helpful against PEM & fatigue)*\n\n* **BCAA’s** 3-5grams\n* **L-Glutamine** 5grams\n* **L-Citrulline** Malate 5grams\n* **L-Arginine** 3grams\n* **Exogenous Ketones / BHB Salts** 3-5grams\n\n>**Explainer:** This powdered recovery drink cocktail is based of the promising research done for AXA1125 on Long Covid, showing improved recovery & fatigue scores. The ingredients listed above are ingredients needed to make AXA1125 at home. My personal twist is adding L-Citrulline & Ketones which I do find add extra benefits, especially the Ketones.  \n**Studies:**  \n\\- [Efficacy AXA1125 in fatigue-predominant long COVID: a single-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(23)00123-2/fulltext)\n\n**d) Sleep Optimization**\n\n* **Melatonin** (3mg)\n* **Magnesium L-Threonate** (200-300mg)\n\n>**Explainer:** Melatonin is a potent detoxifier for the brain. Personally I noticed improved sleep & mental clarity in the mornings with low-dose Melatonin (even though I thought I didn't have sleep issues prior). Mag L Threonate is a form of magnesium that passes the blood-brain-barrier, and can help increase synaptic plasticity in the brain, calm NMDA receptors, and reduce oxidative stress in the brain.  \n**Studies:**  \n\\- [Magnesium L-Threonate Improves Brain Cognitive Functions in Healthy Adults](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9786204/)  \n\\- [Magnesium-L-threonate improves sleep quality and daytime functioning in adults: A randomized controlled trial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590142724000193)  \n\\- [Melatonin in Mitochondria: Mitigating Clear and Present Dangers](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physiol.00034.2019)  \n\\- [The Case for Sunlight & Melatonin in COVID 19 Patients: Oxidative Stress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zzo4SJopcY&list=PLQ_IRFkDInv8Br1Xt12sJuLau8E1AllmS)\n\n**e) Basics**\n\n* **Vitamin D3 & K2** (10,000mg D3 + K2)\n* **Liposomal Vitamin C** (1,000mg)\n* **Zinc** (50mg)\n* **Vitamin E** (400iu)\n\n>**Explainer:** Vitamin D3 supports healthy immune system (taking it with K2 is essential). K2 helps the increased calcium from D3 supplementation get channeled to the right places (into your bones, instead of your arteries). Zinc & Vit C help immune function through T Cells & NK cells. Vitamin E helps promote cell-membrane health & works synergistically with the others listed here.\n\n**f) Methylation Support**\n\n* **TMG** (2-3grams)\n* **Methylfolate** (B9) 1,000mcg\n* **Methylcobalmin** (B12) 5,000mcg\n* **Pantethine (best) or Pantothenic Acid (cheaper)** (B5)\n* **Riboflavin** (B2)\n* **P-5-P** (B6)\n\n>**Explainer:** Methylation is one of the most important biochemical processes in your body - it controls everything from detox, DNA repair, and neurotransmitter balance to energy production and inflammation. 50% of people have impaired methylation genetics (I reccomend doing a DNA test to confirm this, mine showed slightly impaired methylation genetics - therefore the above are crucial part of my stack IMO).  \n**Studies:**  \n\\- [Blood DNA methylation in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC): a prospective cohort study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(24)00287-1/fulltext)  \n\\- [MTHFR and LC, CFS, POTS, MCAS, SIBO, EDS: Methylating the Alphabet](https://download.ssrn.com/23/08/12/ssrn_id4538852_code4147980.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEEkaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQDeiqRqndItSG2Hpxub96fVioZc1SEwdaSswFXvZndaGAIgfvTAJ%2Bq4jSKF47iTLY9QM6fsFbqSWcK%2FFdeOiLzo8lYqvQUIERAEGgwzMDg0NzUzMDEyNTciDAMTq%2FPFC6UqSUZoZSqaBeInjTP14MsmnvHAeq0FGChbtH0UVZ91YYRx9%2BBwWoGcbrIx1U%2Bs2YaUUBRUnVOtAxHG7EewCFa9uMUg21tsYojsGc0RPfT9kfavRLaL3e%2F%2F%2FxJiBIoQ2oxPxRHPcB%2FOIzCyhCiUpbI1%2FWURkYHdIJW24MTqX%2BS65D%2Ba6%2FMZZECnTC1jtWXAf3zyOFFLmaopsB6g8P%2B1xi9kyL5SmxrWjbIoQhSjpNsf5vLr0Z%2BhwMAt0qLc3Xa64cvGzyG2%2BlIZZ2drwS%2BWyojVNVf7Zx0%2FRVyqV7Vr9V821owCK%2F%2BEcE0R4zacxbNd0Uy01MAVKOkGOnnL4Bjp%2FM0d4x7OO41MZj%2BykZA%2FNjXuTe2k5dFs550mDgupCzRSSv%2FbpBNYMGefVVSoSJ%2BfaupZsH%2FVK0mklmaI0SiwdHXnPfvPK4HIn%2BUuivMUxwC76g50yoDZGDPPt5aVW2X6iYfx6J5mkqfsh6l6AhbLXkEh80Yn50OLN9B2qNs9L2WSFgleDkcD15X%2FM%2FHvrN9a6FR%2Bnck%2FMtlvvXuehI69ugAX3jSI7GL%2BgxRhGcWenUvcXEABbFIDNCl0CxDpFeB9UxP%2BygafUd2LlDhT1z4%2Fay2YQSrfnOGK7slHEFcv6SnZKlYPVE69FNuCTK4CJGWW3a3khKNYOcvwueciEKJ2nX6TtcrGH%2Bm7JIqBD91vSNPKT2wPRDmHUDy1MCk7hR%2F%2BcuZMsGMv3fOd1Ruqp9pNIAs0ncGb8g9HSBsJSHUtnhQEovZDseuYD8fwNBjhdJg6eZhIjqKbXs5VBbbld1E2oiA3H%2FLIbxjfxpNxIWJ3oK1Aqhw8Ng%2FkbimOfKaex81NFtNDF9j%2FNm%2Bv3Qii8tA8KS2j22vKYHEMpyw4sF3O3jvuY6RwRDCqgsbBBjqxAWQZAhbHuY9RlfDLOYAyDQrurBAxPr1P87TKYugcEEOabRFBrzvec5rbScXWYaYmh3Cng6scsa0erQOrvtSvj7FqnWnY%2BI7Hsc5oK%2BskCM5WdOrUceIJ0qskTlxqEQzwKjx1lZUx4hkCw6l5mBallg3dVRfLETGUgOWQJ4lva1916uBDZiaLDBglCdIbzGqKWkGX6BTt7kqbnfPQ9C44tow2HnZswr5Zsd1RKxah0biy0g%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250524T082925Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAUPUUPRWE2QDTE5JW%2F20250524%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=1a6634dab9e83ef217184cc7d38c435692f1a15d7744d8914465881c4bfcb964&abstractId=4495911)\n\n**g) Digestive Health** *(helpful if you have bloating or cramping)*\n\n* **Digestive Enzymes**\n\n>Explainer: Digestive enzymes help break down fats, carbs, protein, and lactose for improved digestion. Definitely beneficial during periods that digestion needs optimization.\n\n*That's it for my \"non-negotiable\" supplements. I will continue to take these for the next 1-2 years of my recovery journey.*\n\n\\---------\n\n**4) OPTIONAL ADD-ON'S:**\n\nHere are additional supplements I also occasionally take, but consider \"less essential\" than the ones I listed above for my protocol.\n\n* **Curcumin** (anti-inflammatory)\n* **Quercetin** (natural mast cell stabilizer, anti-histamine)\n* **Boswellia** (5-LOX inhibitor, reduces leukotrienes, anti-allergy)\n* **Sulforaphane** (Nrf2 activator, enhanced detox & epigenetics)\n* **Black Seed Oil** (anti-inflammatory)\n* **Palmitoylethanolamide / PEA** (anti-neuroinflammation)\n* **EGCG** (detox and antioxidant)\n* **Luteolin** (anti-inflammatory & theorized [spike protein detox](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37166054/))\n* **Lactoferrin** (iron pathway support)\n* **Liposomal Glutathione** (detox support)\n* **Liposomal PhosphatidylCholine** (cell membrane support)\n* **Calcium AKG** (Krebs cycle support, boost ATP, and mitochondrial energy)\n* **NAC** (Glutathione precursor, enhances detoxification)\n* **Milk Thistle** (liver detox support)\n* **Sodium Butyrate** (HDAC inhibitor / DNA support)\n* **Vitamin A** (Immune regulation)\n* **Larazotide** (Anti-zonulin peptide, repairs leaky gut)\n* **Probiotics** (Enhance microbiome & digestion)\n\n**5) Discontinued Supplements:**\n\nThese some supplements I found \"promising\" but didn't notice any benefit from and/or the science wasn't convincing enough to keep investing IMO. However, there are some anecdotal success stories from others in this forum, so it may still be worth trying these:\n\n* **Nattokinase / Lumbrokinase** (very promising, but lacked results for me).\n* **DAO Enzyme** (helpful for MCAS & histamine issues, which it turns out I don't have).\n* **NAG**\n* **Diosmin & Hesparidin**\n* **Apigenin**\n* **Resveratrol**\n* **Pterostilbene**\n* **Andrographis**\n* **Chinese Skullcap**\n* **Astaxanthin**\n* **DMG**\n* **Inosine**\n* **Shilajit**\n* **Forskolin**\n\n\\---------\n\n**6) Medications & Treatments (previous posts):**\n\n* View [all of the treatments I've tried (what worked).](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1jb6xdg/ive_tried_25_treatments_for_long_covid_heres_what/)\n* View [all of my current medications, testing, and long-covid hypothesis.](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1k271r7/the_best_evidence_for_long_covid_no_more_pem/)\n* View [the top treatments that have helped my shortness of breath.](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1jdbmvd/this_9step_protocol_fixed_my_shortness_of_breath/)\n\n\\---------\n\n**Final Thoughts;**\n\nLook, I get it - the time & money spent on protocols like this may sound excessive to some of you *(these supplements +* [*antihistamines*](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1jdbmvd/this_9step_protocol_fixed_my_shortness_of_breath/) *+* [*NAD+ injection*](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1jb6xdg/ive_tried_25_treatments_for_long_covid_heres_what/) *+* [*TRT*](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1k271r7/the_best_evidence_for_long_covid_no_more_pem/) *+* [*Prescriptions*](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1k271r7/the_best_evidence_for_long_covid_no_more_pem/) *isn't standard by any means).*\n\nBut for me, 12+ months of barely breathing, zero energy, and watching life pass by from my bed? That cost me everything.\n\n30 minutes a day sticking to this protocol & a few hundred bucks a month invested towards my health is a no-brainer for me (especially considering the alternative).\n\nMy protocol isn't perfect. But it took me from completely house-bound to hitting new PR’s in the gym again. From canceling plans with friends to actually showing up & enjoying the night. From wondering if my life was over, to having full confidence a complete recovery is on the horizon.\n\nI still can't do heavy sprints or intense cardio without consequences, but I'll take the weightlifting sessions, social life, and quality of life improvements as a solid win for now.\n\nFor me, health isn't an expense. It's simply the #1 most important thing in my life, and I'm literally willing to do anything to get it back.\n\nAnyways, this stack works for me... maybe it can help you too *(just do your own research & consult with your doctor).*\n\nWishing you health, wealth, and happiness - Julian\n\n\\---------\n\n*Disclaimer: I'm not a medical provider or practitioner.

That’s where the patience and determination is required.  It requires some research, experimentation, and time. \n\nThis is a great summary of what worked for you and a sound philosophy and approach. It may give some people some ideas to evaluate for themselves. I would encourage folks to take aspects of this philosophy to heart… results, for the most part, WILL NOT be fast. But there’s a good chance that at least a partial solution to improve things may lie in the right diet, lifestyle, and supplementation protocol that’s the right fit for each person’s particular needs. Will it be a “cure”, likely not. But can it improve things if approached in the right way, I think in many cases yes.",

You need only one (in this case e.g. Citrullinemalate) cause Citrulline is converted to Arginine in vivo.

    "body": "So this is personally what I did. I created mnemonics to categorize the amino acids by their characteristics of polarity, charge, and aromaticity first. I based these mnemonics off of the first letter codes, since the three letter codes are relatively easier to understand.\n\n**Nonpolar, nonaromatic**: GAV LIMP (think of a person named Gavin- Gav for short, and him Limping ig)\n\nG- Glycine, A- Alanine, V-Valine, L-Leucine, I-Isoleucine, M-Methionine, P-Proline\n\n**Nonpolar, aromatic**: WYF (pronounced wife)\n\nW-Tryptophan, Y-Tyrosine, F-Phenylalanine (Tyrosine is polar tho)\n\n**Polar, neutral:** HAT STaNQC (pronounced Hat stank). This is a little harder to understand but essentially I did it to make my self realize that the H (for hydroxyl group) corresponds with the first two a.a. (S&T), the A (for amide group) corresponds with the next two (N&Q), and the T (for thiol) corresponds with the last a.a. (C). It makes sense to me and helps me remember the different functional groups associated with them.\n\nH/S-Serine, H/T- Threonine, A/A-Asparagine, A/N- Glutamine, T/C-Cystine\n\n**Polar, acidic**: DE (pronounced \"duh\")\n\nD-Arpartic Acid, E-Glutamic Acid\n\n**Polar, basic**: KRusH (pronounced \"crush\")\n\nK-Lysine, R-Arginine, H-Histidine\n\nAfter separating them by their characteristics, I drew out their structure and made notes on their side chains. I noticed certain patterns between some amino acids, like Leucine has an iso-butyl side chain while Isoleucine has a sec-butyl side chain. Or that Phenylalanine is essentially the alanine amino acid with a phenyl group attached. Making these connections, along with writing what is in the side chain (ie: Serine has a side chain that starts off with a methyl group then has a hydroxyl group), helped me to memorize their individual structures. By simply making these connections off of the structures and writing what their side chain is, helped me memorize, and I drew them twice in order to have it permanently embedded in my mind. Now, whenever I see the 1 letter codes on the FLs, my mind automatically switches to the mnemonics, and what the a.a. structure was.",

Amino Acids are the fundamental building block of Biochemistry, I think it's worth it to spend more time in learning every aspect of the amino acid. Why is it basic? How basic is it? Is this amino acid branched? How would that change it's metabolism? This way helps you build up your problem solving and on the MCAT actually helps you notice the key details to focus on when reading a passage. Would also help you retain it longer because all of this biochem is gonna show up in med school as well and way more in depth.",

    "body": "12 Foods for Anti-Inflammatory Diet\n\n1. Berries\n\nBerries are small fruits that are packed with fiber, vitamins, and minerals.\n\nDozens of varieties exist. Some of the most common ones include:\n\nstrawberries\n\nblueberries\n\nraspberries\n\nblackberries\n\nBerries contain antioxidants called anthocyanins. These compounds have anti-inflammatory effects that may reduce your risk of disease.\n\nIn one study including 25 adults, those who consumed blueberry powder every day produced significantly more natural killer cells (NK cells) than those who did not consume the powder. These findings were similar to those of an older study.\n\nYour body naturally produces NK cells, and they help keep your immune system functioning properly.\n\nIn another study, adults with excess weight who ate strawberries had lower levels of certain inflammatory markers associated with heart disease than those who didn’t eat strawberries.\n\n2. Fatty fish\n\nFatty fish are a great source of protein and the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).\n\nAlthough all types of fish contain some omega-3 fatty acids, these fatty fish are among the best sources:\n\nsalmon\n\nsardines\n\nherring\n\nmackerel\n\nanchovies\n\nEPA and DHA help reduce inflammation, which may otherwise lead to metabolic syndrome, heart disease, diabetes, and kidney disease.\n\nYour body metabolizes these fatty acids into compounds called resolvins and protectins, which have anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nStudies have found that people consuming salmon or EPA and DHA supplements experienced reductions in the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP).\n\nHowever, in one study, people with an irregular heartbeat who took EPA and DHA daily experienced no difference in inflammatory markers compared with those who received a placebo.\n\n3. Broccoli\n\nBroccoli is extremely nutritious.\n\nIt’s a cruciferous vegetable, along with cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and kale.\n\nResearch has shown that eating a lot of cruciferous vegetables is associated with a decreased risk of heart disease and cancer.\n\nThis may be related to the anti-inflammatory effects of the antioxidants they contain.\n\nBroccoli is rich in sulforaphane, an antioxidant that decreases inflammation by reducing your levels of cytokines and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which are molecules that drive inflammation in your body.\n\n4. Avocados\n\nShare on \n\nAvocados are packed with potassium, magnesium, fiber, and heart-healthy monounsaturated fats.\n\nThey also contain carotenoids and tocopherols, which are linked to a reduced risk of cancer.\n\nIn addition, one compound in avocados may reduce inflammation in newly forming skin cells.\n\nIn one high quality study including 51 adults with excess weight, those who ate avocado for 12 weeks had a reduction of inflammatory markers interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and CRP.\n\n5. Green tea\n\nYou’ve probably heard that green tea is one of the healthiest beverages you can drink.\n\nResearch has found that drinking it is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, obesity, and other conditions.\n\nMany of its benefits are due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, especially a substance called epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).\n\nEGCG inhibits inflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and damage to the fatty acids in your cells.\n\nThe 5 Best Foods to Eat When You’re Sick\n\nUnder the weather? Though you may not be thinking about food, eating the right foods when sick can do much more than just give you energy.\n\n6. Peppers\n\nBell peppers and chili peppers are loaded with vitamin C and antioxidants that have powerful anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nBell peppers also provide the antioxidant quercetin, which may reduce inflammation associated with chronic diseases, like diabetes.\n\nChili peppers contain sinapic acid and ferulic acid, which may reduce inflammation and support healthier aging.\n\n7. Mushrooms\n\nWhile thousands of varieties of mushrooms exist worldwide, only a few are edible and grown commercially.\n\nThese include truffles, portobello mushrooms, and shiitake mushrooms.\n\nMushrooms are very low in calories and rich in selenium, copper, and all of the B vitamins.\n\nThey also contain phenols and other antioxidants that provide anti-inflammatory protection.\n\nA special type of mushroom called lion’s mane may potentially reduce low grade inflammation related to obesity.\n\nHowever, one study found that cooking mushrooms lowered their anti-inflammatory compounds significantly. Thus, it may be best to eat them raw or lightly cooked.\n\n8. Grapes\n\nShare on \n\nGrapes contain anthocyanins, which reduce inflammation.\n\nIn addition, they may decrease the risk of several diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer’s, and eye disorders.\n\nGrapes are also one of the best sources of resveratrol, another antioxidant compound that has many health benefits.\n\nStudies show that resveratrol can protect the heart against inflammation.\n\nIn one study including 60 people with heart failure, those who consumed two 50-mg capsules of resveratrol daily for 3 months experienced a decrease in inflammatory gene markers, including interleukin 6 (IL-6).\n\nAn older study from 2012 found that adults who ate grape extract daily experienced increased levels of adiponectin. Low levels of this hormone are associated with weight gain and an increased risk of cancer.\n\n9. Turmeric\n\nTurmeric is a spice with a warm, earthy flavor that’s often used in curries and other Indian dishes.\n\nIt has received a lot of attention because it contains curcumin, a powerful anti-inflammatory compound.\n\nResearch has shown that turmeric reduces inflammation related to arthritis, diabetes, and other diseases.\n\nIn one study, people with metabolic syndrome consumed 1 gram of curcumin daily combined with piperine from black pepper. They experienced a significant decrease in the inflammatory marker CRP.\n\nIt may be hard to get enough curcumin from turmeric alone to experience a noticeable effect. Taking supplements containing isolated curcumin may be much more effective.\n\nCurcumin supplements are often combined with piperine, which can boost curcumin absorption by 2,000%.\n\nMore research is needed to understand how the dosage of turmeric affects inflammatory markers.\n\n10. Extra virgin olive oil\n\nExtra virgin olive oil is one of the healthiest fats you can eat.\n\nIt’s rich in monounsaturated fats and a staple in the Mediterranean diet, which provides numerous health benefits.\n\nStudies link extra virgin olive oil to a reduced risk of heart disease, brain cancer, and other serious health conditions.\n\nIn one study on the Mediterranean diet, CRP and several other inflammatory markers significantly decreased in those who consumed 1.7 ounces (50 mL) of olive oil every day for 12 months.\n\nThe effect of oleocanthal, an antioxidant found in olive oil, has been compared to anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen.\n\nKeep in mind that extra virgin olive oil has greater anti-inflammatory benefits than refined olive oils do.\n\n11. Dark chocolate and cocoa\n\nDark chocolate is delicious, rich, and satisfying.\n\nIt’s also packed with antioxidants that help reduce inflammation. These may reduce your risk of disease and lead to healthier.\n\nFlavanols are responsible for chocolate’s anti-inflammatory effects and help keep the endothelial cells that line your arteries healthy.\n\nIn one small study, people who consumed 350 mg of cocoa flavanols twice daily experienced improved vascular function after 2 weeks.\n\nHowever, more quality studies on chocolate and its components are needed.\n\nIn the meantime, it can’t hurt to choose dark chocolate that contains at least 70% cocoa — a greater percentage is even better — to reap these anti-inflammatory benefits.\n\n12. Cherries\n\nCherries are delicious and rich in antioxidants, such as anthocyanins and catechins, which decrease inflammation.\n\nAlthough the health-promoting properties of tart cherries have been studied more than other varieties, sweet cherries also provide benefits.\n\nOne study including 37 older adults found that those who consumed 16 ounces (480 mL) of tart cherry juice daily for 12 weeks experienced significantly lower levels of the inflammatory marker CRP.\n\nHowever, another study found tart cherry juice had no effect on inflammation in healthy younger adults after they took it daily for 30 days.\n\nMore research is needed to understand how cherries might help reduce inflammation.Share on Pinterest\n\nInflammatory foods\n\nIn addition to filling your diet with nutritious anti-inflammatory ingredients, it’s important to limit your consumption of foods that can promote inflammation.\n\nFor example, ultra-processed foods like fast food, frozen meals, and processed meats have been associated with higher blood levels of inflammatory markers like CRP.\n\nMeanwhile, fried foods and partially hydrogenated oils contain trans fats, a type of unsaturated fatty acid that research has linked to increased levels of inflammation \n\nOther foods like sugar-sweetened beverages and refined carbs have also been shown to promote inflammation \n\nHere are some examples of foods that have been linked to increased levels of inflammation:\n\nProcessed foods: potato chips and fast food\n\nRefined carbs: white breads, white rice, crackers, and biscuits \n\nFried foods: fries, fried chicken, and mozzarella sticks\n\nSugar-sweetened beverages: soda, sweet tea, and sports drinks \n\nProcessed meats: bacon, ham, and hot \n\nTrans fats: shortening and margarine Keep in mind that it’s perfectly healthy to eat these occasionally. \n\nThe bottom line\n\nEven low levels of inflammation on a chronic basis can lead to disease.\n\nDo your best to keep inflammation in check by choosing a wide variety of delicious, antioxidant-rich foods.\n\nPeppers, dark chocolate, fish, and extra virgin olive oil are just a few foods that can help you lower inflammation and reduce your risk of illness.\n\n Enjoy the powerful antioxidant effects of chocolate by making your own hot chocolate.\n\nHeat 1 cup (237 mL) of your favorite milk –– whether it’s dairy, oat, or nut-based –– and whisk in about 1 tablespoon (5.4 grams) of unsweetened cocoa until it’s fully dissolved.\n\nFor extra flavor, you can add a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract and a dash of agave, honey, or maple syrup for sweetness. And for an optional anti-inflammatory boost, try it with a pinch of cayenne and cinnamon.\n\n \n\n1. Parsley + ginger green juice\n\nStudiesTrusted Source have found that parsley’s active ingredient, carnosol, targets inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis, Simon explains.\n\nGingerTrusted Source is a well-known anti-inflammatory. It prevents the production of inflammatory molecules like prostaglandin and leukotriene, as well pro-inflammatory cytokines. These are a type of protein found in cells.\n\nGinger benefits\n\ncontains gingerol, a powerful anti-inflammatory\n\nmay help reduce muscle soreness and pain\n\naids digestion\n\nTry it: Make your own juice at home.Add to a juicer:\n\n1 large handful of parsley\n\n2 cups of spinach\n\n1 green apple\n\n1 lemon\n\n1 small cucumber\n\n2 to 3 celery stalks\n\n1 to 2 inches of ginger\n\nDrink parsley and ginger green\njuice once daily for 8 to 12 weeks.\n\nShare on Pinteres\n\n2. Lemon + turmeric tonic\n\n“Numerous studiesTrusted Source have shown that curcumin, the active ingredient found in turmeric, can help reduce the body’s inflammatory response and provide relief for joint pain and inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.\n\nIn fact, a study analysis published earlier this year in Neurological Sciences found curcumin was a powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant substance. It could help control proteins, enzymes, and cytokines in central nervous system-related disorders, including multiple sclerosis.\n\nA bonus of this tonic (which was modified from Minimalist Baker): The ginger and lemon will help aid in digestion.\n\nCurcumin benefits\n\nhelp with chronic inflammation\n\nprovide antioxidant protection by neutralizing free radicals\n\nfight brain degeneration\n\nTry it: In a small saucepan, combine:\n\n1 tbsp. fresh grated turmeric\n\n1 tbsp. fresh grated ginger\n\nthe juice of 1 lemon\n\nthe rind of that lemon\n\n3 cups filtered water\n\nOptional:\n\n1 to 2 tsp. maple syrup or raw honey\n\na pinch of cayenne pepper\n\nBring to a simmer over medium to medium-high heat, then turn off heat. Be careful not to let it fully boil.\n\nSet a small strainer over serving glasses and divide liquid between two mugs.\n\nStore strained leftovers in the fridge up to two to three days. When ready to eat, reheat on the stovetop until just warm.\n\nDrink 1 to 1 2/3 cups of lemon and turmeric tonic\nevery day for up to four weeks.\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n3. Bone broth\n\n“Bone broth from chickens specifically, not beef or pork or fish, supports joint health through the chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine found in the cartilage, and it’s a good source of anti-inflammatory amino acids like proline, glycine, and arginine.\n\nBone broth benefits\n\nfights inflammation\n\ncontains collagen, which helps support joint health\n\nmay promote better sleep, mental function, and memory\n\nTry it: In a 10-quart slow cooker, combine:\n\n2 lbs. of chicken bones (preferably from high-quality, free-range chickens)\n\n2 chicken feet\n\n1 onion\n\n2 carrots\n\n2 celery stalks\n\n2 tbsp. apple cider vinegar\n\n1 gallon of water\n\nOptional:\n\n1 bunch of parsley\n\n1 tbsp. or more of sea salt\n\n1 tsp. peppercorns\n\nadditional herbs of your liking\n\nSimmer for 24 to 48 hours, skimming fat occasionally. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.\n\nDiscard solids and strain remainder in a bowl through a colander. Let stock cool to room temperature, then cover and chill.\n\nBone broth varies in the way it’s prepared and the quality of ingredients used. Pay special attention to where you purchase bone broth from, and to look for high-quality ingredients.\n\nDrink 1 to 2 cups of bone broth per\nday. You can also eat it as a soup. Use batch within a week, or freeze up to\nthree months.\n\n4. Functional food smoothie\n\nWhole foods are always best, but there are a handful of functional food powders that help deliver a ton of antioxidants and anti-inflammatories into one drink.\n\nPowders loaded with bioflavonoids and antioxidants from sources like ginger, rosemary, and turmeric can help boost your immune system and reduce inflammation in your body.\n\nOther functional food powders can help heal leaky gut issues, allowing you to absorb more nutrients while keeping out the allergens and toxins that cause inflammation, Francis adds.\n\nHer smoothie also includes arctic cod liver oil. It’s loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, which can suppress the proteins that promote chronic inflammation.\n\nHer smoothie also includes vitamins A and D. Studies show that vitamin A and D deficiencies can contribute to chronic inflammation.\n\nThere are a handful of more pricey ingredients in this smoothie than the budget-friendly ones above. But if you’ve tried other alternative remedies and they didn’t work to reduce your inflammation, then this could be a great option.\n\nCod liver oil benefits\n\ncontains vitamins A and D, both powerful antioxidants\n\nis a source of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids\n\nmay help reduce joint pain in people with rheumatoid arthritis\n\nTry it: In a blender, combine:\n\n2 scoops of Metagenics\nUltra-InflammX\n\n1 tbsp. Designs\nfor Health GI Revive\n\n1/2 tsp. Designs for Health\nProbiotic Synergy\n\n1 tbsp. arctic cod liver oil\n\n1 scoop Designs for Health Paleo Greens\n\n1 tbsp. Designs\nfor Health Paleo Reds\n\n12 to 16 oz. purified water\n\nOptional:\n\n1/4 cup frozen, organic berries\n\n1/2 cup rice, hemp, or coconut\nmilk\n\nDrink this food smoothie as a meal replacement for breakfast, or\ndrink with your regular breakfast.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAvoid vitamin K after surgery\n\nImmediately after surgery and while taking blood thinners, it’s best to be mindful of your intake of foods that are high in vitamin K, such as:\n\nbroccoli\n\ncauliflower\n\nBrussels sprouts\n\nliver\n\ngreen beans\n\ngarbanzo beans\n\nlentils\n\nsoybeans\n\nkale\n\ncabbage\n\nonions\n\nVitamin K enhances blood clotting. This can be useful for preventing bleeding, but keeping vitamin K amounts consistent after surgery is important. Particularly because there is a higher risk of blood clots and deep vein thrombosis. Try not to overdo your intake.\n\nIf you use blood thinners, ask your doctor how much of these vegetables you should eat, as it is important for providing the correct dose of your blood thinner.\n\nVitamin C and zinc for the immune system\n\nA healthy immune system is crucial while your wound is healing.\n\nVitamin C may help prevent inflammation and joint damage Alongside other measures.\n\nHowever, more research is needed to confirm this.\n\nTop of Form\n\n \n\nBottom of Form\n\nPromote bone health with Vitamin D\n\nVitamin D plays a key role in bone health. It helps increase bone density by promoting the absorption of calcium.\n\nYou can get vitamin D in three ways:\n\neating oily fish, mushrooms, dairy products, and fortified foods\n\nreceiving 5–30 minutes of sun exposure during peak daylight hours\n\ntaking a supplement\n\nIf your vitamin D levels are low in a blood test, supplementing is your best option for increasing levels, particularly if you do not get in the sun daily. Although you can get some vitamin D from food sources, the amounts are fairly low as the sun is the source.\n\nSome researchers have suggested that vitamin D may help prevent osteoarthritis from progressing.\n\nAdditionally, they concluded that vitamin D may help relieve joint pain in people who have low levels of this nutrient.\n\nVitamin E for wound healing\n\nAnecdotal reports claim that vitamin E — particularly vitamin E oil — can aid in wound healing and decrease scar formation.\n\nSome doctors recommend applying the oil to your closed wound three times per day after removing your stitches.\n\nHowever, researchers have not found evidence to support these claims, and some suggest vitamin E may worsen the appearance of scars. \n\nAsk your doctor before using vitamin E. Taking Vitamin E orally should be avoided at least 2 weeks prior to surgery as it can increase the risk of bleeding according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nYour doctor may prescribe iron\n\nYour surgeon will likely prescribe iron after surgery. This is to replenish iron in your blood that was lost during the operation.\n\nExpect to take the supplements for about 4 weeks.\n\nIron helps your blood’s clotting mechanism and helps you avoid anemia.\n\nIron supplements can lead to constipation. \n\nConsider herbal supplements\n\nA variety of herbal supplements may help your body heal after knee replacement surgery.\n\nGreen tea and rosehip tea have antioxidant properties and may promote wound healing.\n\nWitch hazel or chickweed, applied topically, may reduce bruising after the incision has healed.\n\nEchinacea and bromelain reduce inflammation and promote healing.\n\nArnica may reduce bruising.\n\nMany of these supplements are said to reduce inflammation and swelling or fight infections and promote wound healing.\n\nConsider non-herbal supplements\n\nOther non-herbal supplements and substances may aid in healing, including fighting infection and rebuilding tissue.\n\nThese include:\n\ncoenzyme Q10\n\nessential fatty acids\n\nfree-form amino acids\n\nL-lysine\n\nL-cysteine\n\nL-glutamine\n\nMSM\n\nFrench maritime pine bark extract\n\nHyaluronic Acid\n\nGlucosamine Chondroitin \n\nPeople take each one for different reasons. It’s essential to research claims about any products and check with your doctor that they are safe to use.\n\nAsk your doctor about these suggestions.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is malabsorption syndrome?\n\nThe main role of your small intestine is to absorb nutrients from the food you eat into your bloodstream. Malabsorption syndrome refers to a number of disorders in which the small intestine can’t absorb enough of certain nutrients and fluids.\n\nI mention this if you have problems absorbing nutrients to heal.\n\nNutrients that the small intestine often has trouble absorbing can be one or both of the following:\n\nmacronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats)\n\nmicronutrients (vitamins and minerals)\n\nCauses of malabsorption syndrome\n\nMany things can lead to malabsorption syndrome, from certain diseases to infections or developmental issues.\n\nPossible causes\n\nFactors that may cause malabsorption syndrome include:\n\ndamage to the intestine from infection, inflammation, trauma (injury), or surgery\n\nprolonged use of antibiotics\n\nother conditions such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, chronic pancreatitis, or cystic fibrosis\n\nlactase deficiency, or lactose intolerance\n\ncertain irregularities that are congenital, or present at birth, such as biliary atresia, when the bile ducts don’t develop normally and prevent the flow of bile from the liver\n\ndiseases of the gallbladder, liver, or pancreas\n\nparasitic diseases\n\nradiation therapy, which may injure the lining of the intestine\n\ncertain drugs that may injure the lining of the intestine, such as tetracycline, colchicine, or cholestyramine\n\nThe syndrome may also be caused by digestive problems. Your stomach may not be able to produce the enzymes it needs to digest certain foods. Or, your body may not be able to mix the food you eat with the enzymes and acid produced by your stomach.\n\nRare causes\n\nThere are also some uncommon disorders that can result in malabsorption. One of these is called short bowel syndrome (SBS).\n\nWith SBS, the small intestine is shortened. This makes the intestine less able to absorb nutrients. SBS may be an irregularity present from birth, or it may be caused by surgery.\n\nCertain diseases may cause malabsorption. These include tropical sprue, a condition most common in:\n\nthe Caribbean\n\nIndia\n\nparts of Southeast Asia\n\nTropical sprue may be related to environmental factors, such as:\n\ntoxins in food\n\ninfection\n\nparasites\n\nAn even rarer potential cause of malabsorption is Whipple’s disease, which is a result of a bacterial infection.\n\nRecognizing the symptoms of malabsorption syndrome\n\nSymptoms of malabsorption syndrome occur when unabsorbed nutrients pass through the digestive tract.\n\nMany symptoms differ depending on the specific nutrient or nutrients that are not being absorbed properly. Other symptoms are a result of a deficiency of that nutrient, which is caused by its poor absorption.\n\nYou may have the following symptoms if you’re unable to absorb fats, protein, or certain sugars or vitamins:\n\nFats. You may have light-colored, foul-smelling stools that are soft and bulky. These stools are difficult to flush and may float or stick to the sides of the toilet bowl.\n\nProtein. You may have dry hair, hair loss, or fluid retention. Fluid retention is also known as edema and will look like swelling.\n\nCertain sugars. You may have bloating, gas, or explosive diarrhea.\n\nCertain vitamins. You may have anemia, malnutrition, low blood pressure, weight loss, or muscle wasting.\n\nMalabsorption may affect people based on different characteristics. For instance, people may stop menstruating, and children may not grow properly. Their weight or rate of weight gain may be significantly below that of other children of a similar age and biological sex.\n\nAnother sign of malabsorption in children is that they may avoid certain foods.\n\nRisk factors for malabsorption syndrome\n\nRisk factors for malabsorption syndrome include:\n\na family history of cystic fibrosis or malabsorption\n\ndrinking large amounts of alcohol\n\nintestinal surgery\n\nuse of certain medications, including laxatives or mineral oil\n\ntravel to the Caribbean, India, and parts of Southeast Asia\n\nTop of Form\n\n \n\nBottom of Form\n\nDiagnosing malabsorption syndrome\n\nA doctor may suspect malabsorption syndrome if you have:\n\nchronic diarrhea\n\nnutrient deficiencies\n\nsignificant weight loss despite eating a balanced diet\n\nCertain tests are used to confirm the diagnosis. These tests may include:\n\nStool tests\n\nStool tests can measure fat in samples of stool, or feces. These tests are the most reliable because fat is usually present in the stool of someone with malabsorption syndrome.\n\nBlood tests\n\nThese tests measure the levels of specific nutrients in your blood, such as:\n\nvitamin B12\n\nvitamin D\n\nfolate\n\niron\n\ncalcium\n\ncarotene\n\nphosphorus\n\nalbumin\n\nprotein\n\nA lack of one of these nutrients may not necessarily mean you have malabsorption syndrome. It can mean you’re not choosing foods with enough nutrients.\n\nNormal levels of these nutrients suggest that malabsorption is not the problem.\n\nBreath tests\n\nBreath tests can be used to test for lactose intolerance.\n\nIf lactose isn’t being absorbed, it enters the colon. Bacteria in the colon break down the lactose and produce hydrogen gas. The excess hydrogen is absorbed from your intestine into your bloodstream and then into your lungs. You’ll then exhale the gas.\n\nIf you have hydrogen gas in your breath after ingesting a product containing lactose, you may have lactose intolerance.\n\nImaging tests\n\nImaging tests, which take pictures of your digestive system, may be done to look for structural problems. For instance, your doctor could request a CT scan to look for thickening of the wall of your small intestine, which could be a sign of Crohn’s disease.\n\nBiopsy\n\nYou may have a biopsy if your doctor suspects you have abnormal cells in the lining of your small intestine.\n\nA biopsy will likely be done using an endoscopy. A tube is inserted into your mouth and sent through your esophagus and stomach and into your small intestine to take a small sample of cells.\n\nTreatment options for malabsorption syndrome\n\nYour doctor will likely start your treatment by addressing symptoms like diarrhea. Medications such as loperamide can help.\n\nYour doctor will also want to replace the nutrients and fluids that your body has been unable to absorb. They may monitor you for signs of dehydration, which can include:\n\nincreased thirst\n\nlow urine output\n\ndry mouth, skin, or tongue\n\nNext, your doctor will provide care based on the cause of the absorption problem. For instance, if you’re found to have lactose intolerance, your doctor will likely advise you to avoid milk and other dairy products or take a lactase enzyme tablet.\n\nAt this point, your doctor may refer you to a dietitian. Your dietitian will create a treatment plan that will help make sure you’re getting the nutrients your body needs. Your dietitian may recommend:\n\nEnzyme supplements. These supplements can help your body absorb the nutrients that it can’t absorb on its own.\n\nVitamin supplements. Your dietitian may recommend high doses of vitamins or other nutrients to make up for those that are not being absorbed by your intestine.\n\nDiet changes. Your dietitian may adjust your diet to increase or decrease certain foods or nutrients. For instance, you may be advised to avoid foods high in fat to decrease diarrhea and consume more foods high in potassium to help balance your electrolytes.\n\nA doctor and dietitian can help create a treatment plan that will manage your malabsorption symptoms and allow your body to get the nutrients and fluids it needs to function properly.\n\n ",

    "body": "\nHey all! 👋🏻I want to review hair growth serum from minimalist-\n\nSo i have straight fine hair(little below shoulder length)(30s/F), oily scalp. \n\nI have been suffering from hair loss for past two years. I haven't checked with my derm. I have lost some hair (in patches) because of my tight hairstyle. Then came humidity season and my hair were everywhere. Before taking an appointment I decided to try hair serum. I started on 29th june. \n\n\n29/6: Started with serum. First application was hassle free. No burning or warming of the scalp. I used 4 drops front of scalp(problem area) and 4 drops back of my head, everyday, in the AM(as i take shower in the PM). Rubbed into my fingers and then Massaged only on my scalp and not on length. It was non greasy.\n\n\n01/07: In just two days I started to feel my hair fall is less, like 3-4 strands in my comb. I thought its a placebo effect.\n\n\nI continued it for two weeks straight, every day and my hair fall reduced by 20%. I stopped the application on 14/7 for two weeks as i was traveling and wanted to see if hairfall return and to my luck it Did. But it wasn't alot. I think some people miss understand that after stopping hairfall doubles but it's just the same amount you used to get(at least for me)\nI restarted again and still using it and now i can say I definitely see hair looks bit thicker, have seen baby hair growth especially at the hairline and hair fall has reduced to 80%. \n\nI will keep using it as it dint have any side effects except one stubborn cc which always occurs on my forehead if apply regularly. Thus i now use it 4-5 times a week(depends on which day i ll shampoo and workout)\n\nIts non greasy if applied less but if you directly use the dropper on scalp you might end up using alot and it will give oily look. My scalp normally gets oily on 3rd day but with everyday application of serum hair looks oily on 2nd day. \n\n\nPROS: 1. It works.\n2. New hair growth. \n3. Hair seem thicker.\n4. Less hairfall.\n\n\nCONS: 1.Everyday application is a task for long hair and oily scalp as you need to shampoo.\n2. Give cc on forehead with regular use.\n3. Don't think its a permanent cure.\n4. Expensive.\n\nInci:\nButylene Glycol, Aqua, Dextran, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Trifolium Pratense (Clover) Flower Extract, Propanediol, Arginine, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Gluconolactone, Calcium Gluconate, Glycerin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Apigenin, Oleanolic Acid, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Sprout Extract, Isomalt, Sodium Metabisulfite, Larix Europaea Wood Extract, Glycine, Zinc Chloride, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sanguisorba Officinalis Root Extract, Serenoa Serrulata (Saw Palmetto) Fruit Extract, Capryloyl Glycine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Lactic Acid\n\n\nTL:DR- True to its claims, will repurchase it!\n------------------------------",

In the wake of the pandemic, that is a noteworthy detail.\n\n#https://www.newsweek.com/dr-fauci-backed-controversial-wuhan-lab-millions-us-dollars-risky-coronavirus-research-1500741\n\n**Scientist Richard Ebright**\n\n#>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction. And here is a proposal from the beginning of 2018 [from Fauci/Gates-funded EcoHealth Alliance] proposing explicitly to engineer that sequence at that position in chimeric lab- generated coronaviruses.\n\n- Richard Ebright, an eminent molecular biologist at Rutgers University, https://archive.is/cCBUw\n\n**Eminent Virologist David Baltimore of CalTech**\n\n>When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine [humanized] codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.\n\n- David Baltimore, an eminent virologist and former president of CalTech, https://archive.is/yalCe\n\n\n**Former CDC Director Robert Redfield:**\n\n>I was concerned because of the presence of the furin cleavage site that we've talked about and I think it's important to understand what that cleavage site does. That cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of COVID, so where before it could not see the ACE2 receptor which is the human receptor, it totally changes the orientation now so it has high affinity for human receptors. So that furin cleavage site bothered me, it didn't seem like it belonged there. \n\n>And then if you look at the sequences they use in those 12 nucleotides for arginine, where the arginine sequence nucleotide triplet were coded for humans. So why did it have the arginine coding for humans and not bat? It was very disconcerting to me. It looked like this virus was engineered.\n\n\n>It's not scientifically plausible that this virus went from a bat to humans and became one of the most infectious viruses that we have for humans.",

The texture is slightly thick and gooey(but not gross)\n\nApplication: I use 3-4 pumps for my whole face. I apply it on wet dripping face right after cleanser in the evening. On some days I layer it twice. My skin drinks it up as soon as I apply it. It spreads easily on wet skin. On dry skin it doesn't fully absorb and sits on the skin.\n\nI love it. I bought 9 bottles so far. And gifted three to my friends. You can see 4 in the photo. I gave away the old ones for recycling. I use it every day in my PM routine during winters. It helps keep my skin hydrated in dry weather. If i go a week without using it, I can feel the difference. Skin feels tight and not as glowy when i wake up. I always take it for travelling. It's helpful during flights and while staying in hotel rooms where my skin feels most dehydrated.\n\n***10/10 Will repurchase , Holy Grail!***\n\nSorry for any mistakes. This is my first review.

    "body": "# TL;DR\n\nFinished Candito's 6 week program, got massive gainz especially on the squat, but pulled a hamstring while pulling sumo.\n\n# Intro\n\nHey yall. Just finished the fifth week of Candito's 6 week program which brought me massive gainz. Instead of going for 1RM's next week I'm just gonna take a week off because I just got a stupid hamstring injury today ;(  I'm currently writing this program review in bed icing my hammy.\n\n# Short Background Info\n\n20/Male/182cm. BW used to be 83-84 kg for a long time, but got bumped up to 86-87 kg while running this program. I'm from South Korea (born and raised), finished my first year in college in the States (Northwestern Uni in IL), but now I'm back in my home country cuz of COVID, mandatory military service, etc. I've been in between things so I’ve had more free time, and naturally I've been able to devote more time and energy to lifting and recovery. \n\nI've been program-hopping a little bit since April: J&T 2.0 this April-May, Greg Nuckols 28 Programs for a couple cycles, then this.\n\n# Stats / Results\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||*Starting*|*Resulting*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**BW**|84kg|86kg|\n|**Squat**|[175kg 3RM](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFYfeWXpxZG/?igshid=1800ts62lwhib) (September 2020)|[180kg 4RM](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHEjJLlpZ2-/?igshid=ft4z7qimz6k5)|\n|**Bench**|107.5kg 1RM (September 2020)|[100kg 3RM](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHJyzhApd_P/?igshid=1j6u2i9hxooh5)|\n|**Deadlift**|205kg 1RM (September 2020)|200kg x2 (Could have done more)|\n|**Grammy Nominations**|0|0|\n\n**Squat:**\n\nThis I was very, very happy with. As a lot of y'all know, week 2 was a bitch for squats, but I managed to hit 10 reps on the MR10 sets ([150kg x10](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGWcIkzJguI/?igshid=ik0qjyj6xaq6)). Candito laid out the program for week 2 so that you’re “rewarded” with more back-off sets if you hit all the reps. I cheated on the back-off sets by resting a tad bit more than a minute (sorry mama candito!) but they all worked out fine. If you check out the link above where I squat 180kg for 4, I actually check if I underloaded the bar after the lift bc of how unbelievably easy the reps were LMAO. I put some mass on my glutes and legs overall as well.\n\n**Bench:**\n\nNothing too special here. I enjoyed the upper body workouts where I got to work on some lifts that were kind of neglected (eg seated DB press). Frequent back work also put some more muscle on my back.\n\nA 3RM at 100kg was still a PR, and consideting it was a 1RM back in April, it was a W.\n\n**Deadlift:**\n\nWent pretty well until the hammy strain happened. I used to pull conventional only until I ran Greg Nuckols’ DL twice per week program where I took the time to practice sumo. I switched to and only pulled sumo during Candito, and I’d say it was pretty successful. I chose stiff legged sumo for the DL variation which felt pretty nice. \n\nThe injury happened on the last day of week 5 (today as I’m writing this review). I don’t think it was a big technique issue. Instead, I think what happened was this: I normally pull on a wooden quasi-platform barefoot, and my sweaty foot slipped and stretched my hamstring while it was loaded. I post my lifting footage on IG but I didn’t post the injury footage since my gf checks my lifting account and I didn’t want her to get worried lol. \n\nInstead, here’s a footage of [195kg x2](https://www.instagram.com/p/CG6aEMFJ-8o/?igshid=1o7dhnv5j21ry) from week 4 which was smooth.\n\n# Diet & Nutrition\n\nDidn’t keep track of calories, but I roughly kept track of protein intake. I tried my best to get in around 180 g per day. Basic Korean boy diet (Rice, Japanese Ramen, Meat, whatever lol) and I added in 2-3 scoops of Whey Protein Isolate. I made sure I took 5 g of creatine monohydrate daily plus fish oil, multivitamin, and L-arginine for health.\n\nI don’t drink alcohol regularly but only occasionally. I don’t smoke even though I use snus pretty regularly. Oh and I got off prescribed alprazolam (xanax) during the course of running this program. Big W.\n\n# Future Plans\n\nI’ll make sure my hammy gets recovered ASAP by eating and sleeping enough, icing, stationary bikes, etc. I’d really appreciate any tips on hamstring strain recovery!\n\nThanks for reading through my write up! Much love.",

General mobility work is good, but when it strains it tightens up, and stretching can put stress on the site of injury.\n\n* RICE protocol and anti-inflams are really good.\n\n* make sure your hips are mobile, so that other muscles will take their fair share of load.\n\n* get as much pain free, low impact volume is as you can. I did stationary bike and kettlebell swings, staying in pain free range, as my early stage work. Concentric work especially, as it doesnt put as much stress on the muscle as eccentric.\n\n* I tried the [Starr Rehab Protocol](https://www.google.com/amp/s/chicagosc.com/starr-rehab-protocol-muscle-injury/amp/) and had good results. I had a mild strain not long after, and never tried it again. Have a read and see what you think.\n\nAll in all, rest the injury but get the muscle working (pain free) asap. Good luck",

    "body": "I (40,M) have had herpes for 20 years and have learned a bit about it along the way. I asked myself what kind of post I wish I would have stumbled upon when first getting diagnosed and here we are. There where many things I wish I had known early on. \n\nHerpes can be a hard to deal with sometimes. Most of it gets easier as time goes by.  I hope this information makes your life easier and things a bit smoother.  Here are some of the things I’ve learned along the way… \n\n# MINDSET\n\nYou can live an easeful happy life with herpes. It’s not as big of a deal as you think it is in the beginning. No, your life isn’t over. As a matter of fact you may even have future moments where you smile in gratitude at having herpes and the way it has helped you.\n\nHerpes can be a great teacher if you let it. It will help you learn more about your body and way of being than many other things. It is possible to see it as a gift \\~ this can transform your experience with it. It will even help you feel less stressed which can help reduce outbreaks. \n\nHaving this does not mean anything about your goodness as a person. We live life and things both wanted and unwanted happen. \n\nIs it happening TO me or is it happening FOR me? The choice is yours ;)\n\n# NATURAL APPROACH\n\nI am a health-centered person and have tried to use natural methods where I can. I don’t like depending on pharmaceuticals and the unknown chemical load from taking a pill everyday. I don’t know what longterm effects it would have for me or how it would affect my future children (sperm) and so I have tried to minimize their use.\n\nIf you go the natural method you will need to more closely monitor your diet and stress levels. It will be more work but I believe it will reward you with a healthier body and also one you know more deeply. \n\nHerpes will be there to remind you when to slow down and consume consciously. \n\n# CALENDULA OIL\n\nWhen you have an outbreak rub some calendula oil on it. This oil works amazing for reducing the severity of the outbreak. Rub some oil directly on the sores. It reduces the intensity of the pain and duration of the outbreak. There’s a brand called HERB PHARM on amazon that I’ve found works great. \n\n# MEDICATION\n\nI used to take 500-1000mg of Acyclovir/Valtrex everyday to prevent outbreaks.  Later I tapered down to a half dose per day and then a half dose 2-3x per week and found it just as effective. Less chemical load - nice. Medication is very effective for preventing outbreaks. I wish someone had told me early on that I might get by with less dosage and be fine. Test for yourself. \n\nI now use lysine in place of pharmaceuticals to prevent outbreaks. I have not taken any medication in a couple years. \n\n# DIET\n\nYour diet absolutely affects outbreaks. Certain foods trigger it. Arginine high foods can trigger it. Get a list of foods high in arginine/lysine and be mindful. I think this can change over time. I used to always get an outbreak after eating a lot of peanut butter or dark chocolate. Even oatmeal could do it. I love peanut butter and this was an issue. This can change. Now I have a big giant bowl of oatmeal and peanut butter with no outbreaks.  \n\nGet a list of arginine/lysine rich foods. In my experience highly processed foods and gmo gluten also has been a strong trigger. Tread lightly. My outbreaks greatly reduced when I eliminated gluten from my diet for a couple years. Now I can eat pancakes and sourdough toast without issues. Processed bread, donuts, can still trigger it but that more so depends on my stress levels.\n\nOther things like plant medicines, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes can cause outbreaks. Be mindful. Use lysine or pharma pill if you’re concerned. Probably due to the reduction in the immune system function. \n\n# LYSINE\n\nI take lysine almost daily. 1000mg daily has been working well. I’ll take more if I just ate a highly triggering food like peanut butter or dark chocolate. If I feel the onset of an outbreak I’ll load up with 4000mg for a couple days and that usually prevents it from happening. \n\nI used to invest in high quality lysine for $40 per bottle but have found the cheap lysine from walmart to be just as effective. \n\n# STRESS\n\nAlong with food, stress is the top trigger for outbreaks. Learn to manage your stress. Meditation, breath work, prayer, and of course REST. Many outbreaks have been caused by pushing my body too hard and not resting when it told me I needed to. \n\n# KAMBO\n\nI used to have outbreaks about every month and a half. Sometimes monthly. I thought this would reduce a lot over time but unfortunately I found it wasn’t much the case for me. This greatly changed when I had kambo medicine for the first time.  Every time I have a kambo session I can feel the virus is less strong and outbreaks are less frequent. I believe it’s the closest thing to a cure. There are plenty of reports of people healing completely from multiple kambo sessions.\n\nKambo is a medicine from a frog. It’s a gritty experience where you purge strongly. I usually end feeling extremely light and clear. In my experience it works and I plan to return for more kambo ceremonies when my budget allows. Yes, taking frog poison and throwing up is pretty rugged, but I'll take it anyday if it heals the herp.\n\n# IMMUNE SYSTEM \n\nLast year I completed a 3-month detox intended for immune system boosting and I have not had an outbreak in 5 months. It was basically meat, fruit, and eggs along with plenty of immune boosting supplements like mushrooms, camu camu, and echinacea. I had some close calls but I used lysine and rest to prevent it from turning into an outbreak. I think this detox was helpful in building a stronger immune system to keep the virus at bay.\n\n# DISCLOSING\n\nI have always made it a point to disclose to a new partner as soon as I feel things may lead to us having sex. Firstly, I am actually doing this for my own health and well-being as I have found guilt from not disclosing will eat at me. Your conscience has a way of making itself known to you. Go against your conscience and it can lead to regret and if ignored even worse things later. Some people don’t feel its a big deal especially if taking a daily pharma pill and using protection, maybe they are right.\n\nUse your own discretion. I have found people are much more accepting of herpes than I ever thought initially. I never had any moments where someone outright rejected me because of it. I think this may also be because I learned how to disclose in a very casual and upfront way. If you feel like it’s a big giant dealbreaker than so will they. Your vibe will be felt. \n\nWork on loving and accepting yourself even with the virus. You are still worthy of love and intimacy. \n\n# WISHING YOU EASE\n\nHerpes is a teacher. It will help you become a better communicator and get better at loving and accepting life and yourself more deeply. \n\nYou’re not cursed, you’re just human, living a wild, messy, mysterious, beautiful human life. \n\nI hope this information helps you on your herpes journey. \n\nWishing you ease and joy as you go.",

In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

    "body": "All right, guys, I'll try to make this a quick one. A brilliant guy on Discord—who, by the way, should definitely do his own writing—asked me to write a post about the synergy between L-citrulline and L-arginine.\n\nAs you may know, there are multiple studies showing that equal parts L-citrulline and L-arginine actually provide a better effect in terms of sports performance and nitric oxide increase when compared to using just L-arginine or just L-citrulline alone. u/Hinkle\\_McKringlebry has talked about it many times. \n\nNow, we already know that L-citrulline is superior to L-arginine because it bypasses the first-pass metabolism. But if L-citrulline is better than L-arginine, how come combining one part L-arginine with one part L-citrulline is better than just using two parts L-citrulline?\n\nThink about it: you have two parts of a superior compound (L-citrulline) compared to a mix of one part superior (L-citrulline) and one part inferior (L-arginine). Yet somehow, the superior plus inferior combination works better.\n\nThis is what we're going to explore today—this unique 1+1=3 synergy and how it actually works.\n\n# Why is L-citrulline superior in the first place\n\nL-arginine is converted into L-citrulline during the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and L-citrulline serves as a precursor for the regeneration of L-arginine via separate metabolic pathway we won't need to focus on for this post. While L-arginine supplementation has been thought to improve endothelial function, studies have shown that most orally administered L-arginine is metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract and liver by arginases 1 and 2 before it can reach the kidneys. **L-citrulline is more effective at increasing plasma L-arginine concentrations than L-arginine supplementation because it is not metabolized by arginase and can reach the kidneys where it is converted into L-arginine**\n\n# Combination of L-citrulline and L-arginine is superior\n\n[https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006291X14018178](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006291X14018178)\n\n**Oral supplementation with a combination of l-citrulline and l-arginine rapidly increases plasma l-arginine concentration and enhances NO bioavailability**\n\n“l-Citrulline plus l-arginine supplementation caused a more rapid increase in plasma l-arginine levels and marked enhancement of NO bioavailability, including plasma cGMP concentrations, than with dosage with the single amino acids”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p0nzfdqck0be1.jpg?width=2165&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1857018c8e31d7409021c9a18402ecfe1978a88f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vw8axg1hk0be1.jpg?width=2165&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47b576afbe847d1bd503e039a4373ff708132cb5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dwfsxluik0be1.jpg?width=1476&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12f1b2b0f7fa3710fa28f04def1462512045e17b\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09168451.2016.1230007#:\\~:text=In%20conclusion%2C%20our%20data%20shows,dose%20of%20l%2Darginine%20alone.\n\n**The effects on plasma L-arginine levels of combined oral L-citrulline and L-arginine supplementation in healthy males**\n\n“Oral l-citrulline plus l-arginine supplementation more efficiently increased plasma l-arginine levels than 2 g of l-citrulline or l-arginine, suggesting that oral l-citrulline and l-arginine increase plasma l-arginine levels more effectively in humans when combined.”\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/e19hz580p0be1.gif\n\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/2306-5710/8/3/48#:\\~:text=Consumption%20of%20amino%20acids%20L,production%20and%20improve%20physical%20performance.\n\n**The Effects of Consuming Amino Acids L-Arginine, L-Citrulline (and Their Combination) as a Beverage or Powder, on Athletic and Physical Performance: A Systematic Review**\n\n“Four electronic databases (PubMed, Ebscohost, Science Direct, and Google scholar) were used. An acute dose of 0.075 g/kg of L-Arg or 6 g L-Arg had no significant increase in NO biomarkers and physical performance markers (p > 0.05). Consumption of 2.4 to 6 g/day of L-Cit over 7 to 16 days significantly increased NO level and physical performance markers (p < 0.05). Combined L-Arg and L-Cit supplementation significantly increased circulating NO, improved performance, and reduced feelings of exertion (p < 0.05).”\n\n[https://academic.oup.com/bbb/article/81/2/372/5955995](https://academic.oup.com/bbb/article/81/2/372/5955995)\n\n**The effects on plasma L-arginine levels of combined oral L-citrulline and L-arginine supplementation in healthy males** \n\n“We investigated the effects of combining 1 g of l-citrulline and 1 g of l-arginine as oral supplementation on plasma l-arginine levels in healthy males. Oral l-citrulline plus l-arginine supplementation more efficiently increased plasma l-arginine levels than 2 g of l-citrulline or l-arginine, suggesting that oral l-citrulline and l-arginine increase plasma l-arginine levels more effectively in humans when combined.”\n\nOK, but what is the reason for that? Why would the combination beat plain old L-citrulline? In the beginning I mentioned arginine’s rate limiting enzymes - arginase 1 and 2, which are responsible for its rapid breakdown. Well **L-citrulline suppresses the activity of arginase.** This allows more of the administered L-arginine to bypass first-pass metabolism and reach circulation. It is actually a strong allosteric inhibitor of arginase. \n\n“L-Cit acts as a strong allosteric inhibitor, as it has an inhibiting effect on arginase, which metabolises L-Arg to urea and L-ornithine”\n\n“L-citrulline, were shown to inhibit MPEC arginase activity under maximal assay conditions.”\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9124321/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9124321/)\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20170815174653/http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/ajpendo/272/2/E181.full.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20170815174653/http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/ajpendo/272/2/E181.full.pdf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sop1t029p0be1.jpg?width=2265&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6dccc3bfc0ddaf6ce05bb84318b88cded4dddc65\n\nSo there you go. L-citrulline inhibits arginase, effectively sparing the L-arginine and you get a nitric oxide increase from both L-cit and L-arg, which is bigger than that from the same quantity L-Cit.\n\nL-arginine is not useless at all as long as you inhibit arginase. \n\n# Other arginase inhibitors \n\nThere are actually better arginase inhibitors than L-cit.\n\n* L-Norvaline - the most practical one. 250-500mg gets the job done as tested and proven by yours truly with a saliva strip test\n* Cocoa Extract - flavonoids in cocoa inhibit arginase. You just have to get a decent high polyphenol extract, not munch on chocolate  \n* Berberine - yes, the good old Berberine..what is it that it does not do. Well don’t use it for that, it is a moderate one, just wanted to mention it\n* Resveratrol, Cinnamon extract, Agmatine -  probably on the weaker side. The data is not sufficient \n* Piceatannol - the most potent one, but not practical to use, hard to source high Piceatannol supplements\n* Chlorogenic acid  - found in coffee. If you source a high % green coffee extract you can have the desired effect.\n\n**Or just take Nitrosigine…**\n\nNitrosigine stabilizes arginine in its inositol-silicate form, making it less susceptible to arginase activity. This means more arginine is preserved and made available for NO production.\n\nSo that is it. Have your L-arginine. It is an awesome nitric oxide booster…just have to inhibit its breakdown. Almost everyone takes L-Cit and L-cit + L-Arg beats just L-cit so no reason to ignore L-arg in sport exercise or general health endeavors. \n\nEDIT: They tested 1:1 ratio for comparison purposes in these studies. In other studies they actually found 2:1 L-Cit:L-Arg to be the optimal ratio\n\n=====================================================================  \nFor research I read daily and write-ups based on it - https://discord.gg/R7uqKBwFf9",

More importantly, the Rothschild-Rockefeller Mafia NWO at the top who runs the central banks, intelligence agencies, owns all governments and media, and runs the world.

Highly unusual, and I've been involved in dual use labs when I was in the military.\n\n\n>And the third thing they did which I think is really telling is they let a contractor redo the ventilation system in that laboratory. So I think  clearly there was strong evidence that there was a significant event that happened in that laboratory in September. It's now been declassified, you can read it. I'm sure there's more classified information around it.\n\n**Scientist Richard Ebright**\n\n>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction.

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "[Manyo Factory Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Repair Skin Toner](http://manyo-factory.com/en/shop/product/hyaluronic-acid-hydrating-repair-skin-toner)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI purchased this toner about a month ago. I know only a month's use is a bit premature, and I usually do reviews of products once I have completely finished them,  but if I wait until I finish this product it will probably be 5-6 months from now.\n\n**Feel**\n\nThis toner feels really nice on the skin. It is a bit thicker than water and is totally clear. I pour a small puddle into my hand, and then pat into my skin. I apply it after using a facial spray (Caudalie Grape Water or Manyo Factory Lactobacillus Mist). I bring it up under my eyes without irritation. I even apply it to my lips.\n\n**Results**\n\nSo for skin care products that aren't actives, I sometimes feel like I don't notice any difference in my skin, and I have to wonder if it's doing anything at all. I was beginning to feel the same way about this product, but then I forgot to apply it the other day before going to work, and my skin had a slight tight feeling all day. I was definitely missing some hydration. This toner definitely hydrates my skin well, and when applied to my lips makes them plumper. I really enjoy using this, and I might even like it better than the Pyunkang Yul Essence toner that I always recommend to people looking for a hydrating toner.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nI'll include the entire ingredients list so you can see all the awesome stuff in it. I was really impressed with the ingredients list.\n\n Mineral Water, Carbonated Water, Hydrolyzed Collagen Extract, Glycerin, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Sodium PCA, Urea, Uric Acid, Calcium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Magnesium Chloride, Ceramide NP, Oligopeptide-29, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Beta-Glucan, Allantoin, Arbutin, Butylene Glycol, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Water, Methylpropanediol, Chondrus Crispus Powder, Caprylyl Glycol, Glutamic acid, Threonine, Serine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Proline, Glycine, Alanine, Lactic acid, Citric Acid, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Valine, Isoleucine,Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Cysteine, Xanthan Gum, Lysine, Histidine, Arginine, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Aspartic acid \n\nYou've got ceramides, collagen, glycerin, arbutin, allantoin, urea, panthenol, amino acids, lactic acid, hyaluronic acid, and plant extracts. It's a win in my book. I would bet this could help repair a damaged moisture barrier (the name says as much anyway)\n\n**Packaging**\n\nIt comes in a 250 mL bottle with a flip cap. I haven't experienced any issues with pouring out too much. I think the packaging is great, and would probably be good for traveling (obviously not on an airplane because it's too big for the liquid regulations)\n\n**Repurchase?**\n\nAbsolutely! My mom is using it too, and we both love it. It definitely makes a difference in my skin and leaves it feeling hydrated. I would recommend this to anyone needing a hydrating toner. It also layers well if you wanted to do the 7 skin method with it. I haven't done 7 layers, but have done 2 or 3 without issue. It also works well when I use it alongside the Pyunkang Yul Essence toner.",

    "body": "It has been over 9 months since I began using 1g Agmatine Sulfate in the morning, and 1g in the early evening. I have experienced 0 physical side effects, besides the obvious substance potentiation associated with NMDA antagonists. fyi this is a [repost](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/Nootropics/comments/ipqhzu/agmatine_sulfate_has_completely_changed_me_9/)\n\n**It has cured my depression**\n\nOne hour after my first 1g dose, I noticed an immediate change in my mentality. I no longer dwelled on negative thoughts and lashed out at the people around me. I no longer felt like I wanted to die. I was finally able to control my thought patterns and focus on other things. Sometimes it feels like I can't even get sad anymore, but there have been a few brief moments where I was down.\n\n**I learned better behavior**\n\nBefore using Agmatine, I was really obsessed with talking to women. Like, I would quickly become clingy and desperate. After a few months I felt it easier to control this, and finally now I don't even care about what people think. I've even stopped masturbating every day, not because I have ED or lack the desire, but because I'm just not addicted to it anymore. I'm more goal-oriented, and not worried about petty things. Overall my actions have become less dictated by fear.\n\n**In general, my learning has improved**\n\nI find myself retaining a lot more information than I did before, and quickly learning things. There's not much more to add here, I just wanted to say that.\n\n**Negative interactions/ downfalls**\n\nIf you're using it for the antidepressant effect, avoid alcohol. Every time I drink, I instantly feel depressed, as though I skipped my Agmatine dose. So even though I didn't really drink before, now I don't drink at all. I believe I also read that L-Citrulline/ L-Arginine kills the antidepressant effect of Agmatine. So maybe don't mix the two.\n\nI feel like Agmatine is pretty GABAergic. There's studies that say that it is, and I feel like that would explain why I feel too relaxed sometimes. The lower blood pressure and glutamate action probably doesn't help either. Honestly not much of a problem, but I just wanted that to be known.\n\nJust as I described above, it feels like sometimes I have less of an emotional range of sadness. That doesn't mean I don't get sad, but sometimes I wonder if I'm too content, or if not feeling the same sadness as before is taking away from my creativity. Either way, I don't think I'm ready to put that to the test, so I'll probably keep using Agmatine Sulfate until I reach all of my goals.\n\nSome of you have probably already seen this, but this is all of the research I've collected on the substance: [**https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ht9hvr/agmatine\\_sulfate\\_miracle\\_substance\\_with\\_endless/**](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/Nootropics/comments/ht9hvr/agmatine_sulfate_miracle_substance_with_endless/)",

I've spent far too long in dark rooms and I've had to give up a lot of things I thought were key to my life. It's been rough.\n\nDuring that time I've learned to improve my nutrition a bunch, (largely with help from a good specialist nutritionalist).

Something I'm only currently experimenting with: caffeine depletes magnesium (many other things do especially sugar and alcohol), but I find that I don't necessarily feel better without caffeine, but when I stopped caffeine and took magnesium, there seemed to be benefits. Perhaps some people are particularly sensitive to caffeine in this way.\n\nTo clarify, I only ever have one coffee. But I think that over time this may be depleting my magnesium.",

L-cysteine is the original version but I've noticed more of a difference with the NAC (Also a very passive sort of change. It's something I really only notice the benefits of when I stop)\n\n- Turmeric/curcumin: probably the most noticeable benefit when I take this. My crashes are much less painful and I'm not as achy\n\n- Bromelain: helps with the absorption of the turmeric. Honestly it's just the enzyme in pineapple, so it's a lot cheaper to just have a glass of pineapple juice than to buy the supplement! Also a pain reliever and anti-inflammatory (if I take turmeric w bromelain in the morning, I've found it works just as well as tylenol or ibuprofen for this)\n\nOtherwise vitamin d, magnesium, and b12 are my usual ones that seem to help me the most. I try to add in athletic greens to my smoothies (usually the only thing I can stomach) just for the nutrients, but not sure if I noticed any specific benefit. Vitamin C of course if I don't want to have a constant cold or flu\n\nAgree with the little effect on melatonin and iron too... just IBS problems 🫠",

Summers are hot &amp; humid, winters are dry &amp; bone cold. My initial concerns were getting rid of forehead CC'S, bumps, flakiness around my nose and between my eyebrows. Now I am simply trying to fade some acne marks and still trying to stop some minor flaking. Winter is coming so I need a heavier moisturizer... if you have any recs, I am open to looking into them!\n\n**Note:** Most -- not all -- of my products are \"clean\", meaning they are FA-safe, contain no fatty alcohols, contain no silicone or alcohol except for maybe 1 or 2 products.

Pills super easy... broke me out on my forehead.  \n*RiRe Silky &amp; Light Sun Milk SPF 50+/PA++++* \\- I loved this one, but I'm erring on the side of caution for now and will only keep 1 non-FA safe product in my routine   \n*Tosowoong Pure Green Tea Mask Pack* \\- Tried it just for fun, it felt nice and cooling on my skin but it dried my cheeks out  \n*Dr. Jart+ Clear Skin Lover Rubber Mask* \\- Tried it for funsies, found it at TJ Maxx for cheap. I'm not a big fan... it's meh for the price.  \n*Derma E Purifying 2-in-1 Charcoal Mask* \\- It burned!!

I know a lot of people hate the thought of using makeup wipes... but I do and it works for me. My skin does not feel irritated, but my skin is not your skin. I also don't use oil cleansers because apparently they hate me (or at least the one I tried hates me), but your skin might love them! I have a sensitivity to fatty alcohols, but you might enjoy CeraVe in the tub. YMMV, as always!\n\n**Don't beat yourself up**. This is not a race! You must be patient. Good things come, all in good time. You cannot rush perfection, right? So you have to give your skin time to heal and reveal its potential! It took me a few months to discover a routine that works for me. Some people figured it out in years... we're all on a different timeline so don't compare your progress to someone else's.",

Eventually every single of the 16 virus databases managed by the WIV was taken offline.\n\nhttps://archive.is/i79eW\n\n\n\n**Here's former CDC director Robert Redfield under oath before the Congress on Wuhan Lab September 2019 events:**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/aXXWRaM-sWQ?feature=share\n\n\n>I will say if you go back and look, it's declassified now, and I'm sure you all have your classified briefings, but the declassified information now: \n\n>In September of 2019, three things happened in that lab, one is they deleted the sequences, that was highly irregular, researchers don't usually like to do that\n\n>Second thing they did was they changed the command and control of the lab from the civilian control to the military control. Highly unusual, and I've been involved in dual use labs when I was in the military.\n\n\n>And the third thing they did which I think is really telling is they let a contractor redo the ventilation system in that laboratory. So I think  clearly there was strong evidence that there was a significant event that happened in that laboratory in September. It's now been declassified, you can read it. I'm sure there's more classified information around it.\n\n**Scientist Richard Ebright**\n\n>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction. And here is a proposal from the beginning of 2018 [from Fauci/Gates-funded EcoHealth Alliance] proposing explicitly to engineer that sequence at that position in chimeric lab- generated coronaviruses.\n\n- Richard Ebright, an eminent molecular biologist at Rutgers University, https://archive.is/cCBUw\n\n**Eminent Virologist David Baltimore of CalTech**\n\n>When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine [humanized] codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.\n\n- David Baltimore, an eminent virologist and former president of CalTech, https://archive.is/yalCe\n\n\n**Former CDC Director Robert Redfield:**\n\n>I was concerned because of the presence of the furin cleavage site that we've talked about and I think it's important to understand what that cleavage site does. That cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of COVID, so where before it could not see the ACE2 receptor which is the human receptor, it totally changes the orientation now so it has high affinity for human receptors. So that furin cleavage site bothered me, it didn't seem like it belonged there. \n\n>And then if you look at the sequences they use in those 12 nucleotides for arginine, where the arginine sequence nucleotide triplet were coded for humans. So why did it have the arginine coding for humans and not bat? It was very disconcerting to me. It looked like this virus was engineered.\n\n\n>It's not scientifically plausible that this virus went from a bat to humans and became one of the most infectious viruses that we have for humans. \n\n\n\n**Scientist Valentin Bruttel:**\n\n>I tried to raise awareness to this for a year now.\nWIV use BsaI and BsmBI/Esp3I sites before to make synthetic WIV1 variants.\nAnd exactly those sites appear in a \"silently introduced, perfect for synthetic assembly\" pattern in SARS2, but non of its nat. relatives.\n\n>seriously, what is the chance that exactly those type IIs restriction appear or disappear through random evolution in a Banal-20-52 like virus?\n5-6 precise mutations in 30000bp?\nabout 1 in 10^20!\nSARS2 is clearly synthetic!\n\n**Type Ils restriction sites prove a synthetic origin**\n\nSynthetic RNA viruses are assembled at the DNA level and later transcribed. 30,000 nucleotides cannot be synthesized in one go. These viruses are therefore assembled from smaller, 2- 8,000 nucleotide long pieces. Specific DNA restriction sites are often added to later reassemble the individual building blocks in the correct order. It is also technically possible to hide these interfaces (No See'em), but this was not done in the WIV.\n\nIn a 2017 paper, two very specific, particularly suitable type Ils restriction enzymes were used at the WIV. These have the advantage that they can produce different DNA overhangs (sticky ends), which are crucial for a correct assembly of the complete genome: Bsal and BsmBI.\n\nSARS2 shows a Bsal and BsmBI restriction site pattern which is ideal for assembling synthetic viruses and to later replace the spike protein or furin cleavage site.\n\nBsal and BsmBI restriction sites also exist in closely related viruses (Banal20-52, RaTG13), but these are distributed in such a way that an artificial virus could never be generated using the methods established at WIV 2018/19. \n\n**The probability that the required 5 synonymous mutations, which enable a synthetic assembly of SARS2, arose purely by chance is less than 1 in 10^20 or about as likely as winning the lottery jackpot 3 times in a row.**\n\nDr. Valentin Bruttel\n\nhttps://twitter.com/VBruttel/status/1566365635680124929?t=koDQ9poynY6I9qSchgQAnw&s=19",

    "body": "I figure it's time for my \"miraculously cured\" post since I've been waiting a few months and I'm still feeling ok. My background is that I've suffered from **brain fog, slow thinking, anhedonia, low energy**, and some anxiety and flattened emotions for as long as I can remember. Always felt I should be able to perform better but something was blocking my brain. I've gone through different things trying to fix it, including\n\n- sleep pattern and diet changes, exercise\n- stimulants\n- atomoxetine\n- sarcosine\n- NAC\n- various supplements: vitamins, fish oil, A-GPC, iodine, magnesium, yohimbine, resveratrol, d-ribose, betaine, arginine, citrulline, ALCAR, PQQ, COQ10, and many I don't remember outright\n\nThe various supplements didn't do much, meanwhile the other things gave me major relief for a while, but none of them ended up working reliably for longer than a week, and they lost their effectiveness within the span of weeks to a few months.\n\nSo, then I found out about this \"methylation\" thing, which is really about ameliorating things that function poorly in your metabolism. Here's two of my most memorable resources if you want to read more*:\n\n- https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/blog/2019/03/01/start-here-for-mthfr-and-methylation\n- http://heartfixer.com/AMRI-Nutrigenomics.htm\n\nSo, I figure an **S-adenosylmethionine deficiency** is a thing that's one major source of my problems. I could write tons about that, but I don't want to ramble, you can just google it and read the resources for more info - basically what's for certain is that SAM is important and you don't want to run a deficiency, so if your body is struggling to keep it balanced you need to change something. Without further ado, here's my stack for that:\n\n- **5-MTHF** (metafolin) 100 - 300 ug daily, 100 ug at a time\n\t- Alleviates my brain fog and anhedonia\n\t- Only take more than 100 ug if I don't feel \"right\" that day\n\t- Focused on morning to midday\n\t- Can easily become negative if I take too much, especially with creatine\n- **Creatine** ~4 g daily, 1 g at a time\n\t- Speeds up my thinking and gives me mental energy an resilience\n\t- Gives me physical endurance\n\t- Used to take less, but 4 g helps keep my levels up better and I can tolerate if if I don't take 5-MTHF too much\n- **Glycine** 4 g daily, 2 g at a time\n- **2 big eggs** daily\n\t- Seems to support quick thinking, if I don't take any for a week I become slower and can't function well in quick everyday situations\n\t- **Choline** from them is probably a key factor, the extra protein might also help\n\nI take creatine + 5-MTHF + glycine when I wake up, to start the day. Then I take 0 - 2 doses more of 5-MTHF if I feel a thick brain fog coming in, then I switch to taking creatine for the rest of the day. Dosing hasn't been easy to figure out, and one major thing I've noticed is that there's a downside to taking too much of both creatine and 5-MTHF, where their effect starts becoming the opposite, so I try to space them out except for the initial morning dose.\n\nI also take:\n\n- NAC randomly at least every few days, 320 mg or 160 mg\n\t- Initially fixed my brain fog and should help keep oxidative stress in check\n- A methylated b-complex or B2 and B12 daily\n\t- Making sure I don't miss any other B vitamins\n- Some vitamin C, zinc, selenium about every other day\n\t- These may support methylation related processes\n- Vitamin D 50 ug daily, some magnesium and iodine\n\nEver since starting creatine and 5-MTHF, I've also enjoyed exercise a lot more and actually started noticing cognitive benefits from it, so I make sure to move around daily and properly exercise at least every 3 days. Obviously also make sure to get enough sleep and eat well (avoiding sugar, not eating too much carbs, eating plants).\n\nI've been on this kind of routine for months now and it hasn't pooped out, my quality of life is still way better than ever before, so it really feels like a complete solution for my problems at this point.\n\nThis likely isn't universal for everybody, but if you're struggling with similar symptoms, you could try something like this out. All of the stuff listed is very safe and occurs naturally in food, so give it a try, play around with doses and see if it helps.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATES**\n\n**2021-01-04**\n\nFigured I should do a follow-up on the post. All in all, the stack is still working. It's not 100 % reliable, but I'm still way more functional than \"naturally\", and I no longer have actual bad days, just decent to great. I've made some changes since first posting, and they've increased the frequency of my good days. Here's the gist:\n\n- Creatine: Upped to a static 8 g per day, in doses of 2 g throughout the day. No more issues from it and no effects from extra dosing, feels like my levels are saturated.\n- 5-MTHF: Now try to take at least 300 ug a day, but sometimes take up to 600 ug. If I feel brain fog forming, I take it and it usually goes right away.\n- Choline: I've put an increased focus on it. I found out 5-MTHF worked worse when I didn't get a lot of choline. Could easily be explained by a SAM deficiency, as the body's choline synthesis may use up SAM. I take 500 mg choline bitartrate daily, sometimes up to 1000 mg if 5-MTHF doesn't seem to be working, but no more - you can easily go overboard.\n- I avoid taking creatine, choline or 5-MTHF at the same time - I've found they can interact with each other and somehow go overboard. Maybe a sudden SAM excess? When I take all of these one hour apart, I can easily recognize which supplement is helpful at that time and which isn't, and I avoid any acute interactions.\n- I've added sarcosine - I take 100 - 400 mg on some days. This was just a stroke of luck because I had some lying around and decided to give it a try, then noticed it seemed to make me more present and clear-headed. It doesn't do anything positive if I overdo it, but every few days it seems to become beneficial. Could this indicate a lack of glycine in my brain? Dunno.\n- NAC: It sometimes seems to help a lot when I'm foggy, so I take it more liberally - I've taken about a gram on some days without major adverse effects, but usually around 600 mg max.\n\n**2021-07-23**\n\nI'm still doing better than before, and now my stack seems to be becoming more stable - stable enough that I no longer have to fear it pooping out unexpectedly and not knowing what to do. I'm struggling a bit with my energy levels on some days (putting in a steady amount of productive & challenging work every weekday is still a challenge), but other than that I feel pretty much cured. This will probably be my last update here unless the stack poops out on some day.\n\nHere's the latest adjustments I've made:\n\n- 5-MTHF: 400 ug every day constantly. I also take a mild methylated b-complex OR an equivalent multivitamin every day.\n- Choline: 1100 mg per day normally, but now when I first see signs of my brain stopping working, I take 2750 mg on that day. This seems to ensure I have enough choline around in my body and causes no side effects when done only when needed. I don't take creatine on the same day, because it could interact with choline and make it hard to tell when I've had enough of both.\n- Creatine: I've realized this is the most significant variable in my stack. I take 4.5 grams on a normal day, but sometimes I need up to 10 g per day. Being physically active seems to have an impact on how often I need to boost my creatine levels. On the other hand, taking too much creatine can turn into a negative (for instance increasing my brain fogginess), so I need to be careful with its dosing. I've found a creatine \"overdose\" can have effects for a couple of days in my body.\n- No more need for sarcosine (or proper effects from it), NAC very occasionally at 500+ mg.\n\nMy current routine is focused on having enough choline and creatine, but also not accidentally dosing too much of them. I always dose choline first when I'm starting to feel crappy, so that I know the issue is low creatine rather than a lack of choline. Then I do 1 to 2 days of taking max 10 g of creatine per day - as much as I feel I need until I'm feeling energetic again. This boosting is usually enough to make me feel awake, energetic and functional again, if not then I repeat the cycle 1 or 2 times. If it still doesn't work, I take 1 or 2 of days of reduced dosing to ensure I haven't gone overboard with something, and then try boosting both choline and creatine again. If nothing else worked before, this does. As a result, I still have some weaker days when I'm trying to improve my SAM levels, but no more completely crappy and hopeless periods where nothing seems to work.\n\n**2021-10-09**\n\nFeels like I've finally found a system that completely solves my problems! The key was [vitamin A and the GNMT enzyme](https://old.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/q4smba/if_youre_having_problems_with_overmethylation/) - earlier I've been supplementing glycine to support GNMT, but it didn't seem to do all that much lately - turns out because I might have been deficient on vitamin A! Supplementing vit A has made me much more resistant to \"over-doses\" of choline and creatine, presumably through improved GNMT function in combination with glycine. Thanks to this, I have been able to increase my creatine doses a bit, making my stack work really steadily and reliably now, with hardly any negatives!\n\nI've increased my normal creatine doses to 6.5 grams a day now, I supplement 1500 ug of retinyl palmitate daily and I increased my glycine doses to 10 grams a day. Everything else is the same as before. I feel way steadier and consistently functional now, but I still need occasional boosts of creatine and choline every few days - when I notice my brain slowing down I do as previously described, take one day to boost my choline intake, then 1 to 2 days to boost creatine. Now one round of boosting is enough to get my head working again, so I really have almost no moments of fog and lethargy anymore! I'm basically fixed, and it's still a bit hard to believe that this was really the thing that's been my issue all these years...\n\n---\n\n\\* *They don't cite academic sources, but they're readable (though the second one is kind of messy), and you can verify anything you find by using search engines such as google scholar.*\n\nPosted on other subs too:\n\n- https://old.reddit.com/r/SCT/comments/ia51a9/what_worked_for_me_5mthf_creatine_and_glycine/?\n- https://old.reddit.com/r/hangovereffect/comments/ia517b/what_worked_for_me_5mthf_creatine_and_glycine/?\n- https://old.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/ia4zlr/what_worked_for_me_5mthf_creatine_and_glycine/?\n- https://old.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/ia511w/what_worked_for_me_5mthf_creatine_and_glycine/?",

        "body": "Wow thank you for posting this, I recently started using creatine with glycine and noticed a huge energy boost mentally/physically, but despite that still have absolutely terrible anhedonia that keeps getting worse and only ever kinda goes away when I take adderall(not consistently though), and my brain fog never really seems to clear up. I've got a few questions. Your symptoms are pretty much just like adhd right? I haven't been officially diagnosed with adhd but I'm pretty sure I have it and my symptoms are a copy paste of yours so maybe these things may really help. Lastly any brand recommendations and can I take these effectively along with my standard supplements?(multi, fish oil, vit d/k2, probiotic, magnesium bisglycinate)",

        "body": "This is interesting--so, are there any particular signs you recognize when you've overdosed on methylfolate in particular?\n\nI've been tired all my life, quit caffeine about two months ago, went through hell for three weeks, and then had a week where it basically felt like I was on amphetamines the whole time, except in the most natural, pleasant possible way--I was studying for 14 hours a day indefatigably, and loving every moment of it. I was also finally sleeping for eight hours instead of ten, and waking up feeling rested, so I was sure that I had solved all my problems by quitting caffeine. It was pure hyperthymia, with no negative side effects whatsoever, and I was actually convinced that I'd get to live the rest of my life that way.\n\nThen I slowly began to feel like garbage again, and now I probably feel about as bad as I ever did before, with the quirk that I now suffer from inadequate sleep duration and wake up after about six hours, which is a problem I've never before experienced, and continue to  wake up feeling totally unrested as has been the norm for my whole life.\n\nIncidentally, I began taking Smarty Pants multivitamins, which contain 600mcg of methylfolate, at around the time I quit coffee, perhaps slightly before that. I wonder if my magical Ubermensch week post-caffeine withdrawal could have been the methylfolate supplementation honeymoon period I seem to have heard about. I've suspected I suffer from an MTHFR problem for a while, but hadn't given it a whole lot of thought lately until just now. I remember thinking \"Ah, it's methylated folate, so I should be okay\", apparently forgetting the fact that it's quite possible for MTHFR sufferers to overdose even on methylated folate.",

I’m here to tell you it’s not the end of the world and if you told me that a few months ago I would assume you are joking. I got it from a partner who was asymptomatic and didn’t know he had it. I will never forget my first outbreak. I couldn’t move. It was itching and burning like I was on fire. I thought no one would want me and because I am a woman who likes to be really hard on choosing partners, I thought this was the end of the world because no one would want me but I was wrong. I told all my partners, no one had a problem. I never infected anybody and I had intercourse with and without a condom. Men still treat me the same and I even went on a date with a doctor who said that it’s very common and I shouldn’t be worried. I had two very very very mild outbreaks. It was two or three pimples,just a little bit itchy and that’s it. To prevent outbreaks all I do is eat well ( chocolate is full of arginine which is risky for outbreaks). I take supplements for the immune system and 1000 mg of lysine every day that’s it. It’s not the end of the world. It’s very common. It doesn’t damage your health. Remember, there’s people living with cancer, HIV and life-threatening diseases. We shouldn’t complain about it. Just make sure to live life to the fullest. Have a lot of sex and love a lot. For me, it’s better to use a condom even if you’re in a relationship with someone not because you are going to infect them but because of pregnancy, utis etc. I’m here to tell you most men don’t care. I just had one friend of mine who judged me for it and I just said bye-bye and I have no problems. Keep in mind I work in a hospital so I talk with a lot of doctors and a lot of doctors flirt with me and they don’t care about my herpes cause they see it every day they know that it’s not harmful and that you can control and prevent Infecting others so please don’t stress about it. Don’t be sad. Life is beautiful. Love you all. I wish everybody an amazing summer full of positivity.",

For total internal reflection to occur, light has to bend AWAY from the normal and the only way for that to happen is if n2/n1 is less than 1. If n2/n1 is greater than 1, light bends TOWARDS normal and total internal reflection does not occur (there will be no critical angle). \n\nI also use this idea to help me figure out what happens when light hits a new medium. If n2 is greater than n1, light bends twds normal and if n2 is less than n1, light bends away. Since n=c/v, where c is speed of light in vacuum and v is speed of light in medium, a different refractive index MUST correlate with a different wave speed in the medium. FREQUENCY NEVER CHANGES (at least for mcat), so because v=lambda\\*frequency, WAVELENGTH MUST CHANGE. Also, since n=1 in a vacuum (n essentially = c/c), any n>1 will have a lower wave speed than c. Nothing is faster than speed of light, so no n will be less than 1 lol. But just remember that if you have two mediums, the medium with the higher n will have the lower wave speed through that medium and thus a lower wavelength.",

    "body": "***Edit! -*** u/BerdLaw *linked me t**hree* *studies on sake -- one specifically about sake extract.* *I've linked them all in the sources below.*\n\n*One in vitro (meaning in a dish or tube) study showed that rice wine increased  \"the expression of procollagen and laminin-5,\"\\*⁴ which is one of the key components in the intercellular makeup of the layer that holds the epidermis to the dermis. Additionally, \"laminin 5 also accelerates the assembly of basement membranes and may enhance the recovery of damaged skin.\"⁵* *In the same study, experiments were done on hairless mice (in vivo) and showed that topical application protected the mouse from photo-aging.*\n\n*Another study* *show**ed* *that sake extract inhibited tyrosinase, both in vivo (in a living organism) and in vitro, though it is unclear how many subjects were involved based on the abstract alone.⁶*\n\n*More notes: First study comes from Doosan Group R&D, which seems primarily interested in vehicles, construction, electrical, etc., while the second study was paid for by AMOREPACIFIC R&D.*\n\nHiyas!\n\nMany of you love Kiku's High Moist, so I picked it up the last time I went to my local Murakai market in SoCal so I could try it out and figure out what all the hype was about.\n\nThis is a bit of a review slash ingredient breakdown, so I hope you enjoy!\n\n\\---\n\n>*Full Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol ,* ***Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake)****, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Leucine,* ***Ceramide 3***, ***Ceramide 6***, ***Placental Protein***, ***Arbutin***\\*\\*,\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (Licorice Root Extrac\\*\\*\\*\\*t)\\**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein, Maltitol, Methyl Gluceth-10, Peg-6 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Fragrance.*\n\nI've highlighted the ingredients that are worth discussing a bit in detail.\n\n# Ingredient Breakdown\n\nSake is a fermented product made from [rice](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/01/sake-rice-how-sake-is-made-rice-varieties-brewing-sake.html), [water](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-school-the-importance-of-water-in-sake-making-where-does-sake-come-from.html), [koji](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/koji-the-miracle-mold-how-sake-is-made.html), and [yeast](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-yeast-temperature-yeast-strains.html). Ferments have been all the rage recently, with *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (living yeast) extract and *Saccharomyces ferment* being the two I see the most. While I could not find any clinical dermatology studies done on sake as a ferment in skin, we may be able to glean some understanding into the benefits of sake by examining both ferments and koji (kojic acid) itself.\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of yeast used for brewing beer. In one study, saccharomyces cerevisiae extract (SCE) was studied in several formulations. One contained SCE, and/or vitamins A, C, and E, and was patch-tested on the back of volunteers. The subjects were then tested for transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin moisture (SM), skin microrelief (SMR), and free radical protection in 3 hour, 15 days, and 30 day intervals.\n\n>*\"Our results suggest that vitamins and SCE showed effects in \\[skin moisture\\] SM and \\[skin microrelief\\] SMR. Only formulations containing SC had long term effects in the improvement of SMR. Thus, these kinds of evaluations are very important in cosmetics development to evaluate the best risk and benefit correlation.\"¹*\n\nAnother fungi ferment, saccharomyces ferment, has similar benefits. It is obtained through the fermentation of saccharomyces - a genus of fungi that is known as the baker's yeast - in the presence of metal ions. The yeast is credited with promoting good skin condition and is frequently found in products that reduce redness.\n\nThe other half of sake worth discussing, koji (kojic acid) is a skin-lightening agent and antioxidant. It is a tyrosinase (an enzyme that controls the production of melanin) inhibitor, but not as effective as other tyrosinase inhibitors like licorice extract. \"In combination with allantoin and other proper ingredients in sunscreen preparations, the mixture can inhibit UV-caused erythema and accelerate wound healing.\"² Unfortunately, it can also be sensitizing to some skin and create irritation.\n\nFrom this break down, we can assume that sake contains some sort of very mild exfoliating, humectant, and whitening properties, though it is important to keep in mind that there are no studies that I could find into the benefits of sake when applied topically, so this is all assumptions based on the chemical makeup.\n\nThe next ingredients on the list are ceramides 3 and 6. If you've been following my writings, you already know that ceramides are naturally found in the skin and help maintain the skin barrier. In fact, our skin's natural lipids are 35-40&#37; ceramides.\n\nSlightly more exciting is placental protein. Derived from animal placenta ([in this case, horse](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5fgonk/psa_kikumasamune_does_not_use_ingredient_derived/)), it is considered to be a safe ingredient that does not deliver any metabolic or endocrine activity. Again though, there was not much precedent that I could find on the benefits of including this ingredient specifically, however egg whites have been used for centuries on skin to make skin temporarily feel tighter and appear smoother.\n\n*Fun fact: Umbilical extract has precedent for unrestricted use in Japan, except for certain products.³*\n\nFinally, we arrive at the stars of this product: arbutin and licorice root extract. Arbutin, an ingredient primarily used for it's antioxidant properties as well as skin bleaching. It is a natural hydroquinone, derived synthetically or from bearberry plants. Once on the skin, it converts into hydroquinone and acts as a tyrosinase inhibitor. While not as effective as hydroquinone, it lacks the concerns of hydroquinone thus has become more popular in recent years.\n\nLicorice root extract is similarly a tyrosinase inhibitor as well as an anti-irritant - with some studies signalling that it may be able to absorb UVA and UVB rays. It is more effective than kojic acid and some studies put it at 75x more effective than ascorbic acid ([though Dr Dray raises some interesting points regarding the efficacy of L-AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JxO6sVMJzM)). \"The chief constituent of licorice root is glycyrrhizin, present in concentrations that range from 5 to 24 percent depending on the variety of licorice used.\"²\n\n# My Experience\n\n**My skin type:** Rosacean, acne-prone and extremely irritation-prone\n\nFirstly, the pump on my bottle broke off rather spectacularly when my bottle took a tumble from my tiny bathroom counter top. I'm not sure why this product comes with a pump applicator in the first place, as it frequently would dispense more product than I needed, which I suppose is fine as I was able to spread it down my neck and chest, but it was still was a bit of a shock to get a whole handful of it on the first pump. This experience doesn't seem limited to me, so I really recommend decanting this product into a better dispenser if you can, like a spritz top bottle.\n\nPackaging aside, the first time I used the High Moist lotion, I was pretty nervous. It's a very runny product, sharing a consistency with water, and if you've read my blog at all you know that I am a fairly dry-skinned lady. To my surprise and delight though, it was *uber* moisturizing. I applied it fresh out of the shower, in place of my HadaLabo Premium, and instantly my skin just felt soft and supple. I imagine much of this is due to the placenta protein filling in the gaps of the skin cells and creating a \"smooth\" texture as well as the ceramides, which tend to plump up my skin and make it feel softer.\n\nThe fragrance was also so mild that frankly, the smell of sake overpowered it. Thankfully this smell seemed to dissipate after a few minutes of application, and my rosacea did not flare up from the inclusion of fragrance. Over the next few days, I used the High Moist in place of my HadaLabo, and then began to combine it at night with the HadaLabo Premium on top. It worked well with oils and other moisturizing products on top - no pilling or strange film to report.\n\nIn two weeks, my skin looked brighter and felt smoother, though none of my dark spots had faded. Unfortunately, like most products with ferments, it began to break me out after this time. The good news though is that it doesn't appear to break me out immediately, unlike every other ferment, and the smoothness lasted for a few days after I discontinued use, which means I may try to use it sparingly once my skin heals.\n\n# Sources\n\n1.

For example I take my supplements in the morning, before starting working at the computer, where I'm still, in silence and completely in my head. I tend to notice very much if something is different in my body and I usually connected it back to either a supplement I took or a particular food I had for breakfast. Sure, this could be very well be placebo, but from my personal experience I'm almost sure it's not. I think meditation can also help in making you more aware of stuff that's happening in you. The thing is, if you had more energy or felt like crap would you be able to tell if it was from a supplement, from food, from a bad night sleep or anything else?\n\nBut then again, I also tend to feel only a small percentage of the supplements I take. So I guess it also depends on you stack. I wouldn't expect you to feel anything particular after taking a multi vitamins or fish oil (at least that's my experience).",

Hit bottom a year ago when it forced me to forego participating in family holiday gatherings. I was a giant mess. Last resort, turned to talk therapy: I can't cure the insomnia but can I improve the way I react to it? Tools, strategies, coping mechanisms? Nothing against therapy, it was not helpful to me. Second last resort, diet changes to low histamine, ultra anti inflammatory, but the biggest most dramatic change in my negative spiraling came with the addition of omega 3s, first ground flax then fish oil (within a multivitamin). I was a complete skeptic about supplements, now I am a complete convert. Placebo effect? Don't know. I feel like my sanity has been saved, and I believe it is a reduction in inflammation that did it. I still sleep like shit several nights per week, which is inflammatory in itself, but I no longer go to such a dark place over it.

It also does not bind to or has low affinity for a range of ion channels including those for Na+], K+], Cl-] and Ca2+].\n\nELI5: Escitalopram is a clean \"serotonin-only\" drug. \n\nBased on reading extensive scientific papers and anecdotal reports, most positive/negative impacts can be boiled down to the following: \n\n**The Top 3 positive impacts include:** \n\n- decreased anxiety \n- decreased stress \n- increased confidence \n\n**The Top 3 negative impacts include:** \n\n- fatigue \n- sexual side effects\n- apathy, lack of motivation \n\nMost of these negative side effects are likely attributed to dopamine: \n\n- increasing 5HT turns down DA release; \n- decrease DA in the pituitary increases prolactin.  \n\n**Optimization of Escitalopram**\n\nIn order of importance: \n\n**1. Sleep:** \n\n- 8+ hours per night minimum; \n- Use a reliable sleep tracker to track metrics such as HRV; \n- No electronics at night; \n- Use blue-light blocking glasses at night;\n- Ensure your room is cold and pitch dark. \n\n**2. Exercise:** \n\n- Aerobic exercise: 2-4 hours per week of Zone 2 training. \n- Resistance training: 1-2 times a week; ideally compound movements (squats & deadlifts). \n\n**3. Nutrition:**\n\n- Avoid all sugars & refined carbohydrates (do not eat white bread, pizza, pasta, pastries, etc). \n- Eat more clean proteins & fats; look into the Ketogenic diet as an example. \n- Intermittent fasting: ideally 3 or 4 24-hour fasts per month; to learn more start with [this Podcast featuring Jason Fung, MD & Peter Attia, MD](https://peterattiamd.com/jasonfung/)\n- Water: clean filtered water, 1.0L+ per day minimum; purchase a water filtration system and refillable bottle. r/HydroHomies/\n- Do not drink soda/pop, alcohol, smoke cannabis, or smoke tobacco. \n\n**4. Lifestyle:**\n\n- Light therapy: Morning sunlight (get outside, ideally) or in winter a 10,000 LUX SAD light and/or near-infrared (NIR) light photobiomodulation (PBM). Get your Vitamin D3 levels checked if you live in a winter climate. \n- Meditation: 20-30 minutes per day; several Apps available to walk you through via guided meditations. \n- Stress reduction: try and get outside into nature and go for a walk whenever possible. \n\n**5. Nootropics/Supplements:** \n\n- L-Tyrosine \n- L-Arginine\n- Phenylalanine\n- Magnesium (L-Threonate)  \n- Cannabidiol (CBD) - full-spectrum in organic oil base\n- Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) - Omega-3s\n- Vitamin D3 \n- Vitamin B6\n- Vitamin B9\n- Vitamin B12\n\n**6.

    "body": "After four years of consistent lifting (7 days a week, 90 minutes a day), and trying nearly every over-the-counter supplement, here's what I’ve learned - \n\n\n\n1. Do You Need Supplements to Build Muscle?\n\nShort answer: No.\n\nSupplements can help with performance, recovery, and convenience—but they are not essential for muscle growth or fitness. The human body responds to stimulus (exercise), and will grow with or without supplements if nutrition and training are on point.\n\n\n2. The Core Stack: What Actually Helps\n\na) Protein (Whey vs. Soy)\n\nSoy Protein: Cheaper, easier to digest, and just as effective for muscle growth for most people.\n\nWhey Protein: Faster absorbing and slightly higher in leucine, making it technically superior but the real-world difference is negligible unless you're an elite athlete. I used whey for 3 years before switching to soy and I saw no difference whatsoever. Soy also does not effect hormones and is easier on the kidneys for long term use ( 30-40 year span)\n\nVerdict: Choose soy if you're on a budget. Whey is a fine option if you prefer taste and digest it well. \n\nPs - Do not ever choose a mass gainer. They are absolutely useless and you can just have a proper whey or soy and add banana or even just plain sugar/honey to add in calories and have the same effect. \n\n\nb) Creatine Monohydrate\n\nSafest, most researched supplement.\n\nNo need to load or cycle. 3–5g per day is enough.\n\nMyths about hair loss or kidney damage are not supported by evidence.\n\nVerdict: Must-have for strength and muscle performance.\n\n\nc) Multivitamins & Omega-3\n\nMultis won’t “boost” performance unless you’re deficient—but they can help fill dietary gaps.\n\nOmega-3s (EPA/DHA) support heart and joint health.\n\nVerdict: A smart preventative choice, especially for overall health.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Testosterone Boosters: Mostly Hype (Might just be my experience since I am a young healthy male with peak testosterone coursing through my blood) \n\nAshwagandha: Mild mood improvement and stress relief. No noticeable muscle gain.\n\nTongkat Ali: I saw a big libido boost, possible aggression and acne. Effects taper off after two weeks. \n\nShilajit: No noticeable effects. Absolutely useless. \n\nVerdict: Skip these unless you're older or have clinically low testosterone.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Overhyped or gimmicky Supplements\n\nShilajit, Melatonin Gummies, Collagen, etc: Useful only if you have a deficiency.\n\nMagnesium Glycinate vs. ZMA: ZMA does what mag gly does but more with the zinc and is cheaper because its not marketed extensively.\n\n\nVerdict: Always check the actual dosage ( Serving amount) and look for better price online if you end up wanting to buy them anyways. \n\n\n\n5. Underrated Supplements/hidden gems \n\na) GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)\n\nGreat for sleep and anxiety.\n\nMight support growth hormone release.\n\nCan cause grogginess.\n\n\nb) L-Citrulline\n\nBoosts nitric oxide, improves pumps, blood flow, and endurance.\n\nMore effective than arginine, since arginine taken orally does not have the same effect as the doseage you read on google. You will need 5-6 grams of arginine to have enough bioavailability to see any results. \n\n\nc) Potassium\n\nHelps manage blood pressure, muscle cramps, and electrolyte balance.\n\nMost diets are too low in potassium.\n\n\nd) NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide)\n\nSupports cardiovascular health and cellular energy.\n\nPromising but still early in human research. Excellent for cardio athletes. \n\n\ne) Resveratrol\n\nMay help with appetite control and fat loss.\n\nMixed evidence. Possible side effects.  Proceed with caution.\n\n\nf) Astaxanthin\n\nAntioxidant with benefits for muscle recovery, heart health, and skin.\n\nExpensive, but worth considering for longevity.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary: What to Actually Use\n\nFor Beginners:\n\nSoy Protein\n\nCreatine Monohydrate\n\nMultivitamin\n\nOmega-3\n\n\nIf You are rich:\n\nAdd NMN and Astaxanthin for long-term health.\n\n\n\nFinal Note: Supplements are just supplements to good training, nutrition, and recovery. Focus on consistency, and let your supplement choices reflect your actual needs, not marketing hype.\n\n\n\n  ",

If I can get to 12DPO, I’ll be thrilled because then we’ve got a fighting chance to conceive.  Yay!\n\nUPDATE: Under medical supervision by an MD!! I get acupuncture, and I have been using a combination of Vitex  in powdered form and in a tincture, taking N-Acetyl-Cysteine, L-Arginine, vitamin E, and an estrogen replacement called Symplex F. If this works, then I won’t need progesterone. I have other things I’m taking since we suspect that my fertility has been impacted by other health issues, but these are directly related to lengthening the luteal phase and making a cushier lining for implantation. I also drink an infusion recommended by an herbalist of red clover, rose hip, hibiscus, dandelion and red raspberry.  \n\nI have been off the Nuva ring since May 2018 and actively temping/trying since then. I have been using ovulation strips since June 2019 and receiving treatment for fertility since then as well. \n\nThanks for sharing my happiness today! Best of luck to all of you!! ❤️",

Photos 5 and 6 are from an Orang County, CA TJ Maxx. Stores are clean and organized.\n\nHAUL and mini review: (dry/dehydrating/30/Socal)\n\n**Laneige cica sleeping mask $20 60 mL**. My ride or die cica cream that I always need to have in stock. I ran out in March and was gonna buy more on my Japan trip, but couldnt find it in Japan. I didnt really wanna deal with the shipping and tariffs mess with online retailers so I intended to buy it whenever theres a sale at my local Amorepacific/Aritaum store. Regular price is $34, I was hoping to snag it on a 30% sale for \\~ $25, but TJ Maxx selling it for $20 is fantastic. Even Stylevana only has it on sale for $24 right now. I was devastated that this TJ only has 1 in stock. \n\nMini review: Nothing soothes my skin the way this cica cream does it, especially on hotter days. Its my fall back whenever my skin acts up. 10/10. Have been repurchasing for 5 years I think.\n\nIngredients: Water, Propanediol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Squalane, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Glycerin, Panthenol, Cetearylalcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, 1,2-hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Hydroxyethylacrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Tauratecopolymer, Butylene Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Caprylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Sorbitan Isostearate, Asiatic Acid, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**Parnell  cicamanu cotton clear pad $5 90 pads.** This was a clearance item. I didnt even know Parnell sells skincare. I thought they're a makeup company that focuses on cushions. Just checked Stylevana, its being sold for $18.\n\nIngredients: Water, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, C12-14 Pareth-12, Glycereth-26, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glyceryl Caprylate, Betaine, Allantoin, Trehalose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Leptospermum Scoparium Leaf Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Honey Extract, Gluconolactone, Ceramide NP, Anastatica Hierochuntica Extract, Lactobacillus Ferment, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Madecassoside, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Dr. Jart Ceramidin cream $25 30mL + 50mL**. Have not tried. The Dr. Jart cica cream is a thin gel that was too thin for my dry skin so Im hoping this ceramidin cream is thicker. Currently $30 for 50 ML on Yesstyle.\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Methyl Trimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dicaprylyl Ether, Cetearyl Olivate, Panthenol, Glyceryl Stearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Olivate, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, 2,3-Butanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Ceramide NP(2,070ppm), Ceramide NG(2,070ppm), Ceramide NS(2,070ppm), Ceramide AS(2,070ppm), Ceramide AP(529ppm), Cholesterol, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cellulose Gum, Dextrin, Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Citronellol, Tocopherol, Tartrazine\n\n**S.Nature Aqua Squalane Moisturzing Cream $10 60 mL.** Have not tried. Currently $20 on Yesstyle. Interested in trying because the ingredients look good for this price. New brand to me.\n\nIngredients: Water, Squalane (150,000ppm), Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Adenosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Arginine, Allantoin, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n**Sulwhasoo Perfecting Cushion $25 for 2.** Crazy good deal. Its usually $65 for 2. I know its on sale because this is the old version and the new version in store is that ugly boring orange packaging. Got it for my aunt.\n\nAt this point, Im going to TJ Maxx every other day. Its my form of stress release. Thank goodness the deals are reasonable. ",

    "body": " \n\nLike many of you, I hate that this takes so damn long, and I've also wondered why some people can restore much faster than others. Recently, while researching these issues, I chanced upon some information which led me to what seems to be a new discovery that may help speed up the glacial pace of restoring progress.\n\n**Short version:**\n\nThere is a group of substances, known as vasodilators, which act upon the vascular smooth muscle cells in the Dartos Fascia (the bottom layer of the penile shaft skin and mucosa) in a way that appears to speed up the process of growing a foreskin.\n\n**Method of action:**\n\nVasodilators are commonly used to control blood pressure. They act in various ways to relax the walls of arteries, increasing the diameter of the artery and letting more blood flow, thereby lowering blood pressure.\n\nNow here's the connection: the tissue in the artery walls that vasodilators act on is the same vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) that are in the Dartos Fascia. Vasodilators appear to act the same on both tissues. It's this relaxation of the VSMC that provides the benefit for foreskin restoration.\n\n**How this was discovered:**\n\n[A guy wandered into our little oasis with the most over-the-top restoration story possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/foreskin_restoration/comments/1auskyu/unintentional_restoration/). Amazingly enough, his story checked out, as much as it could be. That got me looking into how Cialis could have affected his progress, and then I had the 'Aha!' moment when I made the vasodilator-VSMC-Dartos Fascia connection. In short order I found several other restorers with similar experiences, then realized my own much-better-than-average restoring results were likely aided by the prescription vasodilator I take for blood pressure. I've collected 10+ case histories of restorers with similar journeys. The pattern is clear enough that I feel confident it's time to put this out to our community.\n\nHere are some of our members who have given me information and have graciously consented to being identified\" \n\n[u/Disastrous\\_Cost3980](https://www.reddit.com/user/Disastrous_Cost3980/) has experienced far better than average foreskin growth while using several vasodilator supplements. \n\n[u/uneeknesss](https://www.reddit.com/user/uneeknesss/) is a relatively new restorer who has also achieved well-above-average results while using a prescription vasodilator, losartan and a nitrous oxide supplement.\n\nu/AllAboutTime2 restored from a painfully tight CI-0 to CI-2 in 20 months without even knowing foreskin restoration was possible. He was treating another condition with a traction rig and a prescription vasodilator.\n\n [u/Prepucious10](https://www.reddit.com/u/Prepucious10) has achieved far better than average results in his first 6 months while using several vasodilator supplements. \n\n**What are these vasodilators?**\n\nMany substances readily available as supplements are known to be vasodilators, including:\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids, L-Arginine, L-Citrulline, Creatine, Taurine, Horny Goat Weed, Pomegranate and Pipirine are among the ones that restorers have mentioned to me. [Here is a paper with a lot more](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8048554/). These supplements are known to be safe when taken in moderate amounts, however you must do your own research and determine which is right for you and how much to take.\n\nThere are also prescription vasodilators, including: daily Cialis, ACE II inhibitors like Lisinopril, ARBs like Losartan and CCBs like Amlodipine. While they seem to be more potent than supplements, they are prescription drugs for a reason, and must only be used with a doctor's prescription.\n\n**How can vasodilators help us restore faster?**\n\nThe foreskin has 3 layers: epidermis, dermis and Dartos Fascia. In the common medical procedure of tissue expansion, doctors can double the area of skin - epidermis and dermis only - in 3 to 4 months, while it takes us up to 36 months to do the same. There are several reasons for the speed difference, including the presence of the VSMC in the Dartos Fascia, which has always seemed like the most difficult of the 3 tissues to grow.\n\nThe VSMC of the Dartos Fascia will always resist being stretched - it's job is to keep the shaft skin and mucosa snug to the interior erectile structure of the penis - so helping it relax may do 2 things: 1) allow more tension to be felt by the dermis and 2) increase the rate of growth of the VSMC itself.\n\nThere is plenty of scientific evidence proving how vasodilators affect VSMC, and I will be happy to provide details if asked. I'll also put up a post with more on the scientific information.\n\n**How to use this information:**\n\nIf you're interested in vasodilators, you must do your own research. There's plenty available. Google 'Is L-Arginine a vasodilator?', then 'Is L-Arginine safe?', and go from there. WebMD has been a reliable source of information for me.  The supplements I listed above are widely regarded as safe, and are readily available from reputable sources, like drug stores and Amazon.\n\nI think the easiest and best way to start using vasodilators is with Omega-3 fatty acids. Aside from how they can help your restoration progress, they are arguably the best dietary supplement you can take. So you get multiple benefits.\n\nL-Arginine and L-Citrulline are common amino acids (they are related, and you probably don't have to take them both), and WebMD has info on safe dosages for these and other supplements.\n\nWe obviously know little about effective dosages of any of these supplements, so it's up to us to experiment (starting slowly) and share knowledge. One of the restorers I talked to used 3 to 5 grams of L-Arginine daily with excellent results.\n\nPart of the reason I'm putting out this information is so that we can collect data on how well vasodilators assist restoration progress. If you do decide to experiment with one or more of these substances, please keep data on your tugging progress. If you've been using a vasodilator during your restoration journey (without knowing it would help, of course), please let me know how you have progressed.\n\n**For those using prescription meds for blood pressure, BPH or ED:**\n\nSome BP meds are vasodilators, others, like diuretics, aren't. If you're restoring and taking a non-vasodilator for BP, you may have the option to switch to a medication that is - but only at a doctor's direction, of course.\n\nViagra and Cialis are potent vasodilators, but when taken occasionally, are probably of little to no use for restoration. Daily-use Cialis, however, has been used by 4 different restorers who have had outstandingly fast results, including the accidental restorer linked above.\n\nAgain, these are prescription medications for good reasons. Do not mess around with them. Talk to your doctor, and only use them with a legitimate prescription.\n\n**One last note - vasoconstrictors:**\n\nJust as there are vasodilators, there are vasoconstrictors - substances that cause blood vessels to narrow. just as they have the opposite effect on blood pressure, vasoconstrictors likely have a negative effect on restoration progress. I don't have any data - yet - to back this up, but the logic is sound. \n\nNicotine is a vasoconstrictor, so if you smoke, you should quit, and if foreskin restoration is your motive, that's fine. Pseudoephedrine, the active ingredient in Sudafed and other OTC meds, is also a vasoconstrictive, especially in extended-release form.\n\nBrand new discovery: many OTC allergy meds contain both fexofenadine, an antihistamine, and pseudoephedrine, a decongestant. Allegra-D has both, Allegra has no pseudoephedrine. Restorers who are taking Allegra-D but who can get adequate relief from Allegra may find their restoration progress improved.\n\n**Finally:**\n\nIf I was a scientist, I'd be setting up some trials and studies to figure this out, but I'm not. Thanks to the lack of interest in foreskin restoration from the medical and scientific communities, we have to rely on ad-hoc, crowd-sourced research to make advancements.\n\nDon't use these substances if you haven't satisfied yourself that they are safe - don't rely on my word, do your own research. And if you do use them, please let us know how well they work, and at what dosage. That's how we can determine whether vasodilators are as useful as I believe they are.\n\nOh, one more thing: if you don't know for sure that your blood pressure is in the normal range for your age, PLEASE get it checked, even if you're young. It might not only save your life, but if you do have high blood pressure (or if it's marginal), you may need a prescription drug to help control it... and if so, make sure (if possible) that it's a vasodilator, so you can help your restoration progress as well.\n\nThanks for reading and Keep on Tugging!\n\nCheers.",

Fear, anxiety, grief, mental stress, frustration, etc are vasoconstrictors. Stands to reason the mentality of the restorer also plays a large role in all of this.",

I have been around the restoration scene for probably over 15years now (not actively restoring that whole time, mind), and I seem to have noticed that many of the restorers that report fairly rapid progress seem to be older (which would go against the prevailing narrative that you get restorers should experience quicker growth due to higher levels of HGH etc). \n\nI had a theory that it could be explained by the changes in skin as we age i.e reduction of collagen or the changes to the thickness of the skin etc, but it still remains a theory. It could also be a down to elder people taking more vasodilators for BP. It would be interesting to see if there is a correlation between age and speed of skin growth 👍.\n\nWhat would also be an interesting data point to collect would be general diet (plant based/carnivore/keto etc), but this would prob be too much information for this study into vasodilators. It is however, high time that someone did what you are trying to do here in actually collecting data from restorers to try to optimise this process.\n\nAll the best on this endeavour, I let you know if I start any supplements etc.",

Two that come up in an immediate search on my favorite herbal site are feverfew and cayenne.  \nI am thinking about the possibility of making an oil infusion with one or more vasodilator herbs, which would be massaged directly onto the foreskin (maybe whole penis?) once or more a day.\n\nThere would be several advantages to this over supplements and prescription drugs: no (or miniscule chance of) adverse reactions with existing medication, quality control, and a direct tool instead of a \"broad spectrum\" supplement. This would also possibly work well for manual tuggers.\n\nThe most obvious downside is that device wearers would need to wash the oil off before wearing their device again. There is also the small but very unignorable possibility of adverse reactions with applying a vasodilator directly to the penis every day.\n\nI will contact an herbalist friend and see if he will give input into this idea.",

    "body": "NOTE: Sorry for the WEIRD MARKDOWN. The new Reddit's editor is a damn mess and I am constantly cleaning its crummy markdown.\n\nHi, SCA.\n\nSomeone requested more reviews and breakdowns, so I figured I would post this here. I originally posted it in r/AsianBeauty where I got some excellent feedback and thoughts.\n\nThis is a bit of a review slash ingredient breakdown, so I hope you enjoy!\n\n\\---\n\n>*Full Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol ,* ***Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake)****, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Leucine,* ***Ceramide 3***, ***Ceramide 6***, ***Placental Protein***, ***Arbutin***,***Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (Licorice Root Extract)****, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein, Maltitol, Methyl Gluceth-10, Peg-6 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Fragrance.*\n\nI've highlighted the ingredients that are worth discussing a bit in detail.\n\n# Ingredient Breakdown\n\nSake is a fermented product made from [rice](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/01/sake-rice-how-sake-is-made-rice-varieties-brewing-sake.html), [water](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-school-the-importance-of-water-in-sake-making-where-does-sake-come-from.html), [koji](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/koji-the-miracle-mold-how-sake-is-made.html), and [yeast](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-yeast-temperature-yeast-strains.html). Ferments have been all the rage recently, with *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (living yeast) extract and *Saccharomyces ferment* being the two I see the most.\n\nA couple of studies on sake (specifically rice wine and sake extract) showed multiple benefits. One in vitro (meaning in a dish or tube) study showed that rice wine increased  \"the expression of procollagen and laminin-5,\"⁴ which is one of the key components in the intercellular makeup of the layer that holds the epidermis to the dermis. Additionally, \"laminin 5 also accelerates the assembly of basement membranes and may enhance the recovery of damaged skin.\"⁵In the same study, experiments were done on hairless mice (in vivo) and showed that topical application protected the mouse from photo-aging.\n\nAnother study showed \\*that sake extract inhibited tyrosinase, both in vivo (in a living organism) and in vitro, though it is unclear how many subjects were involved based on the abstract alone.⁶\n\nIt's important to note that the first study I mentioned comes from Doosan Group R&D, which seems primarily interested in vehicles, construction, electrical, etc., while the second study was paid for by AMOREPACIFIC R&D - a popular skincare company.\n\nWhile these studies are minimal, we may be able to glean some deeper understanding into the benefits of sake by examining two of the most popular (and more studied) ferments as well as koji (kojic acid) itself.\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of yeast used for brewing beer. In one study, saccharomyces cerevisiae extract (SCE) was studied in several formulations. One contained SCE, and/or vitamins A, C, and E, and was patch-tested on the back of volunteers. The subjects were then tested for transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin moisture (SM), skin microrelief (SMR), and free radical protection in 3 hour, 15 days, and 30 day intervals.\n\n>*\"Our results suggest that vitamins and SCE showed effects in \\[skin moisture\\] SM and \\[skin microrelief\\] SMR. Only formulations containing SC had long term effects in the improvement of SMR. Thus, these kinds of evaluations are very important in cosmetics development to evaluate the best risk and benefit correlation.\"¹*\n\nAnother fungi ferment, saccharomyces ferment, has similar benefits. It is obtained through the fermentation of saccharomyces - a genus of fungi that is known as the baker's yeast - in the presence of metal ions. The yeast is credited with promoting good skin condition and is frequently found in products that reduce redness.\n\nThe other half of sake worth discussing, koji (kojic acid) is a skin-lightening agent and antioxidant. It is a tyrosinase (an enzyme that controls the production of melanin) inhibitor, but not as effective as other tyrosinase inhibitors like licorice extract. \"In combination with allantoin and other proper ingredients in sunscreen preparations, the mixture can inhibit UV-caused erythema and accelerate wound healing.\"² Unfortunately, it can also be sensitizing to some skin and create irritation.\n\nFrom all of this, we can assume that sake contains some sort of very mild exfoliating, humectant, anti-aging, and whitening properties, but the studies are fairly minimal thus far. To add, it is important to remember that not all skin ingredients penetrate deeper than the first few layers of the stratum corneum (the upper-most layer of the epidermis, what we see with our eyes), so long-term studies in vivo over many years tend to be the most reliable (hence why your doctor may be more apt to prescribe you tretinoin \\[Retin-A\\] than a newer drug).\n\nThe next ingredients on the list are ceramides 3 and 6. If you've been following my writings, you already know that ceramides are naturally found in the skin and help maintain the skin barrier. In fact, our skin's natural lipids are 35-40&#37; ceramides.\n\nSlightly more exciting is placental protein. Derived from animal placenta ([in this case, horse](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5fgonk/psa_kikumasamune_does_not_use_ingredient_derived/)), it is considered to be a safe ingredient that does not deliver any metabolic or endocrine activity. Again though, there was not much precedent that I could find on the benefits of including this ingredient specifically, however egg whites have been used for centuries on skin to make skin temporarily feel tighter and appear smoother.\n\n*Fun fact: Umbilical extract has precedent for unrestricted use in Japan, except for certain products.³*\n\nFinally, we arrive at the stars of this product: arbutin and licorice root extract. Arbutin, an ingredient primarily used for it's antioxidant properties as well as skin bleaching. It is a natural hydroquinone, derived synthetically or from bearberry plants. Once on the skin, it converts into hydroquinone and acts as a tyrosinase inhibitor. While not as effective as hydroquinone, it lacks the concerns of hydroquinone thus has become more popular in recent years.\n\nLicorice root extract is similarly a tyrosinase inhibitor as well as an anti-irritant - with some studies signalling that it may be able to absorb UVA and UVB rays. It is more effective than kojic acid and some studies put it at 75x more effective than ascorbic acid ([though Dr Dray raises some interesting points regarding the efficacy of L-AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JxO6sVMJzM)). \"The chief constituent of licorice root is glycyrrhizin, present in concentrations that range from 5 to 24 percent depending on the variety of licorice used.\"²\n\n# My Experience\n\n**My skin type:** Rosacean, acne-prone and extremely irritation-prone\n\nFirstly, the pump on my bottle broke off rather spectacularly when my bottle took a tumble from my tiny bathroom counter top. I'm not sure why this product comes with a pump applicator in the first place, as it frequently would dispense more product than I needed, which I suppose is fine as I was able to spread it down my neck and chest, but it was still was a bit of a shock to get a whole handful of it on the first pump. This experience doesn't seem limited to me, so I really recommend decanting this product into a better dispenser if you can, like a spritz top bottle.\n\nPackaging aside, the first time I used the High Moist lotion, I was pretty nervous. It's a very runny product, sharing a consistency with water, and if you've read my blog at all you know that I am a fairly dry-skinned lady. To my surprise and delight though, it was *uber* moisturizing. I applied it fresh out of the shower, in place of my HadaLabo Premium, and instantly my skin just felt soft and supple. I imagine much of this is due to the placenta protein filling in the gaps of the skin cells and creating a \"smooth\" texture as well as the ceramides, which tend to plump up my skin and make it feel softer.\n\nThe fragrance was also so mild that frankly, the smell of sake overpowered it. Thankfully this smell seemed to dissipate after a few minutes of application, and my rosacea did not flare up from the inclusion of fragrance. Over the next few days, I used the High Moist in place of my HadaLabo, and then began to combine it at night with the HadaLabo Premium on top. It worked well with oils and other moisturizing products on top - no pilling or strange film to report.\n\nIn two weeks, my skin looked brighter and felt smoother, though none of my dark spots had faded. Unfortunately, like most products with ferments, it began to break me out after this time. The good news though is that it doesn't appear to break me out immediately, unlike every other ferment, and the smoothness lasted for a few days after I discontinued use, which means I may try to use it sparingly once my skin heals.\n\n# Sources\n\n1.

Reviewing FormulaRX Barrier Relief Moisturiser\n \n* Texture and consistency:  It sinks right in the skin and has a gel like texture. It doesn’t feel heavy nor makes me sweat on application unlike other moisturisers make me do. I loved the fact it’s so lightweight and has the gel consistency.\n\n* Effect/ Result: to be very honest, when I first started using this moisturiser, I felt like it was breaking me out, at one point I even stopped using the moisturiser for a while because I was just upset. I loved the texture so much but had been doubting if it’s breaking me out. But later I realised it wasn’t the moisturiser, it was just my usual hormonal acne. I’ve been using it for 2 months and lately it has been working just fine. \n\n• It has 4% niacinamide, confirmed with brand. I had thought of using it as an alternative to a niacinamide serum, but didn’t show any added visible effects.\n\n* Would not repurchase because: \n1. The price, 699 for a 50 g basic moisturiser?!?!\n2. It does it’s job, moisturises my face. Nothing exceptional about it and honestly the Minimalist moisturiser does the same thing for a lesser price.\n3. It makes my face extremely oily and greasy in an hour. My face looks extremely dull. I wouldn’t use it in day time.\n\n•PROS.\nThe thing I love the most about this moisturiser is its consistency and lightweight feature but then the fact it makes my face oily AF is a bummer :(\n\nCute packaging: I’m a sucker for pastel colours and aesthetics and gohd I love the tube in my skincare cabinet, looks so pretty ✨\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS \nLike I’ve been mentioning again and again, I really wanted to love this moisturiser but the price point and lack of any exceptional feature wouldn’t make me purchase it again. \n\nMinimalist Sepicalm 3% + Oat Moisturizer\n\nReview Type: RAVE\n\nPrice: Rs. 345-349 for 50 g\n\nUsage Time: 4 Months, every night and sometimes day too\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Squalane, Glycerine, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Cocoyl Aminoacids, Sarcosine, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Avena Sativa (Oat Kernel) Flour, Sodium Polyglutamate, Undecane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopherol Acetate, Arginine, Glycine, Alanine, Histidine, Sodium Lactate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tridecane, Aluminium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Trehalose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n* It has a creamy texture and is quite a thick moisturiser for an extremely oily skin person like me.\n\n* It does not have any actives and I can layer it on top on any active I use, is the fact I love this moisturiser.\n\n* It is decently priced, would definitely repurchase it. \n\n* I’ve used it under makeup and it has worked wonders since the makeup didn’t cause any breakout or any dryness or flakiness.\n\n* I’ve been using it since July, taking a pea sized amount every-night and still have almost 3/5 left, a little goes a long way for me which makes it super affordable. \n\n* I think it’s safe for me to call it my HG moisturiser. It has never broken me out or caused any CCs or any another issue.\n* Literally soothed me, I had been using pulp vit C earlier which was quite strong and potent, Sepicalm moisturiser came handy every time\n\nCONS\n* it’s thick and greasy\n\n* Does not sink in skin immediately unlike the FormulaRX one. It sits on skin for a while\n\n* Makes me sweat after application \n\n* Cannot use it in day (except under makeup)\n\nWhy do I still use it\n- No matter what texture it has, it has soothed my acne, vit C burn, and improved overall skin texture.\n\n- I love the price point \n\n- I use it at night so I don’t worry about how I look, all I care is how well it works. And it does work for me!\n\nI know we’ve missed detailed reviews on this sub here so here’s one from me, more coming in!\nHope y’all find it helpful :)",

    "body": "Hey all,\n\nI've been a long contributor in other long covid subreddits and have blogged much of my journey here(I need to update it again): \n\nhttps://jondouglas.dev/long-covid/\n\nI've had two bouts of long covid. The first being 14 months when I caught the first strain in January 2021. The second being ~7 months when I was re-infected in July 2022. I've held off on posting this since January 2023 to ensure I had no major regressions. So far, so good.\n\nI've tried a number of things. I'll list the ones that I think are most important here in order. I'm sure people will have critical opinions on some of these, so I will just leave them here without saying more. I'm not going to debate anyone. I'm trying to move on with life. \n\nThese are 10 things that helped me the most. Many of them were excruciatingly painful to do while hauling. \n\n1. Sleep\n2. Diet / Fasting / Water\n3. Exercise / Daily movement\n4. Sunlight\n5. Cold Showers / Baths\n6. Deep Breathing\n7. Supplementation\n8. Cheer / Laughing / Sense of community\n9. Talk to your brain / Tell it you won't take it anymore\n10. Allow repressed emotions to be felt / Talk to a therapist or someone who can help you let it out\n\nSome of the fun experiments I've tried over the years that had noticeable improvements are:\n\n1. Cold plunges at 40 degrees F for 2+ minutes\n2. Nicotine patches for 7 days (7mg)\n3. mHBOT & HBOT (60 minutes + 2 atmosphere + 10 sessions consecutively)\n4. Researched supplement combinations \n    - NK+SK+Aspirin\n    - NAC+Bromelain\n    - NO\n    - L-Arginine + Citrulline + Vitamin C\n    - Vitamin D, Turmeric-Curcumin, Omega-3 Fish Oil\n5. PEMF therapy\n6. Limited 24h news-cycle / social media\n7. Red light therapy\n\nMany of these were based on long covid papers/published articles I'd read online. You can likely find them by searching for the same keywords.\n\nI'm back to working out daily at the gym and hope to get back to my marathon training that was interrupted by my first haul in early 2021.\n\nAnyway, I'd like to thank the early long haulers community for providing such helpful materials, research, and personal experiences in this unknown battle that helped me tackle it across many fronts. While the community has significantly changed with time, I figure it is now my time to make a natural exit. \n\nNow, I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I hope I won't be back. I hope that the community can continue to offer support and resources to those who need them, but that ultimately, we won't need those resources anymore as we find a way to beat it once and for all.\n\nGood luck to everyone out there and I wish you a good life.\n\nEDIT: Confirmed reinfection 8/26/2023. No idea what will happen next!\n\nEDIT#2: It is 10/10/2023 and my recovery has generally held on. I currently have small flare-ups once a month.\n\nEDIT#3: It is 10/21/2023 and I am starting to experience regular long covid symptoms again. My symptoms are quite milder than previous hauls in case you are curious.",

Not the $8 Korean retail price, but still, it seems really worth it to me considering the amazing ingredients.\n\nPanthenol is especially really underrated but it seriously kicks ass for dry & sensitive skin/tret face like mine (make sure it's at least 5% tho to be most effective). I love the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream bc it's so moisturizing & healing, but it PILLS LIKE CRAZY. Grrrrrrr. And it's a litttle sticky. Otherwise, it would be perfect.\n\n(Also, if you have super tret face/super dry skin, urea is very much worth looking into. It's super underrated as well. It's probably one of the most scientifically proven to be effective dry skin ingredients, but it's not marketed in the US for whatever reason. Maybe bc people think it's from \"urine\"? That's obviously not where they get it in skin care products lol, which is why education is so important. \n\nThe Eucerin 5% Urea face cream is the most accessible one I have found, but there's also Balea? Sebamed, Numis, Medisei Panthenol Extra (also 5% panthenol, but may be clogging) from Greece, Bioturm - all 5% urea creams, for those outside the US. I don't suggest going above 5%, as it can be exfoliating and I personally have those to be really heavy/greasy.",

    "body": "Hey guys! I have been meaning to start doing brand reviews for some time now because I’m very loyal to a lot of brands that have worked for me, and am the kind of person who likes to try a lot of different products just for the sake of collecting data on what works for me. Paula’s Choice is a good brand for this because they genuinely have a product for nearly every type of concern or goal. I would like to first of all very briefly go over the history of the brand, and then I’ll like to go into their skincare lines and share my experiences on the products I have tried. The first line I would like to go over is their RESIST line, and since I’d like to cover each product in depth, I will do it by collection. I should also mention I was not paid for this, and while my view of this company is mostly positive, it’s because this website rewards research and I’ve been happy with most of my purchases so far. However, @Paula’s Choice I’m always here if you wanna slide into my dm’s xoxo. I also have been thinking of making video/audio versions of my posts just because of how wordy they get, but maybe that should be a sign to make them less wordy lol. Anyway, I’d love to know if there is interest in that. I also know they are a controversial brand here, and since this is just a thread to give people information, I’d love to hear the experiences you’ve had with their products, especially if they’re negative.\n\nI won’t be rating any products since I still have yet to try many of them. I have tried *many* items from this site, but when you go collection by collection you start to realize just how many products they have, which in my opinion is kind of an issue. It is also the reason I am doing this, as I have spent a lot of time trying to get through the overwhelming amount of products they have to find what is right for me. Moreover, if I have tried them, I will mention my experience and of course gush about my holy grails, but I will share any negative experience as well.\n\nPaula’s Choice is a skincare company that launched in 1995 after Paula had gotten international recognition for being a bestselling beauty author and calling out big skincare brands in broad fucking daylight. She at the time prioritized being open about ingredients, using sustainable packaging, and using the most efficacious and proven ingredients to get the job done. The company has been sold up to three times since, however, and is now owned by Unilever, who also owns Dermalogica. For better or worse, Paula’s Choice has embraced many of the things she used to rally against, such as eye creams (which they insist only have only been listed due to high customer demand) and needlessly overpriced products, and should more or less be separated from this crystal clean image. They are still a top quality brand with tried and true formulas, and they still do a great job at informing the customer, but they only inform the customer as much as their marketing lets them now. \n\n[Here is their own timeline of how the brand came about](https://www.paulaschoice.com/who-we-are/about-paula), but I will go over some important milestones. In 2000, they launched their BHA Exfoliator that we have probably all seen at this point. This was a game changer, and has been replicated in many products since. They have since added many more options for BHA, which I will list later on. In 2002, they launched their [Ingredient Dictionary](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary), which is an amazing resource for learning about ingredients. As with all education resources on skincare sites, just remember that skincare is a huge industry and consider the source. Either way, this was a very smart move of transparency, and I believe it is still one of their strongest assets. In 2008, they launched Beautypedia, which is genuinely a laughable site and I would discourage you from checking it out. It may have been reliable at one point, but it is now a Paula’s Choice circle jerk and they put down every single other brand I have checked out on there. It is hilariously biased, and is one of my least favorite parts of Paula’s Choice’s brand. I would also be willing to bet that they will quietly update reviews for other companies owned by Unilever, but I will not be checking in.\n\nThey are now a website with a bit too many products, and a line for every single type of skin you could really think of (except maybe people of color with their sunscreens 🙁). For instance, they have a CALM line for sensitive skin, a RESIST line for dynamic anti-aging concerns, a DEFENSE line to enable your skin to protect itself from environmental stressors, and a CLEAR line of products to aid in fighting acne. They also have a few lines with fewer products, as well as a good many products that explicitly don’t have a line. In this post, I will just be reviewing the RESIST line.\n\nRESIST:\nThis is perhaps their most varied line, as it covers those with dry and oily skin pretty well. Their lighter blue RESIST products are typically meant for oilier skin, and their darker for dryer. They base most of their formulations in this line (and in general) on the efficacy of antioxidants in fighting sun damage, protecting the skin from free radicals and future sun damage, and healing skin. They have an anti-aging line within this line, but I won’t be covering that because I think needlessly upcharging people for anti-aging products is shady at best and ageist at worst.\n\nThere are two cleansers in this line, and they are both focused on thoroughly cleansing the skin while retaining moisture and balance, though I do find their cleansers are typically very foaming and rough from the ones I’ve tried (the CALM and the CLEAR). The Optimal Results Hydrating Cleanser for dry skin would be your go-to here if you want a thorough cleanse, but you have dry skin to begin with and need to keep your moisture barrier in check. Looking at the ingredient list, it has some light cleansing agents with a focus on soothing antioxidants and emollients. The Perfectly Balanced Foaming Cleanser is the stronger of the two, destined for oily skin, and is focused on cleansing your skin of sebum and reducing pore size. This one has three ceramides, arginine, and aloe extract; so you really could do worse as far as formulations go. The hydrating cleanser is definitely better for sensitive skin, though; and while those calming ingredients help prevent the foaming cleanser from disrupting your skin barrier, I would still beware if you have sensitive skin since this is a wash off product and those skin soothers won’t have nearly enough time to sink into your skin. If what you need is a thorough wash, though, and you’re looking for a nice, calming formula, then the foaming cleanser would be great!\n\nThere are two toners: The Advanced Replenishing Toner and the Weightless Advanced Repair Toner. The first is their highest rated toner (on their site that is), and is a combination of antioxidants, essential fatty acids, and some nice hydrating ingredients. Looking at the ingredient list, I really don’t understand why this is their top rated, but I’d love to hear what people have to say. The second one is one of their more promising, albeit short toner ingredient lists. Its primary ingredient toted is niacinamide, but I think it is also worth mentioning willow bark extract (a natural BHA whose concentration is undisclosed as far as I know), retraversol, and licorice root extract. The willow bark extract isn’t going to go quite to the lengths salicylic acid would, but it is a solid BHA for people with sensitive skin. This toner is meant to absorb right into the skin, and should help with inflammation and clarity.\n\nThey also have two serums in this line, The Super Antioxidant Serum, and the Ultra-Light version of the same serum. Again, the dark blue/light blue dry skin/oily skin combo is at play here. Both of these are a collection of antioxidants, but they surprisingly have very different ingredient lists. The normal, dark blue serum is a vitamin c-driven antioxidant serum with ceramide NP and dimethicone towards the top of the list, whereas the lighter version is a hyaluronic acid and niacinamide driven antioxidant serum with dimethicone and sea whip extract. Their serums are horribly overpriced, and I would avoid them. You can find much better serums with antioxidants on the market for cheaper, in my opinion.\n\nThere are three moisturizers here, and two of them are in darker blue packaging signifying dry skin. They both are focused on repairing your skin barrier, but both have retinol which is interesting. I understand that retinoids can have a firming effect, but I wouldn’t really recommend it as a star ingredient for barrier repair. Both of them are at a .01% concentration, though, so I would be curious to see some studies on the effects of retinol at this very low percentage. Either way, the Skin Barrier Repair is an emollient moisturizer with glycerin, ceramide NP, and licorice and green tea extracts.The Intensive Repair Cream is a bit more of an oily cream with Jojoba oil right up at the top. This cream seems a bit more preoccupied with using skin soothing extracts such as watermelon, licorice, green tea, apple, soybean, and lentil extracts. This is a neat ingredient list, and should honestly smell really nice, but if you have any sensitivities to fruit extracts, I would avoid this one. The light blue moisturizer is called the Anti-Aging Clear Skin Hydrator, and is more of a gel than a cream. It also opts for vitamin C as its active as opposed to retinol, and completes this skin brightening effect with Niacinamide. As far as moisturizers go, this is very basic, though, and considering the price point I would opt for something else that is friendly for oily skin.\n\nOkay guys these are the ones I’ve tried! I became obsessed with their sunscreens earlier this summer and have sampled almost every single one. There are two in this line, and they are pretty different. The Skin Restoring Moisturizer with SPF 50 is the dry skin option, and this is one of my favorite sunscreens for a good glow. It reminds me of the same finish as the dewy moisturizer from Tatcha, which is a compliment if you have dry skin. It can, however, be a bit much for people who are looking for a matte finish with their sunscreen. The active ingredients are Avobenzone 3%, Homosalate 5%, Octinoxate 7.50%, Octisalate 5%, and Oxybenzone 5%; so this is for sure a chemical sunscreen! This burns my skin just slightly, and my friend whom I gifted it to while we were vacationing (he didn’t bring SPF to the desert!) reported the same experience. Also, I would caution against sunscreens containing both Avobenzone and Octinoxate as Octinoxate tends to catalyze the degradation process of Avobenzone in direct sunlight, thus necessitating reapplication. This is a silicon and shea butter driven moisturizer, and has some stellar ingredients in niacinamide, aloe leaf juice, and licorice, coffee, oat, and apple extracts. If you have low sensitivity to chemical sunscreens and are looking for a solid formula for dry skin or just a healthy flow, then this is your girl. Their second sunscreen in this line is their Super-Light Wrinkle Defense SPF 30, which is their only SPF composed of only zinc oxide (13%). To compensate, it is tinted, but I would warn BIPOC against this one as its tint is too bright for even my tanned white skin sometimes. If you are off-white/olive/slightly tan, though, this gives some great color correction. There is also some evidence behind tinted sunscreens providing better protection against blue light. This leaves a very matte finish on the skin, and I often will layer it under another SPF for a more glowy complexion. Zinc oxide also provides some oil and sebum controlling qualities that make this a solid choice for people with oily skin in addition to the finish. The ingredient list focuses more on antioxidants such as vitamin c and retraversol, and I believe is the first item in this line so far without a drop of glycerin. I use this one often, and my “glassy skin” routine needs its color correcting qualities. The fact that a full size is 2 ounces, however, is an issue, and I believe it goes against Paula’s original mission of sustainable packaging. I don’t see this changing, but considering they are popular for choosing basic but efficient formulations, they should realistically have better price points than they do. And that’s just in America! They have even crazier pricing abroad. \n\nTo get these items at decent prices, though, just be patient. They have sales almost all the time, and I would make good use of free shipping passes from their rewards program and/or free shipping promotions to try out their travel sizes, most of which are actually reasonably priced. They also have one of the more flexible return policies I’ve seen in the skincare world, so I would make use of exchanges on products that don’t work for you. I never buy anything without a promo or a gift card, and I’ve managed to score some solid prices on their site. Avoid buying elsewhere as many of their approved retailers like Sephora NEVER have sales! Rude tbh. They are also running their Anniversary sale right now, and I sometimes see the whole website marked down 20%.\n\nSo that’s it! They also have some exfoliants in this line, but I will be doing that in my next review, where I will go through the exfoliants in general. In the meantime, let me know your experiences with this brand and what you think in general!",

Highly unusual, and I've been involved in dual use labs when I was in the military.\n\n\n>And the third thing they did which I think is really telling is they let a contractor redo the ventilation system in that laboratory. So I think  clearly there was strong evidence that there was a significant event that happened in that laboratory in September. It's now been declassified, you can read it. I'm sure there's more classified information around it.\n\n**Scientist Richard Ebright**\n\n>The relevance of this is that SARS Cov-2, the pandemic virus, is the only virus in its entire genus of SARS-related coronaviruses that contains a fully functional cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction.

These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.\n\n- David Baltimore, an eminent virologist and former president of CalTech, https://archive.is/yalCe\n\n\n**Former CDC Director Robert Redfield:**\n\n>I was concerned because of the presence of the furin cleavage site that we've talked about and I think it's important to understand what that cleavage site does. That cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of COVID, so where before it could not see the ACE2 receptor which is the human receptor, it totally changes the orientation now so it has high affinity for human receptors. So that furin cleavage site bothered me, it didn't seem like it belonged there. \n\n>And then if you look at the sequences they use in those 12 nucleotides for arginine, where the arginine sequence nucleotide triplet were coded for humans. So why did it have the arginine coding for humans and not bat? It was very disconcerting to me. It looked like this virus was engineered.\n\n\n>It's not scientifically plausible that this virus went from a bat to humans and became one of the most infectious viruses that we have for humans.",

I'm pretty sure these are all  the same base sunscreen with the same protection. I would get the sunscreen with the simplest ingredient list and whichever one is cheapest. The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

    "body": "Skin type: 30. Dehydrated. Dry. Sensitive to external factors.\n\n**1. Muji brightening moisturizing milk spf 41 PA+++**. Previously reviewed in a prior post about trying Muji travel size skincare. Milky texture. Its drying and smells like citrus due to the essential oil. WNR. Feels drying on my skin. Maybe someone with oily skin would like it more.\n\nIngredients: Water, 1, 3-propanediol, fine titanium oxide, talc, dimethicone, concentrated glycerin, sugar squalane, 2-pentanediol, lipophilic glyceryl stearate, behenyl alcohol, PEG stearate, POE (20) sorbitan oleate, PEG (80), lavender extract-1, chamomilla extract-1, calendula officinalis extract, tangerine peel extract, kiwi extract, oleoyl phytosphingosine, alanine, Arginine, sodium L-glutamate, serine, proline, sodium hyaluronate-2, dipentaerythrityl hexaoxystearate, POP methyl glucoside, BG, ethylhexyl glycerin, beeswax, polyhydroxystearic acid, isostearic acid, aluminum hydroxide, hydrated silicic acid, potassium hydroxide, xanthan gum, starch-sodium acrylate graft polymer, sodium alginate, citric acid, sodium citrate, natural vitamin E, fragrance\n\n**2. Rohto Mentholatum - Hada Labo Koi-Gokujyun Perfect Gel.** Travel size that I got at a random convenience store while in Japan. Soft gel-like texture. Good in humid weather. Not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. Its a decent moisturizer for me in the daytime in the summer. WNR. Again, maybe someone with oily skin may benefit more from this gel.\n\nIngreditents: Water, BG, glycerin, hydroxyethyl urea, pentylene glycol, PPG-10 methyl glucose, triethyl hexanoin, squalane, (acryloyl dimethyl taurine ammonium / VP) copolymer, behenyl alcohol, acetyl hyaluronic acid Na (super hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid Na, hydrolysed hyaluronic acid (nano-ized hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid hydroxypropyl trimonium (skin-adsorbed hyaluronic acid), hydrolyzed collagen, glucosylceramide (ceramide), suizenzino-polysaccharide (Sakuran), dimethicone, PPG-17 butes -17, triethyl citrate, cyclopentasiloxane, phenoxyethanol, succinic acid 2Na, dimethicone crosspolymer, agarten, EDTA-2Na, succinic acid, α-glucan, acrylate copolymer ammonium , Methyl paraben\n\n**3. Kansosan Medical Highly Moisturizing Cream.** A buttery and moisturizing cream. While shopping at Donki, I googled what is the best Japanese cream for dry and sensitive skin and Kansosan was suggested so I bought it to try. \n\nIts fantastic on my dry skin. It sinks in upon application but also coats my skin with a layer of moisturizing protection. Ive been using it for 2 days now and all I can think about is how amazing this would be for winters. Im gonna stock up when I go back to Japan. I think I found my holy grail moisturizer. I need to try other products from this brand. \n\nThis cream is like the better formulated version of the Kikumasamune sake cream and the Purito Dermide sleeping pack. Plus Kansosan doesnt smell bad. People who enjoy thick moisturizers like the Illiyoon and Aestura would like this cream.\n\nIngredients: Heparin-like substance\\*, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate\\*, Purified Water, Glycerin, Methylphenyl Polysiloxane, Cross-linked Methyl Polysiloxane, Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, 1,3-Butanediol, Methyl Polysiloxane, Polyethylene Glycol-Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, 2-Ethylhexyl Dodecanol, 1,2-Pentanediol, Poly(Oxyethylene-Oxypropylene) Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, Isostearic Acid Hardened Oil, Anhydrous Magnesium Sulfate, α-Olefin Oligomer, Sodium Citrate, Glycerol Mono-2-Ethylhexyl Ether, Sodium Metabisulfite, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Citric Acid, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Sodium Phosphate, Vaseline, Glycosyl Squalane, L-Arginine, Hydrogenated Soybean Phospholipid, Plant Sterols, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Water Soluble Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Polyethylene Glycol Octyl Dodecyl Ether, Plant Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate (2), \n\n\\*denotes \"Active Ingredient\", no symbol denotes \"Other Ingredients\"  \n",

    "body": "The reason I ask is because I recently discovered that freshly cut persimmons smells vaguely like semen to me. I was thinking they must have a protein or something in common? I did a quick google and there are articles that talk about its smell but don't really specifically identify the things that can account for it that I can then cross reference with whats in persimmons, that give it its smell.\n\nEdit: at first i thought it was just me but apparently [others](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyama/comments/qx0b6v/i_just_found_out_freshly_cut_fuyu_persimmons/) think so too. But bc of the nature of the sub they might have been joking lol.\n\n2nd edit: i think its amines in both the semen and the persimmons that make them smell the way they do. Ammonia in sperm and various amines in different trees and flowering plants (and persimmons is indeed a flowering tree), and yes even l-arginine seem to be a common theme. Which amines, i don't know but I'm largely satisfied. You guys are great! %100 did not expect to find an answer, thanks!\n\nOo maybe its triethylamine or dimethylamine? Idk.\n\nEdit 3: im thinking now it could be a combination of things that together add up to the smell? \nSpermine, cadaverine, triethylamine in particular seem to occur in both human semen and in plants (which was sort of the second part of my question). They have been noted as being \"the thing\" that causes the smell (always worded in different link as if it were just one thing). There might be more candidates im missing. You guys are great.\n\nEdit 4: i think the winner is spermine! \nFirst mentioned here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/r1eyys/what_is_it_in_normal_smelling_semen_that_gives_it/hlyxkzu\nBacked up a bit here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/r1eyys/what_is_it_in_normal_smelling_semen_that_gives_it/hlzbav8\n\nThis was a trip..

Take care & hope you all have a great day!",
