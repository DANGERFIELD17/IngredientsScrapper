    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nJust wanted to show of my latest experiment. I bought 450g of dried mealworms blended those pour bastards and mixed it in a 4,5L water & 300g sugar solution, at last around 500ml of LABS were added to the mix. \n\n1 day later the jar was cracked due to pressure. \n2 days later the whole jar overflowed. I had the same issue with my fermented Beetroot extract, probably due to filling it up too much. time for a new jar preferably with an airlock.\nAnyway we keep on fermenting. \n\nRecently I’ve bought a 30L plastic brew bucket with an airlock and little tap. I’m thinking of doing a fermented nettle extract in it. Can’t wait to try some new things this spring. \n\nThoughts?",

Types of Hair Problems (3 Main Areas)\n\nAll common hair problems fall into one of these:\n\n1. **Hair Roots (Hair Below the Scalp)** – Hair fall, thinning, reduced density\n2. **Hair Strands (Hair Above the Scalp)** – Dryness, breakage, roughness\n3. **Scalp Issues** – Dandruff, oiliness, itching, inflammation\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧠 2. Hair Root Care – Stop Hair Fall & Grow Stronger Hair\n\nHair fall starts when hair roots weaken or hair becomes thinner. If ignored, it leads to visible scalp and low density.\n\n🛑 **Step 1: Block DHT**\n\n* **Finasteride 1 mg/day** (tablet or topical): Blocks DHT (main reason for male hair loss).\n* Recommended if hair loss is **Stage 2 or more** on Norwood scale.\n\n**💉 Step 2: Improve Blood Flow to Hair Roots**\n\n* **Minoxidil 5%**: Increases blood supply to hair follicles, delivering more nutrients.\n* Apply once or twice daily.\n* For very early hair fall (Stage 1–2), some doctors prefer starting with **caffeine-based or peptide serums** first.\n\n**💊 Step 3: Provide Proper Nutrients**\n\nEven if blood supply increases, without the right nutrients, hair won’t grow strong. Include:\n\n|Supplement|Benefit|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Biotin**|Strengthens hair strands|\n|**Multivitamin (with Zinc, Vitamin D, and B-complex)**|Fixes hidden deficiencies|\n|**Omega-3 or Fish Oil**|Reduces inflammation, nourishes follicles|\n\n**🧪 Step 4: Peptide-Based Serums (for Root Stimulation)**\n\nThese serums contain **plant-based peptides and natural growth factors** that help activate weak or resting follicles without the side effects of stronger medications.\n\n|Serum|Key Ingredients|Benefits|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Redensyl**|DHQG + EGCG2|Activates hair stem cells, reduces hair fall|\n|**Capixyl**|Biomimetic peptide + red clover|Strengthens follicles, reduces inflammation|\n|**Anagain**|Pea sprout extract|Extends hair growth phase (anagen)|\n|**The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Hair Serum**|Blend of multiple peptides|Boosts density, nourishes scalp|\n\n✅ Best used **once daily** on a dry scalp. Can be combined with microneedling (1–2x/week) for better absorption.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 💇‍♀️ 3. Hair Strand Care – Improve Hair Texture, Strength & Shine\n\nThis is the visible part of hair above the scalp. You need to:\n\n**🧴 Use Hair Oil (Carefully)**\n\n* Oil gives moisture and reduces breakage.\n* But **avoid putting oil on the scalp** too often — it can cause dandruff or feed fungus.\n* Apply oil **only on the hair length**, 1–2 times a week, and **wash off properly**.\n\n**🧼 Use Conditioner (Not on Scalp)**\n\n* After shampoo, apply conditioner **only on hair strands** to reduce dryness and tangles.\n\n**💆 Use Hair Mask (Deep Conditioning Treatment)**\n\nHair masks are like super-conditioners. Use them 1–2 times a week to:\n\n* Deeply moisturize dry hair\n* Make hair soft, smooth, and shiny\n* Reduce frizz and split ends\n\n🧴 Choose masks with ingredients like coconut oil, argan oil, shea butter, keratin, or aloe vera.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧴 4.

Hard Water vs Soft Water\n\n# 🔹 Hard Water (contains high levels of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Leaves behind mineral deposits on hair strands.\n   * Causes **dry, rough, dull, and brittle hair**.\n   * Can lead to **more hair breakage and tangling**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * **Clogs scalp pores**, leading to dandruff or scalp acne.\n   * May cause **itching or irritation**.\n   * Reduces the effectiveness of shampoo and conditioner (hair doesn’t feel clean).\n\n# 🔹 Soft Water (low mineral content):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Makes hair feel **softer and smoother**.\n   * Helps shampoos and conditioners work better.\n   * Prevents mineral buildup, making hair **shinier and more manageable**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * Gentle on the scalp.\n   * Helps maintain **natural oil balance**.\n\n# 🌡️ 2. Water Temperature\n\n* **Hot Water:**\n   * Strips natural oils from hair and scalp.\n   * Can cause **dryness, itching, and frizz**.\n   * May weaken hair roots over time.\n* **Cold or Lukewarm Water:**\n   * Retains natural oils.\n   * Helps **seal the hair cuticle**, making hair shinier and smoother.\n   * Best for the final rinse.\n\n# 🧪 3. Chlorinated Water (Swimming Pools)\n\n* Damages the hair shaft.\n* Causes **dryness, discoloration (especially in colored hair), and split ends**.\n* Irritates the scalp and worsens **scalp sensitivity or dandruff**.\n\n# ✅ Solutions if You Have Hard Water\n\n* Install a **shower filter** that removes minerals and chlorine. (or use filtered water from water purifier only for hair wash)\n* Use **chelating or clarifying shampoos** once a week (they remove mineral buildup).\n* Rinse with **apple cider vinegar + water (1:4 ratio)** to remove residue.\n* Apply **deep conditioning masks** to restore moisture.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# # Is Finasteride Safe? Can You Take It Without Doctor Consultation?\n\n**Finasteride** (commonly used for male pattern baldness at **1 mg/day**) is generally **effective and relatively safe** when taken correctly - but **it should NOT be taken without a doctor’s consultation**, especially for long-term use.\n\n# 🔍 Why You Need Doctor Consultation\n\nFinasteride changes your **hormone levels** by reducing DHT (dihydrotestosterone), the hormone responsible for hair loss. Since it alters your body's chemistry, a doctor should:\n\n* Assess if it’s safe based on your medical history\n* Decide the right **dose** and **form** (oral vs. topical)\n* Monitor side effects and hormone balance\n\n# ✅ Is Low-Dose Finasteride (1 mg/day) Safe?\n\nYes, **low-dose Finasteride (1 mg/day)** is considered **relatively safe for most healthy adult men**, especially under medical guidance. In fact, this is the **standard dose** used to treat androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness).\n\nBut even low doses **can have side effects**—though not everyone experiences them.\n\n# ⚠️ Common Side Effects (in 1–10% of users)\n\n* Low libido (reduced sexual desire)\n* Erectile dysfunction\n* Reduced semen volume\n* Breast tenderness or enlargement\n* Depression or mood changes\n\nThese are often **mild and reversible** if the drug is stopped.\n\n# ⚠️ Rare but Serious Risks\n\n* **Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS)** – Persistent sexual, neurological, or psychological symptoms after stopping (very rare, still debated)\n* Gynecomastia (male breast growth)\n* Severe depression or anxiety (in rare cases)\n\n# 👨‍⚕️ Who Should Avoid Finasteride Without Supervision\n\n* People with **liver issues**\n* History of **depression or sexual dysfunction**\n* **Those planning to conceive soon** (Finasteride may affect sperm in rare cases)\n* **Women and children** (especially pregnant women)\n\n# 🔍 Monitoring Required If You Take It\n\n* **DHT levels** (optional, but helpful)\n* **Liver function tests**\n* **Prostate exam** (PSA levels can be falsely lowered)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#

Hair growth takes time — it can take **3–6 months** to see noticeable changes. Stick to your routine consistently and monitor with photos every month.\n2. If hair fall continues despite trying these steps for 6+ months, consult a dermatologist or trichologist to rule out underlying causes like autoimmune conditions, alopecia areata, or scalp disorders.\n\n(After seeing how many people struggle with hair problems and lack clear information, I took the time to research deeply, consult doctors, and gather everything I could. This comprehensive guide is the result of that effort. I hope it helps you in your hair care journey.)\n\n(used gpt for help)\n\n(let me know if I have missed anything, I am trying to make a complete guide for hair care)",

Allow me to correct it from using what is proven and in accordance with my knowledge. \n\nA) In section 1. Types of Hair problems. The root cause of both hairloss, hair thinning, breakage and Density is all causes by DHT. DHT is a useless harmone in adults which is converted from testosterone (good harmone) with an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase (5AR). So all those problems are solved by Finasteride which is 5AR1 inhibitor.\nRegarding scalp with dandruff and flaking problem - 1% ketoconazole is enough. \nAnd that is all \n\nReferences:\n\n1) Shin J, Chung E, Kim M, Kim T, Kim W, Huh C.

This is all you need to solve all the problems mentioned in section 1. \n\nB) Bloodflow Theory - This theory stated a century ago that bludflow restriction caused by wearing tight hats and creating tension in scalp is the reason for male pattern baldness. this theory has been overused till this day to sell Nonsense products. This theory has been debunked over century ago (1916) by Dorothy Osborn. \n\nReferences : \n1) Osborn D. INHERITANCE OF BALDNESS.

When it is not FDA approved, companies can put anything in it without having to disclose the proper composition. So it's best to avoid them or take FDA approved vitamins. Imo just finasteride is enough to solve all hairloss problems. \n\nD) Microneedling does not work as a standalone treatment nor is it safe as a long term usage. it is observed in 3 studies that Microneedling combined with  topical 5%minoxidil has more efficacy than just standalone microneedling and topical minoxidil. This is because the efficacy of minoxidil increases due to channels in epidermis caused by microneedling. \nThere is no standardized protocol for microneedling, so anyone can just dismiss the ineffectiveness of microneedling using No-true Scotsman falacy even when there is compelling evidence to prove otherwise. \nBasically Microneedling is causing inflammation in the scalp and in long term it will become chronic inflammation. Ultimately creating Scar tissue in scalp resulting in a similar situation to what androgenetic alopecia does to scalp. \nI.e back to square one.\nApplying Tretinoin is better than microneedling along with minoxidil to give maximum benefits to hair growth.\n\nReferences: \n1) Chronic inflammation in the etiology of disease across the life span\nDavid Furman et al.

        "body": "Please for the love of Hairs, stop asking GPT and Reddit on hair care routine. It never ends well. Consult a proper Dermat (not someone who says to rub oil) and monitor your scalp condition. \n\nWhat has worked for me : \n1. 1mg finasteride orally per day keeps the hair transplant doctor away. ( Only Finasteride/Dutasteride will cure your hairfall issue which is caused by DHT- a useless harmone in adults (useful until puberty passes). \n\n2. Ketoconazole %1 shampoo (%1 is already most effective and strong. Using 2% is overkill unless you suffer from severe case of seborrheic dermatitis. I use it once or twice a week.\n\n3. Never needed topical Minoxidil but it helps only in compliment with Finasteride. Never used minoxidil alone as it does not solve the hairloss issue.\n\n4. I use Tresemme sulphate free shampoo + conditioner for regular use. \n\n5. When I don't use conditioner, I use Kraves wax for styling along with a cold air blower.(Only occasionally)\n\n6. I don't use any oils because my scalp is oily. Applying more will worsen the dandruff problem. \n\n\nThings to Note : \n1. No other serum works unless it does have proper clinical trials and meta analysis studies on it.\n\n2. Never fall for all natural and organic scams. They do not work. be skeptical. Never be blinded by a brand and Fake doctors who claim ridiculous 'CURES'. They do so because people fear drugs and they don't have any evidence or proof of the efficacy. \n\n3. Depending on food and diet as your only way to fight the Slap head curse is a bad idea. Food is food not a medicine. Just because our ancestors used it, does not mean it's good. Our ancestors did not have knowledge nor the protocols for developing cures and conducting clinical trials. \nThe most heinous diseases like TB black death, Hairloss etc have been cured by Pharmaceuticals. So don't fear drugs.\n\n4. DON'T use microneedling. It will cause scar tissue in your scalp which will permanently remove any chance of you growing new hair in that area.\n\n5. Exercise is a must. Never skip a leg day.",

    "body": "The T-booster supplements on amazon.com get a shi*t ton of positive reviews. I went through the ingredients of the 4 best-selling ones and typed them on Examine.com. \n\nHere's what I found: \n\n**1\\. Vintage Boost** - 4.5 stars, 412 customer reviews.\n\nPrimary Ingredients\n\n- D-Aspartic Acid: There appears to be an increase in testosterone in most subjects acutely (6-12 days), and while this may persist to the tune of 30-60% in infertile men it is reduced to baseline within a month in otherwise healthy men with normal testosterone at baseline. However, high doses also seem to decrease free testosterone and total testosterone in resistance trained men.\n\n- Shilajit Extract: A 23.5% increase has been noted in infertile men, it is not certain if this applies to fertile men.\n\n- Tribulus: In otherwise healthy males, testosterone is not influenced with supplementation of tribulus terrestris. There may be an increase in infertile men, but this is weak.\n\n- Maca Root: No significant influences on testosterone in any tested demographic\n\n**2\\. Alpha Boost** - 4.5 stars, 807 customer reviews.\n\nPrimary Ingredients\n\n- Horny Goat Weed: No clinical research on its effect on T. \n\n- Tongkat Ali: Although the protective effects of tongkat ali on the testicles and the profertility effects may result in a slight increase in testosterone in infertile men and the adaptogenic effects may cause a preservation of testosterone in stressed men, there is no evidence in otherwise healthy and unanxious men.\n\n- Saw Palmetto Extract:80mg of a lipidosterolic extract of saw palmetto (Permixon) taken twice daily for a total daily dose of 160mg over the course of a week failed to influence testosterone or DHT concentrations in otherwise healthy young men; finasteride as the reference drug was effective in acutely reducing and maintaining a reduction of DHT.\n\n- Orchic Substance: Doesn't exist on Examine. \n\n- Wild Yam Extract: No link to T. \n\n- Nettle Extract: No detectable influence on testosterone levels\n\n- Boron: There appears to be an interaction with Boron and testosterone in both genders, but it is seemingly unreliable\n\n**3\\. Superior Labs Test Worx Testosterone Booster Supplement** - 4.5 stars, 5,298 customer reviews.\n\nPrimary Ingredients\n\n- Tribulus: In otherwise healthy males, testosterone is not influenced with supplementation of tribulus terrestris. There may be an increase in infertile men, but this is weak.\n\n- Maca root: No significant influences on testosterone in any tested demographic\n\n- Eurycoma Longifolia Extract: Although the protective effects of tongkat ali on the testicles and the profertility effects may result in a slight increase in testosterone in infertile men and the adaptogenic effects may cause a preservation of testosterone in stressed men, there is no evidence in otherwise healthy and unanxious men.\n\n- L-arginine: No significant influence on circulating testosterone concentrations\n\n**4\\. Sheer ALPHA Testosterone Booster Supplement** - 4.5 stars, 684 customer reviews.\n\nPrimary Ingredients:\n\n- Horny Goat Weed: No clinical research on its effect on T. \n\n- Maca Root: No significant influences on testosterone in any tested demographic.\n\n- Tribulus: In otherwise healthy males, testosterone is not influenced with supplementation of tribulus terrestris. There may be an increase in infertile men, but this is weak.\n\n- Long jack root: Although the protective effects of tongkat ali on the testicles and the profertility effects may result in a slight increase in testosterone in infertile men and the adaptogenic effects may cause a preservation of testosterone in stressed men, there is no evidence in otherwise healthy and unanxious men.\n\n- Ginko Biloba Extract: No link to testosterone.\n\n- DIM: In small amounts, it can both inhibit the aromatase enzyme (and prevent conversion of testosterone into estrogen) and it can act on more potent forms of estrogen and convert them into less potent forms; this conversion reduces the overall effects of estrogen in the body. However, taking too much DIM at once can actually induce the aromatase enzyme and act in the opposite manner and increase estrogen synthesis.\n\n**Most of the so-called \"natural testosterone boosters\" contain some combination of the above ingredients. As you can see, there's very little clinical research to support their claims. There's been a lot of talk here about fake reviews sponsored by big supplement companies, and now it's clearly evident**",

    "body": "So there's a DFW-local MLM that sells weight loss coffee under the name Revital U Brew. I have been inundated with Facebook posts from friends that barraged me with various before-and-after pics. I ignored them, just like I ignored Shakeology and LuLaRoe, until a good friend of mine texted me and said she'd tried it and had lost five pounds. She's been trying to lose weight for years and nothing had really worked, so it piqued my interest. I started looking into it, but (surprise, surprise) there is next to no real info available on the company or its products.\n  \nI took the time to look into it a little bit.\n  \nFirst question: Who the heck is selling this stuff?\n  \nRevital U Brew is based out of Frisco, according to their website's contact information. A WhoIs search of their website, revitalu.com, reveals that it's been registered since 7/15/16 by Mike Adams, SVP of Operations at Momentis International. I can't get their crummy website at momentis.net to load on my computer, and anyways their security certificate is expired so Google gives you a scary warning when you try to go to it. Looks like they have six whole employees. I'm actually getting three addresses associated with them: a strip mall in Frisco, a strip mall in Plano, and an office building off of I-75 in Dallas. Momentis International LLC is probably not doing too hot seeing as how their right to do business in Texas has been forfeited per the Comptroller's Taxable Entity search. This is usually as a result of a failure to pay your annual franchise taxes. Maybe they just don't care? They're incorporated in Delaware (very common even for Texas-based businesses) and I don't want to pay real money to check their status in that state.\n\n\nSomebody went ahead and did a write-up of the company, not sure when it was written (ref: https://www.playersmoney.com/momentis/). Apparently they've been around since 2010, although they only registered with the state to do business in March 2014. Looks like they started selling electricity when the market deregulated and then launched a MLM-based skincare line some time after that. They're still selling electricity, judging by the two recent BBB complaints they received (https://www.bbb.org/dallas/business-reviews/electric-companies/momentis-in-dallas-tx-90384868/reviews-and-complaints). The skincare line is still around, too. It's called Mac Seven Sciences (http://www.macsevensciences.com/home.html). Those products are probably just repackaged from somewhere else, and I don't want to look into it at the moment. There is some vague rumor about their compensation plan being unsatisfactory in some way when they sold electricity, but that's pretty standard in all MLM schemes.\n\n\nSecond question: What the heck are they selling? \n\n\nInstant coffee powder purported to do what every weight loss supplement purports to do: 'kickstart' your metabolism, increase your energy, and suppress your appetite.\n\n\nWhat's in it? Probably mostly coffee. There are a list of ingredients on their website, but it doesn't state amounts anywhere. We all know that these things are under-regulated by the FDA, so there's probably none of it in there. Let's check out what we're being sold for $49 (!) a jar:\n\n\nCoffee: Obviously. Coffee is good for you, according to their website, and let's be honest, you'd be drinking it anyways.\n\n\nVinitrox (Fruit Extracts): They claim something something vasodilation something something antioxidant. A quick Google reveals that Vinitrox is a trademarked athletic supplement produced by Nexira. It's supposed to be special combination of apple and grape polyphenols, which are thought to promote health in traditional (?) medicines and teas. Wikipedia says it's unproven, and implies that these supplements are mostly excreted instead of absorbed because of low bioavailability. I believe Wikipedia.\n\n\nJuglans Regia Bark Extract: So they claim that this ingredient (Walnut bark) works in concert with another additive, Octodrine, in order to get a \"full-spectrum\" effect. Um. Wikipedia and a few clinical studies suggest that the walnut fruit and bark extract does indeed have some potential medicinal value, but it doesn't seem to be related to weight loss.\n\n\nOctodrine: Revital U's site states that clinical tests show this ingredient to be effective in the breakdown of fat cells and weight loss through a \"natural balancing process of various metabolic functions.\" Also enables anabolic response, improves athetlic performances, and helps increase mental focus and clarity. Oh my. So this stuff is also known as DMHA, and it's a widely-used bodybuilding supplement. It's a stimulant and could likely have weight-loss uses, HOWEVER. GUYS. Stimulants are dangerous when they are misused, and in general have side effects ranging from insomnia and anxiety to heart problems.\n\n\nL-Theanine: The site says that this provides and assists with calming effects on the brain by increasing the levels of serotonin and dopamine. The idea is that it naturally provides a relief from anxiety and stress, which is a common cause for over-eating and weight gain. Looks like a widely used herbal supplement found in tea leaves and it is Generally Recognized as Safe by the FDA. Natural Standard rates the beneficial properties listed above as \"unclear or conflicting scientific evidence\", but does say it's likely to improve cognition.\n\n\nPEA (Phenylethylamine HCL): They say it functions as a neurotransmitter (this sounds like a bullshit claim). Also state it stimulates neurotransmitters by releasing dopamine, improves mood and increases alertness, focus, and concentration. At least one person on the internet calls it a \"love-drug\". It is also used as a bodybuilding supplement. Wikipedia says it acts as a central nervous system stimulant in humans, and it seems to be associated with running and skydiving and probably any heart-pounding activity. HOWEVER. Correlation does not equal causation, kids. Wikipedia also states that it produces effects similar to amphetamine and that the half-life of the chemical when taken orally is 5-10 minutes, so that's a pretty short runner's high.\n\n\nAlpha-Glyceryl Phosphoryl Choline: They make sure to tell you that this ingredient is safe and healthy and natural. It apprently encourages brain alertness and memory function and is a critical nutrient for muscle tone and helps with body shaping. Do you think so? Wikipedia thinks this drug has potential as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. This drug is is Generally Recognized as Safe by the FDA, so there's that. It could actually enhance cognition, but there aren't many recent studies on it outside of the Alzheimer's research.\n\n\nCaffeine: It's unclear whether this coffee powder has added caffeine or if this is just the caffeine naturally in the coffee beans. They go on to extol the benefits of caffeine. Caffeine, as a stimulant, does suppress appetite and increase energy temporarily. It's also cheap and widely available.\n\n\nNettle Root Extract: They claim that this \"plant based herbal extraction... aids with reducing blood sugar levels\" and that it also maintains good cholesterol somehow. This herb has been used in traditional medicine for ages, and people still use it for prostate and urinary problems. I used to drink nettle root tea and it tasted awful and I didn't lose any weight, but my cholesterol WAS great. So take from that what you will.\n\n\nOctopamine: Revital U claims that this ingredient stimulates Beta-3 Adrenergic Receptor which is responsible for lipolysis (fat breakdown) and thermogensis (fat burning). Wikipedia claims that this organic chemical is closely related to norepinephrine and acts as as a neurotransmitter for some invertebrates. In humans, it's theorized to be used as a less-effective version of adrenaline. It could also be linked to Orthostatic Hypotension, which is when you get up quickly and then immediately faint because your body has a hard time maintaining adequate blood pressure.\n\n\nChromium Polynicotinate: According to them, most fat Americans just don't get enough chromium because of our terrible diets and it's essential for regulating insulin. Chromium (III) is still considered an essential nutrient in the US, but in 2014 \"the European Food Safety Authority published a report stating that the intake of chromium(III) has no beneficial effect on healthy people, thus the panel removed chromium from the list of nutrients and essential elements.\" Also, it interferes with some medications that treat diabetes or thyroid conditions. Use with caution.\n\n\nConclusion: This is a shady company selling a very expensive, shady product packed with just enough stimulants that you might even lose weight. However, depending on the amounts of each ingredient, it could potentially be dangerous. I can't state that enough - please be careful.",

        "body": "Thank you to the individual who created this post. I was looking everywhere for a legit review of this product and can vouch for the effects myself as a past user of this product. I’ve been exposed to many mlm health products so I have some long term experience with the quality and side effects of these kinds of things. I am also a former drug addict so I have some experience there too.\n\nThere is so much I want to say about Revital U Brew in particular because bottom line, it’s addictive and acts very much like speed and other similar drugs, wreaking havoc on your entire body and can induce unpleasant side effects. Maybe it just didn’t work for me, but the first time I took this product was in a 3 day sample kit - no instructions. If you are a regular coffee drinker, you won’t think just to take ONE single packet unless it specifically says to use only one single dose. If you take all 3, have fun sleeping that night. You literally feel like you are high and “happy” for the first few hours. It definitely works as an appetite suppressant - I had about one whole cracker that entire day. Next comes the crash-where you are wide awake inside but can’t keep your eyes open and you just lay there. Let’s just say I didn’t sleep a wink that night. Sure, maybe I shouldn’t have taken all 3 packets but, oops. With any kind of weight loss product, it’s easy to have the mindset that more is better. Now, I knew better and Just rendered my experience as an accident. I really wanted to give this product a try. \n\nI ordered the mega expensive tub and followed just a single dose, which I was told can be put in your regular coffee. Either way, it’s a hell of a lot of caffeine. For two straight weeks I experienced the following - weight loss of about 7 lbs initially, decreased hunger, mood swings, dry mouth (almost like cotton mouth), increased thirst, constipation, and insomnia. I ended up having to use a laxative and sleeping aid during the course of the two weeks. While the weight loss was great, and I was getting things done like an addict on speed would, I felt dependent on it first thing in the morning despite the side effects. I was also experiencing that drop in blood pressure in the morning like I was going to faint, along with heart palpitations during the day. I was also extremely moody. \n\nI’m a very healthy individual, and in the end I decided it wasn’t worth the drastic weight loss because of all the other side effects I was experiencing. I think this is great for someone who is in need of serious weight loss, fast, however, I think this is something you can definitely get hooked on. A few days after discontinuing the product, my appetite for real food came back. I craved sweets immediately and ate a lot the first day - so, I can see why this can fail if you stop. While I didn’t put the weight back on, one Very easily could. I stopped using sleep aids but I am still having some gastric issues and need to use an occasional laxative.\n\nThere needs to be more testing on this product. Or, just go the all natural route and eat well and exercise. The fact that this is an mlm company is a nightmare. Not only are you going to be pushing to get people to sign on-you are risking them paying for a very pricey product that can have detrimental physiological and psychological effects. I understand this won’t happen to everyone, I am just sharing what happened to me. Needless to say, I dumped the rest of the product down the sink. The health benefits did not outweigh the side effects in my case. \n\nThey should also have a warning: not recommended if you are or were a drug addict or if you value your sleep and want to have regular, normal healthy bowel movements. Truth. Hope this helps someone before they dive in.",

I had no interest in my never can pass it up cake.. My biggest weakness. I did want or crave anything sweet. My plates portions diminished.

People with thyroid or diabetes should steer very clear from products like this as it can cause some big complications, but you will not ever hear or see a revitalu seller mention these things\n3. Once you stop taking the supplement you will be back to the same issue at hand but even worse. Your body has been lacking key nutrients in its diet so basically your body is somewhat \"starved\".  People who were heavier before who did not have healthy eating habits and regular excersise prior will go straight back if not worse then they were before. ANY doctor or nutrionalist will adivse against jurastic weight loss and weight gain as it is 100% unhealthy and can cuase major health issues.\n4. Consuming proteins, good fats, and veggies are crucial in your diet, and when you are not consuming hardly ANYTHING it is 100% not healthy and it does not take a rocket scientist to know this.\n5.

    "body": "I am 17M/5ft7in, with 29% body fat. I have been stuck on my current weight (184lbs) since the **last 5 months**, despite being on keto and IF (16:8) and working out times per week. It’s making me desperate and almost insane. Please advise me\\*. I was unable to write a post before due to my intense study schedule. I am going to give large amount details, to avoid any important details.\n\nI have been on keto & IF since December ,2019. My starting weight 234lbs (106 kgs). By the end of the first month I dropped around 25lbs(11.4kgs), which was unexpected for me during that time. I dropped 25lbs(11.4kgs) more within the next 2 months. Weight loss has stagnated since then. My weight has been roughly the same since March,2020, despite being on standard keto and IF.\n\nI approximate macros are 90g protein, 120g fat and 15 g carbs. I have experimented a lot to with them, but no change in body composition was found after experimenting with higher protein/lower fat ratios. I always keep my calories below1500 Cal (can’t eat more than that as I am usually very full after that). On top of macros, I also keep track of my potassium, magnesium, iodine, zinc, vitamin D and omega 3:6 ratio.\n\n**DIET**\n\nMy diet consists of mostly chicken, different types of fish, shrimp, cabbage, eggs, fish roe, salad (low carb veggies), goat meat and some cheese and cream, and as an evening snack, a cup pumpkin and sunflower seeds and sometimes walnuts. I have apple cider vinegar before eating my protein rich dish.\n\nOn Thursdays, due to religious reasons, I only eat only vegetarian dishes, mainly pointed gourd, brinjal, cabbage, cauliflower, mushroom (with a little onion, carrot, tomato and cheese) and protein powder and some homemade almond flour products (like a couple of cookies or a medium sized cupcake). The macros for this day of the week 75g protein/ 75g fat/ 25g carbs.\n\nSupplements I take: Iodine (from sea weed extract), Potassium, Vitamin D and Vitamin K, Ashwagandha, Bacopa monnieri, Fish Oil, Stinging Nettle Root extract, Milk Thistle, and Gingko Biloba.\n\n**WORKOUT**\n\nThe workout routine I follow is calisthenics based. I train 3 times per week, splitting training into upper body on the first day, abs on the second and lower body and legs on the third day, with one day gap in between them. Sometimes I incorporate cardio after my workouts or a separate day in the week. I keep long rest period to make sure I do not produce a lot of cortisol, as I am already a bit stressed. I sweat a lot; even after 2 minutes of walking, I will be sweating like I have been working out for an hour.\n\nI sleep 7.5 hours on average, but my circadian rhythm is not stable, due to variable sleeping schedule. During exams, I sleep 4.5 to 6 hours, but I immediately balance it out by sleeping 9 to 10.5 hours the next day or two.\n\n**WHAT I HAVE TRIED**\n\n**1.** Longer fasting windows and OMAD: I actually like doing them on weekends since the start of my keto journey, and have tried OMAD for 1 month. Unfortunately, it didn’t help with fat loss compared to 16:8, except giving me some free time in the day.\n\n**2.** Going almost carnivore: I tried going 95% carnivore for 4 weeks. The only non-carnivore item I had is pumpkin seeds (for magnesium and zinc). It didn't make any difference.\n\n**3.**  Extended water fasting: Tried it 2 times, for 2 days each, and it didn’t really help me lose more than 100g fat (most weight lost was water weight). Gained it all back after my first 2 meals after fast.\n\n**4.** Extended dry fasting: Out of desperation, tried it 3 times, for 3days for the first 2 and almost 4 days for the last one, and it was actually easier for me to endure than a water fast. Lost around 400 g of fat after each one of them, but gained them all back after week after each fast.\n\n**5.** Exercising 6 days per week for a month: Didn’t make me lose much fat after a week. Most weight lost was water weight, which was gained back after my first meals of the day. Made me very exhausted and couldn’t sustain due to my studies.\n\n**6.** Supplementing Chromium: Tried it decrease my load on the adrenals during exam time. Had heard that it helps control blood glucose after meals. Didn’t do a thing.\n\n**WHAT I AM SUSPECTING**\n\nI may have a slow metabolism. I have tried dieting on a traditional high carb/low fat diet with below 1400 calories per day for a year in the past, while doing a lot of cardio. I did lose a few 15lbs on that, but after 6 months, weight loss stopped fully.\n\nI also suspect I have mild thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, as it makes it difficult to lose fat.\n\nI am not sure about either.\n\n**WHAT I HAVE BEEN THINKING TO TRY BUT UNSURE WHETHER IT IS WORTH IT**\n\n1. Spike leptin by eating carbs for a week: I know leptin helps metabolism. But I feel wonderful on keto, my brain works much better, which is conductive for my studies. So, I dared not to try it until now, because I can’t stand this plateau any more.\n2. Do alternate day dry fasting: I feel better on dry fast than a water fast. So, as fasting does not slow down metabolism, I should not be harming my metabolism.\n3. Taking additional zinc by supplementation: I have a hair fall problem as well. So, as I know, when Testosterone is low, it is converted into DHT, which causes hair fall. So, maybe, its low testosterone that is causing the problem. BTW, I already eat pumpkin seeds for zinc, but it may not hurt to try.\n\nGuys, I am feeling really stagnated in my health journey. I will be grateful for any advice and suggestions.",

Protein should be about 1g per pound of  lean body mass. Increase this over time as you are gaining muscle. Look into doing HIIT at the end of your fast and try to maintain more activity during the day if possible. Standing desk or walking more when it’s an option. \n\nYou may want to get a full hormone panel with thyroid T3/RT3 test. Thyroid issues tend to prevent weight loss and cause hair loss. If you are concerned about testosterone levels consider ashwaganda and try getting 10-20 minutes of direct sunlight every day. Lifting weights could help with T too.\n\nEdit: changed wording of carb recommendation",

    "body": "Review: RareCraft Sicilian Sunset Hair Cream\nAbout damn time. 🌇🤌\n\nDisclaimer: Jerzyk was a sweetheart to send me the latest batch of RareCraft products (the Sicilian Sunset clay + cream combo and the Tortuga foam) free of charge. However, I made clear to him that I would post my honest opinions and that I wouldn’t try to sugarcoat if things needed to be criticized. Lucky for me, there is almost nothing to criticize about these products.\n\nEarly in the summer, RareCraft launched a new series of products, among which there is a Hair Cream in three different scents: Tortuga, Navigator (which are classic RareCraft scents), and, finally, Sicilian Sunset. The Hair Cream is a reformulation of their original Navigator Prestyler Styling Cream, a sort of “younger brother” as Jerzyk said, but retains much of its features: firm hold, great texture and volume, and a liquid consistency in a glass bottle.\n\nThis product is advertised as providing a perfect matte finish but is no longer described as a pre-styler. Containing ingredients such as nettle extract, castor, organ and avocado oils as well as kaolin clay to reduce shine, this product build on the amazing versatility that made me fall in love with the original.\n\nPresentation:\nWe cannot start without talking about that insane package design. With these new products, RareCraft has taken a definitive leap ahead of the competition — Templeton Tonics included, which was my go-to “aesthetic bathroom jar”. The Sicilian Sunset theme is pure art: a mythical Polish lynx exuding colorful energy with a Sicilian port city in the background. It looks and feels artistic and expensive. The best in the game right now, without a doubt.\n\nScent Profile:\nSicilian Sunset is a scent profile with notes of rosemary, orange blossom, mandarin, neroli, bergamot, and lavender. It is an enticing composition on my nose, a definitive “late summer night in Italy” scent that screams Southern Italy with its notes of rosemary and mandarin. The neroli deepen and make it complex, introducing a healthy quality to the brightness. Finally, the lavender grounds it in the old tradition of Italian artisanal perfumes. For me, this scent is the quintessential modern take on the traditional Italian barbershop scents where bergamot, mint, and lavender were preponderant. I only wish it would last a bit longer. It’s that good.\n\nScoop + Application:\nAlong with the glass bottle, comes the pump — this didn’t clog for now, but it’s certainly possible it will. I just use a comb to remove the dried buildup and close it back when I don’t use it. The consistency is that of a liquid cream. Very easy to go overboard with it: I recommend two pumps maximum on short to medium lengths. I also suggest breaking it down a bit in the palm to let that scent shine before applying. The application is as easy as you can imagine, even in dry hair. Goes in like lotion.\n\nHold + Styling:\nThe product offers a true firm hold on towel-dry hair, as advertised. On damp hair, it’s more of a medium. Styling with it is painless, especially with the help of a blow drier to bring out the volume. The product is very responsive even to finger combing: that’s the way I like it the most as it brings out that perfect texture. Hold in my hair decreases after 6-7 hours, basically by the end of the day, and becomes a true medium. Reworkability is excellent even with just a bit of water.\n\nFinish:\nAs you can see from the pictures, that finish is spot on perfectly matte. In combination with the clay pomade, I got a beautiful natural to low-shine finish. In short, it is as matte as you can for the liquid state it is in. Quite an accomplishment.\n\nHair Feeling:\nHair feels nourished and healthy during every stage of application and use. A tiny bit of stiffness does set in but that goes with the great amount of hold it provides. In comparison with the original Navigator, hair definitely feels less dry and more fluffy.\n\nWashout:\nThe washout was very easy for me and only required a light conditioner. No shampoo was used. Hair as always with most RareCraft products feels great after washout, as it retains all those precious vitamins that the oils in the product provided.\n\nVerdict:\nI said it before: Navigator was a winner for me and my favourite liquid styler. The new Hair Cream doubles down on this win and gives us two new amazing scent options in Sicilian Sunset and Tortuga. What more could we want? I struggle to find disadvantages for this product. Yes, it may not be for you at the end of the day if you don’t enjoy liquid stylers. But the design, scent, hold, finish, and versatility of this stuff are unparalleled. It works amazing with the new RareCraft clay pomade, it works incredibly well with By Elementum Caeli, it works amazing even with Ivor’s Strongcreem, Samson’s Dead Sea Clay, and even on top of a scoop of Lodestar Everglade (didn’t have time to try it with more stuff but…you get the idea. It just works with most of the products you’ll have). This is like RareCraft’s Daniel Olbrychski to Ivor’s Sean Connery Strongcreem. I’ll never get tired of having this with me, like I’ll never get tired of watching these actors on the screen.\n\nNext up tomorrow is the Sicilian Sunset Clay Pomade, and I can assure you that’s another blast.\n\nKeep in mind that this is all personal experience and may not benefit you in the slightest.\n\nHave a good last swim/beginning of autumn folks 🤙",

The goal of these additional rules is to equip Game Masters with a more robust crafting rule set and to provide a richer gaming experience for players who are interested in crafting more of their own potions and poisons.\n\nThis supplement includes rules for players to increase their tool proficiencies to a level of **Master** and provides a recommendation for gaining tool proficiencies in a more attainable timeframe. It also provides new potions, poisons, crafting recipes, and sample reagent tables to assist Game Masters.\n\nIn the off chance that any crafting endeavors go awry, there is also a battle map for an alchemist’s lab at the end of this rules supplement.\n\nI hope you and your players find that these additional rules enhance your gaming experiences.\n\n# Mastering Your Craft\n\nAnyone who acquires and uses a crafting toolset for the first time dons the title of **Apprentice** in that craft. They gain the ability to craft at least one basic, well-known recipe found on the appropriate *Crafting Table* below.\n\nA character may wish to hone their crafting ability over time to become proficient and subsequently a master of their craft. If one of these characters is part of your game, then you should share the below requirements with them.\n\n# Gaining Proficiency\n\nTo become **Proficient** with a toolset, a character must both:\n\n· Study textbooks and scrolls on the toolset, or with someone else who is Proficient, for **20 hours**.\n\n· Successfully **create 5 items** that require the Apprentice level on the appropriate *Crafting Table*.\n\n# Becoming a Master\n\nTo reach the level of **Master** with a toolset, a character must both:\n\n· Study Master-Level textbooks and scrolls on the toolset, or with someone else who is a Master, for **60 hours.**\n\n· Successfully **create 8 items** that require the Proficient level on the appropriate *Crafting Table*.\n\n# Note to the Game Master:\n\nA Master-Level textbook or scroll is whatever ***you*** decide it to be. If you are concerned that a player may progress to a level of Master too quickly, this is one area you can control to ease their progression.\n\n# Milestone Progression\n\nAs an alternative form of progression, you can utilize the Milestone concept for leveling up.\n\nAfter you feel that an appropriate level of effort has been expended using or learning about a toolset, you can grant the character with either Proficiency or Master of their craft.\n\n# Crafting Mechanics\n\nThe sections below detail the various mechanics that are required to either craft an item or create a recipe. Each of these components is listed in the *Alchemy Crafting Table* and the *Poison Crafting Table* below.\n\n# Time Required\n\nCrafting items and making new recipes takes time. Recommended lengths of time are provided in the form of hours in the *Crafting Tables* below.\n\nTo provide characters with easier access to crafting, it is recommended that you allow characters to break up the required crafting time as they need, as opposed to completing the task in one sitting.\n\nFor particularly difficult recipes and crafting activities, or simply whenever you see fit, you may require that the task be completed in one sitting, or the character must start over.\n\n# Crafting Value\n\nCrafting items and making new recipes also requires an expenditure of **Crafting Reagents**. The value of Crafting Reagents needed is typically notated in gold pieces as a **Crafting Value**. Unless otherwise stated, the reagents are consumed when a **Crafting Check** is successfully completed.\n\nWhile crafting values are listed in gold pieces, characters will have a difficult time finding non-player characters willing to purchase reagents and crafted items for the listed amount.\n\n# Crafting Checks\n\nTo craft an item, or make a new recipe, a successful **Crafting Check** must be made while using the appropriate toolset. All Crafting Checks should be called for once the total Time Required has been expended.\n\nWhen completing a Crafting Check made with either Alchemist’s Supplies or a Poisoner’s Kit, the player may choose whether they wish to add their Wisdom or Intelligence modifier to their roll. A Proficiency Bonus may be applied if the character is proficient with the toolset being used.\n\nParticularly difficult recipes or tasks may require two or three successful Crafting Checks. All Crafting Checks must be successfully passed for the task to be considered a success.\n\n# Failing a Crafting Check:\n\nFailing a Crafting Check results in the loss of time and it may result in the loss of reagents if the failure was bad enough.\n\nIf a recipe or task requires multiple Crafting Checks and one of the checks is failed, the entire task is failed and you can disregard any subsequent Crafting Checks.\n\n# Varying Degrees of Success:\n\nAs the Game Master, you should use your own discretion when handling successful and failed Crafting Checks.\n\nThe below is a set of recommendations for handling Crafting Check successes and failures:\n\n· 15 above the DC: One third of the reagents were not consumed\n\n· 10 above the DC: One quarter of the reagents were not consumed\n\n· 2 below the DC: No reagents lost. The next time the same task is attempted, it takes half of the required time.\n\n· 5 below the DC: No reagents lost.\n\n· 10 below the DC: Half of the reagents are lost.\n\n· 15 below the DC: All of the reagents are lost.\n\n# Creating a Recipe\n\nAny player invested in crafting their own gear, consumables, or weapons will eventually ask to create something of their own design. Accounting for every possible request is impossible, but the below framework, and the use of your own judgement, should help guide you in making almost any crafting request a possibility.\n\nTo craft a new potion or poison, a player must create a **Recipe** for that item. Creating a recipe takes time, reagents for testing, and one or more successful Crafting Checks.\n\nOnce a player successfully creates a recipe, they will produce one of that potion or poison and always know how to create that item again.\n\n# Determining Difficulty\n\nMost potions and poisons that players ask to create will be comparable to the effects of existing spells. To determine the necessary requirements and difficulty of creating a recipe, leverage the *Recipe Creation Table* below which offers requirements based on Spell Level Equivalency.\n\nPotions and Poisons that are comparable to cantrips and spells of 1st to 3rd level should require the player to be proficient with the equivalent toolset.\n\nPotions and Poisons that are comparable to spells of 4th or higher level should require the player to be a Master of their craft.\n\nCreating a recipe requires more time and reagents than regular crafting due to testing and failing new ideas. If a recipe is already created and the player wishes to craft that same potion or poison again, the time and reagents required are **half** of what is listed on the *Recipe Creation Table.*\n\n# Recipe Creation Table\n\n|Level|Spell Level|Crafting DC|Checks|Hours|Crafting Value|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|*Proficient*||||||\n||Cantrip|12|1|12|100 gp|\n||1st Level|14|1|12|200 gp|\n||2nd Level|16|1|16|300 gp|\n||3rd Level|14|2|16|400 gp|\n|*Master*||||||\n||4th Level|16|2|20|500 gp|\n||5th Level|18|2|20|650 gp|\n||6th Level|16|3|24|1300 gp|\n||7th Level|18|3|36|2600 gp|\n||8th Level|20|3|48|5200 gp|\n||9th Level|22|4|84|10400 gp|\n\n\n\n# Alchemist’s Supplies\n\n# Apprentice\n\nAnyone who acquires and uses Alchemist’s Supplies gains the ability to craft a **Potion of Healing**. The Crafting Check DC, required hours, and total value of reagents that must be expended are listed below in the *Alchemy Recipes Table*.\n\n# Proficient\n\nBy becoming **Proficient** with Alchemist’s Supplies, you gain the ability to craft potions in the *Proficient* section of the *Alchemy Recipes Table*. You also gain the below features:\n\n# Proficiency\n\nYou may add your proficiency bonus to any ability check that uses Alchemist’s Supplies.\n\n# Quick Consumption\n\nYou learn how to alter the bottle of a potion to allow for quicker consumption. Changing a potion in this way allows it to be consumed using a bonus action.\n\nTo alter a potion for quick consumption, you must spend 1 hour with the potion using Alchemist’s Supplies to complete a Crafting Check. The DC is the same as the Crafting Check required to make the potion and you must expend 50 gold worth of crafting reagents.\n\nA failed check while using this feature results in the loss of the reagents and the potion remains unaffected.\n\n# Master Alchemist\n\nBy achieving the level of **Master Alchemist,** you gain the ability to craft potions in the *Master* section of the *Alchemy Recipes Table*. You also gain the below features:\n\n# Expertise\n\nYou may double your proficiency bonus for any ability check that uses Alchemist’s Supplies.\n\n# Increased Potency\n\nYou understand how to enhance a potion’s potency and can double the amount of its uses. This can only be done once to a potion.\n\nTo increase an existing potion’s potency, you must successfully pass the crafting checks necessary to craft the potion, but you only spend half of the time and expend half of the required crafting value to do so.\n\nA failed crafting check while using this feature does not result in lost reagents or potions.\n\n# Sample Potions\n\n# Potion of Aquatic Adaptation\n\nPotion, common\n\nWhen you drink this potion, your body adapts to an aquatic environment for one hour. You sprout gills and grow webbing between your fingers. You can breath underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.\n\n# Potion of Blinking\n\nPotion, rare\n\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the ability to teleport short distances for 1 minute.\n\nAs a bonus action you can teleport, along with any equipment that you are wearing or carrying, up to 40 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.\n\n# Potion of Elemental Transformation\n\nPotion, rare\n\nWhen you drink this potion, you transform into an elemental for one hour. The potion’s element determines which elemental you transform into (see the table below). Your game statistics are replaced by the appropriate elemental. You retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.\n\nYou can revert to your normal form early by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\n\n\n\n|*Potion Element*|*Elemental Statistics*|\n|:-|:-|\n|Air|Air Elemental|\n|Earth|Earth Elemental|\n|Fire|Fire Elemental|\n|Water|Water Elemental|\n\n\n\n# Potion of Lightning Strikes\n\nPotion, very rare\n\nWhen you drink this potion, your unarmed strikes are empowered for 1 minute and conjure a lightning bolt that can arc to another enemy.\n\nOnce per round, when you successfully hit a target with an unarmed strike, you may choose to have a bolt of lightning leap to another target within 30 feet. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 16). The target takes 8d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n# Potion of Sleep\n\nPotion, uncommon\n\nWhen you drink this potion, roll 5d8. If the total is greater than your current hit points, you fall unconscious for 10 minutes. The effects of this potion are undone if you take damage or someone else uses an action to shake or slap you awake.\n\nUndead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this potion.\n\n# Potion of The Keen Mind\n\nPotion, rare\n\nWhen you drink this potion, you can comprehend any written language and you read four times as fast for eight hours.\n\n# Alchemy Recipes Table\n\n|Level|Potion|Crafting DC|Checks|Hours|Crafting Value|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|*Apprentice*||||||\n||Potion of Healing|12|1|6|25 gp|\n|*Proficient*||||||\n||Oil of Slipperiness|16|2|10|240 gp|\n||Potion of Aquatic Adaptation|16|1|8|150 gp|\n||Potion of Climbing|14|1|6|90 gp|\n||Potion of Giant Strength - Hill|14|2|8|400 gp|\n||Potion of Giant Strength - Frost/Stone|16|2|10|600 gp|\n||Potion of Greater Healing|16|1|8|75 gp|\n||Potion of Growth|16|1|8|135 gp|\n||Potion of Resistance|16|1|8|150 gp|\n||Potion of Sleep|14|1|6|100 gp|\n||Potion of Water Breathing|14|1|6|90 gp|\n|*Master*||||||\n||Alchemy Jug|16|3|12|3000 gp|\n||Oil of Etherealness|18|3|18|960 gp|\n||Potion of Blinking|16|2|8|250 gp|\n||Potion of Clairvoyance|16|3|12|480 gp|\n||Potion of Diminution|14|2|8|135 gp|\n||Potion of Elemental Transformation|18|2|10|325 gp|\n||Potion of Flying|16|2|10|250 gp|\n||Potion of Gaseous Form|16|2|10|150 gp|\n||Potion of Giant Strength - Fire|18|2|10|900 gp|\n||Potion of Giant Strength - Cloud|18|3|18|1400 gp|\n||Potion of Heroism|14|2|8|90 gp|\n||Potion of Invisibility|14|2|8|90 gp|\n||Potion of Lightning Strikes|16|3|12|650 gp|\n||Potion of Mind Reading|14|2|8|90 gp|\n||Potion of Speed|14|2|8|200 gp|\n||Potion of Superior Healing|16|2|10|225 gp|\n||Potion of Supreme Healing|16|3|12|675 gp|\n||Potion of The Keen Mind|18|2|10|325 gp|\n||Sovereign Glue|14|2|8|200 gp|\n\n\n\n# Poisoner’s Kit\n\n# Poisons\n\nPoisons come in the following four types.\n\n**Contact**. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.\n\n**Ingested**. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.\n\n**Inhaled**. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.\n\n**Injury**. Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.\n\n# Apprentice\n\nAnyone who acquires and uses a Poisoner’s Kit gains the ability to craft a **Potion of Poison**. The Crafting Check DC, required hours, and total value of reagents that must be expended are listed below in the *Poison Recipes Table*.\n\n# Proficient\n\nBy becoming **Proficient** with a Poisoner’s Kit, you gain the ability to craft poisons in the *Proficient* section of the *Poison Recipes Table*. You also gain the below features:\n\n# Proficiency\n\nYou may add your proficiency bonus to any ability check that uses a Poisoner’s Kit.\n\n# Alter Delivery\n\nYou learn how to alter the delivery method of a poison and adapt it to your weaponry. When you change a poison in this way you change the poison type to Injury.\n\nTo change a poison’s type to Injury, you must spend 1 hour with the poison using a Poisoner’s Kit to complete a Crafting Check. The DC is the same as the Crafting Check required to make the poison and you must expend 50 gold worth of crafting reagents.\n\nA failed check while using this feature results in the loss of the reagents and the poison remains unaffected.\n\n# Master Poisoner\n\nBy achieving the level of **Master Poisoner,** you gain the ability to craft poisons in the *Master* section of the *Poison Recipes Table*. You also gain the below features:\n\n# Expertise\n\nYou may double your proficiency bonus for any ability check that uses a Poisoner’s Kit.\n\n# Self-Tester\n\nYou have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.\n\n# Increased Potency\n\nYou understand how to enhance a poison’s potency and effectiveness. Poisons with increased potency can affect creatures who are immune to poisons.\n\nTo increase an existing poison’s potency, you must successfully pass the crafting checks necessary to craft the poison, but you only spend half of the time and expend half of the required crafting value to do so.\n\nA failed crafting check while using this feature does not result in lost reagents or poisons.\n\n# Sample Poisons\n\n# Dark Rain\n\nPoison (ingested), rare\n\nA creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 10 minutes. The poisoned creature loses blindsight, darkvision, and truesight for the duration of the poison.\n\n# Gorgon’s Breath\n\nPoison (inhaled), rare\n\nA creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.\n\n# Harrow\n\nPoison (injury), uncommon\n\nA creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) psychic damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage. After one successful save, the poison ends.\n\n# Magebane\n\nPoison (inhaled), rare\n\nA creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature can only cast one spell or cantrip per round of combat.\n\n# Tolling Bell\n\nPoison (injury), common\n\nA creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature cannot regain any hit points.\n\n# Weighted Anchor\n\nPoison (contact), very rare\n\nA creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. On a failed save, the poisoned creature begins choking. The poisoned creature repeats the saving throw every 6 seconds. A successful saving throw ends the poison.\n\nWhen a creature is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\n\n# Poison Recipes Table\n\n|Level|Poison|Type|Crafting DC|Checks|Hours|Crafting Value|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|*Apprentice*|||||||\n||Potion of Poison|Ingested|10|1|6|50 gp|\n|*Proficient*|||||||\n||Assassin's Blood|Ingested|12|1|6|75 gp|\n||Crawler Mucus|Contact|14|1|6|100 gp|\n||Drow Poison|Injury|14|1|6|100 gp|\n||Harrow|Injury|14|2|8|200 gp|\n||Malice|Inhaled|16|1|8|125 gp|\n||Oil of Taggit|Contact|14|2|8|200 gp|\n||Pale Tincture|Ingested|16|1|8|125 gp|\n||Serpent Venom|Injury|14|1|6|100 gp|\n||Tolling Bell|Injury|12|1|6|50 gp|\n||Truth Serum|Ingested|14|1|6|75 gp|\n|*Master*|||||||\n||Burnt Other Flames|Inhaled|16|2|10|250 gp|\n||Dark Rain|Ingested|16|2|10|250 gp|\n||Essence of Ether|Inhaled|14|2|8|150 gp|\n||Gorgon's Breath|Inhaled|16|2|10|250 gp|\n||Magebane|Inhaled|16|2|10|250 gp|\n||Midnight Tears|Ingested|16|3|12|750 gp|\n||Purple Worm Poison|Injury|18|3|18|1000 gp|\n||Torpor|Ingested|18|2|10|300 gp|\n||Weighted Anchor|Contact|18|3|18|1300 gp|\n||Wyvern Poison|Injury|16|3|12|600 gp|\n\n\n\n# Sample Reagent Tables\n\n# Reagent Table Overview\n\nThe tables below provide sample reagents that you can offer your players if they search for crafting materials. These items can be found in the wilderness, on the bodies of fallen foes, or may be sold by reagent merchants. These materials would be appropriate for crafting with either **Alchemist’s Supplies** or **Poisoner’s Kits**.\n\nD20 pairings are provided if you wish to randomize what the player finds.\n\nThe **Crafting Value** provided is per reagent. If you wish to provide your players with a greater reward than just one reagent, roll for quantity using the recommended die in the **Quantity** column\n\n# Arctic Reagents\n\n|d20|Quantity|Reagent|Description|Crafting Value|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|1d8|Blue Winter Blade Trimming|A variety of frost-resistant grass that has a distinctive blue color.|5 gp|\n|2|1d2|Chillweed Paste|White paste derived from a weed that grows underneath ice.|25 gp|\n|3|1d6|Dusk Root|Gnarled root with a fibrous, deep red and purple interior.|10 gp|\n|4|1d4|Frozen Silkweed|A small rigid plant with silky white leaves.|15 gp|\n|5|1d10|Glacial Holly Branch Shavings|Pale green shavings that have a sharp, invigorating scent.|5 gp|\n|6|1d4|Gnome Birch Sapling|Small sapling with pale, smooth bark.

I hope to have the results within about 10 days. Thought I'd let everyone know! I will make a new post once the result are in. The stack I've been using this time consists of the following:\n\nIn the morning vit d3+k2, nmn, quercetin, dioscorea nipponica, shilajit, black ginger, (now brand) stinging nettle root extract.\n\nIn the evening I take bacopa 24, milk thistle, magnolia bark, mag glycinate",

I did a very similar self-protocol to yours and it got me maybe 70% of the way there. Doing the shoemaker protocol and taking the CSM has helped me get another 20% healed. I’m starting VIP in a couple of weeks which will hopefully get me to 100%.\n\nIf you for whatever reason can’t work with a Shoemaker protocol practitioner, I would suggest using okra and beet powder as a binder as it has the right negative charge for binding mycotoxins. I took MycoBind. Also, immunoglobulins were really helpful too! Mega IgG2000 by microbiome labs is a great dairy free option. Also might want to join the r/cirs group. \n\nGood luck!",

I've read we actually build up a tolerance to antihistamines, which is very frustrating, so moved to cetrizine for this year. Think it might be worth alternating between the two every year. The doctor also recommended two tablets per day, one in the morning and one in the evening, ignoring the \"one a day\" advice on the packets.\n\n2. Dymista nose spray. This seems to be helping massively but you do need a prescription. You can get one online, however the spray isn't cheap. It's around £20 per bottle, but it's worked great for me. I've been taking Sudafed nose spray beforehand to unbung my sinuses, then once unbunged I use the dymista. Once in the morning and once in the evening also.\n\n3. Stinging nettles. \n\n3A) I finally built up the courage this year to sting the shit out of my legs. Essentially stinging nettle stings reduce the histamine response (allergic reaction to hayfever) in our bodies, reducing the symptoms. This actually helped. I've only done one lot of this so far, apparently you need to do it fairly regularly over the course of 3 years to get rid of hayfever symptoms. A couple of days of itchy stings is well worth the pay off of reduced hayfever symptoms. Just pick some nettles, be brave and slap your legs with them. I'm going to keep up this treatment on a weekly to bi weekly basis.\n\n3B) Nettle tea. After the stings I made a nettle tea and drank it. Supposed to also help. Will do this after each stinging bout.\n\n3C) Nettle root extract. I'm taking a capsule a day to try to help. I did try this last year on its own and it did bugger all, but I'm hoping if it's alongside the stings and nettle tea it might help alleviate the hayfever response a bit more.\n\n4. ZMA before bed to help with sleep. I tend to find hayfever wakes me up in the night leading to less sleep, higher stress etc, meaning my hayfever gets worse, which in turn leads to my sleep getting worse etc, with all of the negatives exacerbating each other. A ZMA supplement tends to help me sleep a little deeper meaning I'm less likely to wake up in the middle of the night sneezing. Seems to at least stave it off until the early hours of the morning. Not sure if you need the zinc part, I think it's just the magnesium that helps you sleep, but can't hurt to keep zinc levels up with it.\n\n5. All the other generic bollocks on Google; dry clothes indoors, change clothes if you've been outside, hypoallergenic bedding, air filters, wooden floors instead of carpets, all the usual stuff.\n\nIt's still early days this season, but yeah, hope this helps. Hayfever fucking sucks ",

This morning, I found out that my head is visible because I have so little hair. \n\nI'm on birth control because of my reproductive health issues. I take 200mg zoloft, euthyrox (lebothyroxine), vit d, vit c, and some other meds. I recently started taking methionin but after 3 weeks, my hair is even getting worse. \n\nI use nettle extract shampoo and nettle spray for hair loss.\n\nIs there something that really helped anyone? I'm getting desperate because I go to school every day and feel insecure and anxious about it. My hair also gets very oily ebery second day. I'm 18 if it helps.\n\nI know it probably is from the meds and stress but I can't change anything about it. \n\nThank you in advance \n\n",

I usually use some natural shampoo that has purported DHT/Inflammation blockers like Saw Palmetto, Black Cumin, Azelaic Acid Etc. instead of keto, which I've found that I don't tolerate well. This stack rank is totally subjective and based on about 3 years of personal use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1st [Pura D'or](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013X3IAU2/ref=sspa_dk_detail_1?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B013X3IAU2&pd_rd_w=c9Xkq&pf_rd_p=733540df-430d-45cd-9525-21bc15b0e6cc&pd_rd_wg=LW5Xe&pf_rd_r=AJKA7PN6EW86Y8QPRJTR&pd_rd_r=9cf8ed9d-3733-11e9-a62e-358d4c5f0879). $24 on Amazon 16 oz. They essentially take the kitchen sink approach - throwing in about a dozen purported DHT blocking ingredients which if you’re looking for the most effective ingredients amidst inconclusive research, feels like a safe/hedged bet. Love the minimalistic scent. At 16 Oz for $24, this is also the best deal on the list. \n\n2nd[ Hims DHT Blocker Shampoo](https://www.forhims.com/hair-loss/dht-blocker-shampoo). *$14 + $5* Shipping 8oz*.* From a value perspective this stuff is great, and I also recommend HIMS for guys looking to get a Finasteride script online. This doesn't have any Saw Palmetto (probably the ingredient with the highest amount of research backing it as a DHT blocker) which prevents it from sliding into 1st place. The Nettle extract and Salicylic acid are probably the main ingredients that are used for fighting inflammation and build-up of keratin in hair follicles. Also, nice that it doesn't have fragrance, but a bit annoying that it's dyed blue.\n\n3rd [Bevisen Organic Anti-DHT Shampoo ](https://bevisen.com/collections/frontpage/products/bevisen-organic-anti-dht-shampoo)$16.11-free shipping 8oz. Kind of a random one that I bought on a whim as it’s hard to find Saw Palmetto + Azeliac Acid together. Generally I liked it and it seems like it has those two ingredients in reasonably high quantities. It’s an Italian brand - which might explain the fairly strong woodsy/cologne-like scent (only thing I wasn’t a fan of personally). \n\n4th [Ultrax Labs Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007SZCG0C?aaxitk=EQ1.CYLOR3a-4e9RwKLzdA&pd_rd_i=B007SZCG0C&pf_rd_p=e037c154-e093-48a4-b127-477e5e294e3f&hsa_cr_id=2792550440801&sb-ci-n=productDescription&sb-ci-v=Ultrax%20Labs%20Hair%20Surge%20%7C%20Caffeine%20Hair%20Loss%20Hair%20Growth%20Stimulating%20Shampoo%208%20oz). $56 on Amazon 8oz. This stuff technically has keto in it (0.2%), but at such a trace amount I'm including it in the all-natural list. Looking at the ingredients list, I suspect Saw Palmetto is less than half a percent. Based on how it felt on my scalp and how my hair looked after drying, this is a decent overall shampoo, but with a small bottle (like 8ozs) there is nothing to justify the $56 dollar price tag.\n\n5th[ Hairgenics Pronexa Clinical Strength Hair Growth & Regrowth Therapy Shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/Hairgenics-Pronexa-Clinical-Strength-Regrowth/dp/B01GW3R9NY/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1550710440&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=anti-dht+shampoo&psc=1&smid=A1CVR8FHKBH4XE). $39 on Amazon 8oz. This seems to rely on saw palmetto and biotin. If this was at a decent price, it would be a bit better than mediocre, but foran 8oz bottle, there's no way this guy is worth the $39 dollar price tag.

Their [other drinks](https://www.vitaminwell.com/sv/funktionella-drycker/) didn't do anything for me, and the difference seems to be that the drink that worked (it's discontinued) had nettle extract in it.

So I’m stuck in a constant search. I recently got a bottle from a rando Etsy shop and was super amped to try it since it actually checked EVERY box of my ridiculous wishlist. It was clarifying rather than moisturizing, contained nettle extract, contained peppermint and didn’t have a “thick” scent (ginger lime.) Well I just got out of the shower and the “ginger lime” read as straight broccoli. BROCCOLI. Not pleased. So, please, please HELP ME! \n\nI don’t care if it’s liquid or bar form but it really needs to be clarifying or for “oily” hair types. Moisturizing and “dry” hair formulas aren’t my friend. If it’s a cooling/light scent or contains peppermint or menthol, even friggin better but at this point I’m not going to be too dang picky. \n\nTHANK YOU!",

I often do eggs with breakfast and some wild meat or seafood with dinner.  I could possibly include more organ meat to really max out my *paleo-status*, but I'm just not quite there yet.  I usually eat these around 2x square meals with 16:8 IF, and my body fat hovers around 12% (BMI @ 23.)  My last A1C was 4.9%.\n\nIn the mornings, I go out for a 30-40m walk, where the UV is around 5-6 outside (it gets up over 100F here in the summer), then I often do this again in the evening, where it's around UV 4-5.  I figure I *should* be good on vitamin D.\n\nThe last hormone panel I ran had SHBG at 76 (nmol/L) on a range from 10 - 57, which was sort of off the top of the chart.  This drops free (active) testosterone down to 7.1 ng/dL on a range from 9.0 - 30.0, off the bottom of the chart.  Total T was in the clear at 628 on a range of 160 - 726.  TSH measured 2.755 (ulU/mL) on a range of 0.358 - 3.74, slightly elevated.  My IGF1 listed at 76 (ng/mL) which was very low -- on par with a woman in her 80's... I'm a male in my early 30's -- I eat plenty of methionine per day (upward of 100-150g/d protein while lifting heavy weights -- my deadlifts are almost up to 405lbs.)\n\nI currently supplement 225mcg of Iodine via Potassium Iodide, since my sea salt is not fortified.\n\nI was reading that supplemental Boron / Zinc might help to lower SHBG and more Iodine / Selenium might decrease TSH.  I was seeing these listed on the PerfectHealthDiet's Recommended Supplements page.\n\nHave you guys looked into supplemental Boron / Zinc / Iodine / Selenium / D3 supplementation or have any tips for further balancing out these hormones (I was reading about herbs like stinging nettle root extract) ?",

I had terrible bloating and gut pain and a lot of stuff after not like all vegetables and fruits. even though eaten carnivore for almost a year before that.\n\nI tried two days two hass avocado organic and nothing no bloating no pain just like I wouldn’t eat it at all.\n\nI do not know if this is one thing or it helped in long run but we will see.\n\nI been doing it for few weeks a month now and seeing the difference.\n\nI still can not eat anything without issues with autoimmune and MCAS and reactions beside carnivore but goal is to not have to eat meat only for the rest of the life but to choose only eat only meat.\n\nChosen, not forced!\n\nHere is what I did:\n\n\\- NO-PLANT GAPS diet ( cooked / boiled for meat stocks and boiled meat so lamb or chicken sometimes beef and fat and organs ( not fat around the organs ( chelev ) ( suet ) it is horrid and after a while goat or sheep kefir with kefir grains. No eggs especially whites ( later yolks maybe later but way later....\n\n\\- mineral water 2-3 L per day\n\n\\- Betaine HCL + pepsin 1:3000 ( 975 mg + 225mg) for each meal so one to three times a day\n\n\\- TUDCA 1200mg for before each meal sometimes less max around 2000 mg a day\n\n\\- OX BILE 250mg to 500mg a day before each meal so sometimes 125mg per meal or 250mg per meal\n\n\\- Freeze dried Grass fed beef kidney 1500mg to 3000mg per meal / day ( helps with histamine load etc and great source of selenium and b vitamins)\n\n\\- Stinging nettle extract 1000mg per meal  ( helps with histamine and other stuff awesome )\n\n\\- B1 healing protocol ( Thiactive b complex one caps a day with benfotiamine 50mg and TTFD 100mg )\n\n\\- B2 100mg\n\n\\- Magnesium glycinate ( 400mg to 600mg ) spread throughout the day.\n\n\\- Molybdenum ( helps with sulfur metabolism and food intolerances) 150ug a day but I increased it to 300ug from few days.\n\n\\- EDTA 1500mg 3 times a week followed by few sprays of Colloidal silver ACS 200 or other a silver above 200 PPM ( antibacterial and helps heavy metal toxicity)\n\n\\- NAC from 1600mg to 3200 mg a day and liposomal glutathione 500mg a day ( I see it helps with bacterial overgrowth)\n\n\\- Vitamin c ( ascorbic acid tapioca based or camu camu ) 1000mg to 3000mg a since it helps stabilize MCAS and lower histamine\n\n\\- Freeze dried Trace beef organs they helps with many things in the body…\n\n\\- Freze dried Beef Cartilage Codeage ( helping joints and knees and of course with gut health)\n\nStill continuing binder to get rid of mold.

    "body": "So far I co-washed two times.\n\nFirst time I did it the lush way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage, wash, put significant amount of conditioner on hair from roots to ends, wait, wash. The hair was clean, I think it was too clean, there was more resistance when brushing vs after shampoo washing, there was significantly more hair left on my hands (and on the brush when brushing too I think) when applying the product. I think the hair was somewhat sticky and waxy, but not too much.\n\nThe second time I did it the easy way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage (and in the process get a bit on the hair and ends too), wait, wash. The hair was clean enough (not shampoo-clean, but I think that's better for my hair and for my scalp's accomodation). There was more resistance when brushign vs after shampoo washing (and I think also vs the first co-wash). There too was significantly more hair left on my hands when applying the product, but because it was applied only once it was this much less hair loss. My hair is sticky, waxy. It looks good, but feels really bad, because of the stickiness.\n\nI used warm water.\n\nTo put this into perspective, if I brush my hair downwards while leaning down, the hair will literally stay in the air afterwards as if I gelled it or something. This effect is present to some extent after I shampoo-wash too, but not this extremely. It's also quite difficult to brush in the first place.\n\nThe conditioner somewhat sticks to the hair even while washing with it, the consistency of conditioner is gluey, sticky, it doesn't make my fingers run through my hair with conditioner applied run buttery smoothly, but rather the complete opposite, I'm scared of pulling my hair out this way... No hair loss when rinsing it off. \n\nMy scalp is also itchy as fuck now. My guess is the preservatives Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone are to blame, but the thing is the shampoo has them too, so maybe not and the waxiness or whatever (co-washing in general) causes this?\n\nI'm pretty certain that the conditioner causes this. I didn't use any other product. When I wash with just shampoo from the same brand (it's SLES based, but it's the opposite of potent, I take few times more of it to achieve the same potency that normal SLS shampoos have, could be the conditioner is similarly \"potent\") and either don't use any other product or only few drops of oil it won't be like this and it's pretty much what I want.\n\nThe ingredients of the conditioner:\n> Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract, Inula Helenium Extract, Humulus Lupulus Flower Extract, Helianthus Annuus Hybrid Oil, Cera Alba, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Chamomilla Recutita Oil, Geranium Sibiricum Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, PEG-12 Dimethicon, Pinus Sibirica Needle Extract, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil Polyglyceryl-6 Esters, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Ceteareth-20, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nNote that Cera Alba (Bees wax), Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride (guar gum derivative) and PEG-12 Dimethicon (water-soluble sillicon) are in it. Could it be that the Bees wax is the problem? The two other ingredients are water soluble so shouldn't be... Cera Alba (Bees wax) is also in the shampoo, but probably in smaller quantity.\n\nIngredients of the shampoo:\n> Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract*, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Glycine Soja Oil, Urtica Dioica Extract*, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Water*, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract*, Salvia Officnalis Oil, Carum Carvi Fruit Oil, Mel*, Saponaria Officinalis Root Extract*, Cera Alba, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Benzyl Salicylate, Hexyl Cinnamal, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nShould I buy another conditioner, keep on using this one or switch to non-harsh shampoo? If I should switch conditioner, what ingredients should I be looking for except no wax and sillicon? No oils? Other surfactants (glucosides instead of kationic chlorides)? Something more oily? Something very minimalistic (just kationic surfactans like cetrimonium chloride and humectants like cetearyl alcohol)? Something with more humectants?  I wouldn't be super happy buying another conditioner just to find out it's trash and I have nothing to do with it.\n\nEdit: My hair is ~5inch/13cm long.",

        "body": "I'm no expert and this is just personal experience over the past several years but I would try an SLS-free shampoo & silicon-/wax-free conditioner to see if that helps. It sounds more like an issue with the conditioner ingredients or other products sticking to your hair and scalp then not getting washed out with the co-wash so it builds up on your hair more and more. I tried many conditioners to co-wash and also water-only but neither worked for me. My hair ended up stringy, heavy and waxy though not as quickly as you have experienced. I have very hard water where I live which can also add to the problem.  You can also look into an apple cider vinegar rinse as an alternative (lots of info on the side-bar).\n\nI have had good success with SLS-free shampoo plus silicon-free conditioner every second wash or so. I only have to wash it once a week with water-only rinses as needed in between washes and my scalp is much less itchy and dry than when I was using regular shampoo or co-washing. When particularly dry and itchy, I use jojoba oil on my scalp as a mask/cleanse before I shower, massage it in well, leave it on for 5-10 minutes then wash out . This also helps with any build-up of product on my scalp.\n\nIt will probably take some trial and error to find out what works for you and a bit of time for your scalp to transition. You may also need to use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of all the build-up on your hair before starting over to give you a clean start but not everyone needs that step.",

Simple. \n\nIf you are switching to low poo products and just using those, I would say it’s probably a bit of waxiness from transition. That’s normal and just a matter of lifting the waxiness (apple sauce mask, egg, or a full-poo shampoo) and forging ahead.  If you’re still using full poo products (which it looks like you are, regardless of how you’re using them) it’s probably just a bad formulation for you and/or the water coming out of your tap.   Find something inexpensive to try.  Burt’s Bees, L’Oreal Paris Evercurl or Evercreme cleansing conditioners, Nature’s Gate, VO5 conditioners in the white bottles (if they’re still packaged the same as when this list was made) are all fairly widely-available and often fairly inexpensive options.",

    "body": "Hi guys. Sorry for the delay, had some IRL issues to deal with, but here is my regimen to rescue my overloaded, protein-sensitive hair. My hair is also medium to low porosity and takes to oils. \n\nThere are 4 Parts: The pre-poo, shampoo, deep moisture mask and leave-in conditioner. I've also added links to the products I use (NOT affiliate links!). I do this entire thing once a week. \n\n**REGIMEN**\n\n**Pre-poo**:\n\nA mix of natural oils. They all have a specific property ex. carrier oils, moisturizing, penetrative etc. You can either mix them yourselves, or get a mix of which ever ones are necessary from places like health food stores, online beauty shops (http://www.makeupartistschoice.com/) or beauty supply outlets- my favourite is Clore in Toronto. Most are very affordable, so ignore the $60-$100 ones from places like Sephora. As long as they are pure oils without preservatives or additives you're good. \n\nJojoba,\nTocopherol (Vitamin E),\nTea Tree,\nOlive,\nJamaican Black Castor,\nAmla,\nSweet Almond,\nShea Butter,\nHorse Chestnut Seed Extract,\nSeabuckhorn Extract,\nGreet Tea Extract,\nNettle Extract,\nGinkgo Biloba Extract,\nSafflower Extract,\n\nI warm it up a little bit and add it to my sectioned hair, focusing on the scalp and ends, then massage for about 10-15 min. I put a plastic bag on my head and let it get soaked up for about an hour or so. Please note that oils derived from protein -based items are chemically not the same as using actual protein ingredients. In fact, even if there is protein, it is so minuscule to basically not make a huge difference in the overall scheme. The reason why a lot of people have issues with coconut oil (myself included) is due to the presence of Lauric Acid- which tends to \"bind\" and seal the protein to the hair, causing a build-up and no real penetration of moisture. \n\n**Shampoo**\n\nFor my shampoo, I use [Live Clean Apple Cider Clarifying Shampoo](https://www.amazon.ca/Live-Clean-Vinegar-Clarifying-Shampoo/dp/B00BIWYZZK/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1502292344&sr=1-1&keywords=live+clean+apple+cider+vinegar+clarifying+shampoo). This is my absolute holy grail. Vegan as well as SLS / Sulfate Free, Paraben Free, Phthalate & Phosphate Free,\nPetroleum Free\n\n**Deep Moisture Mask**\n\nAfter clarifying I use Snowymoon's Moisture Mask Recipe; which I personally think is a miracle. Also where I finger de-tangle slowly and gently.:\n\n4 parts conditioner \n\n[1 part honey](https://www.amazon.ca/Capilano-Honey-Natural-Manuka-375ml/dp/B00NT4ZLVM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1502294119&sr=8-1&keywords=manuka+honey)\n\n[1 part clear aloe gel](https://www.amazon.ca/Lily-Desert-99-Percent-Certified-Organic/dp/B003HUJK24/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1502294184&sr=8-4&keywords=organic+aloe+vera+gel)\n\nHeat in the microwave for a few seconds til it's warm, then apply to wet or dry hair (especially the ends). Cover hair with a shower cap/shopping bag/clingy food wrap/whatever, and let it sit for as long as you can stand it (30 minutes to overnight). Rinse out, do not shampoo. \n\n**Leave-in**\n\nAfter rising out the deep moisture mask and while my hair is still dripping wet, I add some [TRESemmé Perfectly (un)Done Weightless Moisturizing Conditioner](https://www.amazon.ca/TRESemm%C3%A9-Perfectly-Weightless-Moisturizing-Conditioner/dp/B00S67DRLS/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1502292970&sr=1-1&keywords=tresemme+undone) mixed with a bit of jojoba oil mixture throughout my hair and seal it off with clear Aloe Vera Gel. I do this as needed throughout the week depending on the thirst of my hair. I just make sure to wet it first, especially if it's looking like my hair needs detangling. \n\nSince following this regimen, my hair feels super soft and less like tangled and knotted straw.",

    "body": "First off, huge thank you to each one of you that is a part of this reddit community! This subreddit has given me the confidence and courage to take on this nasty disease. I have learned so much from you all, and I wanted to return the favor by writing about my journey and my plan to heal from SIBO-C. I will keep this post updated over the coming weeks, and this will serve as a nice motivator for me to keep at it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Start of My SIBO-C Journey**\n\nThroughout my whole life, I had great digestion. I could eat anything without gaining much weight and would have consistent, healthy bowel movements (BMs). This all came to a halt in the Fall of 2021 at the age of 26. I started to have periods of constipation where I wouldn’t have a BM for 3 days. I quickly resolved these episodes by taking chewable Dulcolax. I wasn’t too alarmed about these episodes at the time.\n\nIn January 2022, I started my own technology company. Stress levels obviously increased significantly, but I continued to keep a relatively healthy lifestyle. I prepped healthy meals for the week (rice, quinoa, animal protein, and vegetables) and exercised 6 days a week. By the end of February, I started to get severely constipated. This happened to be right after having a cold / virus. I went back to my Dulcolax, but it seemed to make it worse. By day 6 of bad constipation and extreme bloating, I went to see a GI who told me to get take 3 caps of MiraLAX to resolve my constipation. It worked, and I felt so relieved. I, however, was unable to ween of MiraLAX, and constipation kept coming back. I had to take at least 1 cap of MiraLAX a day to stay regular.\n\nI went back to my GI. She is a saint. She immediately concluded that I may have SIBO-C, and she ordered blood tests and a breath test. Blood tests came back with elevated liver enzymes, but all else normal. The breath test came back “very positive” (as my GI puts it, LOL) for methane product (84 ppm). I had a liver ultrasound done, but all was normal there. Liver enzymes returned normal after a new blood test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Attempt #1 to “Cure”**\n\nIn June 2022, I started a rifaximin and neomycin regimen for 2 weeks. WOW. It worked almost immediately. By day 2 on the regimen, I had die-off symptoms. But by day 3, I was able to completely ween off MiraLAX and have perfectly formed, satisfying BMs. I felt like a million bucks. By the end of the regimen, it seemed like I was “cured”, so I went about living my life normally.\n\nExactly 30 days after ending the regimen, I relapsed. I was constipated for 3 days, and I was back on MiraLAX. I felt defeated. My GI suggested started another round of antibiotics, but I didn’t want to hop on them again so quickly after reading more deeply about some of the negative effects. I just went about my life taking 1 cap of MiraLAX a day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Attempt #2 to “Cure”**\n\nCome April 2023, I became annoyed and tired about being bloated all the time. I have been reading this subreddit for some time and became convinced that I should give herbal treatment a try. I connected with a functional health specialist, redid a breath taste, and completed a GI Map. She assigned be a protocol that was quite robust. I quickly became overwhelmed by all the requirements and diet restrictions, so I gave up and went back to my daily cap of MiraLAX.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Giving Up, Symptoms, and My New Determination to Heal**\n\nStress at work continued to increase over time, and I was obviously not handling it well. I wanted to enjoy my downtime without restrictions and having to lug around supplements wherever I went. I love eating out with friends and enjoying my weekends by adventuring new neighborhoods and cuisines. So, I continued my daily cap of MiraLAX and gave little thought to my SIBO-C.\n\nMy symptoms from SIBO-C continued to get worse through 2023. I would bloat aggressively after meals (even low fodmap meals). I started to have histamine responses to everything, and I would break out in hives if I ate high histamine foods. I had to hop on daily Zyrtec to keep my symptoms at bay. My stress levels also started to get unbearable, and I was having panic attacks in social settings. I have to present in front of audiences a lot at work, and these presentations started to become very difficult. I also had difficulty sleeping longer than 4 hours a night. SIBO-C definitely has a negative feedback loop effect with regard to stress and anxiety. My SIBO-C was likely amplifying my anxiety symptoms.\n\nBy January 2024, I decided to take control and try to make myself feel better by committing to heal my SIBO-C. This time I had a different mindset and understood this requires healing journey rather than a one time cure. I spent the month of January reading almost every post on this subreddit to figure out my personal protocol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Root Cause Hypotheses**\n\nIt is clear that my root cause is stress. The only major change in my life is the founding of my company. This is when all my symptoms started. I also believe that the illness I had in February 2022 could have been a trigger that set off my SIBO-C. For SIBO-C sufferers, it is key to keep BMs moving, and any irregularity in BMs could cause a relapse or a worsening of SIBO-C. Also, because I was busy running my company, my meal prepping got a bit lazy. I kept things very simple and easy to make. This may have resulted in being too restrictive with my diet, and I may have not gotten the appropriate amount of nutrients to keep my migrating motor complex (MMC) going.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Current Protocol to Heal**\n\nWith SIBO, you need to both heal your gut, kill off the bad bacteria, and solve the root cause problem. Like I mentioned, I spent a lot of time on reddit just learning. I dug through the SIBO, social anxiety, and anxiety subreddits. I then came up with a plan and protocol.\n\nSolving my Root Cause:\n\nAs I mentioned, my root cause is likely stress. The stress and social anxiety became unbearable. For presentations, I was symptom managing by taking propranolol to limit the symptoms of social anxiety. I tried a multitude of natural methods to resolve it, but I ultimately decided to get on SSRIs. I got a prescription on [hims.com](https://hims.com) and started 50 mg of Zoloft for 4 weeks. I immediately felt the effects of it. I felt almost high and very calm, and I had the urge to dance anytime I heard music, LOL. The effects started to taper off over time, and I increased my dosage to 100 mg by week 4 with no side effects. I believe it is slightly working now, but I am going to give it some more time before increasing dosage. I still have panic attacks, but they are way more manageable.\n\nHerbal Protocol:\n\n* Every meal\n   * 900 mg of allicin extract (Allimax Pro, kill agent)\n   * 1 capsule of Kirman Biofilm Defense\n   * 1 capsule of Enzymedica Digest Gold with ATPro\n   * 1 capsule of Designs for Health LV-GB Complex (to promote bile production)\n   * 100 mg of Oregano Oil (ADP, kill agent)\n   * 2 capsules of Integrative Berberine Complex (kill agent)\n* Morning\n   * 100 mg of Zoloft\n   * 25 mcg of vitamin D3\n   * 600 mg of quercetin (histamine support)\n   * 600 mg of nettle extract (histamine support)\n   * 500 mg of artichoke extract (MMC activator)\n* Night\n   * 500 mg of artichoke extract (MMC activator)\n   * 1 cap of MiraLAX\n\nI am now two weeks into the protocol. I titrated all of these supplements over a 2 week period.\n\nHow I am currently feeling:\n\nI noticed improvements largely from the allicin, LV-GB Complex, and artichoke extract. My stomach is much flatter now, and I am not bloating as much after meals. A good test for me is eating an orange as historically oranges immediately caused a lot of trap gas. I am able to eat an orange without any pain now. Additionally, my BMs are more well-formed and feel complete. I don’t have to drink as much coffee to stimulate a BM. I am starting feel like I can taper of MiraLAX soon! I will likely add additional MMC activators and magnesium citrate as a replacement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Diet**\n\nDuring the work week, I eat a meal prepped meal. I have provided a summary below of what my daily meals look like. I am very active and do strength training, so I try to consume a healthy amount of calories and protein to keep satiated and feeling good.\n\n* Breakfast\n   * Protein: 4 large eggs or 7 ounces of chicken breast\n   * Carbs: 1 cup of blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, or pineapple\n* Lunch/Dinner\n   * Protein: 12 ounces of chicken breast, chicken thigh, pork tenderloin, pork chops, cod, salmon, or etc.\n   * Vegetables: green beans, zucchini, carrots, or baby corn\n   * Carbs: brown rice, white rice, potatoes, or sweet potatoes\n   * Fats: ½ tbsp of olive oil (doing this really improved my sleep)\n   * Seasonings: chili powder, paprika, cumin, turmeric, thyme, oregano, basil, hot sauces, mustards, or etc.\n* Snacks:\n   * 1 cup of blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, or pineapple\n   * Almonds or peanuts\n   * Dark chocolate\n\nOn the weekends, I eat out regularly and don’t have a care for what I am eating. If I am not eating out, I will likely cook something similar to my meal prepped meals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Exercise**\n\nI exercise about 6 days a week. Happy to provide my training splits for those that are interested! Since 2021, I have shifted to doing calisthenics, and I have fell in love with this form of exercise. I no longer get injured, and I feel so satisfied after each training session. It is so fun seeing the exercise results from simply training with your own body weight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Future Plans**\n\nMy plan moving forward is to keep on my current protocol for a period of 2 months. From there, I will taper off the kill agent supplements. If I am still dealing with SIBO-C then, I will likely try antibiotics again after some rest from the herbal treatment. I will continue the fight and will not give up this time!\n\nAgain, huge thank you to this community! I will keep this post up to date with my progress, but I would also appreciate any feedback from you all!\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "So, I told a good friend of mine I found all these subreddits on Aim30, after she told me about her experience with using Aim30 for her cat, and so she asked me to post the following:\n\n\"TL; DR - mix AIM30 with ½ ounce of water 'til thoroughly liquidy, then use 10 ml feeding syringe to give to your kitty in 3 to 5 squirts until it's all gone, and do this once or twice a day.\n\nSolid foods break down the substance before it gets in the bloodstream. But liquids absorb much more instantaneously into the bloodstream from a cat's stomach lining.\n\nHere's my whole experience and how it unfolded for any of those interested in the excessive details: So my experience is I've been giving my cat the supplement for about a year, stage two right now, last checked at least. We had a bit of a rough week and I'm concerned that it may have indicated a worsening of condition and this is while taking the supplement. His appetite had dropped dramatically. He was eating somewhat consistently but less and less and little bits each time.\n\nBut here's the thing and here's what happened afterwards.\n\nI had heard from my friend that in one of the subreddit groups posting about aim 30 supplement that the problem in its concept for use is, when consuming food, a cat's natural stomach enzymes break down the substance such that it can't get into the bloodstream.\n\nThen I remembered something and did a little research.\n\nI thought I'd remembered learning somewhere that fluids process completely differently in a cat's system than solid food. That fluids tend to go right into the bloodstream more so than solid food. And sure enough, that's what the research I looked up reflected.\n\nSo the past week my cat's appetite was rapidly dropping and this was even with the aim supplement. He's been on Royal canin renal wet food for a while as well. I also give him a few liquid supplements that I mix mix into his food that are supposed to help cats with kidney disease such as liquid nettle extract, dandelion extract, a B complex liquid vitamin, about .26 grams of powdered calcium HMB, and a liquid kidney formula made by \"Pet Wellbeing.\"\n\nSo here's what I did... (and as always, check with your vet first for any thing you decide to add to your cat's nutritional profile):\n\nI took the aim 30 supplement and mixed it in with all the liquid supplements mentioned above plus the .26 grams of the HMB powder which is very extensively researched, safe, and specifically good for maintaining and building muscle mass in older pets (for this small measure amount, I actually use the little flat blue scoop that comes in Tomlyns immune lysine powder, and stick it perpendicularly into the HMB powder to only fill the 52 g sc scoop perpendicularly halfway amounting to a 0.26 g serving) and one servings worth dosage of Life Extension Cat Mix which he's also been on for a while.\n\nI mixed it all up so that liquid supplements rendered the whole mix with the aim 30 powder into a kind of a syrupy fluid, then added about half an ounce of distilled water to make it much thinner/more liquidy.\n\nBlocking the tip with my finger of a 10 ml pet food syringe that I had, and having removed the syringe plunger, I poured this now very liquidy substance of deep reddish maroon color into the top of the now open syringe. It came up to almost about 10 ml. I then replaced the syringe carefully in the top, got it in just enough so that it wouldn't leak out of the top, turned it upside down, and the air went to the top of the syringe as I slowly push the syringe a little bit further in to more securely seat it within the syringe vial.\n\nNow it was ready to be administered.\n\nTwo separate notes: 1, if you're going to try this with any or all of the supplements I mentioned, of course check with your vet that all of these supplements are okay, as my vet currently does and has known my cat takes all of these supplements. 2, It's worth mentioning that another daily thing I give my cat is Azodyl probiotic pills specifically for cats with kidney issues, which you can't break up, you have to give to them whole, so I use a pill syringe. And I've gotten quite adept at making him feel comfortable with accepting it. All this is to say that my cat is perhaps more comfortable than some with handling me putting things in his mouth and depositing medications there.\n\nSo this was a couple of days ago that I gave him his first syringe midday.\n\nSome of it spilled out of his mouth after I gave it to him, he may have spit it out a little, but for the most part he swallowed it. For that serving, I gave it to him in about three separate pushes of the syringe now filled with this cocktail, so as not to overwhelm his little drinking esophagus. I'd recommend 3 to 5 goes at it, a portion at a time.\n\nNothing much seemed different for about a day. But he seemed to be eating a little more.\n\nThe next morning I did the same thing and gave him the cocktail.\n\nSince he wasn't eating his renal cat food I needed to get calories in him, so I gave him some of his old wellness cat food which is decent quality at least. He ate that pretty voraciously and I was just glad that all of a sudden need was going to break his near fast with any kind of sustenance at all, Even if it wasn't his Royal canin renal prescription cat food made for his condition.\n\nBy evening I gave him another serving of the cocktail. And this time, since I have one other supplement that I only give him once a day, I decided to make its addition a regular part of only what will be his second of two doses of the day, and it's called: Vet classics S.O.D. & Boswellia (half a pill per day very easily crushed up into a fine powder in my fingers and mixed into the liquidy cocktail.)\n\nFor his food serving, this time I decided to mix in his old food with his prescription food, to see if I could capitalize on his noticeably elevated appetite to get some of his prescription food back in him.\n\nOver the evening he basically ate a bunch of it. So I decided to add more of his prescription food to his plate without anything else, which was now sitting on an ice pack so that it would stay fresher if left out long.\n\nNow, with this more prescription food heavy plate, he was picking at for the rest of the evening but a little more so than before when he was quickly slowing down from eating the prescription food. I went to bed. I woke up and it was completely gone.\n\nI gave him another morning serving of the cocktail.\n\nAbout an hour after that I decided to see if I could get him to eat his prescription food but without any of the old wellness mixed in.\n\nAnd I don't know if this is temporary, it's only been a couple of days, but holy crap, he suddenly started eating The pure Royal canin renal formula prescription cat food voraciously. I thought maybe it was a fluke of the morning. It was a whole can and he was eating more than half of it and I usually only serve him a half a can for each of his three meals a day. He kept coming back to chow down more, almost as if he didn't realize he would be hungry or later because he wasn't used to eating this way more recently, like he was surprising himself that yes he wanted to go back and still eat, again voraciously.\n\nI think he might possibly also like the taste of the food better without me mixing all those supplements including the aim 30 into those meals, which I was previously doing regularly, which at first he had no problem with but in these more recent days, as previously mentioned, he was starting to grind to a halt on it. I'm now wondering if also part of it is that he just likes the Royal canin renal wet cat food in its pure state. And since I am now giving him those supplements in a cocktail separately, he gets to eat the food as a pallet changer almost. He's also been notably hopping up on the couch with a visibly extra spring action.\n\nHe already weighs more today than he did yesterday. And yesterday more than the day before, for a total of about a third of a pound increase. In 3 days. At this rate if this keeps up, I'm realizing I may have to start curtailing his portion size so he doesn't actually become overweight and risk diabetes.\n\nAs for these three days, so far he's eating like I haven't seen him eat, not only compared to the last week, but the last several months. He's already started on what would normally be just his third and last serving of the day of half a can, But I put out a whole can just to let him eat however much he wanted, and he's definitely eating more than half, thus beyond his third and last serving of the day. I have it on a huge ice pack so I'm going to leave it out to see how far he goes throughout the evening and overnight.\n\nI don't know if it's coincidence, if he had a stomach bug or something that suddenly got better, but the timing is pretty uncanny, and the change is dramatic for what I've been used to seeing especially over the last week or so compared to these last couple of days.\n\nBut again, it's only been a couple of days, so I'm tempering my optimism. Though I'm not going to stop with this regimen and monitor how he progresses from here.\n\nI'm just going to keep giving him the aim 30 now constituted in liquid form with the cocktail mix of supplements, under the reasonably backed up research that says it should all go into his bloodstream much more than if he were to eat it with solid food which will break it down in his digestive system unlike what his body does to liquids.\n\nBtw, by the time I'm posting this, it's been 3 days and not only has his appetite improved from where it was for the last 2 weeks which was really dropping quickly, but, and this is not hyperbole, and your mileage may vary, but my cat has suddenly started eating the way he used to years ago. He's literally eating twice as much as the servings he wasn't finishing only last week. Which is also twice as much as he's eaten per day in over a year. It's kind of remarkable. I'm afraid to get too hopeful and get devastated, but I have to admit I have a really good feeling about this because I have not seen him eat like this in easily over a year, maybe two or three. And no vomiting. His water intake is no longer excessive for 2 minutes at a time of drinking these past few days, but still occurring at healthy intervals for maybe 30 seconds each. He's gained weight in 3 days, each day weighing a little more. He's dramatically more stable walking in 3 days and just looks like a normal cat moving around even though he's not the fastest one in the world.\n\nKeep in mind I have been giving him aim 30 about a couple years but only in solid food. I don't think I've ever seen him react this way since 3 days ago when I started giving it to him as a pure liquid on an empty stomach so that his stomach most thoroughly absorbs it. I suppose there'll always be a part of me It feels a twinge of fear over letting myself hope. But my God this is experience has made it really really hard for me to not feel encouraged because it's just been so mind-blowingly dramatic to see. Anyway, don't know if anyone else will have the same experience, but hope this helps anyone. And best to all of you and our little persons in our lives who we love so dearly.\n\n[Here's a collage image link of all the supplements I add into the aim 30 liquid cocktail, along with the picture of a similar syringe I use.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nCuXDhd1U3qSEcUYrsc9SQMsGUbikMlJ/view?usp=sharing) (If you want to use them as well, dosages of these extra supplements vary depended on your cat, / weight, etc so I'm using the recommended per serving dosages for each cocktail for my cat, and perhaps, after checking with your vet of course, you'll follow a similar guideline.)\"",

    "body": " \n\nHey everyone\n\nApologies for the long post but I needed to add detail so hopefully someone can assist please.\n\nI am 34 and have been struggling with libido issues for approximately 4 years. This never used to be an issue previously as I had a very very high sex drive, my penis literally throbbed and would get hard instantaneously just looking at a girl. Random erections throughout the day, woke up with rock hard morning wood most mornings.\n\nFor the past couple of years, it has completely disappeared, I no longer get random erections and have not had proper morning wood in years. Once in a blue moon I will get morning wood but it is only because I needed to use the bathroom. Even these erections were incredibly weak. I don't ever \"feel\" horny.\n\nCouple of years ago, I went to see my general practitioner and had blood tests done. My testosterone , according to him was on the higher side of normal >700 ng/l. But he didn't explain or consider the effects of the other hormones, estrogen, free testosterone, thyroid etc.\n\nI also had a diabetes test and it came back negative.\n\nHis only recommendation was that it was probably mental (been cheated on a few times) and recommended an anti-depressant, which I refuse to take.\n\nThings seemed to have gotten worse. When I had a girlfriend last year,I was always down for sex and would get hard enough but the erection quality wasn't great and actually looked much smaller and less thicker due to the weak erection quality, sometimes also lost erection during. Although I was always down for sex , the libido/horny \"feeling\" wasn't there. In fact I have not \"felt\" horny in years and I can't recall what it even feels like.\n\nHooked up with a few girls after her but its very unsatisfying as I am not horny and just doing it for the sake of it. The erections are very weak anyway.\n\nI did use to look at porn a lot but went completely nofap / noporn, not even Instagram models for like 6-8 months and it made zero difference.\n\nI have also emailed several urologists with my issues and they said they cannot assist. Thinking it might be hormone related, I also emailed an endocrinologist but they have massive waiting lists and are prohibitively expensive.\n\nI have done the following for years with very little/no change.\n\n\\- Quit cigarettes for over a year (recently started again);\n\n\\- Exercise frequently, usually daily with a combination of weights, cardio and calisthenics;\n\n\\- Totally quit caffeine for over 3 months (as it can affect hormones/cortisol/bloodflow);\n\n\\- Lost a lot of fat (used to be quite chubby, couple of years ago), where I could almost see my 6 pack, made zero difference. Gained fat back but am working on losing it again.\n\n\\- Stopped masturbating/porn. Even if I don't ejaculate for months, i do not get \"blue balls\" or even a sense of missing/wanting sex. I will have the occasional wet dream but its usually from a flaccid/weak erection state. I just don't ever feel horny.\n\n\\- Eat a predominantly clean diet, lots of fruit and vegetables, at least 2 litres of water a day. Lots of crucifurous vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower daily as this supposedly increases free testosterone but may affect thyroid.\n\n\\- I do use lots of artificial sweetener, in coke zero and in drinks and this is the next thing I will try and quit to see if it makes a difference as there are conflicting studies;\n\n\\- Do not drink much alcohol and do not take drugs;\n\n\\-Taken pine pollen ( had some effect on hormones as my face and hair got very oily which never happens), increased magnesium, beetroot powder, greens powder, zinc and tried maca (absolutely useless, did not do anything for me).\n\n\\- Tried nettle root extract, to stop any aromatization, made very little difference;\n\n\\- Increased consumption of nitrates such as beetroot, argula (rocket) and pomegranate for months (made no difference).\n\n\\- Tried citrulline malate and arginine for more than a month on several occasions, it did nothing.\n\nI understand that I may not have the libido I had when I was younger but I feel like I am 80 years old. When discussing with my friends they all say they still get morning erections and still feel horny/have a high sex drive. I just do not understand what is wrong with me. Even if I look at porn now I get easily bored and turn it off, I have no desire to cum.\n\nAlso my orgasms are incredibly weak and unsatisfying, which never used to be the case, I guess it also has to do with weak erection strength.\n\nI also have a very difficult time building muscle and strength (although I have been eating in a calorie deficit for months to lose fat so I don't expect to gain much muscle/strength);\n\nI have been on ro-accutane (accutane for Americans) twice in my teens/early 20's for crazy bad acne- heard this can affect hormones). It lead to weakened skin and lots of stretch marks.\n\nI am going to see another general practitioner who specializes in sexual health soon. What should I be testing for? free testosterone, thyroid, estrogen, prolactin, progestorone etc? Anyone/anything else who you recommend I should consider?\n\nThank you so much for reading, I just don't know what to do, any ideas what could be contributing or causing this.\n\nI so badly want to feel normal again.\n\nThank you for your time.",

    "body": "Diagnosed (breath test) methane dominant sibo for over 2 years with suspected hydrogen sulphide. Worst symptom is sore throat/hoarse voice along with bloating/gas. I've also had chronic neck pain for about 3 years which I believe developed due to poor mechanics and improper lifting (nothing actually stands out though and I've considered gut inflammation radiating). Also have forward head posture issues and wonder if it has disrupted my vagus nerve. GP is useless and laughed when I asked about testing. I'm getting bloodwork done with a naturopath to make sure my thyroids ok but can't afford much, I've missed tons of work and got myself in debt. Sucks because I had savings for school and everything... But I know I'm not alone with this shit. \n\nAnyways I've done a few herbs here and there but I was stuck in this anxiety cycle where everything had to be perfect before I started treatment. I ordered BiomeBalance (Dysbioside) and FC Cidal a few months ago and was going to do at least two proper cycles with perhaps some Allimax... I reached out to the sellers to make sure nothing was on back order etc. and eagerly waited.  The BiomeBalance came but FC Cidal was lost in the mail. So I snapped this past Monday, gathered as many ingredients from the FC Cidal as I could and now I'm probably overdoing it. I'll be honest, I think I'm fishing for reassurance with this post because I fully intend to keep going. But maybe someone can set me straight if I'm being a real dumbass. \n\nHere's my routine since Monday:\n\nMorning\n- 2 x BiomeBalance (Dysbioside)\n- Pau d'Arco organic tea (FC Cidal ingredient)\n- Thyme added to the tea (FC Cidal Ingredient) \n- Horsetail 4.7mg (FC Cidal ingredient)\n- Stinging Nettle extract 250mg (FC Cidal ingredient)\n- Pure Encapsulations Nutrient 950 without iron.\n\nAfternoon\n- 2 tablets A.D.P Oregano 30 mins before lunch.\n\nWith lunch or just after\n- 180mg Allimax (gas smells garlicy afterwards?... sorry)\n- Sodium Butyrate for possible leaky gut/candida. \n- Milk Thistle to support detox.\n- Apple Cider Vinegar tablets 500mg for low stomach acid. \n\nEvening (with supper)\n- Monolaurin 500mg for immune support.\n- PepzinGI (Zinc-Carnosine) for reflux issues. \n- Apple Cider Vinegar tablets\n-Turmeric for inflammation and to prevent C. Diff (still monitoring for that though). \n\n2 hours later before bed\n- Same routine as the morning without the multivitamin, attempting to mimic the Biotics Research Dysbioside/FC Cidal protocol. \n\nI have done pretty much this exact routine since Monday (3.5 days ago) while varying on the timing with a few. I thought I'd do this for a day or two just to get a good first attack when the bastards weren't expecting it. But I feel pretty much the same. My throat is noticeably more sore but bloating is the same if not slightly improved and heads a bit clearer. \n\nI know I'm probably hammering my body with too much but I've totally lost patience and need to get back to work. It's not that I can't work, but my job requires me to use my voice frequently and my throat feels torn apart by the end of each shift. My ENT thinks it looks a bit swollen but \"isn't sure what he can do.\" They took my tonsils out January 2021 to no avail. Inflammation markers on my bloodwork were 6.5 a few months ago and still crickets from my doctor. Also supposed to sing backup in a band this summer... That's probably out of the picture though. \n\nOther products I have on hand that I've lightly tested before with no significant reaction:\n- S. Boulardii\n- L. Plantarum 299v\n- Berberine \n- Molybdenum \n- Colloidal Silver\n- Pepto (bismuth, helped with weird sulphur smell at points).\n- Grapseed Extract \n- Great Plains Bentonite Clay Herbal Detox\n- Charcoal \n- Iberogast (caused some nausea almost felt like die-of?)\n\nNot tested\n- Black Walnut Wormwood complex \n\nDo you think I'm putting myself at a high risk of complications if I continue this for a week or two? Would you add, subtract, or switch anything given the products listed? I'm doing what might be considered lower doses of the Oregano and Allimax but I know they're both still very powerful. \n\nAlso if someone's reading this and getting the idea of throwing the kitchen cupboard at it... I've done a mind numbing amount of reading on these products and have accepted that I may be damaging myself. I would personally suggest finding a really good naturopath if you can afford it and getting the GI 360 three day stool test. I've spoken with Dr. Tali Troyansky out of Toronto ON. She visits the labs and takes a very scientific approach with apparently great results.\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",

I'd also put it in the oil phase and let it hydrate when you emulsify instead of hydrating it in the water phase first. I'm super lazy, yes, but I have way better results doing it this way.\n\nPolyquat 10 can vary a lot depending on the version and supplier. The 2 I've bought could not have been more different. I love the first one, but threw away the second because it was sticky and made me itch even in shampoo.\n\nPolyquat 10 is more effective as a conditioner when used in combination with anionic surfactants, as far as getting good deposition on hair, but it can be used in this type of product too.

Replace everything else with oil or water correspondingly, percent for percent.\n\nThat's already a lot of variables to work with, but the consistency is hardest to get right, so I'd spend the time to get that tuned to your preferences before you add the stuff that helps the hair but doesn't change the consistency too much. Why? It's a PITA to add so many ingredients while you're tweaking the base of the formula, and it's wasting the (generally) more expensive ingredients. This will let you do more iterations. I think you'll want to play with tweaking your BTMS-50 from 3.5-7%.

    "body": " \n\nHey everyone\n\nApologies for the long post but I needed to add detail so hopefully someone can assist please. Hopefully someone here has insight.\n\nI am 34 and have been struggling with libido issues for approximately 4 years. This never used to be an issue previously as I had a very very high sex drive, my penis literally throbbed and would get hard instantaneously just looking at a girl. Random erections throughout the day, woke up with rock hard morning wood most mornings.\n\nFor the past couple of years, it has completely disappeared, I no longer get random erections and have not had proper morning wood in years. Once in a blue moon I will get morning wood but it is only because I needed to use the bathroom. Even these erections were incredibly weak. I don't ever \"feel\" horny.\n\nCouple of years ago, I went to see my general practitioner and had blood tests done. My testosterone , according to him was on the higher side of normal >700 ng/l. But he didn't explain or consider the effects of the other hormones, estrogen, free testosterone, thyroid etc.\n\nI also had a diabetes test and it came back negative.\n\nHis only recommendation was that it was probably mental (been cheated on a few times) and recommended an anti-depressant, which I refuse to take.\n\nThings seemed to have gotten worse. When I had a girlfriend last year,I was always down for sex and would get hard enough but the erection quality wasn't great and actually looked much smaller and less thicker due to the weak erection quality, sometimes also lost erection during. Although I was always down for sex , the libido/horny \"feeling\" wasn't there. In fact I have not \"felt\" horny in years and I can't recall what it even feels like.\n\nHooked up with a few girls after her but its very unsatisfying as I am not horny and just doing it for the sake of it. The erections are very weak anyway.\n\nI did use to look at porn a lot but went completely nofap / noporn, not even Instagram models for like 6-8 months and it made zero difference.\n\nI have also emailed several urologists with my issues and they said they cannot assist. Thinking it might be hormone related, I also emailed an endocrinologist but they have massive waiting lists and are prohibitively expensive.\n\nI have done the following for years with very little/no change.\n\n\\- Quit cigarettes for over a year (recently started again);\n\n\\- Exercise frequently, usually daily with a combination of weights, cardio and calisthenics;\n\n\\- Totally quit caffeine for over 3 months (as it can affect hormones/cortisol/bloodflow);\n\n\\- Lost a lot of fat (used to be quite chubby, couple of years ago), where I could almost see my 6 pack, made zero difference. Gained fat back but am working on losing it again.\n\n\\- Stopped masturbating/porn. Even if I don't ejaculate for months, i do not get \"blue balls\" or even a sense of missing/wanting sex. I will have the occasional wet dream but its usually from a flaccid/weak erection state. I just don't ever feel horny.\n\n\\- Eat a predominantly clean diet, lots of fruit and vegetables, at least 2 litres of water a day. Lots of crucifurous vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower daily as this supposedly increases free testosterone but may affect thyroid.\n\n\\- I do use lots of artificial sweetener, in coke zero and in drinks and this is the next thing I will try and quit to see if it makes a difference as there are conflicting studies;\n\n\\- Do not drink much alcohol and do not take drugs;\n\n\\-Taken pine pollen ( had some effect on hormones as my face and hair got very oily which never happens), increased magnesium, beetroot powder, greens powder, zinc and tried maca (absolutely useless, did not do anything for me).\n\n\\- Tried nettle root extract, to stop any aromatization, made very little difference;\n\n\\- Increased consumption of nitrates such as beetroot, argula (rocket) and pomegranate for months (made no difference).\n\n\\- Tried citrulline malate and arginine for more than a month on several occasions, it did nothing.\n\nI understand that I may not have the libido I had when I was younger but I feel like I am 80 years old. When discussing with my friends they all say they still get morning erections and still feel horny/have a high sex drive. I just do not understand what is wrong with me. Even if I look at porn now I get easily bored and turn it off, I have no desire to cum.\n\nAlso my orgasms are incredibly weak and unsatisfying, which never used to be the case, I guess it also has to do with weak erection strength.\n\nI also have a very difficult time building muscle and strength (although I have been eating in a calorie deficit for months to lose fat so I don't expect to gain much muscle/strength);\n\nI have been on ro-accutane (accutane for Americans) twice in my teens/early 20's for crazy bad acne- heard this can affect hormones). It lead to weakened skin and lots of stretch marks.\n\nI am going to see another general practitioner who specializes in sexual health soon. What should I be testing for? free testosterone, thyroid, estrogen, prolactin, progestorone etc? Anyone/anything else who you recommend I should consider?\n\nThank you so much for reading, I just don't know what to do, any ideas what could be contributing or causing this.\n\nI so badly want to feel normal again.\n\nThank you for your time.",

I chopped my mane 2 years ago & I am in the painful process of growing it back out. I have **always** used 'curly girl approved' drugstore products for my entire routine - like Shea Moisture, John Frida, Not Your Mother's etc. They all worked perfectly but I have been trying to r/ZeroWaste, so I switched those for natural products. My actual routine has been the same **FOR YEARS**: I co-wash (using prayer hands technique), and scrunch-dry with an old t-shirt outside of the shower, scrunch-dry my gel into semi-dry hair.\n\nSo, I switched over to haircare bars from my local shop! I used this shampoo & conditioner.. the makeshift pair were amazingly for three months. I was hesitant to use them because they contained sodium ***coco*** sulfate.. I know that SLS is the devil of curly hair, but I thought I'd be safe with this natural sulfate.\n\nRecently, they have been leaving my hair feeling dry and feeling like straw... my hair has absolutely no life. I am afraid this change is because of the natural sulfate in the bars, despite the conditioner being 'specifically for curly hair'. I don't know what to do next... does anyone know any organic/natural hair products to use? Should I just go back to drugstore stuff?\n\n[Shampoo ingredients:](https://www.gabeandangel.com/product-page/the-hydrator-shampoo-conditioner-1) sodium coco sulfate, coconut oil, cocoa butter, matcha green tea, french green clay, shea oil, hemp seed oil, apricot seed oil, isosteareth, dimethicone copolyol, ichthammol, stinging nettle extract, and d-panthenol (essential oils of: peppermint, eucalyptus, rosemary, cerdar wood, and bergamot) \n\n[Conditioner bar:](https://www.gabeandangel.com/product-page/the-hydrator-shampoo-conditioner) behentrimonium methosulfate (from rapeseed oil), cetearyl (natural emulsifier and conditioner), cocoa butter, shea butter, olive oil, cetyl, coconut oil, glycerin, jojoba oil, wheat germ oil, sweet almond oil, d-panthenol, organic aloe vera, cyclomethicone, and vitamin E (essential oils of: coriander seed, juniper berry, sweet orange, palmarosa, geranium, cardamom, and patchouli)",

But I think you are proving the case in favor of the CG method.\n\nThere are many organic/natural products to use, but you still have to be a little careful. Giovanni is a trused natural haircare producer, and many of their products are CG friendly, but many aren't. Take a look at their website. They have many new lines to try.

How is the percentage of alcohol to be used in the extraction determined? For instance, I've watched videos of people making a garlic extract, saying you need min. 15% alcohol, while some others recommend min. 40% alcohol.\n2. What is the effect of the alcohol content? Is it just how long the tincture will likely last?\n3. I watched a video of a herbalist making an alcohol-based stinging nettle extract (I wish to try this next), and he used 75% alcohol. Now, I cannot find any 75% alcohol that is not isopropyl alcohol (i.e. for external use only). The herbalist mentioned that this is to counter the moisture content in the plant. Is it really necessary to use min. 75% alcohol for stinging nettles, and if so why?\n4. Finally, if you're using over 50% alcohol, are you supposed to later dilute the tincture (mix with juice or water)? And does the tincture lose its potency when diluted? \n\nThanks in advance for the help! Looking forward to learning more!",

        "body": "I never personally make tinctures with less than 40% alcohol, though I've bought ginger extract made with 25% alcohol and it kept for ages. I'd imagine the garlic thing might be because garlic itself is antimicrobial so may help minimise spoilage.\n\nDepending on your location, finding consumable alcohol with more than about 60% might be hard (I have some overproof rum for when it's needed). Americans tend to find it easier - there are things like Everclear (I think that's the name) which is very strong.\n\nGenerally, stronger alcohol is for resinous/woody parts of herbs, if they have them. I'm not sure why nettle would need this, but someone may come along and correct me.\n\nA tincture is an extract, so the amount you take is the amount you take. A millilitre of tincture will remain a millilitre regardless of what it's in, and so will deliver the equivalent of the herb amount extracted into it, by proportion (1 ml of 1:5, for example, will deliver the equivalent of 200mg of the herb, if extracted right). Some folks swear by taking tinctures neat, but I don't think there are problems with potency from diluting it. Obviously, you dilute it in a glass or something when you take it, and don't dilute what's in the bottle.\n\nAs a note: if you're using stronger alcohol than needed and planning to dilute it, distilled water will help it keep for longer. At the very least, fully sterilise your containers and use boiled (then cooled) water.",

I always thought that was the minimum for preservation.  \nFor higher alcohol tinctures (which there aren't many) I use everclear, grain alcohol which is 70-95% depending on what you buy.  I know you can't get that everywhere though.  \nFor years I didn't have access to it and so I used 100 proof vodka for everything and it was fine.  My tinctures turned out great and they worked as well as any.  \nI just looked at two big manufacturers and their stinging nettle tincture is 48-53% alcohol and another is 40-50%.",

This never used to be an issue previously as I had a very very high sex drive, my penis literally throbbed and would get hard instantaneously just looking at a girl. Random erections throughout the day, woke up with rock hard morning wood most mornings.\n\nFor the past couple of years, it has completely disappeared, I no longer get random erections and have not had proper morning wood in years. Once in a blue moon I will get morning wood but it is only because I needed to use the bathroom. Even these erections were incredibly weak. I don't ever \"feel\" horny.\n\nCouple of years ago, I went to see my general practitioner and had blood tests done. My testosterone , according to him was on the higher side of normal >700 ng/l. But he didn't explain or consider the effects of the other hormones, estrogen, free testosterone, thyroid etc.\n\nI also had a diabetes test and it came back negative.\n\nHis only recommendation was that it was probably mental (been cheated on a few times) and recommended an anti-depressant, which I refuse to take.\n\nThings seemed to have gotten worse. When I had a girlfriend last year,I was always down for sex and would get hard enough but the erection quality wasn't great and actually looked much smaller and less thicker due to the weak erection quality, sometimes also lost erection during. Although I was always down for sex , the libido/horny \"feeling\" wasn't there. In fact I have not \"felt\" horny in years and I can't recall what it even feels like.\n\nHooked up with a few girls after her but its very unsatisfying as I am not horny and just doing it for the sake of it. The erections are very weak anyway.\n\nI did use to look at porn a lot but went completely nofap / noporn, not even Instagram models for like 6-8 months and it made zero difference.\n\nI have also emailed several urologists with my issues and they said they cannot assist. Thinking it might be hormone related, I also emailed an endocrinologist but they have massive waiting lists and are prohibitively expensive.\n\nI have done the following for years with very little/no change.\n\n\\- Quit cigarettes for over a year (recently started again);\n\n\\- Exercise frequently, usually daily with a combination of weights, cardio and calisthenics;\n\n\\- Totally quit caffeine for over 3 months (as it can affect hormones/cortisol/bloodflow);\n\n\\- Lost a lot of fat (used to be quite chubby, couple of years ago), where I could almost see my 6 pack, made zero difference. Gained fat back but am working on losing it again.\n\n\\- Stopped masturbating/porn. Even if I don't ejaculate for months, i do not get \"blue balls\" or even a sense of missing/wanting sex. I will have the occasional wet dream but its usually from a flaccid/weak erection state. I just don't ever feel horny.\n\n\\- Eat a predominantly clean diet, lots of fruit and vegetables, at least 2 litres of water a day. Lots of crucifurous vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower daily as this supposedly increases free testosterone but may affect thyroid.\n\n\\- I do use lots of artificial sweetener, in coke zero and in drinks and this is the next thing I will try and quit to see if it makes a difference as there are conflicting studies;\n\n\\- Do not drink much alcohol and do not take drugs;\n\n\\-Taken pine pollen ( had some effect on hormones as my face and hair got very oily which never happens), increased magnesium, beetroot powder, greens powder, zinc and tried maca (absolutely useless, did not do anything for me).\n\n\\- Tried nettle root extract, to stop any aromatization, made very little difference;\n\n\\- Increased consumption of nitrates such as beetroot, argula (rocket) and pomegranate for months (made no difference).\n\n\\- Tried citrulline malate and arginine for more than a month on several occasions, it did nothing.\n\nI understand that I may not have the libido I had when I was younger but I feel like I am 80 years old. When discussing with my friends they all say they still get morning erections and still feel horny/have a high sex drive. I just do not understand what is wrong with me. Even if I look at porn now I get easily bored and turn it off, I have no desire to cum.\n\nAlso my orgasms are incredibly weak and unsatisfying, which never used to be the case, I guess it also has to do with weak erection strength.\n\nI also have a very difficult time building muscle and strength (although I have been eating in a calorie deficit for months to lose fat so I don't expect to gain much muscle/strength);\n\nI have been on ro-accutane (accutane for Americans) twice in my teens/early 20's for crazy bad acne- heard this can affect hormones). It lead to weakened skin and lots of stretch marks.\n\nI am going to see another general practitioner who specializes in sexual health soon. What should I be testing for? free testosterone, thyroid, estrogen, prolactin, progestorone etc? Anyone/anything else who you recommend I should consider?\n\nThank you so much for reading, I just don't know what to do, any ideas what could be contributing or causing this.\n\nI so badly want to feel normal again.\n\nThank you for your time.",

        "body": "NAD. I’m sorry you’re going through this! A GP that specializes in sexual health should know what tests to run. There’s a fairly standard workup of male sex hormones—the ones you listed included.\n\nTake a copy of your previous lab work to your appointment. You may need to request it in writing. Also try to create a timeline of the first time you noticed symptoms and what they were...up to the present time. Finally, it would be best to discontinue any OTC supplements prior to your appointment as they could impact the validity of lab testing.\n\nMy other suggestion for a practitioner is a reproductive endocrinologist. (They do see patients who are not trying to conceive.) The wait times for these doctors can be over six months in some areas, so as a backup plan you might want to make an appointment there, too.\n\nThere isn’t strong evidence that roaccutane causes any permanent, lasting hormonal impact to either men or women. It’s highly unlikely that whatever is happening here is the result of your lifestyle or a medication you took. And most hormonal issues are treatable. They can be tricky to diagnose, but after that things get better.",

Poor digestion have plagued me for a long time now. \n\nI done a genetic test and had a DAO deficiency gene and also HNMT gene defects. I done a blood DAO test which also came back low.\n\nI've tried every histamine that's offered here in the UK. I try and remain on them for a period of time to let my body adjust also. Cetirizine. Loratidine. Fexofenadine. Levocetirizine. Desloratadine. Acrivastine etc. All have the exact same outcome. They work in terms of helping my issues but the side effects actually are worse than the histamine issues. I tried doing half doses. Sublingual. Different brands etc all the same outcome. Feel great the first few days and then the headaches start.\n\nI then looked into natural histamine/Mast cell stabilisers. \n\nI picked up some Stinging nettle extract. I used the recommended dose 3x a day. This started to make me feel very ill after a few days. \n\nI also tried berberine/dihydroberberine which also had studies of calming histamine problems. It crashed my blood sugar so bad. Hypoglycemia all day long. \n\nI also tried both porcine based and legume based DAO. I have naturally low blood pressure and DAO seems to lower it too far. If I took dessicated kidney. Daofood. Naturdao. The following day I would almost pass out everytime I would stand up. Not sure why it's doing this tbh. \n\nI also have a slow comt gene and quercitin/luteolin etc all react really bad for me. I did try quercitin and the anxiety was insane. Took me a good few days to recover from this aswell. \n\nI then seen palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) seemed to have a very good review for histamine and mast cell issues. I've tried it now 3x. I've now had 3 full blown migraines. Bed ridden migraines also. \n\nDo I just accept that I will suffer histamine issues all my life? \n\nDid anyone else struggle to find balance? Doing a low histamine diet for life just sounds miserable. Going out for a meal is just stress. \n\nAnyone else not able to find a treatment that works? ",

It is made with organic components including saw palmetto, Pumpkin seed powder, garlic, Pygeum bark extract, and as well as vitamins and minerals, to promote healthy prostate function and enhance urinary function.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe likelihood of acquiring prostate health problems rises with age.

Replaced Emulsifying Wax NF with Cetearyl Alcohol - I found that it makes the formula thicker, and less conditioning. \n\n2. Removed PolyQuat 10, cause BTMS 50 provides conditioning factor which is more than enough. I'm wondering if I should go lesser with BTMS 50.\n\n3. Reduce the percentage of Flaxseed oil since this oil can go rancid easily and it only has a shelf life of 1 year?   \n\n\nOverall I think I'm satisfied with this formula.

The goal of these additional rules is to equip Game Masters with a more robust crafting rule set and to provide a richer gaming experience for players who are interested in crafting more of their own potions and poisons.\n\nThis supplement includes rules for players to increase their tool proficiencies to a level of **Master** and provides a recommendation for gaining tool proficiencies in a more attainable timeframe. It also provides new potions, poisons, crafting recipes, and sample reagent tables to assist Game Masters.\n\nIn the off chance that any crafting endeavors go awry, there is also a battle map for an alchemist’s lab at the end of this rules supplement.\n\nI hope you and your players find that these additional rules enhance your gaming experiences.\n\n## Mastering Your Craft\n\nAnyone who acquires and uses a crafting toolset for the first time dons the title of **Apprentice** in that craft. They gain the ability to craft at least one basic, well-known recipe found on the appropriate *Crafting Table* below.\n\nA character may wish to hone their crafting ability over time to become proficient and subsequently a master of their craft. If one of these characters is part of your game, then you should share the below requirements with them.\n\n## Gaining Proficiency\n\nTo become **Proficient** with a toolset, a character must both:\n\n· Study textbooks and scrolls on the toolset, or with someone else who is Proficient, for **20 hours**.\n\n· Successfully **create 5 items** that require the Apprentice level on the appropriate *Crafting Table*.\n\n## Becoming a Master\n\nTo reach the level of **Master** with a toolset, a character must both:\n\n· Study Master-Level textbooks and scrolls on the toolset, or with someone else who is a Master, for **60 hours.**\n\n· Successfully **create 8 items** that require the Proficient level on the appropriate *Crafting Table*.\n\n## Note to the Game Master:\n\nA Master-Level textbook or scroll is whatever ***you*** decide it to be. If you are concerned that a player may progress to a level of Master too quickly, this is one area you can control to ease their progression.\n\n## Milestone Progression\n\nAs an alternative form of progression, you can utilize the Milestone concept for leveling up.\n\nAfter you feel that an appropriate level of effort has been expended using or learning about a toolset, you can grant the character with either Proficiency or Master of their craft.\n\n## Crafting Mechanics\n\nThe sections below detail the various mechanics that are required to either craft an item or create a recipe. Each of these components is listed in the *Alchemy Crafting Table* and the *Poison Crafting Table* below.\n\n## Time Required\n\nCrafting items and making new recipes takes time. Recommended lengths of time are provided in the form of hours in the *Crafting Tables* below.\n\nTo provide characters with easier access to crafting, it is recommended that you allow characters to break up the required crafting time as they need, as opposed to completing the task in one sitting.\n\nFor particularly difficult recipes and crafting activities, or simply whenever you see fit, you may require that the task be completed in one sitting, or the character must start over.\n\n## Crafting Value\n\nCrafting items and making new recipes also requires an expenditure of **Crafting Reagents**. The value of Crafting Reagents needed is typically notated in gold pieces as a **Crafting Value**. Unless otherwise stated, the reagents are consumed when a **Crafting Check** is successfully completed.\n\nWhile crafting values are listed in gold pieces, characters will have a difficult time finding non-player characters willing to purchase reagents and crafted items for the listed amount.\n\n## Crafting Checks\n\nTo craft an item, or make a new recipe, a successful **Crafting Check** must be made while using the appropriate toolset. All Crafting Checks should be called for once the total Time Required has been expended.\n\nWhen completing a Crafting Check made with either Alchemist’s Supplies or a Poisoner’s Kit, the player may choose whether they wish to add their Wisdom or Intelligence modifier to their roll. A Proficiency Bonus may be applied if the character is proficient with the toolset being used.\n\nParticularly difficult recipes or tasks may require two or three successful Crafting Checks. All Crafting Checks must be successfully passed for the task to be considered a success.\n\n## Failing a Crafting Check:\n\nFailing a Crafting Check results in the loss of time and it may result in the loss of reagents if the failure was bad enough.\n\nIf a recipe or task requires multiple Crafting Checks and one of the checks is failed, the entire task is failed and you can disregard any subsequent Crafting Checks.\n\n## Varying Degrees of Success:\n\nAs the Game Master, you should use your own discretion when handling successful and failed Crafting Checks.\n\nThe below is a set of recommendations for handling Crafting Check successes and failures:\n\n· 15 above the DC: One third of the reagents were not consumed\n\n· 10 above the DC: One quarter of the reagents were not consumed\n\n· 2 below the DC: No reagents lost. The next time the same task is attempted, it takes half of the required time.\n\n· 5 below the DC: No reagents lost.\n\n· 10 below the DC: Half of the reagents are lost.\n\n· 15 below the DC: All of the reagents are lost.\n\n## Creating a Recipe\n\nAny player invested in crafting their own gear, consumables, or weapons will eventually ask to create something of their own design. Accounting for every possible request is impossible, but the below framework, and the use of your own judgement, should help guide you in making almost any crafting request a possibility.\n\nTo craft a new potion or poison, a player must create a **Recipe** for that item. Creating a recipe takes time, reagents for testing, and one or more successful Crafting Checks.\n\nOnce a player successfully creates a recipe, they will produce one of that potion or poison and always know how to create that item again.\n\n## Determining Difficulty\n\nMost potions and poisons that players ask to create will be comparable to the effects of existing spells. To determine the necessary requirements and difficulty of creating a recipe, leverage the *Recipe Creation Table* below which offers requirements based on Spell Level Equivalency.\n\nPotions and Poisons that are comparable to cantrips and spells of 1st to 3rd level should require the player to be proficient with the equivalent toolset.\n\nPotions and Poisons that are comparable to spells of 4th or higher level should require the player to be a Master of their craft.\n\nCreating a recipe requires more time and reagents than regular crafting due to testing and failing new ideas. If a recipe is already created and the player wishes to craft that same potion or poison again, the time and reagents required are **half** of what is listed on the *Recipe Creation Table.*\n\n## Recipe Creation Table\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Level|Spell Level Equivalency|Crafting DC|Checks|Hours|Crafting Value|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Proficient| | | | | |\n| |Cantrip|12|1|12|100 gp|\n| |1st Level|14|1|12|200 gp|\n| |2nd Level|16|1|16|300 gp|\n| |3rd Level|14|2|16|400 gp|\n|Master| | | | | |\n| |4th Level|16|2|20|500 gp|\n| |5th Level|18|2|20|650 gp|\n| |6th Level|16|3|24|1300 gp|\n| |7th Level|18|3|36|2600 gp|\n| |8th Level|20|3|48|5200 gp|\n| |9th Level|22|4|84|10400 gp|\n\n# Alchemist’s Supplies\n\n## Apprentice\n\nAnyone who acquires and uses Alchemist’s Supplies gains the ability to craft a **Potion of Healing**. The Crafting Check DC, required hours, and total value of reagents that must be expended are listed below in the *Alchemy Recipes Table*.\n\n## Proficient\n\nBy becoming **Proficient** with Alchemist’s Supplies, you gain the ability to craft potions in the *Proficient* section of the *Alchemy Recipes Table*. You also gain the below features:\n\n## Proficiency\n\nYou may add your proficiency bonus to any ability check that uses Alchemist’s Supplies.\n\n## Quick Consumption\n\nYou learn how to alter the bottle of a potion to allow for quicker consumption. Changing a potion in this way allows it to be consumed using a bonus action.\n\nTo alter a potion for quick consumption, you must spend 1 hour with the potion using Alchemist’s Supplies to complete a Crafting Check. The DC is the same as the Crafting Check required to make the potion and you must expend 50 gold worth of crafting reagents.\n\nA failed check while using this feature results in the loss of the reagents and the potion remains unaffected.\n\n## Master Alchemist\n\nBy achieving the level of **Master Alchemist,** you gain the ability to craft potions in the *Master* section of the *Alchemy Recipes Table*. You also gain the below features:\n\n## Expertise\n\nYou may double your proficiency bonus for any ability check that uses Alchemist’s Supplies.\n\n## Increased Potency\n\nYou understand how to enhance a potion’s potency and can double the amount of its uses. This can only be done once to a potion.\n\nTo increase an existing potion’s potency, you must successfully pass the crafting checks necessary to craft the potion, but you only spend half of the time and expend half of the required crafting value to do so.\n\nA failed crafting check while using this feature does not result in lost reagents or potions.\n\n# Sample Potions\n\n## Potion of Aquatic Adaptation\n\nPotion, common\n\nWhen you drink this potion, your body adapts to an aquatic environment for one hour. You sprout gills and grow webbing between your fingers. You can breath underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.\n\n## Potion of Blinking\n\nPotion, rare\n\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the ability to teleport short distances for 1 minute.\n\nAs a bonus action you can teleport, along with any equipment that you are wearing or carrying, up to 40 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.\n\n## Potion of Elemental Transformation\n\nPotion, rare\n\nWhen you drink this potion, you transform into an elemental for one hour. The potion’s element determines which elemental you transform into (see the table below). Your game statistics are replaced by the appropriate elemental. You retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.\n\nYou can revert to your normal form early by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Potion Element|Elemental Statistics|\n|:-|:-|\n|Air|Air Elemental|\n|Earth|Earth Elemental|\n|Fire|Fire Elemental|\n|Water|Water Elemental|\n\n## Potion of Lightning Strikes\n\nPotion, very rare\n\nWhen you drink this potion, your unarmed strikes are empowered for 1 minute and conjure a lightning bolt that can arc to another enemy.\n\nOnce per round, when you successfully hit a target with an unarmed strike, you may choose to have a bolt of lightning leap to another target within 30 feet. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 16). The target takes 8d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n## Potion of Sleep\n\nPotion, uncommon\n\nWhen you drink this potion, roll 5d8.

Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.\n\n**Ingested**. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.\n\n**Inhaled**. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.\n\n**Injury**. Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.\n\n## Apprentice\n\nAnyone who acquires and uses a Poisoner’s Kit gains the ability to craft a **Potion of Poison**. The Crafting Check DC, required hours, and total value of reagents that must be expended are listed below in the *Poison Recipes Table*.\n\n## Proficient\n\nBy becoming **Proficient** with a Poisoner’s Kit, you gain the ability to craft poisons in the *Proficient* section of the *Poison Recipes Table*. You also gain the below features:\n\n## Proficiency\n\nYou may add your proficiency bonus to any ability check that uses a Poisoner’s Kit.\n\n## Alter Delivery\n\nYou learn how to alter the delivery method of a poison and adapt it to your weaponry. When you change a poison in this way you change the poison type to Injury.\n\nTo change a poison’s type to Injury, you must spend 1 hour with the poison using a Poisoner’s Kit to complete a Crafting Check. The DC is the same as the Crafting Check required to make the poison and you must expend 50 gold worth of crafting reagents.\n\nA failed check while using this feature results in the loss of the reagents and the poison remains unaffected.\n\n## Master Poisoner\n\nBy achieving the level of **Master Poisoner,** you gain the ability to craft poisons in the *Master* section of the *Poison Recipes Table*. You also gain the below features:\n\n## Expertise\n\nYou may double your proficiency bonus for any ability check that uses a Poisoner’s Kit.\n\n## Self-Tester\n\nYou have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.\n\n## Increased Potency\n\nYou understand how to enhance a poison’s potency and effectiveness. Poisons with increased potency can affect creatures who are immune to poisons.\n\nTo increase an existing poison’s potency, you must successfully pass the crafting checks necessary to craft the poison, but you only spend half of the time and expend half of the required crafting value to do so.\n\nA failed crafting check while using this feature does not result in lost reagents or poisons.\n\n# Sample Poisons\n\n## Dark Rain\n\nPoison (ingested), rare\n\nA creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 10 minutes. The poisoned creature loses blindsight, darkvision, and truesight for the duration of the poison.\n\n## Gorgon’s Breath\n\nPoison (inhaled), rare\n\nA creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.\n\n## Harrow\n\nPoison (injury), uncommon\n\nA creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) psychic damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage. After one successful save, the poison ends.\n\n## Magebane\n\nPoison (inhaled), rare\n\nA creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature can only cast one spell or cantrip per round of combat.\n\n## Tolling Bell\n\nPoison (injury), common\n\nA creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature cannot regain any hit points.\n\n## Weighted Anchor\n\nPoison (contact), very rare\n\nA creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. On a failed save, the poisoned creature begins choking. The poisoned creature repeats the saving throw every 6 seconds. A successful saving throw ends the poison.\n\nWhen a creature is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\n\n## Poison Recipes Table\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Level|Potion|Type|Crafting DC|Checks|Hours|Crafting Value|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Apprentice| | | | | | |\n| |Potion of Poison|Ingested|10|1|6|50 gp|\n|Proficient| | | | | | |\n| |Assassin’s Blood|Ingested|12|1|6|75 gp|\n| |Crawler Mucus|Contact|14|1|6|100 gp|\n| |Drow Poison|Injury|14|1|6|100 gp|\n| |Harrow|Injury|14|2|8|200 gp|\n| |Malice|Inhaled|16|1|8|125 gp|\n| |Oil of Taggit|Contact|14|2|8|200 gp|\n| |Pale Tincture|Ingested|16|1|8|125 gp|\n| |Serpent Venom|Injury|14|1|6|100 gp|\n| |Tolling Bell|Injury|12|1|6|50 gp|\n| |Truth Serum|Ingested|14|1|6|75 gp|\n|Master| | | | | | |\n| |Burnt Other Flames|Inhaled|16|2|10|250 gp|\n| |Dark Rain|Ingested|16|2|10|250 gp|\n| |Essence of Ether|Inhaled|14|2|8|150 gp|\n| |Gorgon’s Breath|Inhaled|16|2|10|250 gp|\n| |Magebane|Inhaled|16|2|10|250 gp|\n| |Midnight Tears|Ingested|16|3|12|750 gp|\n| |Purple Worm Poison|Injury|18|3|18|1000 gp|\n| |Torpor|Ingested|18|2|10|300 gp|\n| |Weighted Anchor|Contact|18|3|18|1300 gp|\n| |Wyvern Poison|Injury|16|3|12|600 gp|\n\n# Sample Reagent Tables\n\n## Reagent Table Overview\n\nThe tables below provide sample reagents that you can offer your players if they search for crafting materials.

    "body": "**Overview**\n\nI’ve had consistently elevated Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) for many years. It tends to to track with my Total Testosterone and results in consistently lower levels of free and bioavailable testosterone.\n\nThis appears to be a fairly common complaint especially amongst people on low carb/keto diets and with people who suffer from iron overload (genetic and unknown causes) or just a general complaint of aging.\n\nThe common recommendations are supplementing with Boron or Stinging Nettle extract to reduce SHBG or its binding affinity with Testosterone. There are many reports of this working and Boron in particular appears effective for many people. However, there are a number of people who find that the effects of Boron are short lived or there are negative effects on their Estrogen levels with long term use.\n\nThere are some personal reports from Paul Saladino MD and Elliot Overton who have successfully used therapeutic phlebotomy (blood donation) to reduce their SHBG. The theory is that high level of iron (iron overload) lead to iron being deposited into the liver and causing elevated SHBG (see Elliot’s youtube video for a deep dive). The personal reports from Paul and Elliot are a great starting point and I thought it might be helpful to do a structured study. My hope is that we might be able to find a range of effective strategies to help people with elevated SHBG levels that result in low free and bioavailable testosterone.\n\n**Aim**\n\nInvestigate the effect of therapeutic phlebotomy (donating blood) on serum Total Testosterone, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin, Albumin, and calculated bioavailable and free testosterone.\n\n**Hypothesis**\n\nH1: Therapeutic phlebotomy reduces elevated Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) independently of Total Testosterone, and Albumin resulting in increasing bioavailable and free testosterone.\n\n**Method**\n\n*Subject*\n\nI’m going to share lots of details to help people draw potential parallels with their situation but if there is anything else just drop a comment.\n\nMale 42, mixed European heritage, resistance training for 20+ years, training 5 days per week, eating in maintenance/mild caloric surplus (3200 kcal) 42% Carbs: 31% Protein: 27% Fats, Lean mass 86kg and 8.5% bf, normal ferratin (320 ug/L) for previous 6 months but has previously been above normal range (655 ug/L), normal Haematocrit over the previous 6 months (0.45 L/L) and all red blood and iron markers normal. Very low HS CRP <0.15 (always ridiculously low),  Current blood lipids are all low normal (Total 3.43 mmol/L, LDL 1.6 mmol/L, HDL 1.47 mmol/L, Triglycerides 0.8).\n\nCurrent supplements that might influence the study. I’m taking Tongkat Ali, Fenugreek, Ashwagandha but they were kept stable throughout the study.\n\n*Research Design*\n\nN = 1 design with baseline testing over several months starting on 1st August 2024 through to 21st of November 2024 followed by a single blood donation on 25th of November 2024 and follow-up post intervention testis on the 9th of December (2 weeks post intervention).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/672hk95yst6e1.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=67ba733dca4b45583c1f7fa467747eee9087400c\n\n*Intervention*\n\nTherapeutic Phlebotomy through blood donation of 500ml\n\n*Measures*\n\nSerum direct measurements of Total Testosterone, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), Albumin and calculated Bioavailable Testosterone, Free Testosterone, and Free Testosterone %\n\n**Results**\n\nThere is a consistent upward trend in SHBG and Total Testosterone across the baseline period. SHGB starts in the upper end of the normal range and by the end of the baseline period it is elevated above the normal range. Total Testosterone starts in the low end of the normal range (possibly due to my previous nutrition with protein > 3.3g/kg) and by the end of baseline it is in the upper end of normal range. Albumin is stable and in the upper end of the normal range across the baseline period. Bioavailable and Free Testosterone are both stable and in the lower end of the normal range (Free 4.5 – 2.5 ng/dL, Bioavailable 108 – 500 ng/dL). Free Testosterone % is in the low range and decreases through the baseline period. At the intervention point there is a clear upward trend in both SHBG and Total Testosterone established over several timepoints. SHBG is 62.9 nmol/L and Total Testosterone is 20.6 nmol/L. Following the intervention the upward tend in SHBG reverses and SHBG is 52.3 nmol/L 16% lower than the previous measurement. The upward trend in Total Testosterone is maintained at the previous trajectory and Total Testosterone is 24.4 nmol/L 18% higher than the previous measurement. Albumin remains relatively stable after the intervention. Free Testosterone and Bioavailable Testosterone both increase post intervention by 24% and 45% respectively. The downward trend in Free Testosterone % reverses following the intervention and is 1.58 a 17% increase from the previous measurement.\n\n*Phase 1: Baseline*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpny3he2tt6e1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8c326a6ae26a7e113b8cb5a8ae998a328c5b91b\n\n*Phase 1: Testing*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpl8b3i5tt6e1.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=d50d1f393070a35d0c46e1f527e94bf9cbb9fec6\n\n**Biomarkers over baseline measures and post intervention testing**\n\nTo help establish trends in biomarkers over time I've graphed the levels over the 3 months prior to the intervention on the 25th Nov marked with vertical pink line.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2rxm346cqt6e1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbfe67ff2d461f459a9649d36a87691481f6f336\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b0uk76cgqt6e1.png?width=996&format=png&auto=webp&s=99efa4b21f02b1fd941144f66fcb2aa524c8294f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qbdfvg2xqt6e1.png?width=965&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1a557096393feb2f471c3a87b4b2f00f90effb6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3jf7awryqt6e1.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c68745136095bdc583a4bc992931e74f26d6592\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/490xi8p0rt6e1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=4221ad2560ac265d84727fa93449543182755c90\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t5hgh882rt6e1.png?width=996&format=png&auto=webp&s=455bd971a64e0fda6485292c21bfa3ce90907351\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe reversal of the clear upward trend in SHBG suggests that donating blood can lead to reduction in elevated SHBG. In addition, Total Testosterone continuing on its upward trajectory shows that SHBG was reduced independently of Total Testosterone. Reducing SHBG without affecting Total Testosterone lead to increases in calculated Bioavailable and Free Testosterone. This offers clear support for our hypothesis. There are some limitations that reduce the strength of our evidence.\n\nThe largest limitation is that this is an N = 1 intervention with a single AB intervention which means our result could be due to chance or other changes that happen to coincide with the intervention or may not generalise to other individuals. Other limitations are the single follow up testing point which means that we’re unsure if the changes in our biomarkers are consistent over time or have rebounded following and initial change. Only leaving 2 weeks following the intervention to retest the biomarkers means that its possible that we didn’t see the full impact of the intervention. Lastly using calculated instead of direct measures of Bioavailable and Free Testosterone mean that we’re only estimating the true values (although the research suggests that calculated measurements strongly align with direct measurements).\n\n**Addressing Limitations in Future**\n\nA second post intervention testing is scheduled for Jan 6th 2025 will help to answer the question of whether the changes in SHBG are maintained over time and the longer term effects of the intervention.\n\nA second intervention following a washout period with retesting is scheduled for Jan 12th 2025 will help answer the question of whether effects of the intervention were due to random chance or changes in other variables that occurred with our intervention.\n\n**Safety Considerations**\n\nI donated blood through an official blood donation centre and would recommend anyone who would like to investigate the relationship between therapeutic phlebotomy and SHBG in themselves to only ever use official trained phlebotomists. In saying that, get out and donate blood if you're able to do so!",

    "body": " \n\n**Overview:** Stinging Nettle (Urtica dioica) is a herbaceous plant known for its tiny stinging hairs that cause a mild irritation when touched. Despite this, stinging nettle has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for its wide range of health benefits. It's particularly valued for its ability to support hormonal balance, alleviate symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and reduce inflammation.\n\n**Dosage:**\n\n* **Common Dosage in Supplements:** 300 mg to 500 mg per day.\n* **Form:** Available in capsules, tinctures, teas, and extracts.\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n\n1. **Supports Prostate Health:** Stinging nettle is commonly used to help manage symptoms of BPH, such as frequent urination, by reducing inflammation and supporting overall prostate health.\n2. **Balances Hormones:** This herb helps regulate hormone levels, particularly by interacting with sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which can influence testosterone availability in the body.\n3. **Reduces Inflammation:** Stinging nettle has potent anti-inflammatory properties, making it useful for conditions such as arthritis and other inflammatory disorders.\n4. **Promotes Urinary Health:** It is often used to alleviate urinary issues, including those related to BPH, and to support kidney health.\n5. **Allergy Relief:** Stinging nettle may help reduce symptoms of hay fever and other allergic reactions by acting as a natural antihistamine.\n\n**Mechanism of Action:** Stinging nettle's health benefits are attributed to its rich content of bioactive compounds, including lignans, phytosterols, flavonoids, and minerals:\n\n* **Hormonal Balance:** The lignans in stinging nettle can bind to SHBG, potentially increasing free testosterone levels in the body, which is beneficial for men’s health.\n* **Anti-inflammatory Effects:** The plant’s anti-inflammatory properties stem from its ability to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which helps reduce inflammation in the body.\n* **Prostate Support:** Stinging nettle root extract helps reduce symptoms of BPH by interacting with pathways involved in the growth of prostate cells and by supporting urinary flow.\n\n**Use in Supplements:** Stinging nettle is a common ingredient in supplements aimed at:\n\n* **Prostate Health:** Found in many men’s health formulas, especially those targeting prostate health and managing BPH symptoms.\n* **Hormonal Support:** Often included in formulations designed to balance hormones and improve male vitality.\n* **Anti-inflammatory:** Used in supplements for joint health and to reduce systemic inflammation.\n\n**Conclusion:** Stinging nettle is a versatile herb with a long history of use in traditional medicine, particularly for its ability to support prostate health, balance hormones, and reduce inflammation. Its wide range of benefits makes it a valuable addition to many health supplements. Whether you're looking to manage BPH symptoms, boost testosterone levels, or simply reduce inflammation, stinging nettle offers a natural and effective solution. As with any supplement, it's best to consult with a healthcare provider before starting to ensure it's appropriate for your individual health needs.",

Even in his late 50s, he’s the guy who wakes up at the crack of dawn to hit the trails, rain or shine.\n\nBut in the past year, he started noticing something frustrating—his **frequent bathroom trips** were interrupting his rides, forcing him to plan routes around rest stops.\n\nWorse yet, the **nagging pressure** and the feeling of **never fully emptying his bladder** had him constantly distracted.\n\nHe [gave Gorilla Flow a shot](https://theworldhealth.org/get-your-flow-back-official) after doing some research on **natural remedies for enlarged prostate**, and after a few weeks, he started noticing improvements.\n\nHis **nighttime urination decreased**, allowing him to get through the night without multiple wake-ups. On his long rides, he wasn’t pulling over nearly as often, which let him **stay focused on the road instead of his bladder**.\n\nThat said, he did mention one **small downside**—he didn’t notice an immediate **boost in overall energy** like some users claim. It helped his **urinary health**, no doubt, but he was hoping for a little extra kick in endurance.\n\nStill, for him, the ability to get through a ride without constantly thinking about restrooms was **more than worth it**.\n\n# Star Ratings\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Effectiveness** – Most users report **noticeable improvements** in **urinary function** after a few weeks.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Ingredient Quality** – Includes **top-tier anti-inflammatory herbs for prostate health**.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Value for Money** – Not the cheapest, but **packed with high-quality herbal extracts**.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Ease of Use** – A simple **daily supplement**, no hassle.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Customer Feedback** – Plenty of **positive testimonials** from users seeing **real benefits**.\n\n**Overall Rating: 4.8/5**\n\n# Pricing Options\n\n✔ **One bottle** (30-day supply) – Regular price - $79.  \n✔ **Three bottles** (90-day supply) – $59 per bottle ($177)  \n✔ **Six bottles** (180-day supply) – Best value - $49 per bottle ($294)\n\nBuying **multiple bottles** makes sense, since **natural prostate supplements** take time to show **full effects**.\n\n# Where to Buy Gorilla Flow\n\nThe [official website](https://theworldhealth.org/get-your-flow-back-official) is the **only reliable place** to buy **Gorilla Flow**. This protects buyers from **counterfeit supplements** and **ensures eligibility** for the **money-back guarantee**.\n\nShady resellers on **eBay, Amazon, or Etsy** sometimes sell **knockoff versions**. Stick to the **official source** for the **real deal**.\n\n# Final Thoughts & Call to Action\n\n**Gorilla Flow** takes a **different approach** by **balancing hormones** instead of just **shrinking the prostate**. Its **blend of Pygeum africanum extract, saw palmetto, and boron** makes it a **strong option** for **prostate support**.\n\nIf [you’ve tried Gorilla Flow](https://theworldhealth.org/get-your-flow-back-official), let us know in the comments! **Your experience** could **help someone else** decide.\n\n**It's good karma 🙏**\n\n**Thanks for reading!**  \n**– Mary G**\n\n🌿\n\n*The information provided in this article is for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

    "body": " \n\nHey everyone\n\nApologies for the long post but I needed to add detail so hopefully someone can assist please.\n\nI am 34 and have been struggling with libido issues for approximately 4 years. This never used to be an issue previously as I had a very very high sex drive, my penis literally throbbed and would get hard instantaneously just looking at a girl. Random erections throughout the day, woke up with rock hard morning wood most mornings.\n\nFor the past couple of years, it has completely disappeared, I no longer get random erections and have not had proper morning wood in years. Once in a blue moon I will get morning wood but it is only because I needed to use the bathroom. Even these erections were incredibly weak. I don't ever \"feel\" horny.\n\nCouple of years ago, I went to see my general practitioner and had blood tests done. My testosterone , according to him was on the higher side of normal >700 ng/l. But he didn't explain or consider the effects of the other hormones, estrogen, free testosterone, thyroid etc.\n\nI also had a diabetes test and it came back negative.\n\nHis only recommendation was that it was probably mental (been cheated on a few times) and recommended an anti-depressant, which I refuse to take.\n\nThings seemed to have gotten worse. When I had a girlfriend last year,I was always down for sex and would get hard enough but the erection quality wasn't great and actually looked much smaller and less thicker due to the weak erection quality, sometimes also lost erection during. Although I was always down for sex , the libido/horny \"feeling\" wasn't there. In fact I have not \"felt\" horny in years and I can't recall what it even feels like.\n\nHooked up with a few girls after her but its very unsatisfying as I am not horny and just doing it for the sake of it. The erections are very weak anyway.\n\nI did use to look at porn a lot but went completely nofap / noporn, not even Instagram models for like 6-8 months and it made zero difference.\n\nI have also emailed several urologists with my issues and they said they cannot assist. Thinking it might be hormone related, I also emailed an endocrinologist but they have massive waiting lists and are prohibitively expensive.\n\nI have done the following for years with very little/no change.\n\n\\- Quit cigarettes for over a year (recently started again);\n\n\\- Exercise frequently, usually daily with a combination of weights, cardio and calisthenics;\n\n\\- Totally quit caffeine for over 3 months (as it can affect hormones/cortisol/bloodflow);\n\n\\- Lost a lot of fat (used to be quite chubby, couple of years ago), where I could almost see my 6 pack, made zero difference. Gained fat back but am working on losing it again.\n\n\\- Stopped masturbating/porn. Even if I don't ejaculate for months, i do not get \"blue balls\" or even a sense of missing/wanting sex. I will have the occasional wet dream but its usually from a flaccid/weak erection state. I just don't ever feel horny.\n\n\\- Eat a predominantly clean diet, lots of fruit and vegetables, at least 2 litres of water a day. Lots of crucifurous vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower daily as this supposedly increases free testosterone but may affect thyroid.\n\n\\- I do use lots of artificial sweetener, in coke zero and in drinks and this is the next thing I will try and quit to see if it makes a difference as there are conflicting studies;\n\n\\- Do not drink much alcohol and do not take drugs;\n\n\\-Taken pine pollen ( had some effect on hormones as my face and hair got very oily which never happens), increased magnesium, beetroot powder, greens powder, zinc and tried maca (absolutely useless, did not do anything for me).\n\n\\- Tried nettle root extract, to stop any aromatization, made very little difference;\n\n\\- Increased consumption of nitrates such as beetroot, argula (rocket) and pomegranate for months (made no difference).\n\n\\- Tried citrulline malate and arginine for more than a month on several occasions, it did nothing.\n\nI understand that I may not have the libido I had when I was younger but I feel like I am 80 years old. When discussing with my friends they all say they still get morning erections and still feel horny/have a high sex drive. I just do not understand what is wrong with me. Even if I look at porn now I get easily bored and turn it off, I have no desire to cum.\n\nAlso my orgasms are incredibly weak and unsatisfying, which never used to be the case, I guess it also has to do with weak erection strength.\n\nI also have a very difficult time building muscle and strength (although I have been eating in a calorie deficit for months to lose fat so I don't expect to gain much muscle/strength);\n\nI have been on ro-accutane (accutane for Americans) twice in my teens/early 20's for crazy bad acne- heard this can affect hormones). It lead to weakened skin and lots of stretch marks.\n\nI am going to see another general practitioner who specializes in sexual health soon. What should I be testing for? free testosterone, thyroid, estrogen, prolactin, progestorone etc? Anyone/anything else who you recommend I should consider?\n\nThank you so much for reading, I just don't know what to do, any ideas what could be contributing or causing this.\n\nI so badly want to feel normal again.\n\nThank you for your time.",

I couldn't find significant results from grape seed extract as the research on molecules like proanthocyanidin oligomers focuses on women with breast cancer. So, leaving aside prescription drugs like exemestane or letrozole and the steroid androsterone, the only promising natural remedies turn out to be ashwagandha and brown seaweed.\n\n----\nAs in the title. I currently use topical fin with only little SEs and things are finally starting to work out regarding my hair loss but one negative effect I do still get (and I know this is controversial but to each their own) is rapidly accumulating belly and hip fat. It’s abnormal for my weight and level of activity. Like previous SEs I had with oral fin, it's probably due to high level of free testosterone aromatisation and it will be a while before I can see an endocrinologist. So I’m wondering if any of you has found success with over-the-counter aromatase (estrogen) inhibitors or even just a supplement. I’m taking nettle root extract at the moment but don't know if it's doing anything.\n\nHope I used the right flair",

It is believed to improve urinary symptoms related to BPH and enhance prostate function. Research supports the efficacy of Pygeum Africanum in improving urinary symptoms and overall prostate health.\n\n**6. Zinc**\n\nZinc is an essential mineral crucial for maintaining prostate health. It is involved in various enzymatic processes and supports immune function. Adequate levels of zinc are vital for prostate health and may help prevent issues related to prostate enlargement. The role of zinc in supporting prostate function is well-established in scientific literature.\n\n[Click Here To Visit Official Website](https://studentdairy.life/proshaaff)\n\n**Mechanism of Action**\n\n**Prostadine’s Formulation**\n\nProstadine’s formula is designed to address multiple aspects of prostate health.

    "body": "I've done a lot of research recently on improving overall health and well-being and I think the right supplements could really help me in achieving this. That's why I hope some of you guys here will help me with inputs and some discussion around the different elements of my supplement regime.\n\nI'm a male in my late 20's and I generally eat balanced with as little processed foods as possible and trying to keep a lower intake of carbs and sugar. I eat meat/fish in different forms daily with raw/cooked vegetables for both lunch and dinner. I don't eat a breakfast except a few pieces of fruit, but try to 'fast' from dinner to lunch.\n\nI've looked into the following supplements and doses divided into 'most wanted' and 'somewhat wanted' since I think adding all of them to my regime would be a lot both physically and financially. Financially because I have looked into only getting 'natural sourced' supplements so it's not completely lab-made, which is a little more expensive. I will keep my questions to the bottom of the post.\n\n**Most Wanted**\n\n* Organic Magnesium 100mg (LACTOBACILLUS BULGARICUS)\n* Vegetable Vitamin D3 2500IU (Extracted from moss)\n* Natural Vitamin C 200mg (Dried and pulverized Acerola cherries)\n* Iodine 194ug (from seaweed) & Nettle Extract 114ug\n\n**Somewhat Wanted**\n\n* Vegetable Vitamin B12 500ug (methylcobalamin)\n* Organic Calcium 500mg - also 37mg magnesium and 28ug Iodine (Dried and pulverized red algae)\n\nSo my questions to all this would be:\n\nWhat combination of these do you think would be most optimal taking into account trying to optimize both everything physically and financially?\n\nAnything you would recommend to add instead of something else?\n\nShould I be doing these daily or maybe every other day? Change the regime during different seasons of the year?\n\nWill this specific 'kind' of magnesium make me have the shits? I've read some places about a specific 'strain' of magnesium that acts like a lacxative and would like to avoid this.\n\nThank you for taking the time!",

I strongly recommend against using it in hair or body care at all.\n\nHave you considered other, gentler methods?\n\nNatural haircare has 2 main branches: mechanical cleaning and alternative washing. You can learn about mechanical cleaning here:\n\n[Natural Haircare Quick Start Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/wiki/index/quickstart)\n\nAnd there's a link in the sidebar/About tab to a list of common alternative washing methods on Hair Buddah. Rye/Pulse flours are one of the easiest and gentlest alternative washing methods. They can be a mild protein for some types of hair, so if you are using them, you should do frequent strand tests as detailed at the end of the quick start guide. Some people who experience protein buildup with one type of flour don't experience it with another, so it's worth trying different ones!\n\nThis bar you've shared is a true soap made from saponified oils and as you observed, contains no artificial ingredients. Since it's made from oils, it interacts poorly with hard water like oils do, turning into 'wax' that coats everything, also known as soap scum. True soap is an alkaline wash, so you should follow general alkaline guidelines when using it: no more often than every 4 days and always finished with a properly diluted acidic rinse of some sort to help lower the hair cuticle and reset pH.",

    "body": "The health of the prostate is a concern dear to men, particularly as they enter the aging process. ProstaVive emerges as a potent solution intended for the enhancement of prostate health and improvement of urine flow. The detailed observation of this article will look into why ProstaVive is one of the preferred supplements with a unique formula, benefits, and how it may support prostate health and enhance quality of life for men.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kmoajkbutwyd1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=d43a9c439053ecd50fd87190e821635ffe2ed96d\n\n[**Click Here Website ProstaVive**](https://linktr.ee/ProstaVive9)\n\n# Understanding the Importance of Prostate Health\n\nBut the prostate does play a significant role in the process, despite its small size. An enlarged prostate or prostatitis is fairly common conditions in older men. This may cause a range of uncomfortable symptoms related to urination that include frequent nighttime urination, weak flow, and/or the feeling that your bladder is not completely empty. The key here will be to catch these symptoms in their early stages to continue on a path of good urological and general health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What Is ProstaVive?\n\nProstaVive is a quality dietary supplement, specifically formulated to provide maximum care for the prostate. Its powerful formula brings together herbal extracts that target and alleviate symptoms of an enlarged prostate, among other problems related to poor prostate health. The composition of ProstaVive is supported by scientific research, ensuring each component plays its role with efficiency in the care of the prostate and associated urinary functions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Key Ingredients in ProstaVive for Optimal Prostate Health\n\nThe ProstaVive formula is chock-full of thoughtfully curated, clinically studied ingredients. Let's take a closer look at each component and its specific role in enhancing prostate health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. Saw Palmetto Extract**\n\nPerhaps one of the most studied ingredients for prostate support, saw palmetto has been identified to help reduce urinary symptoms associated with BPH. Various studies have proposed that saw palmetto inhibits the enzyme 5-alpha reductase, which tends to convert testosterone into DHT-a hormone linked with the growth of the prostate. Due to this reduction in DHT levels, saw palmetto decreases the chances of prostate growth and helps improve urinary problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Beta-Sitosterol**\n\nIt is a plant extract that has been shown to improve urine flow and reduce the amount of residual urine left in the bladder. It relieves the irritation of an enlarged prostate through its anti-inflammatory action. Beta-sitosterol keeps the level of cholesterol within the normal range, ensuring the health of the heart and the general health of the aging man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Zinc**\n\nZinc is a significant constituent of male health, and especially of prostate health. It occurs naturally in a high concentration within the prostrate gland and helps the body's immune function. In cases of severe zinc deficiency, the risks for development of prostate conditions are increased, so it should be included in any supplement meant for the prostate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Pygeum Africanum**\n\nPygeum is extracted from the bark of an African cherry tree. Anti-inflammatory properties of this ingredient contribute to reducing swelling in the prostate and also help reduce symptoms related to frequent urination, urgency, and flow. Other studies conducted emphasize its capability of reducing discomfort and enhancing overall urinary tract function.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. Nettle Root Extract**\n\nOther powerful ingredients for prostate health are Nettle roots, which are popularly prescribed to help deal with the symptoms of BPH. It works along with other components like saw palmetto and beta-sitosterol, which facilitate urinary issues and work out a better bladder control that reduces the frequency of nighttime urination.\n\n[**Click Here Website ProstaVive**](https://linktr.ee/ProstaVive9)\n\n# How ProstaVive Works to Support Prostate Health\n\nProstaVive acts through an action mechanism on the root causes of prostate enlargement and inflammation. The active ingredients in the formula work harmoniously to keep DHT levels low, maintain inflammation in check, and facilitate healthy blood flow to the prostate. Such a multi-modal approach alleviates symptoms such as:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Frequency: Lower swelling of the prostate with ProstaVive reduces the urgent need to urinate, especially at night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWeak Urine Flow: With ingredients such as beta-sitosterol and saw palmetto, ProstaVive improves urine flow and reduces strain.\n\nBladder Emptying: It helps in full emptying of the bladder and the prevention of residual urine in the bladder. \n\n# Benefits of ProstaVive for Prostate and Urinary Health\n\nThe administration of ProstaVive offers a plethora of benefits that help in the maintenance of quality life for men with prostate health issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.

Hormone Balance and DHT Control**\n\nHormones, especially DHT, play a significant role in the enlargement of the prostate. ProstaVive contains components that help balance the hormones and reduce the conversion rate of testosterone to DHT. Controlling DHT levels ensures, according to ProstaVive, that there will be a reduction in the risk of enlarged prostates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Immune Health is Supported**\n\nThe presence of other ingredients, such as zinc and pygeum, boosts the immune system to help the body transcend the infections and inflammation that may deteriorate the symptoms of prostate problems. A good immune system contributes to recovery and supports the health of one's prostate over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ProstaVive: All-Natural, Safe, and Effective\n\nWhat places ProstaVive in a special position is the fact that it naturally combines a composition evidenced to be effective in maintaining prostate health.

    "body": "The health of the prostate is a concern dear to men, particularly as they enter the aging process. ProstaVive emerges as a potent solution intended for the enhancement of prostate health and improvement of urine flow. The detailed observation of this article will look into why ProstaVive is one of the preferred supplements with a unique formula, benefits, and how it may support prostate health and enhance quality of life for men.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kmoajkbutwyd1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=d43a9c439053ecd50fd87190e821635ffe2ed96d\n\n[**Click Here Website ProstaVive**](https://linktr.ee/ProstaVive9)\n\n# Understanding the Importance of Prostate Health\n\nBut the prostate does play a significant role in the process, despite its small size. An enlarged prostate or prostatitis is fairly common conditions in older men. This may cause a range of uncomfortable symptoms related to urination that include frequent nighttime urination, weak flow, and/or the feeling that your bladder is not completely empty. The key here will be to catch these symptoms in their early stages to continue on a path of good urological and general health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What Is ProstaVive?\n\nProstaVive is a quality dietary supplement, specifically formulated to provide maximum care for the prostate. Its powerful formula brings together herbal extracts that target and alleviate symptoms of an enlarged prostate, among other problems related to poor prostate health. The composition of ProstaVive is supported by scientific research, ensuring each component plays its role with efficiency in the care of the prostate and associated urinary functions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Key Ingredients in ProstaVive for Optimal Prostate Health\n\nThe ProstaVive formula is chock-full of thoughtfully curated, clinically studied ingredients. Let's take a closer look at each component and its specific role in enhancing prostate health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. Saw Palmetto Extract**\n\nPerhaps one of the most studied ingredients for prostate support, saw palmetto has been identified to help reduce urinary symptoms associated with BPH. Various studies have proposed that saw palmetto inhibits the enzyme 5-alpha reductase, which tends to convert testosterone into DHT-a hormone linked with the growth of the prostate. Due to this reduction in DHT levels, saw palmetto decreases the chances of prostate growth and helps improve urinary problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Beta-Sitosterol**\n\nIt is a plant extract that has been shown to improve urine flow and reduce the amount of residual urine left in the bladder. It relieves the irritation of an enlarged prostate through its anti-inflammatory action. Beta-sitosterol keeps the level of cholesterol within the normal range, ensuring the health of the heart and the general health of the aging man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Zinc**\n\nZinc is a significant constituent of male health, and especially of prostate health. It occurs naturally in a high concentration within the prostrate gland and helps the body's immune function. In cases of severe zinc deficiency, the risks for development of prostate conditions are increased, so it should be included in any supplement meant for the prostate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Pygeum Africanum**\n\nPygeum is extracted from the bark of an African cherry tree. Anti-inflammatory properties of this ingredient contribute to reducing swelling in the prostate and also help reduce symptoms related to frequent urination, urgency, and flow. Other studies conducted emphasize its capability of reducing discomfort and enhancing overall urinary tract function.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. Nettle Root Extract**\n\nOther powerful ingredients for prostate health are Nettle roots, which are popularly prescribed to help deal with the symptoms of BPH. It works along with other components like saw palmetto and beta-sitosterol, which facilitate urinary issues and work out a better bladder control that reduces the frequency of nighttime urination.\n\n[**Click Here Website ProstaVive**](https://linktr.ee/ProstaVive9)\n\n# How ProstaVive Works to Support Prostate Health\n\nProstaVive acts through an action mechanism on the root causes of prostate enlargement and inflammation. The active ingredients in the formula work harmoniously to keep DHT levels low, maintain inflammation in check, and facilitate healthy blood flow to the prostate. Such a multi-modal approach alleviates symptoms such as:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Frequency: Lower swelling of the prostate with ProstaVive reduces the urgent need to urinate, especially at night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWeak Urine Flow: With ingredients such as beta-sitosterol and saw palmetto, ProstaVive improves urine flow and reduces strain.\n\nBladder Emptying: It helps in full emptying of the bladder and the prevention of residual urine in the bladder. \n\n# Benefits of ProstaVive for Prostate and Urinary Health\n\nThe administration of ProstaVive offers a plethora of benefits that help in the maintenance of quality life for men with prostate health issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. Stronger Urination**\n\nProstaVive addresses the common urinary issues that men face with an enlarged prostate and helps them regain control over their urination. With its flow-enhancing and frequency-reducing ingredients, ProstaVive soothes these discomforting symptoms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Improved Sleep Quality**\n\nThe nighttime urination intervals disrupt your sleep patterns and leave you fatigued. By minimizing nighttime urination, ProstaVive can ensure more adequate rest for you and therefore contribute to your overall health and daytime productivity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Hormone Balance and DHT Control**\n\nHormones, especially DHT, play a significant role in the enlargement of the prostate. ProstaVive contains components that help balance the hormones and reduce the conversion rate of testosterone to DHT. Controlling DHT levels ensures, according to ProstaVive, that there will be a reduction in the risk of enlarged prostates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Immune Health is Supported**\n\nThe presence of other ingredients, such as zinc and pygeum, boosts the immune system to help the body transcend the infections and inflammation that may deteriorate the symptoms of prostate problems. A good immune system contributes to recovery and supports the health of one's prostate over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ProstaVive: All-Natural, Safe, and Effective\n\nWhat places ProstaVive in a special position is the fact that it naturally combines a composition evidenced to be effective in maintaining prostate health. Unlike some pharmaceutical solutions, ProstaVive provides soft, mild, and non-invasive treatment for symptoms. It is formulated free from artificial additives, fillers, or hazardous chemicals, which makes it safe for long-term use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Scientifically Backed and Clinically Researched**\n\nEvery ingredient in ProstaVive has research studies confirming its benefits toward prostate health. Saw palmetto, beta-sitosterol, among other components undergoing clinical trials, demonstrates their efficiency in maintaining normal urinary functions and reducing the discomfort that may come from BPH. ProstaVive brings together the ingredients in the best dosages for effectiveness in results.

    "body": "First, consider why you might be losing your hair. Is it heredity   [**HAR VOKSE Review**](https://discountdevotee.com/har-vokse-review/) or does it seem to be stress related. Stress related hair loss usually goes away when you finally become less stressed. If you feel that this is the problem, consider looking into techniques that will help you relax, like massage, mediation or just sitting for a bit by yourself. When you feel your stress levels go down, it is possible that you will see new growth!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor cases where hair loss is fairly minimal, some people swear by vigorous scalp massage. Massaging your scalp for a few minutes every day can help you stimulate blood circulation, which will in turn help you achieve a healthier state of being. This can contribute to growing more hair if there are no other factors in place. This is usually most effective in cases of temporary hair loss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat sorts of herbal remedy are going to be available to you when you start looking into hair loss and the solutions that are out there. Some people find that saw palmetto, which lowers levels of DHT, can help with this. Because DHT can contribute to cases of androgenetic alopecia, you'll find that this supplement can be quite helpful. Do keep in mind that women who are on oral contraceptives should avoid saw palmetto.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNettle root extract, which has a great deal of vitamin C and vitamin A, can encourage the growth of hair, and when it starts to come back in, you'll find that the hair is often thicker as well. Rosemary and sage have a strong place in folklore when it comes to aiding the growth of hair. You can always add them to your cooking or you can boil them in water, strain it, and then use the water to rinse out your hair. Keep the water cold and you'll also find that the cuticle of your hair will tighten, giving your hair a sleeker look that is also more hardy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n[**https://discountdevotee.com/har-vokse-review/**](https://discountdevotee.com/har-vokse-review/)",

ProstaVive emerges as a potent solution intended for the enhancement of prostate health and improvement of urine flow. The detailed observation of this article will look into why ProstaVive is one of the preferred supplements with a unique formula, benefits, and how it may support prostate health and enhance quality of life for men.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kmoajkbutwyd1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=d43a9c439053ecd50fd87190e821635ffe2ed96d\n\n[**Click Here Website ProstaVive**](https://linktr.ee/ProstaVive9)\n\n# Understanding the Importance of Prostate Health\n\nBut the prostate does play a significant role in the process, despite its small size. An enlarged prostate or prostatitis is fairly common conditions in older men. This may cause a range of uncomfortable symptoms related to urination that include frequent nighttime urination, weak flow, and/or the feeling that your bladder is not completely empty. The key here will be to catch these symptoms in their early stages to continue on a path of good urological and general health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What Is ProstaVive?\n\nProstaVive is a quality dietary supplement, specifically formulated to provide maximum care for the prostate. Its powerful formula brings together herbal extracts that target and alleviate symptoms of an enlarged prostate, among other problems related to poor prostate health. The composition of ProstaVive is supported by scientific research, ensuring each component plays its role with efficiency in the care of the prostate and associated urinary functions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Key Ingredients in ProstaVive for Optimal Prostate Health\n\nThe ProstaVive formula is chock-full of thoughtfully curated, clinically studied ingredients. Let's take a closer look at each component and its specific role in enhancing prostate health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. Saw Palmetto Extract**\n\nPerhaps one of the most studied ingredients for prostate support, saw palmetto has been identified to help reduce urinary symptoms associated with BPH. Various studies have proposed that saw palmetto inhibits the enzyme 5-alpha reductase, which tends to convert testosterone into DHT-a hormone linked with the growth of the prostate. Due to this reduction in DHT levels, saw palmetto decreases the chances of prostate growth and helps improve urinary problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Beta-Sitosterol**\n\nIt is a plant extract that has been shown to improve urine flow and reduce the amount of residual urine left in the bladder. It relieves the irritation of an enlarged prostate through its anti-inflammatory action. Beta-sitosterol keeps the level of cholesterol within the normal range, ensuring the health of the heart and the general health of the aging man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Zinc**\n\nZinc is a significant constituent of male health, and especially of prostate health. It occurs naturally in a high concentration within the prostrate gland and helps the body's immune function. In cases of severe zinc deficiency, the risks for development of prostate conditions are increased, so it should be included in any supplement meant for the prostate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Pygeum Africanum**\n\nPygeum is extracted from the bark of an African cherry tree. Anti-inflammatory properties of this ingredient contribute to reducing swelling in the prostate and also help reduce symptoms related to frequent urination, urgency, and flow. Other studies conducted emphasize its capability of reducing discomfort and enhancing overall urinary tract function.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. Nettle Root Extract**\n\nOther powerful ingredients for prostate health are Nettle roots, which are popularly prescribed to help deal with the symptoms of BPH. It works along with other components like saw palmetto and beta-sitosterol, which facilitate urinary issues and work out a better bladder control that reduces the frequency of nighttime urination.\n\n[**Click Here Website ProstaVive**](https://linktr.ee/ProstaVive9)\n\n# How ProstaVive Works to Support Prostate Health\n\nProstaVive acts through an action mechanism on the root causes of prostate enlargement and inflammation. The active ingredients in the formula work harmoniously to keep DHT levels low, maintain inflammation in check, and facilitate healthy blood flow to the prostate. Such a multi-modal approach alleviates symptoms such as:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Frequency: Lower swelling of the prostate with ProstaVive reduces the urgent need to urinate, especially at night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWeak Urine Flow: With ingredients such as beta-sitosterol and saw palmetto, ProstaVive improves urine flow and reduces strain.\n\nBladder Emptying: It helps in full emptying of the bladder and the prevention of residual urine in the bladder. \n\n# Benefits of ProstaVive for Prostate and Urinary Health\n\nThe administration of ProstaVive offers a plethora of benefits that help in the maintenance of quality life for men with prostate health issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. Stronger Urination**\n\nProstaVive addresses the common urinary issues that men face with an enlarged prostate and helps them regain control over their urination. With its flow-enhancing and frequency-reducing ingredients, ProstaVive soothes these discomforting symptoms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Improved Sleep Quality**\n\nThe nighttime urination intervals disrupt your sleep patterns and leave you fatigued. By minimizing nighttime urination, ProstaVive can ensure more adequate rest for you and therefore contribute to your overall health and daytime productivity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Hormone Balance and DHT Control**\n\nHormones, especially DHT, play a significant role in the enlargement of the prostate. ProstaVive contains components that help balance the hormones and reduce the conversion rate of testosterone to DHT. Controlling DHT levels ensures, according to ProstaVive, that there will be a reduction in the risk of enlarged prostates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Immune Health is Supported**\n\nThe presence of other ingredients, such as zinc and pygeum, boosts the immune system to help the body transcend the infections and inflammation that may deteriorate the symptoms of prostate problems. A good immune system contributes to recovery and supports the health of one's prostate over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ProstaVive: All-Natural, Safe, and Effective\n\nWhat places ProstaVive in a special position is the fact that it naturally combines a composition evidenced to be effective in maintaining prostate health. Unlike some pharmaceutical solutions, ProstaVive provides soft, mild, and non-invasive treatment for symptoms. It is formulated free from artificial additives, fillers, or hazardous chemicals, which makes it safe for long-term use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Scientifically Backed and Clinically Researched**\n\nEvery ingredient in ProstaVive has research studies confirming its benefits toward prostate health. Saw palmetto, beta-sitosterol, among other components undergoing clinical trials, demonstrates their efficiency in maintaining normal urinary functions and reducing the discomfort that may come from BPH. ProstaVive brings together the ingredients in the best dosages for effectiveness in results.

ProstaVive emerges as a potent solution intended for the enhancement of prostate health and improvement of urine flow. The detailed observation of this article will look into why ProstaVive is one of the preferred supplements with a unique formula, benefits, and how it may support prostate health and enhance quality of life for men.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vnvuq1cuwyd1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f8c6f8e0137cf8c1d17cb43507dc1d1d276ef8b\n\n[**Click Here Website ProstaVive**](https://linktr.ee/ProstaVive9)\n\n# Understanding the Importance of Prostate Health\n\nBut the prostate does play a significant role in the process, despite its small size. An enlarged prostate or prostatitis is fairly common conditions in older men. This may cause a range of uncomfortable symptoms related to urination that include frequent nighttime urination, weak flow, and/or the feeling that your bladder is not completely empty. The key here will be to catch these symptoms in their early stages to continue on a path of good urological and general health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What Is ProstaVive?\n\nProstaVive is a quality dietary supplement, specifically formulated to provide maximum care for the prostate. Its powerful formula brings together herbal extracts that target and alleviate symptoms of an enlarged prostate, among other problems related to poor prostate health. The composition of ProstaVive is supported by scientific research, ensuring each component plays its role with efficiency in the care of the prostate and associated urinary functions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Key Ingredients in ProstaVive for Optimal Prostate Health\n\nThe ProstaVive formula is chock-full of thoughtfully curated, clinically studied ingredients. Let's take a closer look at each component and its specific role in enhancing prostate health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. Saw Palmetto Extract**\n\nPerhaps one of the most studied ingredients for prostate support, saw palmetto has been identified to help reduce urinary symptoms associated with BPH. Various studies have proposed that saw palmetto inhibits the enzyme 5-alpha reductase, which tends to convert testosterone into DHT-a hormone linked with the growth of the prostate. Due to this reduction in DHT levels, saw palmetto decreases the chances of prostate growth and helps improve urinary problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Beta-Sitosterol**\n\nIt is a plant extract that has been shown to improve urine flow and reduce the amount of residual urine left in the bladder. It relieves the irritation of an enlarged prostate through its anti-inflammatory action. Beta-sitosterol keeps the level of cholesterol within the normal range, ensuring the health of the heart and the general health of the aging man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Zinc**\n\nZinc is a significant constituent of male health, and especially of prostate health. It occurs naturally in a high concentration within the prostrate gland and helps the body's immune function. In cases of severe zinc deficiency, the risks for development of prostate conditions are increased, so it should be included in any supplement meant for the prostate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Pygeum Africanum**\n\nPygeum is extracted from the bark of an African cherry tree. Anti-inflammatory properties of this ingredient contribute to reducing swelling in the prostate and also help reduce symptoms related to frequent urination, urgency, and flow. Other studies conducted emphasize its capability of reducing discomfort and enhancing overall urinary tract function.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. Nettle Root Extract**\n\nOther powerful ingredients for prostate health are Nettle roots, which are popularly prescribed to help deal with the symptoms of BPH. It works along with other components like saw palmetto and beta-sitosterol, which facilitate urinary issues and work out a better bladder control that reduces the frequency of nighttime urination.\n\n[**Click Here Website ProstaVive**](https://linktr.ee/ProstaVive9)\n\n# How ProstaVive Works to Support Prostate Health\n\nProstaVive acts through an action mechanism on the root causes of prostate enlargement and inflammation. The active ingredients in the formula work harmoniously to keep DHT levels low, maintain inflammation in check, and facilitate healthy blood flow to the prostate. Such a multi-modal approach alleviates symptoms such as:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Frequency: Lower swelling of the prostate with ProstaVive reduces the urgent need to urinate, especially at night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWeak Urine Flow: With ingredients such as beta-sitosterol and saw palmetto, ProstaVive improves urine flow and reduces strain.\n\nBladder Emptying: It helps in full emptying of the bladder and the prevention of residual urine in the bladder. \n\n# Benefits of ProstaVive for Prostate and Urinary Health\n\nThe administration of ProstaVive offers a plethora of benefits that help in the maintenance of quality life for men with prostate health issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. Stronger Urination**\n\nProstaVive addresses the common urinary issues that men face with an enlarged prostate and helps them regain control over their urination. With its flow-enhancing and frequency-reducing ingredients, ProstaVive soothes these discomforting symptoms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Improved Sleep Quality**\n\nThe nighttime urination intervals disrupt your sleep patterns and leave you fatigued. By minimizing nighttime urination, ProstaVive can ensure more adequate rest for you and therefore contribute to your overall health and daytime productivity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Hormone Balance and DHT Control**\n\nHormones, especially DHT, play a significant role in the enlargement of the prostate. ProstaVive contains components that help balance the hormones and reduce the conversion rate of testosterone to DHT.

The prostate gland, which plays a vital role in the male reproductive system, can develop issues such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis, and even prostate cancer. These conditions can lead to uncomfortable symptoms, including frequent urination, difficulty urinating, and pain. With the growing awareness of these issues, many men are turning to dietary supplements to support prostate health. One such product gaining attention is **Prostadine**. This article provides an in-depth review of Prostadine, examining its ingredients, benefits, potential side effects, user experiences, and the scientific backing behind its claims.\n\n# Understanding Prostate Health\n\n# What is the Prostate?\n\nThe prostate is a small gland located below the bladder and in front of the rectum. It is responsible for producing seminal fluid, which nourishes and transports sperm during ejaculation. The prostate typically grows larger with age, leading to potential health issues.\n\n# Common Prostate Issues\n\n1. **Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)**: A non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate that can cause urinary difficulties.\n2. **Prostatitis**: Inflammation of the prostate, which can be acute or chronic, leading to pain and urinary symptoms.\n3. **Prostate Cancer**: One of the most common cancers among men, with various risk factors including age, family history, and lifestyle.\n\n[Click Here To Visit Official Website](https://theshoppers.life/Prostadine)\n\n# Symptoms of Prostate Issues\n\nMen experiencing prostate problems may notice symptoms such as:\n\n* Frequent urination, especially at night\n* Difficulty starting or stopping urination\n* Weak or interrupted urine flow\n* Painful urination\n* Pain in the lower back, hips, or pelvis\n\nGiven the potential severity of these conditions, many men seek preventive measures and treatments to maintain their prostate health.\n\n# What is Prostadine?\n\nProstadine is marketed as a dietary supplement designed to support prostate health and function. It is formulated with a blend of natural ingredients that aim to reduce urinary symptoms, support bladder function, and promote overall well-being in men. Prostadine claims to address the root causes of prostate issues rather than just alleviating symptoms.\n\n# Key Ingredients\n\nProstadine features several key ingredients known for their potential benefits to prostate health:\n\n1. **Saw Palmetto**: This herbal extract is widely used to alleviate symptoms of BPH. It may help reduce the size of the prostate and improve urinary function.\n2. **Nettle Root**: Often used in conjunction with saw palmetto, nettle root may help reduce inflammation and support urinary health.\n3. **Pygeum Africanum**: Extracted from the bark of the African plum tree, pygeum is believed to reduce urinary symptoms associated with BPH.\n4. **Beta-Sitosterol**: A plant sterol that may improve urinary flow and reduce the frequency of urination.\n5. **Zinc**: An essential mineral that plays a role in prostate health. Adequate zinc levels are necessary for maintaining normal prostate function.\n6. **Vitamin D**: Important for overall health, Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to prostate issues, including cancer.\n7. **Pumpkin Seed Oil**: Rich in nutrients, pumpkin seed oil may help improve urinary symptoms and support prostate health.\n8. **Green Tea Extract**: Contains antioxidants that may protect against cellular damage and inflammation.\n\n# The Science Behind the Ingredients\n\n# Saw Palmetto\n\nNumerous studies have investigated the effectiveness of saw palmetto in treating BPH symptoms. A review published in the *Journal of the American Medical Association* found that saw palmetto could improve urinary symptoms, although results can vary among individuals.\n\n# Nettle Root\n\nResearch has suggested that nettle root may help alleviate symptoms of BPH. A study published in *Urology* indicated that nettle extract, often combined with saw palmetto, can lead to improvements in urinary flow and overall prostate health.\n\n# Pygeum Africanum\n\nPygeum Africanum has been shown to improve urinary symptoms in men with BPH. A meta-analysis in *European Urology* highlighted its effectiveness in reducing nocturia (nighttime urination) and improving quality of life.\n\n# Beta-Sitosterol\n\nBeta-sitosterol has been studied for its potential benefits in treating BPH symptoms. A systematic review in *BMJ Open* reported that beta-sitosterol supplementation improved urinary symptoms and flow rates.\n\n# Zinc\n\nZinc is essential for maintaining prostate health. A study in *The Prostate* found that men with prostate issues often have lower zinc levels. Supplementing with zinc may support prostate function and health.\n\n# Vitamin D\n\nResearch has shown a correlation between Vitamin D levels and prostate health. A study published in *Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention* found that higher Vitamin D levels may be associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer.\n\n# Pumpkin Seed Oil\n\nPumpkin seed oil contains phytosterols that may help improve urinary symptoms associated with BPH.

Is it possible to maintain my current DHT levels by balancing  5-alpha-reductase with Zinc? I have heard that Zinc may also act as a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor. \n\nMy goal is to ultimately slow down aromatization, lower estrogen levels and increase free testosterone but take no effect on DHT. If anything, I want to increase DHT to increase libido.\n\nThanks",

ProstaVive emerges as a potent solution intended for the enhancement of prostate health and improvement of urine flow. The detailed observation of this article will look into why ProstaVive is one of the preferred supplements with a unique formula, benefits, and how it may support prostate health and enhance quality of life for men.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vnvuq1cuwyd1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f8c6f8e0137cf8c1d17cb43507dc1d1d276ef8b\n\n[**Click Here Website ProstaVive**](https://linktr.ee/ProstaVive9)\n\n# Understanding the Importance of Prostate Health\n\nBut the prostate does play a significant role in the process, despite its small size. An enlarged prostate or prostatitis is fairly common conditions in older men. This may cause a range of uncomfortable symptoms related to urination that include frequent nighttime urination, weak flow, and/or the feeling that your bladder is not completely empty. The key here will be to catch these symptoms in their early stages to continue on a path of good urological and general health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What Is ProstaVive?\n\nProstaVive is a quality dietary supplement, specifically formulated to provide maximum care for the prostate. Its powerful formula brings together herbal extracts that target and alleviate symptoms of an enlarged prostate, among other problems related to poor prostate health. The composition of ProstaVive is supported by scientific research, ensuring each component plays its role with efficiency in the care of the prostate and associated urinary functions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Key Ingredients in ProstaVive for Optimal Prostate Health\n\nThe ProstaVive formula is chock-full of thoughtfully curated, clinically studied ingredients. Let's take a closer look at each component and its specific role in enhancing prostate health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. Saw Palmetto Extract**\n\nPerhaps one of the most studied ingredients for prostate support, saw palmetto has been identified to help reduce urinary symptoms associated with BPH. Various studies have proposed that saw palmetto inhibits the enzyme 5-alpha reductase, which tends to convert testosterone into DHT-a hormone linked with the growth of the prostate. Due to this reduction in DHT levels, saw palmetto decreases the chances of prostate growth and helps improve urinary problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Beta-Sitosterol**\n\nIt is a plant extract that has been shown to improve urine flow and reduce the amount of residual urine left in the bladder. It relieves the irritation of an enlarged prostate through its anti-inflammatory action. Beta-sitosterol keeps the level of cholesterol within the normal range, ensuring the health of the heart and the general health of the aging man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Zinc**\n\nZinc is a significant constituent of male health, and especially of prostate health. It occurs naturally in a high concentration within the prostrate gland and helps the body's immune function. In cases of severe zinc deficiency, the risks for development of prostate conditions are increased, so it should be included in any supplement meant for the prostate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Pygeum Africanum**\n\nPygeum is extracted from the bark of an African cherry tree. Anti-inflammatory properties of this ingredient contribute to reducing swelling in the prostate and also help reduce symptoms related to frequent urination, urgency, and flow. Other studies conducted emphasize its capability of reducing discomfort and enhancing overall urinary tract function.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. Nettle Root Extract**\n\nOther powerful ingredients for prostate health are Nettle roots, which are popularly prescribed to help deal with the symptoms of BPH. It works along with other components like saw palmetto and beta-sitosterol, which facilitate urinary issues and work out a better bladder control that reduces the frequency of nighttime urination.\n\n[**Click Here Website ProstaVive**](https://linktr.ee/ProstaVive9)\n\n# How ProstaVive Works to Support Prostate Health\n\nProstaVive acts through an action mechanism on the root causes of prostate enlargement and inflammation. The active ingredients in the formula work harmoniously to keep DHT levels low, maintain inflammation in check, and facilitate healthy blood flow to the prostate.

Zinc**\n\nZinc is a significant constituent of male health, and especially of prostate health. It occurs naturally in a high concentration within the prostrate gland and helps the body's immune function. In cases of severe zinc deficiency, the risks for development of prostate conditions are increased, so it should be included in any supplement meant for the prostate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Pygeum Africanum**\n\nPygeum is extracted from the bark of an African cherry tree. Anti-inflammatory properties of this ingredient contribute to reducing swelling in the prostate and also help reduce symptoms related to frequent urination, urgency, and flow. Other studies conducted emphasize its capability of reducing discomfort and enhancing overall urinary tract function.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5.
