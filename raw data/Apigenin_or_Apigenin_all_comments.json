    "body": "Most episodes on this podcast go way more in-depth than the average person may want to learn. They also include some impractical protocols intent on neurotically “optimizing” one’s life. Here is a list of simplified protocols that the average person can implement in a flexible and practical way. If a topic is not mentioned (such as testosterone, brain chemistry, or strengthening your immune system) it’s because the answer is (wait for it): A healthy diet, getting good sleep, and regular exercise - there is no need to make it more complicated than that. With that being said, Huberman has provided a lot of great information in his lectures, which I have summarized here. I created this for my own personal use but decided to post it here for anyone who wants it.\n\n## Alcohol\n\n* Less alcohol, fewer health risks; more alcohol, greater health risks.\n* An average of 1-2 drinks per day in a week is associated with thinning of the neocortex, increased impulsivity, increased baseline cortisol, reduced mood, increased cancer risk, and lower testosterone.\n* Electrolytes before drinking can reduce the severity of a hangover.\n* Spiking adrenaline (e.g. through cold exposure) helps alleviate hangover.\n\n## Caffeine\n\n* To avoid discomfort, consume no more than 1-3mg of caffeine per kilogram of bodyweight.\n* Delay intake 90-120 minutes after waking if you find that caffeine causes you to crash in the afternoon.\n* Has a reinforcing effect on foods, drinks, and activities (i.e. consuming caffeine while consuming or doing something will increase your liking of it).\n* Tablets are an alternative to caffeinated drinks.\n* Benefits:\n   * Releases acetylcholine, increasing alertness, and dopamine, increasing mood and motivation.\n   * Improves reaction time and ability to recall information\n   * Inhibits sleepiness by blocking adenosine receptors\n   * Increases the dopaminergic effect of exercise and reinforces the desire for that exercise.\n\n## Cannabis\n\n* Three strains of cannabis:\n   * Sativa - Acts as a stimulant, increasing feelings of creativity, energy, and focus while reducing pain.\n   * Indica - Has a more “full body” effect. Promotes relaxation and helps relieve anxiety.\n   * Hybrid strains - blends of sativa and indica.\n* Potential adverse effects:\n   * Use of cannabis before age 25 will negatively impact brain development, depending on the amount of use:\n      * Thins gray matter, particularly in the frontal lobe, which has a long-term impact on executive function\n      * Increases the risk of developing depression or anxiety problems\n      * Increases the risk of psychosis for those who are genetically predisposed\n   * All of the health risks involved with smoking or vaping anything\n   * May increase baseline anxiety in chronic users\n   * Depression has been found to increase with chronic use over time, especially for those who were not depressed when they began use\n\n## Cold Exposure\n\n* Cold shower effective, ice bath even better.\n* Cold enough that you would like to get out, but can stay in safely.\n* Sessions can be around 1-5 minutes.\n* You can take a hot shower afterward and still derive the benefits of cold exposure (minus the increases to metabolism).\n* Your body will heat up afterward, which may make falling asleep more difficult.\n* Benefits:\n   * Spikes epinephrine and norepinephrine, while creating a steady and sustained increase in levels of dopamine. Epinephrine and norepinephrine increase focus and energy. Dopamine improves mood and motivation.\n   * Can be used as a form of resilience training.\n   * Increases metabolism & converts white fat cells into beige and brown fat cells over time through the shivering process.\n   * Improves recovery and reduces muscle soreness when done after exercise for those whose primary goal is recovery, not adaptation (e.g. if you have a competition coming up).\n\n## Diet\n\n* Aim for 25g fiber/day to promote health and longevity.\n* Aim for 500-600g of fruits and veggies/day.\n* Ensure you are getting the nutrients you need. To do so, eat a balanced diet containing:\n   * Plenty of whole foods\n   * Fruits and veggies\n   * Whole grains\n   * Healthy fats (nuts, seeds, fatty fish, etc.)\n   * Sufficient protein\n   * Dairy products\n* \"Whole foods\" are beneficial in the sense that they are high in nutrients and eating plenty of them will often help you decrease your caloric intake if that is your goal.\n* Drawbacks of refined sugar:\n   * High in calories but low in nutrients\n   * Chronic overconsumption is associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers\n   * Can lead to tooth decay/cavities\n   * Can create cravings for more sugar\n* People who completely abstain from eating something (e.g. sugar) are more likely to binge on it.\n\n## Fitness\n\n* Don’t worry about watching overly complex Andy Galpin lectures in order to construct your workouts. Use a weightlifting program from [Liftvault](https://liftvault.com/) or the r/fitness [wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/).\n* Aim to keep weight training sessions under 60 minutes, 75 minutes maximum. This prevents an excess of cortisol and ensures proper recovery.\n* 3-5 minutes of downregulation breathing post-workout helps enhance recovery by activating the parasympathetic nervous symptom and lowering stress hormones that are naturally higher during a workout. This can be simple as slow deliberate breathing, physiological sighs, or any breathing pattern that emphasizes exhales.\n* For muscle gain: Aim for 0.6g-1g protein /1lb bodyweight per day. \"Bulking\" is not required to increase muscle mass - if you are at a healthy body fat % that you are happy with, you can simply eat at maintenance with sufficient protein while training.\n* For weight loss: Eat in a calorie deficit - see the r/loseit wiki. Diet plays much larger role in weight loss than physical activity does, although research shows that for those who are able to both lose weight *and* keep it off, over 70% of them engage in regular exercise.\n* Incorporate endurance cardio and HIIT (high-intensity interval training) into your fitness regimen. You generally want to aim for 2-4 cardio sessions per week.\n* [Fitness Routine Suggestion from Huberman](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64416928859cbdd1716d79ce/650e450994ef9ab775e16acf_Neural_Network_Newsletter_Foundational_Fitness_Protocol.pdf) \\- not recommended for beginners, but gives you an idea of what you might include in your own program.\n* Heat impedes performance, so cool down your body if you get too hot. The most efficient way to do this is to cool your AVAs - your palms, the bottoms of your feet, and/or upper face. The evidence for “supercharging” performance with cooling is iffy.\n* Cold exposure or anti-inflammatory drugs within 4 hours after exercise may inhibit muscle gain.\n* Supplements to consider include creatine, caffeine, and rhodiola rosea (see section).\n\n## Flexibility\n\n* “Microstretching” is better than intense stretching - stretching should generally be done without much pain. Consistency and frequency is better than intensity.\n* Three types of stretching, each with different benefits:\n\n1. [Static Stretching](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64416928859cbdd1716d79ce/650e4561150f33388c0e1a5e_July2022_Neural_Network_Newsletter_Protocol_1.pdf) \\- General purpose routine to improve range of motion. Also helps improve recovery and reduce muscle soreness post-exercise.\n2. [PNF Stretching](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64416928859cbdd1716d79ce/650e4559a41e6e696b2a56a4_July_Neural_Network_Newsletter_Protocol_2.pdf) \\- Increase flexibility of targeted muscle groups to improve athletics. Often done with a partner.\n3. [Antagonistic Muscle Group Stretching](https://hubermanlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/July2022_Neural_Network_Newsletter_Protocol_3.pdf) \\- Reduce risk of injury pre-exercise/athletics. Good for activities like gymnastics, dance, and martial arts.\n\n* Potential benefits:\n   * Reduce natural decline in flexibility while aging\n   * Overall health, balance, and posture\n   * Reduce pain and inflammation\n   * Smoother gait and better athletic performance due to greater range of motion\n\n## Focus\n\n* Sustaining focus means being able to bring your attention back when it drifts. The average adult can sustain unbroken attention for no more than 3 minutes - do not expect your focus to be uniform while working.\n* Keeping your work sessions 90 minutes or less is “optimal” for focus.\n* Staring at one spot for 60 seconds will increase your level of focus; mental focus follows visual focus.\n* Your best cognitive work will be done within 8 hours after waking.\n* Keeping your screen at or above eye level helps promote alertness.\n* Try background sounds: white/pink/brown noise, binaural beats.\n\n## Goals\n\n* Visualize the big win to get the process started. Visualize the consequences of failure to stay motivated.\n* Goals should be moderately lofty - achievable but not easy.\n* 1-3 major goals per year is best.\n* Your end goal and the steps needed to achieve it should be concretely defined.\n* Assess your progress regularly, e.g. once a week, to stay motivated.\n\n## Gut Microbiome\n\n* Important for mental and physical health.\n* Incorporate fiber and low-sugar fermented foods into your diet.\n* Avoid eating too much processed food.\n* Get good sleep.\n\n## Heat Exposure\n\n* Use a sauna.\n* 5-20 minutes per session.\n* 1 session per week good, 2-3 ideal, up to 7 max.\n* Ensure you stay hydrated during sessions (around 6-18oz water for every 20 minutes).\n* Potential benefits:\n   * Improved cardiovascular health\n   * Reduced decline of growth hormone while aging\n   * Improved mood\n   * Maintains protein structures to promote well being\n\n## Learning Information\n\n* Learning bouts of 90 minutes or less tend to be best.\n* A spike in adrenaline post-learning (such as from cold exposure) may improve retention.\n* NSDR post-learning may also improve retention.\n* Use active recall and spaced repetition (look it up).\n* Get good sleep.\n\n## Learning Skills\n\n* Be alert and focused.\n* Do repetitions of the action you want to improve.\n* Expect and embrace errors (the 85% rule - failing around 15% of the time is the \"optimal\" difficulty for skill learning).\n* Randomly take a break every few minutes for around 10 seconds - for some reason this makes you learn faster.\n* Practice the skill on a consistent basis.\n* Limit learning sessions to 90 minutes or less.\n* NSDR post-session may improve learning.\n* Get good sleep.\n\n## Longevity\n\n* Exercise regularly, get good sleep, and eat a healthy diet (see sections).\n* Maintain muscle mass to ensure functional aging.\n* Minimize sources of chronic inflammation (including chronic stress) to reduce the risk of age-related diseases.\n* NAD+ and resveratrol supplements may increase longevity, but the research on this is still unclear.\n\n## Meditation (aka NSDR)\n\n* The physiological sigh is a tool for lowering stress by increasing the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system. Perform a full inhale through the nose, then a second inhale through the nose, followed by a complete exhale through the mouth as many times as needed.\n* Consider transcendental meditation once or twice a day.\n* Try other forms of meditation.\n* Potential benefits:\n   * Reduces stress and anxiety\n   * Improves focus, mood, and ability to regulate emotions (by increasing gray matter in related brain areas)\n   * Strengthens the prefrontal cortex, improving executive function\n\n## Motivation\n\n* Many people refer to dopamine as the \"pleasure\" molecule, but it can be more aptly described as the molecule of craving and motivation. Your level of motivation is governed by your current dopamine baseline. Whenever you have a large spike in dopamine, your baseline will drop until it replenishes itself.\n* Experiment with random intermittent reinforcement, which is the most effective reward schedule for maintaining motivation - i.e., celebrate your wins, but not all of them.\n* Put emphasis on the process - dopamine release is partially controlled by mindset.\n* Avoid layering too many sources of dopamine if your goal is to consistently feel motivated (you will crash afterward).\n* Get good sleep.\n\n## Sleep\n\n* Get morning sunlight exposure for 5-10 minutes after waking up to help set your circadian clock for the day (even if it's cloudy). This is the most important one.\n* Avoid bright light between 10pm and 4am (especially overhead lights). Exceptions are red light and firelight. Lights low down in the room are less harmful. This is the second most important one.\n* Keep your room cool and dark while sleeping.\n* Avoid caffeine 8-10 hours before bedtime, as it disrupts sleep.\n* Alcohol close to bedtime will also disrupt sleep.\n* Limiting variation in your sleep is more important than the amount of sleep you get (although both matter).\n* Shift your clock gradually to prepare for jet lag.\n* Naps are perfectly fine; as long as they are kept under 90 minutes, they shouldn't disrupt your sleep cycle.\n* Huberman does not recommend taking melatonin.\n* NSDR can be used for insomnia.\n* You can experiment with apigenin (also found in chamomile tea) or theanine if you have trouble falling asleep. There is [limited evidence](https://examine.com/supplements/magnesium/faq/d2PxX2x-is-magnesium-good-for-sleep/) to support magnesium's sleep benefits outside of a few niche cases. Supplements are less important than following the other sleep protocols.\n\n## Supplements\n\n* Some of the supplements discussed on the podcast have limited supporting evidence. Here are some with stronger evidence:\n* [Ashwagandha](https://examine.com/supplements/ashwagandha/) \\- reduces cortisol (stress).\n* [Caffeine](https://examine.com/supplements/caffeine/)\n* [Creatine](https://examine.com/supplements/creatine/) \\- improves physical performance and possibly cognition. One of the most well-researched supplements. Needs to be taken daily to provide benefits.\n* [Omega-3 fatty acids](https://examine.com/supplements/fish-oil/) \\- can reduce depression and improve cognition, plus other health benefits you can look up. It's best to aim for products that contain at least 1g of EPA + DHA. Dosages as high as 2g of EPA have been shown to carry benefits.\n* [Rhodiola rosea](https://examine.com/supplements/rhodiola-rosea/) \\- reduces stress and improves performance while under stress. Can improve work capacity and recovery on intense workouts.\n* If you have a specific gap in your diet (e.g. magnesium, vitamin D), you can take something for that.\n* Consider a multivitamin if you decide you need one.\n\n## Water\n\n* Filter your tap water, preferably with a filter that removes fluoride.\n* Hard water (water that is high in dissolved minerals like calcium and magnesium) can reduce inflammation and benefit cardiovascular health.\n* Aim for around 80oz of water within 10 hours of waking to avoid dehydration.\n* Try to avoid plastic water bottles, as the plastic will leach into the water over time.\n* Electrolytes help offset dehydration and are good to take during exercise.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nAs always, remember not to lose the forest for the trees. The point of these protocols are to improve the quality of your life, not to optimize for the sake of optimizing. Nothing is optimal in the real world, and to the extant something is ideal in one way, it is less ideal in another way. I appreciate the love and I hope everyone found this helpful.

    "body": "This post is an attempt to provide a general answer to one of the most commonly asked questions on this subreddit: \"*I just got my Genetic Genie report...what does it mean??*\"\n\nI've tried to base this on reliable information, but it is inevitably incomplete, laced with opinion, and perhaps has errors. I welcome suggestions/corrections. Further, there may be interactions between SNPs that are unique to an individual, their life history, nutrition status, etc. that cannot possibly be addressed in such a general post.\n\nFinally, while [Genetic Genie](https://geneticgenie.org/) is a very handy tool and is free, it only analyzes a handful of SNPs. There can be many more SNPs that may be impactful for an individual. For those who wish to delve deeper, I recommend considering the following paid reports (each report will be in the 100-page range):\n\n* [Stratagene](https://www.seekinghealth.com/collections/strategene/products/strategene-report)  ([review](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/155qo9e/stratagene_report_review_some_pros_and_cons/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))\n* [Genetic Lifehacks](https://www.geneticlifehacks.com/)\n\n\n\nThe genes are listed in the order in which they appear in the Genetic Genie report.\n\nAlternate names for SNPs come from a) the rsID column of the Genetic Genie report, and b) [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) entries.\n\n\n\n# COMT\n\n* 'COMT' is short for 'catechol-o-methyltransferase'.\n* V158M alternate names: 472G>A, Val158Met, rs4680\n* H62H alternate names: 186C>T, rs4633\n* P199P alternate names: 597G>A, rs769224\n* COMT performs the breakdown of catecholamines; in particular, of dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and estrogen compounds.\n* Cofactors: magnesium, s-adenosyl-methionine (SAM)\n   * Maintain healthy levels of magnesium.\n   * Improve/maintain the methylation system (see other SNPs).\n* COMT regulates levels of [topic dopamine](https://youtu.be/IRQ4-lAeYJI&t=1951).\n   * One can think of **tonic dopamine** as providing the fairly constant baseline reference level of dopamine, whereas **phasic dopamine** is the brief sub-second pulse of dopamine due to some stimulus. [Phasic dopamine](https://youtu.be/IRQ4-lAeYJI&t=2037) is not regulated by COMT.\n   * If the tonic dopamine is low, then the phasic pulse will be large relative to the tonic level, and so the stimulus gets more attention. Behaviorally, this is someone who can have characteristics such as: being easily distracted, ADHD, more easily drops unpleasant thoughts, thrill seeker, potentially better under stress.\n   * If the tonic dopamine is high, then the phasic pulse will be small relative to the tonic level, and so the stimulus gets less attention. Behaviorally, this is someone who can have characteristics such as: able to concentrate on single topics, OCD, rumination, anxiety, worse under stress.\n   * If the tonic dopamine is intermediate, then the phasic pulse will be moderate relative to the tonic level, and so the stimulus gets a 'normal' amount of attention. Behaviorally, this is the someone who can be more balanced in their ability to respond or not to stimuli, who tends to neither ADHD nor OCD ends of the behavior spectrum.\n   * **NOTE**: COMT requires SAM, which is the primary output of the methylation cycle. If methylation output is low due to MTHFR or other issues, then COMT will work less efficiently at breaking down these neurotransmitters and thus tonic dopamine levels will be higher. (E.g., an intermediate COMT variant may act like a slow COMT variant, simply due to lack of SAM. Resolving the methylation issues will thus improve the COMT performance.)\n* V158M Green (-/-)\n   * This is often called \"fast COMT\".\n   * Dopamine/epinephrine/norepinephrine and other catecholamines are broken down at an accelerated rate, resulting in lower tonic dopamine levels.\n   * Some action steps if low tonic dopamine is a problem:\n      * Consider a higher protein diet to increase intake of tyrosine and phenylalanine. However, note that this may also increase intake of tryptophan which can be detrimental if one has slow MAO-A.\n      * Consider addition of catechols (such as quercitin, ECGC, fisetin, green tea, capers, cilantro, berries, apples) to occupy some of COMT's bandwidth.\n      * It may be that [higher iron and/or calcium levels could slow down COMT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3466255/).\n      * Consider supplementing tyrosine, which is the raw material for tyrosine hydroxylase, or supplementing Mucuna Pruriens (which contains L-Dopa). L-Dopa is the output product from tyrosine hydroxylase and is the precursor to tyrosine.\n      * NOTE: See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/18351lg/a_cautionary_tale/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for some potential issues with supplementing tyrosine or Mucuna Pruriens.\n      * Improve vitamin D status toward the higher end of the reference range.\n      * Maintain healthy levels of iron, vitamins B6, C.\n      * In the dopamine production pathway, tyrosine hydroxylase also depends on BH4, which comes from the biopterin pathway, and that pathway in turn also depends on GTP from the folate cycle. So, improving the folate cycle by addressing MTHFR will also help with BH4 production. BH4 production and utilization also needs healthy levels of B3, C, iron, zinc, and magnesium.\n* V158M Yellow  (+/-)\n   * Despite it showing yellow on the report, this COMT is actually 'normal'. About 45-50% of the population are V158M +/-.\n   * Your tonic dopamine levels are intermediate.\n* V158M Red  (+/+)\n   * This is often called \"slow COMT\".\n   * Dopamine/epinephrine/norepinephrine and other catecholamines are broken down at a reduced rate, resulting in higher tonic dopamine levels.\n   * Reduced breakdown of estrogen compounds can result in symptoms associated with excess estrogen or estrogen dominance.\n   * Some action steps for V158M Red:\n      * Most important is to improve methylation. This includes addressing MTHFR, MTR, B12 and folate status, and other SNPs not shown on Genetic Genie.\n      * See [this article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/click-here-happiness/202001/what-is-the-comt-gene-and-how-does-it-affect-your-health) for many good suggestions.\n      * If you are estrogen dominant, consider supplementing DIM, I3C, calcium-d-glucarate to reduce excess estrogen.\n      * It may be that [higher iron and/or calcium levels could slow down COMT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3466255/).\n      * Consider trying small (100-200mg) doses of supplemental SAMe, once/day or once/every few days. Once methylation status is improved, this may be unnecessary.\n* H62H - general\n   * This SNP and V158M together are a 'haplotype'. H62H will almost always be the same variant type as V158M. Therefore, refer to V158M.\n* H62H Red (+/+)\n   * According to [this paper](https://translationalneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40035-017-0081-9): \"*Both rs4633 TT \\[H62H Red (+/+)\\] and rs4680 AA \\[V158M Red (+/+)\\] encode the low activity COMT enzyme, which may decrease COMT activity and dopamine degradation*.\"\n   * Therefore, it appears the (+/+) variant would act as slow COMT. However, it is not clear if the impact of the H62H  (+/+) variant alone would be more, less, or similar to a comparable V158M (+/+) variant alone.\n* P199P\n   * [77-98%](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs769224) of people have the  Green (-/-) variant.\n   * I am unaware of any evidence that this SNP is impactful.\n\n\n\n# VDR\n\n* 'VDR' is short for 'vitamin D receptor'.\n* Consensus appears to be that Yellow or Red in **VDR Taq**, **VDR Bsm**, or **VDR Fok** indicate reduced vitamin D receptor activity.\n   * If any of these are Yellow or Red, consider improving your vitamin D status toward the higher end of the normal reference range.\n* **NOTE**: There is [some belief](https://www.heartfixer.com/AMRI-Nutrigenomics.htm#VDR%20Taq:%20%20Vitamin%20D%20Receptor%20Taq%20Abnormality) that VDR SNPs significantly affect tonic dopamine levels.\n   * Although it appears that tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme activity (which produces the dopamine precursor L-Dopa) will be improved by more optimal levels of vitamin D, it does not follow that more optimal levels of vitamin D will necessarily produce *excess* tonic dopamine.\n   * To avoid any potential issues, those with high tonic dopamine (due to V158M Red and/or poor methylation) may opt to address those issues first, prior to improving their vitamin D status.\n* **NOTE**: VDR is merely the last step in the sequence of steps to utilize vitamin D in its active form. There are several conversion steps that inactive vitamin D must go through to become active vitamin D, and those enzymes can have SNPs which downregulate them. The Genetic Lifehacks report mentioned at the top of the post will include these.\n\n\n\n# MAO-A\n\n* MAO-A is short for 'monoamine oxidase A'.\n* MAO-A alternate names: 891G>T, rs6323, R297R, Arg297Arg\n* MAO-A breaks down amines including dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, histamines, tyramines, and also estrogen compounds.\n* The cofactor is B2.\n   * NOTE: Hypothyroidism can reduce conversion of riboflavin to the active forms FAD and FMN.\n* **NOTE**: Males only have one copy of MAO-A, thus Genetic Genie will report a single letter, e.g., 'G', instead of 'GG', for males.\n* Iron deficiency can impair MAO-A activity.\n* Be aware of MAO Inhibitors (MAOIs) which can impair MAO-A activity:\n   * Some prescribed drugs.\n   * [Natural MAOIs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35807542), such as turmeric, curcumin, quercetin, piperine, luteolin, apigenin, chrysin, naringenin, and others.\n* MAO-A R297R Green (-/-) or Yellow (+/-, TG)\n   * These are 'normal' variants.\n   * Maintain healthy B2 levels and healthy thyroid performance.\n* MAO-A R297R  Red (+/+, T or TT)\n   * This is often called \"slow MAO-A\".\n   * Maintain healthy B2 levels and healthy thyroid performance.\n   * You may find you are more susceptible to amines such as histamines or tyramines, especially  those with MAO-A Red. If so:\n      * Reduce or avoid high tyramine and/or high histamine foods.\n      * Consider DAO supplements to degrade histamines in the gut from bacteria and food.\n      * Maintain healthy iron, copper, vitamin C, magnesium, and calcium levels.\n   * Excess estrogen may also be an issue, especially if you also have COMT V158M Red.\n      * Consider supplementing DIM, I3C, calcium-d-glucarate to reduce excess estrogen levels.\n   * Resources:\n      * r/HistamineIntolerance subreddit\n      * [Histamine Intolerance Introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/cr9pf6/histamine_intolerence_introduction_and_help_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) post\n   * Supplements I like:\n      * [Thorne Cal Mag Citrate + Vitamin C](https://www.amazon.com/Thorne-Research-Effervescent-Magnesium-Supplement/dp/B0797FBSKY)\n      * [Pure Encapsulations Copper Glycinate - 2 mg Copper Supplement](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H7Y6J2)\n      * [NaturDAO DAO Enzyme Supplement - 1,000,000 HDU](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08R5ZVG4L)\n\n\n\n# ACAT1-02\n\n* 'ACAT1' is short for 'acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1'.\n* ACAT1-02 alternate names:  rs3741049\n* I am unfamiliar with this SNP, and I refer you to:\n   * [Medline article](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/acat1/)\n   * [Blog post](https://www.myquinstory.info/know-your-genes-the-acat-gene/)\n\n\n\n# MTHFR\n\n* 'MTHFR' is short for 'methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase'.\n* MTHFR is the final enzymatic step in the conversion of food folate, folic acid, or folinic acid to methylfolate. If the methylation cycle were thought of as a gear that is turned by a crank handle, then methylfolate is the hand that turns the crank handle - with poor methylfolate status, the methylation cycle performs poorly.\n* The cofactor is B2.\n   * NOTE: Hypothyroidism can reduce conversion of riboflavin to the active forms FAD and FMN.\n* P39P\n   * P39P alternate name: rs2066470\n   * [74-95%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs2066470#frequency_tab) of people have the Green (-/-) variant.\n   * I am unaware of evidence that this SNP is impactful.\n* C677T and A1298C\n   * C677T alternate names: 677C-T, 677C>T, C665T, 665C>T, Ala222Val, rs1801133, C667T\n   * A1298C alternate names: 1298A-C, 1298A>C, 1286A>C, GLU429ALA, rs1801131, E429A\n   * These two SNPs can appear in different permutations of variants, which affect the performance of MTHFR.\n   * See [MTHFR: A Supplement Stack Approach](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1730mw4/mthfr_a_supplement_stack_approach/) for action steps for C677T and A1298C.\n   * Per the [table on Genesight](https://genesight.com/white-papers/what-is-the-clinical-significance-of-the-mthfr-a1298c-polymorphism/), the resulting percent of performance for the various combinations are:\n\n|Genotypes|677CC (-/-) \\[GG\\]|677CT (-/+) \\[AG\\]|677TT (+/+) \\[AA\\]|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1298AA (-/-) \\[TT\\]|100%|51-73%|22-32%|\n|1298AC (-/+) \\[GT\\]|69-92%|36-60%|n/a|\n|1298CC (+/+) \\[GG\\]|52-60%|n/a|n/a|\n\n* **NOTE**: MTHFR is only the last step in the folate conversion cycle. There can be SNPs in preceding enzymes such as MTHFD1 or SLC19A1 which may also degrade performance of the folate cycle.  The Stratagene report mentioned at top of post will analyze these SNPs. Also, Chris Masterjohn's free [Choline Calculator](https://chrismasterjohnphd.substack.com/p/how-much-choline-should-i-eat-the) will analyze MTHFD1 and SLC19A1 from your 23andme or Ancestry data.\n\n\n\n# MTR\n\n* 'MTR' is short for '5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase' or more commonly, 'methionine synthase' (MS).\n* MTR alternate names:\n* MTR is the enzyme which takes the methyl group donated by methylfolate and gives it to B12, which in turn gives the methyl group to homocysteine to convert homocysteine to methionine.\n* The cofactor is zinc.\n* Adequate methylfolate, B12 sufficiency, and adequate homocysteine levels are required for its operation.\n* [Adequate glutathione is also required](https://youtu.be/nR02eWsFK2I?t=6511) for MTR to work properly.\n   * See also: [Paper(2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3577685/), [Paper(2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4017153/)\n* A2756G all variants:\n   * A2756G alternate names: 2756A>G, Asp919Gly, D919G:GAC>GGC, 2756A-G, rs1805087\n   * Maintain healthy zinc and B12 status.\n   * Address folate intake and any MTHFR issues.\n   * Maintain healthy methionine (e.g., protein) intake.\n   * Maintain homocysteine a healthy range (e.g., \\~5-8mcmol/L).\n\n\n\n# MTRR\n\n* 'MTRR' is short for '5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase'.\n* This is a low-activity repair enzyme for B12 that gets used by MTR.\n   * (It is typically stated that the methionine cycle 'spins' 18000 times/day, and that B12 needs repair roughly every 200 cycles. Therefore, MTRR is needed only \\~90 times/day, or an average of once every 16 minutes.)\n* The cofactors are B2, B3, SAM.\n   * NOTE: Hypothyroidism can reduce conversion of riboflavin to the active forms FAD and FMN.\n* MTRR - all SNPs and  variants:\n   * Maintain healthy B2, B3, and B12 status. Maintain healthy thyroid performance.\n   * SAM is the output of the methylation cycle, so address MTHFR and any other methylation issues.\n\n\n\n# BHMT\n\n* 'BHMT' is short for 'betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase'.\n* BHMT uses betaine (aka trimethylglycine or TMG) to convert homocysteine to methionine. This is an alternate path for conversion of homocysteine to methionine, which runs in parallel with the MTR path.\n* The cofactor is zinc.\n* BMHT - all SNPs and variants:\n   * Maintain healthy zinc, B2, B3, B6 to support BHMT and the upstream steps which convert choline to betaine. Maintain healthy thyroid performance.\n   * Maintain adequate choline intake. For this, see [MTHFR: A Supplement Stack Approach](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1730mw4/mthfr_a_supplement_stack_approach/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\n\n\n# AHCY\n\n* 'AHCY' is short for 'adenosylhomocysteinase'.\n* AHCY converts s-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) to homocysteine, in the methionine cycle.\n* AHCY is alternatively called 'SAHH', short for  'S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase'.\n* The cofactor is B3.\n   * [This video](https://youtu.be/6-g-gCLa-xY) claims that magnesium and manganese are also needed. However, I cannot find anything elsewhere to substantiate this.\n* I do not know of any specific actions to take for this gene, aside from maintaining healthy B3 status.\n* For more info, I refer you to this paper: [Functional and Pathological Roles of AHCY](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044520/).\n\n\n\n# CBS\n\n* 'CBS' is short for 'cystathionine-beta-synthase'.\n* CBS is an enzyme which uses some homocysteine from the methionine cycle to another set of pathways (transsulfuration pathway), which include the creation of the important antioxidant glutathione.\n* The cofactors are B6, heme iron, serine.\n   * Serine comes from the diet or can be converted from glycine by the SHMT enzyme.\n* The reaction is activated by SAM.\n* CBS - all SNPs and all variants:\n   * Maintain healthy B6, iron, and serine levels.\n   * Maintain homocysteine a healthy range (e.g., \\~5-8mcmol/L).\n   * I am not aware of any good evidence that these SNPs are impactful.\n   * There may be issues further down the transsulfuration pathway which cause issues with sulfur intolerance and/or poor glutathione production, but that may require examination of other SNPs that are not on Genetic Genie. For that, I suggest the Stratagene report mentioned at top of the post.\n\n\n\n# SHMT1\n\n* 'SHMT1' is short for 'serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1'.\n* SHMT1 has a dual role in the folate cycle:\n   * Simultaneous reversible conversion of serine to glycine and tetrahydrofolate (THF) (the form after MTR takes away a methyl group from methylfolate) to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (the form needed by MTHFR).\n      * This pathway [provides 80-90% of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate for MTHFR](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.00351.2003?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org).\n   * The cofactor is B6.\n* C1420T - rs1979277 Red (+/+, AA) or Yellow (+/-, AG):\n   * Per [this paper](https://doi.org/10.3945%2Fjn.110.132506), these variants may sequester methyltetrahydrofolate, and may interact with a C677T variant (if present) resulting in reduced methylfolate available for methylation.\n* C1420T - all variants:\n   * Maintain healthy B6 status, and healthy glycine intake.\n   * I am unaware of any additional action steps to take.\n\n\n\n\n\nEDITS:\n\n* 20231010 - Corrected typo 'lower tonic dopamine' to 'higher tonic dopamine' for slow COMT.\n* 20231011 - Added bullet point about BH4 to fast COMT actions. Minor edits.\n* 20231011 - Added H62H \"slow COMT\" bullets.\n* 20231025 - Added alternate names (rsIDs and ClinVar names) to several SNPs.\n* 20231101 - Added glutathione requirement to MTR, with references.\n* 20231111 - Add SAHH alternate name for AHCY.\n* 20231120 - Add CBS cofactors serine & heme iron, and activator SAM.\n* 20231126 - Add Mucuna Pruriens for fast COMT, and link to post re potential tyrosine issues.\n* 20231128 - Add hypothyroidism comments for B2 cofactors. Add fast COMT catechol suggestions. Add iron/calcium comment to fast & slow COMT sections.\n* 20231226 - Add to resource links under MAO-A and ACAT1.\n* 20240203 - Add specific supplements to MAO-A. Add references on SHMT1.\n* 20240225 - Add iron deficiency as contributor to MAO slowdown. Add natural MAOIs list.\n\n\n\n",

So you have to be a chemist or else estimate roughly how much glycine there is from those values.\n* There is also a tacit assumption here that 100% of the glycinate component will be broken down and become available in the body as glycine. I don't know if this is true.\n* The percentage of elemental mag per dose varies from [10](https://www.amazon.com/Supplements-Magnesium-Glycinate-Absorbable-Tablets/dp/B07NWMVMT1)\\-[21](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7LXGS76)% in the label claims of products I've seen on Amazon, so it appears there will also be varying amounts of glycine per dose, based on brand.\n* If you need larger amounts of glycine, say 10g/day, then the accompanying magnesium amount may be excessive either in terms of need or bowel tolerance or both.\n\nSo, in theory, some people may be able to use mag glycinate as a substitute source for plain glycine, but there are too many caveats and what-ifs to make a general statement like \"if you want to use mag glycinate, use X amount of mag glycinate as a substitute for Y amount of glycine\".",

    "body": "# Introduction\n\nMost people arrive at this subreddit with their [Genetic Genie](https://geneticgenie.org/) report, seeking to address some set of symptoms. A combination of three particular types of issues - which interact with each other - seem to cause a common cluster of symptoms:\n\n* Folate-pathway reductions (including MTHFR)\n* Slow or slow-acting COMT (rs4680)\n* Slow MAO-A (rs6323)\n\nNOTE: While this seems to be a *common* pattern, it is not necessarily a *universal* pattern: there are many more genes potentially affecting one's symptoms, as well as nutrient status and lifestyle factors, which can impact symptom types and intensities, so consider this post as *suggestive* of a cause-effect pattern, but not *definitive*.\n\n# Folate-pathway reductions in methylfolate production\n\n**WHAT THIS IS**\n\n* Genetic variants in some folate-pathway genes can cause reduced methylfolate production. This results in less methylfolate available to remethylate homocysteine to methionine through methionine synthase (MTR).\n\n**WHAT THIS DOES**\n\n* The result is reduced methylation cycle output of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a methyl donor found in almost every tissue of the body, and needed for countless processes to function properly.\n\n**TYPICAL SYMPTOMS**\n\n* Common symptoms can include:\n   * Depression\n   * Fatigue\n   * Brain fog\n   * Inability to follow through on tasks\n   * Exercise intolerance\n   * Muscle or joint pains\n   * Possible high homocysteine\n\n**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**\n\n* Genetic variants which can contribute to reduced methylfolate production (homozygous variants impose greater reductions than heterozygous):\n   * SLC19a1  rs1051266\t                 T/T or T/C\n   * MTHFD1  rs2236225 (G1958A)\t A/A or A/G\n   * MTHFR     rs1801131 (A1298C)   G/G or G/T\n   * MTHFR     rs1801133 (C677T)\t A/A or A/G\n   * Upload your data to Chris Masterjohn's [Choline Calculator](https://chrismasterjohnphd.substack.com/p/how-much-choline-should-i-eat-the) to get a free report on these genes. The results are listed on two tabs:\n      * **Just Gimme What Works** \\- lists the number of egg yolk equivalents of dietary choline needed daily to compensate for these methylfolate reductions. Multiply by 136 to get the number of milligrams of choline (e.g., 8 yolks \\* 136 = 1088mg).\n      * **Advanced Stuff** \\- this will include 1) the specific SNP results, 2) the methylfolate reduction calculations and total reduction percentage.\n* Note that chronic folate and/or B12 deficiencies also result in reduced ability to drive MTR remethylation, and so can have similar symptoms.\n\n**RESOLUTION**\n\n* There are two pathways for remethylation of homocysteine in the methylation cycle: the methylfolate+B12-dependent pathway through MTR, and the choline-dependent pathway through BHMT. Due to the genetic folate-pathway restrictions, the body will place greater demand on the BHMT pathway, thereby increasing dietary choline requirements.\n   * See [this MTHFR protocol](https://new.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1730mw4/mthfr_a_supplement_stack_approach/) to implement the restoration of methylation function.\n\n# Slow (or slow-acting) COMT\n\n**WHAT THIS IS**\n\n* COMT is an enzyme which breaks down *catecholamines* in the body.\n* These catecholamines include:\n   * Exogenous catecholamines: from sources such as quercitin, green tea, some medications, etc.\n   * Endogenous catecholamines:\n      * Dopamine\n      * Epinephrine\n      * Norepinephrine\n      * Estrogen compounds\n\n**INTERACTIONS WITH FOLATE-PATHWAY REDUCTIONS**\n\n* As mentioned above, folate-pathway reductions can result in reduced SAM. SAM is a cofactor for COMT, so reduced SAM will reduce the ability of COMT to function to its genetic potential.\n* Slow COMT: Homozygous (A/A or \"Met/Met\") rs4680 COMT genetically already has reduced ability to break down catecholamines. Reduced SAM further reduces the ability of COMT to perform these functions.\n* Slow-acting COMT: Heterozygous rs4680 (A/G or \"Met/Val\") or fast rs4680 COMT (G/G or \"Val/Val\") normally can process catecholamines at faster rates than slow COMT.  However, reduced SAM can cause these COMT variants to have reduced ability of COMT to perform these functions, to the point that they *act like* slow COMT.\n\n**WHAT THIS DOES**\n\n* The result of slow or slow-acting COMT is:\n   * Higher [tonic dopamine](https://youtu.be/IRQ4-lAeYJI&t=1951), epinephrine, norepinephrine\n   * Higher levels of estrogen compounds\n\n**TYPICAL SYMPTOMS**\n\n* Common symptoms can include:\n   * Chronic anxiety\n   * Rumination\n   * OCD tendencies\n   * Low tolerance for stress\n   * Estrogen-dominance related symptoms\n   * Possible increased sensitivity to supplemental methyl donors\n\n**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**\n\n* See the COMT section of [this post](https://new.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/173y8yi/interpreting_your_genetic_genie_methylation_panel/) for more information.\n\n**RESOLUTION**\n\n* Restoring methylation to its potential is the primary resolution, as this will increase SAM output, allowing COMT to function at its genetic potential.\n* Magnesium is also a cofactor of COMT, so maintain healthy magnesium status.\n* Consider use of DIM, I3C, Calcium-D-Glucarate to assist in reducing estrogen levels if estrogen-dominance symptoms are present.\n* Inositol has also been [shown to be effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5097808/) for PCOS.\n* For genetically slow COMT, preventing overburdening of COMT through diet and lifestyle can help COMT function up to its limited potential. [This article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/click-here-happiness/202001/what-is-the-comt-gene-and-how-does-it-affect-your-health) provides some useful pointers on things to look out for.\n\n# Slow MAO-A\n\n**WHAT THIS IS**\n\n* MAO-A breaks down *amines*. These amines include:\n   * Dopamine\n   * Serotonin\n   * Biogenic amines:\n      * Histamine\n      * Tyramine\n      * Possibly also putrescine and cadaverine\n* Homozygous rs6323 slow MAO-A (T or T/T) has reduced ability to break down these amines.\n* Heterozygous rs6323 MAO-A (T/G) has somewhat reduced ability to break down these amines.\n* NOTE: Since the MAO-A gene is on the X chromosome, only women can have heterozygous MAO-A. Similarly, since men will only have one copy of MAO-A, it is often reported as a single letter 'T' or 'G' instead of 'T/T' or 'G/G'.\n* NOTE: If you used **23andme** and the test is from 2018 or later, then rs6323 will not be in your data as their V5 testing chip [no longer included rs6323 and several other useful genes](https://www.drbenlynch.com/23andme-v5-chip/). Ancestry's AncestryDNA does include the following SNPs mentioned in that blog post: rs72558181 MAT1A,  rs6323 & rs1137070 MAO-A, rs1799836 MAO-B, and rs10156191 AOC1 (DAO).\n\n**INTERACTIONS WITH FOLATE-PATHWAY REDUCTIONS AND SLOWED COMT**\n\n* MAO-A is slowed further by high estrogen, so higher estrogen levels due to slowed COMT further reduce MAO-A functionality.\n* Decreased dopamine breakdown by slowed COMT increases dopamine breakdown burden on MAO-A.\n* Decreased SAM production due to folate-pathway reductions causes reduced HNMT activity, thereby increasing intracellular histamines, likely also increasing burden on MAO-A.\n\n**WHAT THIS DOES**\n\n* The result of slow MAO-A is:\n   * Higher [tonic dopamine](https://youtu.be/IRQ4-lAeYJI&t=1951) and serotonin\n   * Higher levels of histamine and tyramine (and possibly other biogenic amines)\n* NOTE: MAO-A/MAO-B are slowed further by:\n   * Hypothyroidism.\n   * Iron deficiency.\n   * MAO Inhibitors (MAOIs)\n      * Some prescribed drugs.\n      * [Natural MAOIs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35807542), such as turmeric, curcumin, quercetin, piperine, luteolin, apigenin, chrysin, naringenin, and others.\n\n**TYPICAL SYMPTOMS**\n\n* Common symptoms can include:\n   * Histamine-intolerance - [wide variety of symptoms](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/cr9pf6/histamine_intolerence_introduction_and_help_with/)\n   * Tyramine-intolerance - headaches, migraine, blood-pressure increases\n   * [Food intolerances](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8469513/)\n* NOTE: Since high estrogen can slow MAO-A further, fluctuating estrogen levels in women's cycles can also cause fluctuating symptom appearance and intensity.\n   * Histamine-intolerance may be involved in PMS/PMDD symptoms, according to many websites.\n\n**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**\n\n* See r/HistamineIntolerance\n* See r/Migraine\n* See r/MCAS\n* [Genetic Lifehacks](https://www.geneticlifehacks.com/) genetic report includes sections on additional relevant genes:\n   * Histamine\n   * Alcohol and Histamine\n   * Histamine Early Morning Insomnia\n   * Estrogen and Histamine\n* [Stratagene](https://www.seekinghealth.com/collections/strategene/products/strategene-report) genetic report includes a sections on additional genes in relevant pathways:\n   * Dopamine pathway\n   * Histamine pathway\n   * Serotonin pathway\n\n**RESOLUTION**\n\n* Restoring methylation to its potential is important, as this will increase SAM output, allowing COMT to function at its genetic potential. As a result:\n   * Dopamine breakdown by COMT will increase, reducing burden on MAO-A some.\n   * Estrogen breakdown by COMT will increase, reducing estrogen-induced slowdown of MAO-A.\n   * HNMT will receive adequate SAM, allowing increased breakdown of intracellular histamine.\n      * NOTE: I speculate this may initially cause increased burden on MAO-A, as excess intracellular histamine is eliminated.\n* Riboflavin (B2) is a cofactor of MAO-A, so maintain healthy B2 status.\n* Maintain healthy iron, copper, vitamin C, magnesium, and calcium levels.\n* SIBO is a potential cause of chronic excess histamines produced by a dysbiotic gut microbiome.\n* MCAS is also a potential cause of excess histamines.\n* Discuss concerns about MAO inhibitor (MAOI) drugs with your doctor.\n* Consider removing or reducing supplements which are MAO inhibitors (MAOIs).\n* Slow MAO-A persons may always need to manage their histamine/tyramine intake to reduce the total burden present at any point.\n   * Histamine-intolerance groups often use the 'histamine bucket' analogy:\n      * A person will have a certain capacity \"bucket\" to hold histamines.\n      * Intake of histamine/tyramine from food fills up that bucket.\n      * Slow MAO-A breakdown of histamine will more slowly lower the level of histamine in the bucket.\n      * When the bucket \"overflows\" due to too much accumulated histamine, this is when symptoms appear.\n* Consider using DAO enzyme supplements with high-histamine/tyramine meals to break down tyramine/histamine before they are absorbed, as a way to reduce total load.\n   * [This video](https://youtu.be/sxizNOh7kUY) provides a good in-depth look at DOA and histamine issues.\n* Consider if your B5 intake is adequate to support the NAT pathway to break down histamines.\n* Consider if your zinc and B3 intake is adequate to support the ALDH enzymes which break down the acetaldehyde form of histamine that is output from MAO-A/B. \n* In addition to high-histamine foods, there are seem to be \"histamine liberators\", which induce histamine release; coffee is perhaps the most common.\n* Histamine release after exercise is not unusual.\n* Supplements I like for my slow MAO-A:\n   * [Thorne Cal Mag Citrate + Vitamin C](https://www.amazon.com/Thorne-Research-Effervescent-Magnesium-Supplement/dp/B0797FBSKY)\n   * [Pure Encapsulations Copper Glycinate - 2 mg Copper Supplement](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H7Y6J2)\n   * [NaturDAO DAO Enzyme Supplement - 1,000,000 HDU](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08R5ZVG4L)\n\nEDITS:\n\n* 20240225 - Add iron deficiency as contributor to MAO slowdown. Add natural MAOIs list.\n* 20240708 - Add details of AncestryDNA coverage of SNPs no longer included in 23andme.\n* 20250111 - Add link to DAO video.

This is needed along with glycine for the methyl buffering.\n* Methylfolate - recommend sublingual so that they can be broken into smaller pieces (125-250mcg) to slowly ramp up without overmethylation from larger doses.\n* Choline - \"550 mg capsules or powder\" \n   * Depending on the type of choline supplement, it may be 15-40% choline.\n   * Trimethylglycine (TMG) powder - just 1/3-1/2tsp - can satisfy half of the choline demand.\n   * Egg yolks are of course a good source (\\~136mg/yolk). \n   * Meat is also a good source - 16oz of beef is \\~500-530mg.\n* Inositol powder - may be useful for OCD. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You personally had the real breakthrough success with this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes.

But I used to get periods that were like 8 days long sometimes like a week or more late, extremely heavy (bad clots), and I would get cramps so bad I was doubled over in the fetal position moaning in pain. In 2019 my periods started getting worse and I had worsening PMS symptoms. I started getting cramps earlier and earlier and they would start REALLY badly maybe 3-5 days before my period and last for a week or more. Sometimes I would be crying from the severe breast tenderness I couldn’t even move my arms or put a shirt on. It was brutal. I also got a headache on day 1 of my cycle for over TEN YEARS. \n\nI decided to see this acupuncturist, she said I had liver/blood stagnation I think, did some acupuncture and mixed this concoction of herbs for me to take which tasted like dirt lol. It was my first time taking herbal medicine but I trusted her because she also had a PHD in biochemistry haha. \n\nI kid you not after taking those herbs for one cycle I had a 5 day period on time with very normal bleeding, NO clots, NO cramps, NO headache, and hardly any PMS. I thought it was a coincidence until I took the herbs for only 3 months but the effects have lasted until now, for 7 months until I got pregnant and now it’s been almost 5 years since I took them, 3 years postpartum and I still have very normal easy periods. It just permanently did something in my body. It’s truly a miracle and I still don’t understand it. I’m personally a huge skeptic but I saw the same miraculous effects when I had a cyst rupture last year, a brewing infection because I was in so much pain everyday for over a month. I saw so many doctors, went to the ER and had a CT scan. No one would help me. So I saw another Chinese medicine doctor (I was living in another country through all this) who gave me a concoction of herbs to take for a week. Day 1 took in the evening and my pain was completely gone the next morning, but started coming back during the day so I took another dose and it was gone again. Day 3 of the herbs and my pain never came back again. I will swear by this stuff for the rest of my life.\n\nAlso in case anyone else is wondering, I luckily kept note of what she gave me for my periods! The formula had - \n- Cinnamon twig, white peony root, ginger root, jujube date, licorice root, angelica senisis root, evodia fruit, wild ginger root, nut grass rhizome, sichuan lovage rhizome and cattail pollen.",

So finding the right dose is important. Unfortunately, SAMe are usually enteric-coated, so breaking them apart with a pill-splitter works but its not ideal. There is a sublingual SAMe on Amazon, but the reviews are pretty negative about the taste. So, I suggest trialing with 200mg doses and if no bad reaction, then consider trying 400mg.\n\nThe effects of SAMe for me were sharpened cognition and a slight energy improvement. The effect would last roughly 6 hours for me, so it was something I used tactically when I felt a little foggy or when I needed some energy for a work project, but not as a regular supplement. But that was half a year ago while I was still going through the protocol. At this point, though, SAMe seems irrelevant to me as I consistently have good methylation and cognition.",

Maybe there is no single reason, just an accumulation of cascading errors in the immune system or in the gut wall or both.\n\nThe closer I am to carnivore, the better I feel in general. But then an occasional day of high carb, low protein/fat will rejuvenate me; but if I try to continue that high carb low protein beyond a day I will worsen quickly. I'm still trying to sort out the best pattern and least-negative high carb foods for myself.",

'Phasic' refers to the pulses of a neurotransmitter in response to some stimulus. So when someone talks about a \"dopamine hit\" as a good thing, they are referring to the phasic pulse. Phasic levels are controlled differently from tonic levels.\n\nIronically, higher tonic levels make the phasic pulses seem smaller by comparison, so the pulses of dopamine or serotonin are less impactful, and provoke less emotion or response.",

I don’t know enough yet about how the body metabolize or stores creatine to figure out if a lower dose or every other day protocol might work. It definitely seemed as though the sleep issues started a few weeks into taking it and then quickly became unbearable. So, I am assuming, I reached some sort oft threshold or max utilization/absorption. \n\nEven dropping to 1g a day caused sleep issues and it required many days of not consuming it to return to normal sleep. \n\nAny thoughts on what protocol might allow me to continue taking it but without the sleep issue?",

I recently undertook a small project: I selected 50 episodes heavily focused on foundational health and actionable protocols.\n\nI then uploaded these 50 sources into Google's NotebookLM to see if I could extract a purely actionable summary. Essentially, a condensed list of the \"what to do\" without the (incredibly valuable, but lengthy) explanations of the underlying mechanisms. The goal was to create a high-level reference guide of tangible practices.\n\nYou can find that post here: [**Key Takeaways from 50 Core Huberman Health Episodes (Analyzed with NotebookLM)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HubermanLab/comments/1k20t18/key_takeaways_from_50_core_huberman_health/)\n\nI wanted to do the same for ALL videos he has ever released, and this post, does that. This post is a culmination of **all \\~300 podcasts ever released by the Huberman Lab** analysed and compiled by NotebookLM Plus by Google.\n\nHere is a detailed list of specific, actionable tips, techniques, and protocols for optimizing physical and mental health, drawn directly from the provided sources and organized by health domain.\n\n# Wiki 1\n\nBased on the provided sources from the Huberman Lab, here is a detailed compilation of specific, actionable tips, techniques, and protocols for optimizing physical and mental health, organized into distinct categories. This compilation focuses strictly on the practical steps and strategies mentioned in the sources or noted as being available in associated resources like the neural network newsletter and the book \"Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body.\"\n\n**1. Sleep Optimization Protocols**\n\nSleep is emphasized as the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. Getting a great night's sleep is necessary to study and learn at your absolute best. Adequate sleep is needed for the positive effects of exercise on brain health.\n\n* **Regulate the temperature of your sleeping environment**.\n* You can use a tool like a **smart mattress cover** to easily regulate the temperature of your sleeping environment.\n* In order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature needs to **drop by about 1 to 3 degrees**.\n* In order to wake up in the morning and feel alert, your body temperature needs to **increase by about 1 to 3 degrees**.\n* **Get a great night's sleep the night before** if you want to be able to study and learn at your absolute best.\n* **Get adequate amounts of sleep**. It is not sufficient just to exercise; you need to get proper sleep, as sleep mediates many, though not all, of the positive effects of exercise on brain performance and long-term brain health.\n* **Structure your sleep** for optimal mental health, physical health, and performance.\n* Consider **monophasic sleep schedules**, which are the more typical sleep schedule where you go to sleep at night and then wake up in the morning, sleeping in one bout.\n* Consider **polyphasic sleep schedules**, which are when you sleep in two or more bouts, either at night or perhaps a shorter bout of sleep at night and another bout of sleep during the day.\n* Understand how your **needs for sleep and naps vary across the lifespan**.\n* **Pay attention to body position during sleep**, as it is critical for ensuring that the sleep you get is optimally restorative.\n* **Use light and absence of light** to regulate the timing and quality of your sleep.\n* **Use temperature** (both of your sleep environment, specifically the room you're in, and your body temperature) to regulate the timing and quality of your sleep.\n* **Get out of bed when you can't sleep**.\n* Be mindful of how things like **alcohol, caffeine, and cannabis impact sleep** and the various stages of sleep.\n* Explore **over-the-counter supplements** that seem to have some benefit in order to augment sleep.\n* Advanced protocols related to **thermal manipulation** can be explored for sleep enhancement.\n* Protocols for **optimizing your sleep** are included in the book \"Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body\". The book is designed to be incredibly easy to use, such that if you are suffering from a particular pain point in life, such as difficulty sleeping, you can go to a specific chapter and protocol and begin to resolve that issue.\n* Protocols for **optimizing your sleep** are included in the neural network newsletter. These are brief 1-3 page PDFs.\n* A **sleep toolkit**, described as a distilled list of things to do in order to optimize your sleep, is available at [hubermanlab.com](http://hubermanlab.com) by going to the Neural Network Newsletter section.\n* Information and actionable protocols related to **sleep** are available on the Huberman Lab clips channel.\n* You can find episodes and newsletters that discuss how to optimize your sleep, improve your sleep, deal with insomnia, shift work, and jet lag by **putting \"sleep\" into the search function at hubermanlab.com**.\n* If you have a specific issue with sleep, such as shift work, jet lag, middle of the night waking, or trouble shifting your schedule because you want to become an early riser, you can **put those specific terms into the search function at** [**hubermanlab.com**](http://hubermanlab.com) to find specific timestamps in relevant episodes.\n* There is a newsletter on **sleep** that lists off the various things that you should and can be doing to improve your sleep, no matter how well you happen to be sleeping now.\n\n**2. Exercise & Movement Protocols**\n\nExercise is a critical foundational pillar practice for mental and physical health. Exercise improves brain health both in the long term and by improving sleep.\n\n* Follow the **basic structure of the foundational fitness protocol**: **three resistance training sessions per week and three cardiovascular training sessions per week**.\n* **Access the foundational fitness protocol** which is available as a PDF that spells out which workouts are done on which days, what the various workouts look like including sets and reps, and what options you have in terms of cardiovascular exercise. This can be found by following a link in the show note captions or simply going to [hubermanlab.com](http://hubermanlab.com), going to the menu tab, scrolling down to newsletter, and then scrolling down to the foundational fitness protocol. It is completely zero cost.\n* **Choose options for cardiovascular exercise** mentioned in the foundational fitness protocol, such as running, using a rower, or using a stationary bike.\n* Protocols for **exercise** are included in the book \"Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body\". The book covers protocols for increasing your motivation and focus for exercise.\n* The neural network newsletter includes a **foundational Fitness protocol** that describes a template routine that includes cardiovascular training and resistance training with sets and reps, all backed by science. These protocols are in the form of brief 1 to 3 page PDFs.\n* A complete summary of our **fitness series** is available as a toolkit in the neural network newsletter.\n* **Assess your level of Fitness**.\n* Use **zero-cost ways to assess one's level of Fitness** such as a routine broad jump test and an in-home high jump jump and touch test.\n* Use ways that require a bare minimum of technology to assess fitness, such as **taking your pulse rate in very specific ways at specific times**, some **timing of Mile runs**, and some other things related to strength and hypertrophy.\n* From the options provided for recovery, **pick one or two things per category** that are most important to you, that are at your cost and availability, that are interesting and important/relevant to you, and do that. The point is not to measure all of them.\n* When applied properly, recovery tools and modes can actually **help you recover from the stress and create the literal result that you're trying to achieve**.\n* Discussed ways on **how best to warm up for any and all workouts**.\n* Discussed how to **improve our movement patterns** for cardiovascular exercise, for sport, for resistance training across the board.\n* Discussed how to **improve our range of motion** with the minimal amount of time investment.\n* Discussed how to improve our range of motion across our entire body in the best possible ways.\n* Discussed how to **offset or repair any imbalances** that stem from muscular skeletal problems or from neural issues.\n* Discussed how to **reduce soreness**.\n* Discussed how to **improve our posture** (seated standing and movement-based posture).\n* **Take time off from the gym if you had to take a week off** because you were sick; you'll be fine and will probably come back stronger in the end.\n* After taking time off, **take a couple of days and ramp back up**.\n* **Please don't come to the gym sick**.\n\n**3. Stress Management & Mental Well-being Protocols**\n\nMental health and physical health are critically important and discussed using science-based tools. Emotional health has everything to do with our physical health and vice versa.\n\n* Engage in **a particular form of journaling that is supported by over 200 peer-reviewed studies** in quality journals for improving our mental and physical health. This practice should easily be placed among some of the other critical so-called foundational pillar practices. (The specific form of journaling is not detailed in this source).\n* Consider doing **regular therapy with a licensed therapist**.\n* Using an online platform like BetterHelp can make it very easy to **find a therapist that's optimal for your needs**.\n* Understand the **structure of our own minds** and how to think about our own minds as a way to enhance our mental health. This includes understanding how our subconscious mind and our conscious mind interact.\n* Protocols are provided for you to **address questions about your own Mental Health**.\n* You will learn to **assess levels of anxiety**.\n* You will learn **protocols for addressing levels of anxiety**.\n* You will learn to **assess levels of your confidence**.\n* You will learn **protocols for addressing levels of your confidence**.\n* You will learn how to **think about your beliefs and internal narratives**.\n* You will learn protocols for **addressing your beliefs and internal narratives**.\n* You will learn how to **think about your self-talk**.\n* You will learn protocols to **restructure your self-talk**.\n* Discussed how to **address common challenges such as overthinking**.\n* Learn how to **build one's mental health through specific practices**, either done alone or with a therapist.\n* Aim to constantly **improve your mood and mental health**.\n* Protocols for **Stress Control** are included in the book \"Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body\". The book is designed to be incredibly easy to use, such that if you are suffering from a particular pain point in life, such as excess stress, you can go to a specific chapter and protocol and begin to resolve that issue.\n* A **Mental Health toolkit** exists, listing off science-backed protocols to bolster your mood and mental health. (The specific protocols themselves are not detailed in the provided sources, but are referred to as the \"big six\" of self-care).\n* Information about the **\"big six\" pillars of self-care and mental health** can be found by putting topics of interest into the search function at hubermanlab.com. These pillars are necessary but not sufficient for the best possible mood and mental health every 24 hours.\n* **Use tools and techniques to readjust the autonomic nervous system in deliberate ways as an adult**. These tools and techniques are available at hubermanlab.com.\n* Practice the **physiological sigh**, described as **two inhales through the nose, as deeply as you can on the first one, sneaking in a little bit more air on the second one, and then a long exhale through the mouth**.\n* Practice **NSDR (non-sleep deep rest)** or **Yoga Nidra**.\n* When practicing NSDR/Yoga Nidra, **lie completely still**.\n* When practicing NSDR/Yoga Nidra, **keep the mind awake**.\n* When practicing NSDR/Yoga Nidra, use a **body scan directed relaxation, etc.**. This practice can help regulate impulses and deal with agitation, especially in the early days of trying to address addiction.\n* Consider **meditation** as a practice.\n* Consider using a **meditation app** that makes meditating easy and is backed by scientific studies, which can help you stick to a regular practice. Huberman uses one regularly, meditating anywhere from five to seven times a week.\n* Protocols related to emotional health are discussed, and Dr. Peter Attia's book \"Outlive\" contains an extensive section on emotional health and tools to improve it that are very actionable for anybody to use.\n* **Engage in social engagement** to support memory capacity and overall health.\n\n**4. Focus, Learning & Neuroplasticity Protocols**\n\nScience and science-based tools can be used for performance, including learning and focus. The nervous system has the capacity for neuroplasticity, meaning it can change.\n\n* Protocols related to **focus** are included in the book \"Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body\". The book covers protocols for increasing your motivation and focus.\n* Protocols for **optimizing your dopamine** are included in the neural network newsletter. These are brief 1-3 page PDFs. The newsletter includes protocols for managing your dopamine, optimizing dopamine, and regulating your dopamine.\n* Protocols related to **neuroplasticity and learning** are included in the neural network newsletter. These are brief 1-3 page PDFs.\n* A **Focus toolkit**, described as a distilled list of things to do in order to improve your focus, is available in the neural network newsletter.\n* Information and actionable protocols related to **focus** are available on the Huberman Lab clips channel.\n* Protocols related to **focus and motivation** are covered in the book \"Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body\".\n* **Get a great night's sleep the night before** when studying and learning, as it is the best nootropic and necessary to be able to study and learn at your absolute best.\n* **Limit your external stress** when studying and learning, although some stress is good because it cues up your alertness.\n* When you sit down to learn, **voluntarily ramp up your level of focus and alertness** by having a silent script within your head, telling yourself \"I need to learn this, I need to learn this\".\n* **Expect the information to be so interesting that it pulls your level of attention and focus**. This is the basis of active learning.\n* **Don't be a passive participant in learning**.\n* **Engage in cognitive activities** to maintain or enhance one's memory capacity as we get older.\n* **Engage in behavioral practices** to change your brain through neuroplasticity.\n* **Repetition can be important to change your brain, but the way to use repetition to change your brain is fundamentally different** from just passively experiencing things.\n* Learning involves all sorts of things; it's not just about being smart, it's about being able to attend and sometimes being creative and flexible with ideas and information.\n\n**5. Nutrition & Supplementation Strategies**\n\nNutrition is part of the ecosystem of factors that influence mental and physical health and performance. Sleep is mentioned as the foundation for recovery and performance, which includes nutrition.\n\n* Consider **supplementation as a potent tool** within a larger system aimed at customizing tools for our mental physical health and performance. Supplements are potent non-prescription molecules that really can move the needle in terms of your ability to think more clearly, sleep better, and support hormone function.\n* **Use resources like** [**examine.com**](http://examine.com) for information on supplements and any interactions to pay attention to if you are taking a combination of compounds. [Examine.com](http://Examine.com) is described as wonderful and having done a marvelous job.\n* Explore **supplements for enhancing sleep, focus, and hormone optimization**. (Specific supplements like magnesium, garlic, tart cherry extract, and Alpha GPC were mentioned as topics discussed in a previous episode, but specific usage protocols for these are not detailed in the provided sources).\n* Follow **specific nutritional guidelines** to follow for health and performance. (Details are not provided in this source, but are available in the book \"Protocols\").\n* **Follow a low inflammatory diet** to support memory maintenance and enhancement.\n* Address **nutrition related to your oral and gut microbiome**, both of which are critical for brain and body health. (Details are not provided in this source, but are available in the book \"Protocols\").\n* Nutrition is one element within an ecosystem of other factors such as your behaviors which includes do's and don'ts, maybe even such as prescription drugs that you also might happen to be taking.\n\n**6. Environmental & Other Health Practices**\n\nCertain environmental factors and lifestyle choices are discussed as contributing to overall health.\n\n* Protocols for **deliberate cold exposure** are included in the neural network newsletter. These are brief 1-3 page PDFs.\n* Protocols for **deliberate heat exposure** are included in the neural network newsletter. These are brief 1-3 page PDFs.\n* **Regulate the temperature of your sleeping environment**.\n* **Use light and absence of light** to regulate the timing and quality of your sleep.\n* To support the maintenance or enhancement of memory capacity, **do not smoke**.\n* To support the maintenance or enhancement of memory capacity, **limit or eliminate alcohol**.\n* **Engage in social engagement** to support the maintenance or enhancement of memory capacity.\n* Pay attention to factors affecting **skin health and appearance**. (Specific protocols for skin health are not detailed in this source, but it emphasizes skin as an important organ that tells us about immediate and long-term health).\n* Pay attention to factors affecting your **teeth and oral microbiome** for brain and body health. (Specific protocols for oral microbiome are not detailed in this source, but they are mentioned as being covered in the book \"Protocols\").\n* Protocols for **creativity** are included in the book \"Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body\". (Details are not provided in this source).\n\n**7. Resources for Accessing Protocols**\n\nThe sources frequently direct the listener to specific resources where detailed protocols are compiled.\n\n* The book \"**Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body**\" is available for pre-sale purchase. It covers protocols for everything from sleep to exercise to Stress Control, protocols related to focus and motivation, nutrition, oral and gut microbiome, and creativity. Within the book, you'll find the scientific basis that substantiates these protocols. The book is designed to be incredibly easy to use such that if you're suffering from a particular pain point in life, you can go to a specific chapter and protocol and begin to resolve that issue. The book is available by pre-sale at [**protocolsbook.com**](http://protocolsbook.com) where you can find links to various vendors.\n* The **neural network newsletter** is a zero-cost monthly newsletter. It includes podcast summaries as well as what are called **protocols** in the form of brief 1 to 3 page PDFs. These protocol PDFs cover topics like how to optimize your sleep, how to regulate/optimize dopamine, deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure, a foundational Fitness protocol (cardiovascular and resistance training with sets and reps), neuroplasticity, and learning. To subscribe, you simply **go to** [**hubermanlab.com**](http://hubermanlab.com)**, go to the menu tab, scroll down to newsletter, and provide your email**. Your email is not shared with anybody. You can see some example newsletters from months past by going to [hubermanlab.com](http://hubermanlab.com), menu tab, newsletter.\n* **Toolkits**, which are brief PDFs that list off the specific science-backed protocols, are available in the neural network newsletter for things like improving your sleep, improving focus, optimizing dopamine, deliberate cold exposure, and a complete summary of our fitness series.\n* You can find information and actionable protocols by **going to** [**hubermanlab.com**](http://hubermanlab.com) **webbsite and putting any topic of Interest or even several topics of Interest into the search function**, and it will take you to the very specific timestamps and other resources that provide information on those topics.\n* The **Huberman Lab Podcast has a clips channel** on YouTube. These are brief clips, anywhere from three to 10 minutes, that encompass single concepts and actionable protocols related to sleep, to focus, caffeine timing relative to sleep, alcohol timing relative to sleep, dopamine, serotonin, mental health, physical health, and on and on. You can find that easily by **going to YouTube and looking for Huberman Lab clips** in the search area.\n* An **AI tool is available at** [**ai.hubermanlab.com**](http://ai.hubermanlab.com) which can allow you to just pull the relevant information, just like you would a book. It is zero cost.\n\nThis compilation details the specific actionable steps and lists the various topics for which detailed protocols are stated in the sources as being available through the neural

        "body": "First off, thanks for taking the time to put this all together!\n\nFrom my perspective, Huberman's approach is grounded in neuroplasticity (not just in the cortex, but in the whole body) while offering practical tools to optimize focus, learning, and emotional well-being. He emphasizes that sleep is not just rest but a crucial element for cognitive function and mental health, which anyone who's had a rough night's sleep can attest to. Learning is not about passive repetition, but about engaging with material, managing stress, and focusing in ways that can change your brain structure or connectome.\n\nOn the nutrition front, he connects what we eat to how we feel and perform. Supplements like magnesium and Alpha GPC can improve sleep and cognitive function when used intentionally. He promotes a low-inflammatory diet and highlights the importance of the gut and oral microbiomes for overall brain health. It's clear that nutrition isn't just about fueling the body but supporting a larger system of mental and physical well-being.\n\nEnvironmental factors also play a significant role in health, and he regularly highlights how elements like light exposure, sleep temperature, and practices like cold or heat exposure affect brain function. It's not about comfort but about using these elements to optimize health. He ties mental health to social interaction and creativity, stressing how smoking or excessive drinking can negatively impact memory and cognition.",

    "body": "So most people on reddit are English speakers who come from the UK, North America, Australia and some people from Europe.\n\nYou also get quite a few people here from India, Pakistan and some countries in Asia. And there's a difference in their attitudes towards medicine. Which is what?\n\nWesterners are kind of conceited about their own medical culture. But modern western medicine has only been around (in its present form) for maybe a century.\n\nHow about some other cultures?\n\nAyurveda from India goes back thousands of years. Traditional Chinese medicine also goes back thousands of years. But try and suggest to most people that these systems have any inherent merit and you'll be met with polite (and not so polite) skepticism.\n\nBut they must have something going for them. Why? Because people are good at figuring things out. Even in the absence of microscopes and experiments, people can still figure out solid cause effect relationships.\n\nSo first, what are the strengths of western medicine?\n\n* Knowledge (to an incredible level of detail) about structure and function. \n\n* Imaging tech (MRI, Xray, ultrasound etc.)\n\n* Chemical medicines and antibiotics.\n\n* Dazzling array of surgical procedures.\n\nI could go on, but you get the idea.\n\nSo what's the weakness?\n\nIt has to do with time. How so?\n\nWestern medicine is reactive in character. Our whole thing is to wait until there's a problem and *then* do something about it. Western medicine is all about intervention... on a massive scale if need be. And what's the alternative?\n\nPre-emptive medicine. Which is what?\n\nAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nFor example?\n\nTake a look at how western medicine handles viral infections. We can know the exact structure of a virus. We know the entire replication cycle, receptors, proteins, polymerases etc. But we have barely a handful of medicines to treat a viral infection. Our answer has, for over a century, been *reactive in nature*.\n\nWe wait for an outbreak, and then react by developing a vaccine... if one can be developed. This response fits the Western Paradigm perfectly. Wait for the disease to occur, then wait for months or years for a treatment. The administration of a vaccine is pre-emptive. But the development is always reactive.\n\nThat's the Achilles Heel of Western medicine. \n\nBy comparison? What's the alternative?\n\nIf you take a pre-emptive approach, what's an example?\n\nYou can strengthen your immune system in a variety of ways *before* you ever get an infection. This is, in part, the TCM or Ayurvedic approach.\n\nWhen you take a look at how these systems work, that's what you notice. Western educated physicians might scoff at \"herbs and spices\" as medicine. But they're thinking \"reactively\".\n\nIf you look at a list of some TCM or Ayurvedic compounds, you'll find out they do contain biologically active compounds. And the more you learn, the more you notice the same names that show up over and over again.\n\nQuercitin, apigenin, a range of terpenes and terpenoids, kaempherol, quinones, saponins and organo-sulphur compounds. And when you look at hard core western scientific research into these compounds, the same properties keep coming up over and over again.\n\nAntimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, anti-oxidant... and very low levels of cytotoxicity.\n\nSo the whole idea is to make these substances a part of your immune system by adding them to your diet in a pre-emptive way. The analogy is that an infection is like a fire in your house.\n\nThe Western approach is like waiting until a couple of rooms are burning... and then you call the fire department (ie. massive reactive intervention)\n\nThe older, \"Eastern\" approach is like having a guy with a bucket of water waiting around to put out the first little flame just as it's getting started (minimal, pre-emptive intervention)\n\nWhen you live healthy and use ancient knowledge to pre-emptively reinforce your immune system, you have less problems to begin with and (when you do get sick) it's briefer and not as severe.\n\nWhat would you prefer?\n\nThe best Western medicine money can buy to treat your high blood pressure, arthritis, stroke or influenza?\n\nOr to head these problems off before they become problems... years ahead of time? (safely, cheaply and effectively)\n\nSo, premise tldr: Western Medicine's weakness lies in its *reactive character and reliance on intervention* (often traumatic or toxic) after problems occur.",

They are bent on observable reality. Things to do with the flesh. \n\nIt's amazing the lack of research that goes into the placebo effect, I presume at least. I'm a medical student and the money they put into these things, machines and surgery and salary. It's a perpetuating system, self reinforcing. We're held up to each other's standards. Consequently, it can turn into a sort of Plato's allegory in the cave thing. We're mesmerized, occupied, beffudled with the shadows.\n\nThere is a greater energetic reality. I have experience with it. I could become trained more.\n\nAllopathic healing has its use though. It must. I wonder what it can do that Eastern styles don't have the ability to. I guess they can't go in and resect stuff. They have pain medications that cease excruciating pain, to allow something to be done(surprise surprise, before my own appendectomy operation, I got to ask the anesthrtist a question. \"So, how exactly do these drugs work?\" Expecting some molecules going through a membrane, instead, she goes, \"yeah, we don't know\". As if she's been asked the question a million times, and there isn't much more she can tell me.)\n\nReductive reasoning, that is the same conclusion I've come to. Burrowing into the details, you're convinced the gold is in there. If only, this one thing! This golden molecule. I will find it, I will find it. It will cure all tbings. We're gonna get mkney. This will make everything easier. Then I'll do experiments about it. Hold it up to scientific scrutiny. Going through rigorous trials, then it might be on the market. That would be one's contribution to the world. But what if it's a dead end? What if one were to contemplate the truth that is on your blind side, your yang side..  greater realities. \n\nStill, the usefulness is in the merging of the two. Somehow, finding answers from both of them. They're filled with Love all the same. It's just different considerations taken into account. \n\nI feel doctors become convinced what they're doing is the truth. Or at least their way to help. And after 30 years of having it pummeled into your head, effectiveness, efficacy and the like, it's easy to become lost. Confused, about what's on the other side. Likewise, it's entertaining to think of people on the East side getting fed up with the woo wah. The two must meet. For the whole.",

But the fact is your case will be individual and whatever random redditors tell you whenever you ask if a supplement will be good for you is not going to be useful because you must trial the supplement yourself do your own research and see how it affects you personally.\n\nRant over just please try using the search bar before you ask simple questions.  Also, please stop upvoting these posts that do not provide any valuable discussion and ask easily answered questions or rate my stack post. Thanks\n\nEdit: I'm sincerely sorry if anyone felt I was personally attacking them with this, but I wasn't and it doesn't really do anything productive to victimize yourself. Instead offer better solutions. I don't think allowing this site to become quora is the right pathway, but that's just me.

    "body": "Hello guys, I'm new here but not new to the brain fog. I've been battling brain fog since 10 years without any success until now. I'm not a native english speaker, so excuse me if I make some mistakes but I wanted to share what worked for me.\n\nMy symptoms were:\n\n\\- inability to focus\n\n\\- extremely slow processing speed when reading, listening, studying\n\n\\- not remembering the right word to say, it's like it's stuck in my tongue and I can't find it\n\n\\- anxiety\n\n\\- lack of motivation\n\n\\- always having to re-read every sentence because I can't understand the meaning on the first try\n\n\\- constant and extreme fatigue\n\n\\- depression\n\n\\- short term memory problems\n\n\\- forgetfulness\n\nWhat I tried to cure it without success:\n\n\\- Supplements (I tried a lot of them.....anti fungals, anti worms, anti parasites, omega 3, vitamin b complex (both methylated and not), vitamin c, vitamin d, vitamin k2, iron, zinc, bioavailable copper, selenium, NAC, resveratrol, apigenin, luteolin, curcumin, Huperzine A, Alpha GPC, prebiotics, probiotics, creatine, l-glutamine and many many others). I didn't notice any success.\n\n\\- Hormonal therapies: tried testosterone, DHEA, pregnenolone and other compounds without effects for my brain fog.\n\n\\- Gut cleansing with edema and hydrotherapy.\n\n\\- Blood analysis including for blood glucose, Cholesterol and all the other common ones (all were normal)\n\n\\- Physical exercise\n\n\\- Meditation (I even went on a retreat in Thailand)\n\n\\- Eliminating all toxic and changing house thinking there may have been some hidden toxic mold\n\n\\- Heavy metals chelation\n\n\\- Sleeping 12 hours per day and changing mattress\n\n\\- Excluding all kind of technology from my life\n\n\\- Taking a gap year to reduce my stress to zero\n\n\\- Sleep study to verify if I had sleep apnea.\n\n\\- Nose surgery to make sure there was enough air coming in to supply oxygen to my brain\n\n\\- Massages and chiropractic sessions\n\n\\- Drinking 10 coffee per day\n\n\\- Antidepressants\n\n\\- Cognitive therapy with psychologists and hypnosis\n\n\\- And many others that I'm not gonna list or this post would be extremely long.\n\nIf you noticed that one thing is missing on the list you are right: it's the diet. I was always a picky eater, disliked many foods and ate unhealthy foods and didn't believe foods could have an impact on my brain fog. I thought it was just some woo woo bullshit preached by functional doctors and my GP actually agreed with that. I refused to believe foods caused my brain fog and actually I didn't want to change my diet because tasty (but unhealthy) foods were the only things that kept me sane during all this. Moreover if all my friends could eat the same foods I ate without experiencing symptoms, why would I experience them? If foods were a problem it should have been for everybody not just for me. It didn't make sense to me on a logical level (and still doesn't tbh). \n\nUnfortunately after everything else failed and seeing more and more people mentioning foods as the culprit and how they healed I decided to try it because my life was such a mess. I lost all jobs, lost my girlfriend, couldn't grasp the meaning of simple sentences anymore without re-reading them multiple times, couldn't find the words to make a coherent sentence ecc. Basically I was suicidal and there was nothing else to do. I also developed other problems including chronic migraines, severe joint pain, restless leg syndrome and others.\n\nInitially I only took gluten out of my diet because it was the ingredient people mentioned the most as the culprit and I already thought that was incredibly hard since gluten is pretty much in all the foods I ate back then. Cutting gluten from my diet was the first thing that helped me somewhat get better and I saw the effects pretty soon, like in less than a week. But my brain fog was still there. I just replaced junk gluten containing foods, with junk gluten free foods. Since I got better I knew I was onto something and so I decided to start eating many healthy foods like lots of vegetables, avocado, berries, nuts, wild caught salmon, green tea ecc....my brain fog and all other symptoms got increasingly better after a few days but there was still some brain fog there.\n\nIn the end I decided to cut all unhealthy or deemed inflammatory foods from my diet and see if I could further improve. So other than gluten I cut dairy, eggs, all sort of sugar, soy, all grains, nightshade vegetables, processed meat, red meat and generally all processed foods....all the while eating healthy foods. What an effect! In just 10 days my brain fog evaporated for the first time in 10 year. I have so much energy, I can concentrate on things, I don't need to re-read sentences to understand the meaning, my processing speed greatly improved and my motivation skyrocketed. My anxiety (which I thought was a genetic trait) also greatly diminished. I feel like a new person and can't believe the effect it had on me.\n\nAs a side note, I also exercise 6x per week and practice meditation 3x per week but I used to do these things before while eating an unhealthy diet and they didn't improve my condition at all. I think they do have a synergistic effect but only with a very healthy diet.\n\nSame thing can be said for supplements, many of them are probably beneficial but I couldn't feel anything because my diet was bad and so they couldn't work in that condition.\n\nI hope this help some of you curing your brain fog. I personally believe that at least 90% of cases of brain fog are related to diet. It's tough to change and give up confort food and eating bland and unappealing foods but that's the only thing that cured me and pretty fast too. I lost 10 years of my life battling brain fog, it caused so many problems and failures in my life but finally I can look at the future with optimism.\n\nI don't know if I can add back those foods in the future, I looked online about people who experienced the same effects and many did add many of the foods back except maybe gluten. Right now I prefer not to risk it for a while but I will definitely try to add some of them back in the future even though now that I know the importance of a healthy diet I don't desire to eat junk food anymore.\n\nI decided to share it so you too have an opportunity to heal and take back your life. Just remember to be strict with the diet. Cheating, even in minimal amount, can compromise your healing. If you are serious about getting rid of your brain fog you have to commit with the diet 100%.",

And since we already have this brain fog, even a bit of inflammation that is easily dealt with in healthy people can be detrimental for us and can seriously impair our recovery.

Cheers.\n\nI honestly have found great help when i started taking Omega 3 in a daily basis, Vitamin B1 B6 B12, enough zinc, magnesium and Vitamin D.\n\nPS : for those who also want to increase their testosterone, improving your mood and lowering Cortisol greatly helps.\n\n# Stress Reduction\n\nOur bodies release cortisol when stressed. **Cortisol decreases serotonin levels in the body**, by increasing serotonin reuptake. Too much cortisol can increase your risk of developing mental health disorders. That is why **reducing mental stress can help balance cortisol levels and increase serotonin**\n\nMany of the lifestyle changes below can be used to decrease stress.\n\n# Mood Improvement\n\nSerotonin impacts our mood, but mood also affects serotonin production. Studies using brain imaging (PET), showed that **brains of people who are happy produce more serotonin** than brains of people who are sad\n\nTherefore, engaging in activities and doing things that make you happier can help boost serotonin production.\n\nIn addition, studies show that social interactions also influence serotonin levels. Spend more time with people who make you feel good in general\n\n# Exercise\n\nFatigue, as a result of exercise, increases the amount of tryptophan that can cross the blood-brain barrier (by decreasing BCAA levels) and thereby boosts serotonin production. Psychological benefits of physical exercise can be more readily achieved with consistent aerobic exercise training\n\nMice that ran on treadmills had higher levels of serotonin compared to mice that remained inactive. Brain tryptophan remained high even after exercise\n\n# Getting More Sun\n\nIt has been long known that bright light helps treat seasonal depression. But several studies suggest that light is also an effective treatment for other forms of depression\n\n**People have higher serotonin levels in the summer compared to winter**\n\nIn fact, our modern way of life, in which we spend a lot of time indoors, may be depleting our serotonin levels, thereby making us more vulnerable to mood disorders\n\nPioneer studies suggest that **our skin may produce serotonin when exposed to sunlight**\n\nIn addition, **you need vitamin D to produce serotonin**, and sun to produce vitamin D\n\nTherefore, going outside and spending more time in the sun on a regular basis is a great way to boost your serotonin levels.\n\n# Yoga and Meditation\n\nA review of over 200 peer-reviewed RCTs, clinical trials, and meta-analyses studying complementary and alternative medicine suggest that **yoga and meditation may help uplift mood and improve symptoms of mild, moderate, and treatment-resistant depression**\n\nIn fact, meditation activates many parts of the brain important for understanding the self, emotions, problem-solving, adaptability, and increasing awareness. Serotonin plays a role in wakefulness, along with other **neurotransmitters, which are all raised in meditators**\n\nThirty minutes of yoga and breathing exercises improved mood in a study of 71 healthy adults\n\n# Psychotherapy\n\nPsychotherapy or counseling may change brain chemistry and even increase serotonin activity (by increasing serotonin receptors). In a (DB-RCT) study of 23 patients with depression who participated in psychotherapy for 4 months, **therapy significantly increased serotonin activity and improved symptoms of depression**\n\n# Eat to Increase Serotonin\n\nTryptophan is the amino acid building block for serotonin. Tryptophan is not produced by the body, so it must be taken in through diet.\n\nCurrent research shows that unlike purified tryptophan, **consuming tryptophan-rich foods does not necessarily increase brain serotonin**. That’s because tryptophan-rich foods, such as meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables, also contain many other amino acids. Tryptophan has to compete with these other amino acids for transport across the blood-brain barrier\n\nOn the other hand, lack of dietary tryptophan (compared to other amino acids) may lead to lower blood and brain tryptophan levels, decreasing serotonin production. **Increased BCAAs also lower tryptophan and serotonin**, as well as dopamine in the brain. This may be especially problematic for people who take protein powders to enhance exercise performance\n\n# Carbs\n\n**Consuming carbs increases serotonin levels** by increasing the transport of tryptophan into the brain\n\nHowever, you should use other methods to boost your serotonin, as increasing carbs in your diet can have a plethora of negative effects.\n\n# which Supplements can Increase Serotonin?\n\n# L-Tryptophan and 5-HTP\n\nIn the body, L-tryptophan is used to make 5-HTP from which serotonin is made. Taking L-tryptophan may raise plasma serotonin, improving cognitive, motor, or gut issues in those who are deficient\n\nA protein called **alpha-Lactalbumin** from milk contains more tryptophan than many other proteins. In a (DB-RCT) study of 18 inpiduals, 12 grams of alpha-Lactalbumin increased the amount of tryptophan in blood plasma by 16% after 90 minutes\n\nIn another (DB-RCT) study, 12.32 grams of tryptophan increased blood tryptophan by 43% after 1.5 hours and improved memory in 23 subjects vulnerable to high stress\n\nIn a pilot study of 13 female patients experiencing premenstrual syndrome (PMS), 6 grams of L-tryptophan taken daily for 14 days improved mood, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and carbohydrate craving\n\nTryptophan can be purchased in the form of L-tryptophan supplements. 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) supplements are also available. It is important to note that 5-HTP is not the same as 5-HT, which is the chemical name for serotonin. 5-HTP freely crosses the blood-brain barrier (serotonin itself does not) to be converted into serotonin\n\n# Probiotics\n\nIn the digestive tract, **probiotics restore the gut microbiome** and influence the gut-brain axis. Gut bacteria are important because they can produce tryptophan, from which serotonin is made. Many mental health disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, are linked to less perse or fewer gut bacteria\n\nIn a study (DB-RTC), an 8-week probiotic regimen (2.0 x 109 CFU/g of *Lactobacillus helveticus* and 2.0 x 109 CFU/g of *Bifidobacterium longum*) increased tryptophan levels in 110 inpiduals with depression. Increased tryptophan can increase serotonin production\n\nA probiotic (*Bifidobacteria infantis*) given to rats for 14 days raised levels of blood tryptophan\n\n# Vitamin D\n\n**Vitamin D helps the body make, release, and use serotonin in the brain**. Vitamin D activates an enzyme that converts tryptophan into serotonin. If vitamin D levels are low, our brains make less serotonin. Thus, increasing vitamin D intake increases serotonin levels, reducing the risk of mental health disorders\n\nA cohort study of over 9K subjects demonstrated that taking vitamin D supplements during the first year of life was correlated with a 77% reduced risk of schizophrenia. In other words, **preventing low vitamin D levels early in life may reduce the chance of having schizophrenia later in life**\n\n# Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n\nWhile vitamin D helps neurons make serotonin, the omega-3 fatty acids, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), **help neurons release serotonin** and improve its activity (increasing serotonin receptor sensitivity). Fish, such as salmon or trout, are high in omega-3 fatty acids. The omega 3 fatty acid supplements are also sold as fish oil capsules\n\nInadequate omega-3 fatty acids intake may increase susceptibility to psychiatric illnesses, including depression\n\nIn a (DB-RCT) study of 49 patients that repeatedly self-harm themselves, 1.2 grams of EPA and 0.9 grams of DHA capsules daily for 12 weeks reduced suicidal thinking by 45% and depression by 30%\n\nAn observational study of 256,118 Japanese participants, discovered that people who ate fish daily had lower rates of suicidal thoughts compared to people who did not eat fish daily. In another observational study of 1,767 Finnish subjects, consuming fish less than twice a week was associated with a higher risk of depression and suicidal thinking\n\nIn rats, low levels of omega-3 fatty acids (specifically alpha linoleic acid) are associated with lower serotonin activity, while DHA deficiency reduces brain serotonin in piglets\n\n**Reduced intake of both EPA and DHA** by pregnant rats resulted in less production, storage, release, and activity (receptor function) of serotonin in the brains of their offspring. Serotonin was not only reduced in the mothers’ brains but also its availability and production were reduced by (65% and 29%, respectively) in the brains of newborn rats\n\n# St. John’s Wort\n\nSt. John’s Wort is a popular medicinal plant (*Hypericum perforatum*) used as an antidepressant for mild depression.\n\nThe plant **increases serotonin in animals, similar to typical antidepressants**, but with fewer side effects\n\nIn a review (of 35 studies) of 6,993 patients with depression, St. John’s Wort standalone therapy improved mild to moderate symptoms as well as antidepressants and better than placebo. The typical dose is 300 mg of the extract 3 times per day for at least 4 weeks\n\n# S-Adenosyl Methionine (SAMe)\n\nSAMe is needed to produce serotonin\n\nIt is a naturally occurring compound that plays a role in methylation, energy breakdown and may help patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who are not responding to conventional, synthetic antidepressants\n\nIn a (DB-RCT) study involving 73 MDD inpiduals unresponsive to drug therapy, **800 mg twice a day improved symptoms of depression** compared to the placebo\n\nIn a (DB-RCT) study of 144 inpiduals with MDD, **1,600 – 3,200 mg of SAMe daily** for 12 weeks significantly improved mood\n\nA review of 132 studies (115 CT and 17 preclinical) concluded **that SAMe can be useful not just for depression**, but for an array of mental health disorders, such as substance abuse and psychosis\n\n# Vitamin B\n\nLack of vitamin B may be associated with the onset of mental health disorders. The body needs Vitamin B6 to make neurotransmitters like serotonin from 5-HTP (Vitamin B acts as enzyme cofactor)\n\nVitamin B12 and folate (vitamin B9) are necessary for the folate cycle, which helps convert tryptophan into serotonin (by producing and recycling essential co-factors)\n\nIn a cohort study of 549 community-dwelling seniors, those with low vitamin B12 and B9 blood levels were more likely to have irreversible problems with cognition (memory, attention, and thought)\n\nIn Rhesus monkeys, a single dose of vitamin B6 increased serotonin production in the brain\n\nIn addition, treatment of healthy adult rats with a vitamin B mixture raised serotonin levels in the brain\n\n# Vitamin C\n\nVitamin C supplements over a period of 6 weeks increased brain serotonin levels in rats with drug-induced dementia\n\n# Vitamin E\n\nVitamin E supplementation for 8 weeks increased serotonin in rats suffering from spinal cord injury\n\n# Zinc\n\nZinc can target and activate serotonin receptors\n\nIn a meta-analysis of 17 observational studies, **blood zinc levels were lower in depressed inpiduals** compared to non-depressed inpiduals\n\nIn a study (DB-RCT), 25 mg of elemental zinc supplements daily for 12 weeks reduced depressive symptoms in a study of 37 patients with major depressive disorder\n\nZinc can be increased through diet in foods such as red meat, oysters, and whole grains\n\n# Magnesium\n\nMagnesium supplements increase serotonin levels by increasing its availability (reducing reuptake) in the brain. In a (DB-RCT) study, 500 mg of magnesium per day for 8 weeks significantly improved symptoms in 60 patients diagnosed with mild to moderate depression\n\nMagnesium is found in green leafy vegetables, nuts, and legumes\n\n# Inositol\n\nInositol increases the sensitivity of serotonin receptors\n\nIn one study of 30 women with a PMS mood disorder, myo-inositol reduced symptoms and improved mood given over 6 menstrual cycles\n\nInositol decreases depression in rats by binding serotonin receptors\n\n# Turmeric\n\nCurcumin is the active component of turmeric. In stressed rats, **curcumin extended the length of time serotonin stays active in the brain** (by blocking the reuptake of serotonin). It also improved cognition and reduced serum corticosterone, a cortisol equivalent, in rats\n\nIn mice, a single dose of curcumin (10 – 80 mg/kg) increased serotonin levels\n\n# Velvet Bean\n\n*Mucuna* *pruriens*, known as the velvet bean, combats Parkinson’s disease better than the standard treatment (levodopa) in rats. In addition to being a source of dopamine, the long-term use of the powder form of *Mucuna pruriens* also **restored serotonin levels in rat brains**\n\n# L-Theanine\n\nL-theanine, an amino acid found in tea leaves (e.g. green, black, or oolong tea) and Bay Bolete mushrooms, has relaxing effects on the mind. **Green tea has the highest concentration of L-theanine**\n\nIn a cohort study of over 42K Japanese inpiduals, those who consumed at least 5 cups of green tea a day experiences less psychological distress that is often associated with reduced serotonin\n\nIn rat studies, L-theanine raised serotonin levels in the brain\n\n# Rhodiola\n\n*Rhodiola rosea* is a flowering plant that may help improve anxiety and depression. In a (DB-RCT) clinical trial of 89 patients with mild to moderate depression and low serotonin, *Rhodiola rosea* extracts (340 mg/day and 680 mg/day) for 42 days i**mproved overall depression, including** **insomnia and emotional instability**\n\nIn 70 depressive rats suffering from chronic mild stress and serotonin deficiency, Rhodiola extract (1.5, 3, or 6g/kg) for 3 weeks **restored normal levels of serotonin**\n\n# Saffron\n\n**Safranal, one of the main active components of saffron** (*Crocus sativus*), increases serotonin availability in the brain (by blocking reuptake)\n\nA meta-analysis (5 RCTs) of 177 participants concluded that **30 mg per day of saffron capsules** can improve symptoms of depression in adults with major depressive disorder within 6 to 8 weeks\n\n# Psychedelics\n\nPsychedelics are hallucinogenic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin mushrooms. **Psychedelics can stimulate serotonin activity** (by directly binding to serotonergic receptors and also increasing their number), raise serotonin levels, and reduce its breakdown\n\nIn a recent pilot study (DB-RCT) of 12 patients with anxiety, 200 μg of LSD significantly reduced self-reported anxiety. LSD was given in a **safe psychotherapeutic environment with medical supervision** to avoid side effects\n\nIn a (DB-RCT) study of 17 healthy inpiduals, psilocybin (215 micrograms/kg) enhanced mood, increased goal-directed behavior and decreased recognition of negative facial expressions\n\nThough psychedelics can activate serotonin signaling, unsupervised use may lead to serious psychological consequences. Certain plant hallucinogens, as well as synthetic hallucinogens, can be especially toxic. Using this substance should be under professional supervision.\n\n# Magnolia Tree\n\nThe bark and seed cones of the Magnolia tree (*Magnolia officinalis*) appear to have anti-stress, anti-anxiety, and antidepressant effects\n\n20 and 40 mg/kg of honokiol and magnolol, the main components of *Magnolia officinalis*, **restored low levels of serotonin** in rats with chronic mild stress\n\nMagnolia bark and ginger rhizome are commonly used to treat mental disorders in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). 30 mg/kg of a **magnolia bark and ginger rhizome mixture increased serotonin in the brains** of depressed mice\n\n# Essential Oils\n\nEssential oils are commonly used to reduce anxiety, stress, low mood, and other mental health disorders. Smelling the essential oils (inhalation) can **activate pathways in the brain to boost serotonin and dopamine production**\n\nIn a study of aromatherapy in 60 elderly patients with depression (RCT), **5 ml of essential oil mixture** (containing lavender, sweet orange, bergamot, and almond oil) increased serotonin levels after application two times a week for 8 weeks\n\n**Ylang-ylang** essential oils increased serotonin levels in mice brains (hippocampus)\n\n**Bitter orange** is an essential oil that reduced anxiety and improved mood by boosting serotonin activity in mice after 14 days of use\n\n**Lavender oil** blocked the breakdown/reuptake of serotonin in cell studies\n\n# Valerian\n\nThe root of the Valerian plant **increases serotonin levels and activity** (by decreasing its turnover)\n\nValerian may help with irritable bowel syndrome. In a rat study, components of the Valeriani root balanced overactive serotonin in the gut (colon) and serum\n\n*Valeriana officinalis* root extract **prevented the breakdown of serotonin** in mice exposed to stress\n\n# Apigenin\n\n**Apigenin is a nutrient in citrus fruits** that may improve cognition and behavior as well as symptoms of depression and stress\n\nIn mouse models, 20-day treatment with apigenin (10 and 20 mg/kg) **increased serotonin levels, and decreased anxious behavior**\n\nApigenin was able to **reduce the impact of chronic mild stress in rats by increasing serotonin** availability and reducing its breakdown\n\n# Berberine\n\nBerberine is a salt derived from plants in the *Berberis* family (the roots, rhizomes, stems, and barks), including **barberry, tree turmeric, Oregon-grape**, and others. It blocks the enzyme MAO-A, which breaks down serotonin, thereby **raising serotonin levels**\n\nA single berberine dose increased levels of serotonin by 47% in the brains of depressed mice. Long-term treatment with berberine (5 mg/kg for 15 days) increased serotonin by 19%\n\nMice given berberine in a different study had increased serotonin levels in regions of the brain (hippocampus and frontal cortex) important for memory and mood\n\n# Acetyl-L-Carnitine\n\n**Carnitine may increase serotonin** in the cerebral cortex, a region of the brain involved in **cognition and memory**\n\nAcetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) is a modified form of carnitine, a common dietary supplement sold in health food stores. ALCAR protects the brain and may help with depression. In mice, it increased levels of serotonin in the brain when given daily for 25 days\n\n# Lithium\n\nLithium has long been used in the treatment of mental disorders such as bipolar disorder. It works by increasing serotonin activity in the brain\n\n# Physical Treatments that Increase Serotonin\n\n# Neurofeedback\n\nNeurofeedback allows inpiduals to consciously **change their brain activity** (EEG waves) and therefore modify their behavior and cognition. Some of its clinical uses are for migraines, ADHD, and PTSD\n\nIn a study (RCT), neurofeedback (30 minutes, 5 sessions weekly, 4 weeks) was applied to 40 patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS patients have lower serotonin and widespread pain in their muscles and bones. After 2 weeks, patients experienced less pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression\n\n# Massage\n\n**Massage therapy decreased cortisol and raised serotonin** and dopamine in a broad population with stress-related health problems in 3 studies\n\nIn one (RCT) study, 24 adults with low back pain were either given two 30 minute massages per week or subjected to standard relaxation procedures over the span of 5 weeks. Urine **serotonin levels were higher in inpiduals who received massage therapy**\n\n# Acupuncture\n\nIn a randomized clinical trial, 75 women with fibromyalgia, acupuncture increased levels of serotonin in the serum, compared to placebo\n\nIn rats, acupuncture-like stimulation increased serotonin activity in certain regions of the brain\n\n# Light Therapy\n\nWhen sun exposure is not possible, bright light therapy can help increase serotonin levels\n\nBright light therapy (photobiomodulation) shows promising results for depression based on clinical trials\n\nIn a study of 10 women with chronic headaches (observational), 34 seconds daily use of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) significantly **increased serotonin levels after just 3 days**\n\nIn a study of 25 drug-free hospitalized veterans with depression or bipolar disorder, **bright white light improved depressive symptoms**. However, further testing needs to be done on the negative consequences of long-term light treatment\n\n# Vagus Nerve Stimulation\n\nLong-term vagus nerve stimulation (14 days) **increased serotonin levels** in rat brains\n\nIn rats, sustained vagus nerve stimulation for 14 days also **increased the action of serotonin**\n\n# Testing Serotonin\n\nSerotonin that gets released into the blood gets rapidly broken down in the liver and lungs, to inactive metabolites (such as 5-HIAA) that are excreted in urine . That is why normally, blood and urine contain very small amounts of serotonin. Larger quantities of serotonin in the blood/urine can be found in people with serotonin-producing tumors (carcinoid tumors).\n\n**Beware of the use of urine serotonin levels to check for “neurotransmitter imbalances”.** While the companies providing these tests state that the levels in urine correspond to brain neurotransmitter levels, science has repeatedly shown that this is not the case\n\nSerotonin doesn’t cross the blood-brain barrier. Even if it did, it is released intermittently and influenced by many different stimuli. Furthermore, levels differ within different parts of the brain. And finally, values differ for the same person from one day to another\n\n**In addition, companies have been known to intentionally use extremely narrow ranges, without any scientific support whatsoever, in order to sell supplements to their clients**\n\nIf you do have neurotransmitter imbalances in the brain, more reliable tests of serotonin levels are cerebrospinal fluid tests or measurements of serotonin in blood platelets\n\nA PET scan is the only direct way to detect changes of serotonin production in specific areas of the brain\n\nSerotonin Risks and Safety\n\nExcess serotonin may result in **serotonin syndrome**, which can be fatal. Usually, though, serotonin syndrome is a result of drug interactions. No cases have been observed just from safe, natural approaches\n\n**MDMA, LSD, and other synthetic drugs** may cause serotonin syndrome, and should not be taken without medical supervision or outside a psychotherapeutic environment\n\nMost of the studies mentioned above were performed on adults. More research involving children is needed in order to determine safety.\n\nAbnormally heightened levels of serotonin (hyperserotonemia) is a consistent finding in inpiduals with autism. Pregnant women with hyperserotonemia are more likely to give birth to children with autism\n\n# Drug Interactions\n\nThe use of **St. John’s Wort, SAMe, or lithium** simultaneously with serotonergic drugs like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-I), and triptans, can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a life-threatening and potentially fatal condition\n\n# Limitations and Caveats\n\nSome of these studies **have fairly small sample sizes**. Additionally, many of these natural methods of increasing serotonin in the body **have only been tested in animals** and need further research in humans through clinical trials.\n\nIn addition to the concentration of serotonin, both the number of serotonin receptors and their sensitivity may also play an integral role in determining serotonin activity.\n\nThough serotonin is mostly made, stored, and released in the gut, serotonin acts as an important neurotransmitter in the brain. Some of these natural remedies and supplements need further testing to determine if they are able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Long-term application of these remedies should also be further studied.",

    "body": "PPMS diagnosed a year ago after constantly worsening and received Ocrevus treatment.\n\nI cut my EDSS from initially 4.0 to now 1.5. My MS is invisible now.\n\nMy initial prognosis was 6 years to cane. Now my theoretical prognosis is 25+ years to cane.\n\nLast MRI showed that most lesions improved significantly and some lesion completely disappeared.([https://postimg.cc/jnxFb0LN](https://postimg.cc/jnxFb0LN))  I have over 2 dozen lesions and was diagnosed with PPMS as I never had a clinical significant relapse.\n\nAfter being diagnosed I took a deep dive into studies and came up with what appears to work for me.\n\nMy 3 pillars are :\n\nPillar 1 : Medicine\n\nPillar 2 : Weight Control, Metabolic Health, Food\n\nPillar 3 : Supplements\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPillar 1 is simple. Take the medicine your doctor thinks is best for you.\n\nPillar 2 : Weight Control\n\nMS is closely linked to the metabolic system. Overweight might worsen long term progression through low constant inflammation.\n\nOcrevus is underdosed, as shown in their study, only BMI<25 significantly benefited from reduced progression. ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469695/figure/Fig2/?report=objectonly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469695/figure/Fig2/?report=objectonly))\n\nI stopped eating meat and replaced it with fish. I do not drink milk, but don’t always avoid milk derivates like cheese or deserts. To loose my extra 20+ kg (45+ lbs) I did some longer water fasts and OMAD. I do not drink alcohol, mainly because I gain weight. Smoking will speed up progression.\n\nPillar 3 : Supplements\n\nFor an insidious slowly progressive disease it's hard to evaluate if a medicine or supplement helps. Simply put, each trial needs years to figure out if it will make any difference.\n\nI am not recommending this as a treatment, I simply do not have enough time to trial each compound individually to see if it helps meanwhile I loose step by step all my mobility. „Hit hard and hit fast“ is the best strategy for multiple sclerosis as confirmed by science.\n\nSupplements I have been taking :\n\nNicotinamide riboside\n\nCholine CDP (Citicoline)\n\nUrsolic Acid (potentially remyelinating)\n\nNA-R-Alpha Lipoic\n\nOmega 3\n\nN-acetyl Cysteine (NAC)\n\nFlavonoids (Luteolin, Baicalein, Quercetin, Apigenin, Fisetin) Liposomal\n\nBoswellin Lipsomal & Boswellic Liposmal (frankincense)\n\nHericium Erinaceus (Lions Mane)\n\nReishi\n\nBacopa monnieri\n\nGrape Seed Extract (OPC clinical strength)\n\nVitamin D+K2, Q10, (I also take B Complex, B12, Biotin, Metafolin, Magnesium)\n\nCreatine HCL\n\nCurcumin & broad extract Curcuma\n\nL-Theanine\n\nHymecromone (inflammatory hyaluronic acid inhibitor, OTC in Europe)\n\nN-Acetylglucosamine 4g 1-1-1-1 (total 16g/day)\n\nI still have a serious tremor, that I am able to control extremely well with high dose of Sensoril Ashwagandha. It is not noticeable most of the time.\n\nGoing forward, I strongly feel peptides may help my remyelination process. I still have mild cognitive impairment and want to get back to the best version of me.\n\nIt works for me, so I am happy.\n\n**edit 27.11.2023:**\n\n**added N-Acetylglucosamine 4g 1-1-1-1 (total 16g/day)**",

It‘s a derivate of Cumarin (in Cinnamon, grass, etc) and has been sitting on the shelf for 40 years with the idea it is low bioavailability and of few use.\n\nCOVID patients taking Hymecromone had a very significant reabsorption of lesions (!) and it reduces lung hyaluronic acid in humans. \n\nHumans have high molecular weight and low molecular weight hyaluronic acid. The low molecular weight is produced in the lungs, where the innate immune system is. In many diseases low molecular weight hyaluronic acid is increased which aggravates inflammation and often diseases.\n\nIn mice Hymecromone stops EAE completely (!) and clinical score of disability reduces.\n\nMain side effect that tiny portion of patients have is unacceptable diarrhea. I started Hymecromone at 1-1-1 for 2 weeks and once I saw no side effects increased.\n\nI am not a doctor. This is based on research. Please ask your doctor and/or read the studies.",

I would do anything to avoid progression and ending in a wheelchair.\n\nI have done initially MS Hope diet, but it was too difficult to adhere. Later switched to Overcoming MS diet and then kept relaxing it. In my household everyone is vegan, so it was easy to cut the meat, and we agreed at home that fish is healthy. Diets work for some and others not.\n\nThe common denominator in my opinion is the metabolic health. If your IL-6 is constantly high because of overweight, chances are your progression might go faster.\n\nSupplements work a little different for each person I guess. Also it's important to look at the details.\n\nI use Ashwagandha mainly for my tremor. Standard Ashwagandha does not help me, but concentrated, standardized Sensoril extract helps. Choline is not helping me, but Choline CDP (a combination of Choline and Uridine that helps transport Choline into the brain) is neuroprotective and increases neurogenesis according to studies.\n\nAt some point, my Leptin value was so low that I considered reducing some of the supplements in a quest to raise my Leptin level as I wanted to loose weight. Leptin  in blood informs the body how much body fat there is to use. Low Leptin = Body thinks low body fat exists. But my initially thinking was wrong (!). I lost the weight later with fasting (Leptin was not important to loose weight afterall) and Leptin is an inflammatory factor, so for us low Leptin is actually good - which brings us back to Metabolic health.\n\nThere is no supplement that really caused me any issues.

        "body": "The article about oxidative stress and migraines was paradigm changing for me. I keep thinking about his theory. For me the migraines went haywire about the same time I developed all of the other ms symptoms , for me they're definitely connected. What if my brain tries to repair some of the damage ms has done by giving me migraines? Food for thought. \n\nMoringa leaves capsules: yeah, that can work the same. Minimal dose is 2 grams I just read. I also take citicholine, so uridine is useless then? In the mr happy stack they use both uridine and choline together. \n\nI think you make a great point about deficiencies. In studies some people get great benefits from a substance and other people get no benefits. Maybe the substance relieves a deficiency, or maybe some people need higher doses of certain substances because of genetic differences. I have had great results from the b12 injections (not the pills). But I can't absorb b12 very well and was deficient for years. B12 is very important for myelin formation. But if you don't have b12 deficiency, taking extra b12 might not work at all.  This is why it's best to do some bloodwork, to know what's going on in your body and what it needs. I for sure had/have alot of deficiencies, despite eating a very healthy wholefoods diet. I think I don't absorb the nutrients very well, that's another thing to investigate and solve. \n\nThx for the indepth info about peptides, that's uncharted territory for me at the moment.",

    "body": "After my recent posts about [recovering from PEM](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1k271r7/the_best_evidence_for_long_covid_no_more_pem/), [fixing my shortness of breath (mostly)](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1jdbmvd/this_9step_protocol_fixed_my_shortness_of_breath/), and the [dozens of different treatments I've tried](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1jb6xdg/ive_tried_25_treatments_for_long_covid_heres_what/) rated by effectiveness... I've received a lot of questions about my exact \"supplement protocol\".\n\nFor context, I've been dealing with long covid for 18+ months. After 6 months of hoping & praying for a recovery, but getting nowhere - I began rigorously researching & testing treatments to get my health back. Lots of discoveries were made between month 8-14, and the last months have been spent removing unnecessary things & refining my stack. I've been working out in the gym 5+ days a week for about 4-6 months now. Seeing consistent improvements, and even hitting new personal records this past week, out-lifting pre-covid 2023 me. Hope this helps.\n\n*Disclaimer: This is purely my personal experience, for entertainment purposes & should not be construed as medical advice.*\n\n\\---------\n\n**1) My Supplement Philosophy:**\n\nBefore I jump into my protocol, let me start off by saying that my approach to supplements seems to be very different from most other people on this subreddit.\n\nPersonally, I **do not** take supplements in search of instant *\"magical effects\"*.\n\nSupplements are simply **one** of the useful tools I use to slightly optimize my recovery. Not magic pills or cures.\n\nI view it the same as supplementing protein-powder after going to the gym...\n\n*Are you going to feel your muscles grow after drinking a single protein shake? Definitely not.*\n\n*How about after a month of protein shakes? Nope, still definitely not.*\n\nYet, we clearly know adequate protein intake is required for muscles-protein-synthesis (muscle growth), and over a long enough time frame.... the person who is consuming proper amounts of protein alongside proper progressive overload in their weight training sessions...  will see faster/greater performance improvements than the person who isn't.\n\nI believe the body can eventually heal itself (it does so for 90% of people who didn't develop long covid). So by providing proper nutrients & supplements that target the proper pathways - we can hopefully accelerate & kickstart our body's healing process.\n\n\\---------\n\n**2) Why I consider these supplements \"essential\":**\n\nOver the past 18ish months I've tested 100's of different supplements, many of which have come & gone....\n\nThere are only 2 qualifiers I follow to curate my protocol & decide which supplements I take.\n\n1. The science is extremely compelling (regardless of whether I feel it or not).\n2. OR, I actually feel the difference.\n\nThose are the 2 qualifiers for the following supplements in my protocol below.\n\n... and yes, I've tried many more supplements... but if the evidence isn't strong enough, AND I also don't feel a difference. Those get phased out.\n\nSo, the following list is ONLY comprised of supplements I believe have strong evidence targeting the underlying mechanics or Long Covid, OR have provided me a noticeable boost.\n\nTherefore, I consider all of these \"non negotiable\" and \"must have\" for optimizing my Long Covid recovery as quickly as possible.\n\n\\---------\n\n**3) My Long Covid Supplement Protocol:**\n\n*PS. The only supplements on this list that DO have noticeable immediate benefits are the Nootropics (moderate-high effects) & Mitochondrial Supplements (mild-moderate effects)*\n\n**a) Brain Function & Cognitive Enhancement (Nootropics):**\n\n* **Nicotine** (optional, but potent cognitive boost)\n* **CDP Choline (500mg)**\n* **Noopept** (10-20mg orally, or 1mg via Nasal Spray)\n* **Fish Oil** (High Dose, 4 Capsules Daily. 3-4grams EPA/DHA)\n\n>**Explainer:** Nicotine functions as a nootropic by acting on the cholinergic system which enhances cognition. Choline is a primary source of fuel for the brain which helps form short & long term memory. Noopept is a nootropic that increases acetylcholine signaling, increases the expression of BDNF and NGF, and protects from glutamate toxicity. Fish oil is one of the most well established & beneficial supplements, helping support healthy fats for the brain & support cell-membrane health.  \n**Studies:**  \n\\- [Is the post-COVID-19 syndrome a severe impairment of acetylcholine-orchestrated neuromodulation that responds to nicotine administration?](https://bioelecmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42234-023-00104-7)\\- [Nicotine and the nicotinic cholinergic system in COVID‐19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7436654/)  \n\\- [Neuroprotective effect of noopept](https://jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12929-014-0074-2)\\- [Noopept modulates persistent inflammation by effecting spinal microglia dependent BDNF throughout apoptotic process](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7895721/)\\- [Citicoline and COVID-19-Related Cognitive and Other Neurologic Complications](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782421/)  \n\\- [Long COVID – a critical disruption of cholinergic neurotransmission?](https://bioelecmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42234-025-00167-8)  \n\\- [Imbalanced Brain Neurochemicals in Long COVID and ME/CFS: A Preliminary Study Using MRI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000293432400216X)\n\n**b) Mitochondrial Support** *(helpful against PEM & fatigue)*\n\n* **CoQ10** (250-500mg)\n* **Methylene Blue** (10mg)\n* **PQQ** (20-40mg)\n* **NAD+** injected subcutaneously (50mg)\n* **Benfotiamine or TTFD** 100-200mg (B1)\n* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** (250-500mg)\n\n>**Explainer:** CoQ10 is a vital part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, playing a crucial role in ATP production (energy). Methylene Blue acts as an backup electron carrier in the mitochondrial transport chain, bypassing complex I & III dysfunction to improve ATP production (if you have dysfunctional mitochondria). PQQ stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis by activating PGC-1α, leading to creation of new, healthy mitochondria. NAD+ is another essential coenzyme in cellular metabolism, ATP production, & DNA repair. Vitamin B1 (Benfotiamine or TTFD) support the Krebs cycle by converting pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. Without B1, pyruvate accumulates and is shunted to lactate, impairing energy production and leading to fatigue and lactic acid buildup.  \n**Studies:**  \n\\- [Methylene blue as a mitochondrial enhancer and neuroprotector](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3740501/)\\- [Potential use of methylene blue in viral infections, including COVID-19](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32479530/)\\- [Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in post-viral fatigue syndromes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-30328-4)  \n\\- [NAD+ replenishment and chronic fatigue syndrome](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32179900/)\\- [Low-dose naltrexone and NAD+ for the treatment of patients with persistent fatigue symptoms after COVID-19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10862402/)  \n\\- [Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in Long Covid](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-30328-4)  \n\\- [PQQ enhances mitochondrial function and biogenesis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20147331/)\n\n**c) ATP Support** *(helpful against PEM & fatigue)*\n\n* **BCAA’s** 3-5grams\n* **L-Glutamine** 5grams\n* **L-Citrulline** Malate 5grams\n* **L-Arginine** 3grams\n* **Exogenous Ketones / BHB Salts** 3-5grams\n\n>**Explainer:** This powdered recovery drink cocktail is based of the promising research done for AXA1125 on Long Covid, showing improved recovery & fatigue scores. The ingredients listed above are ingredients needed to make AXA1125 at home. My personal twist is adding L-Citrulline & Ketones which I do find add extra benefits, especially the Ketones.  \n**Studies:**  \n\\- [Efficacy AXA1125 in fatigue-predominant long COVID: a single-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(23)00123-2/fulltext)\n\n**d) Sleep Optimization**\n\n* **Melatonin** (3mg)\n* **Magnesium L-Threonate** (200-300mg)\n\n>**Explainer:** Melatonin is a potent detoxifier for the brain. Personally I noticed improved sleep & mental clarity in the mornings with low-dose Melatonin (even though I thought I didn't have sleep issues prior). Mag L Threonate is a form of magnesium that passes the blood-brain-barrier, and can help increase synaptic plasticity in the brain, calm NMDA receptors, and reduce oxidative stress in the brain.  \n**Studies:**  \n\\- [Magnesium L-Threonate Improves Brain Cognitive Functions in Healthy Adults](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9786204/)  \n\\- [Magnesium-L-threonate improves sleep quality and daytime functioning in adults: A randomized controlled trial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590142724000193)  \n\\- [Melatonin in Mitochondria: Mitigating Clear and Present Dangers](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physiol.00034.2019)  \n\\- [The Case for Sunlight & Melatonin in COVID 19 Patients: Oxidative Stress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zzo4SJopcY&list=PLQ_IRFkDInv8Br1Xt12sJuLau8E1AllmS)\n\n**e) Basics**\n\n* **Vitamin D3 & K2** (10,000mg D3 + K2)\n* **Liposomal Vitamin C** (1,000mg)\n* **Zinc** (50mg)\n* **Vitamin E** (400iu)\n\n>**Explainer:** Vitamin D3 supports healthy immune system (taking it with K2 is essential). K2 helps the increased calcium from D3 supplementation get channeled to the right places (into your bones, instead of your arteries). Zinc & Vit C help immune function through T Cells & NK cells. Vitamin E helps promote cell-membrane health & works synergistically with the others listed here.\n\n**f) Methylation Support**\n\n* **TMG** (2-3grams)\n* **Methylfolate** (B9) 1,000mcg\n* **Methylcobalmin** (B12) 5,000mcg\n* **Pantethine (best) or Pantothenic Acid (cheaper)** (B5)\n* **Riboflavin** (B2)\n* **P-5-P** (B6)\n\n>**Explainer:** Methylation is one of the most important biochemical processes in your body - it controls everything from detox, DNA repair, and neurotransmitter balance to energy production and inflammation. 50% of people have impaired methylation genetics (I reccomend doing a DNA test to confirm this, mine showed slightly impaired methylation genetics - therefore the above are crucial part of my stack IMO).  \n**Studies:**  \n\\- [Blood DNA methylation in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC): a prospective cohort study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(24)00287-1/fulltext)  \n\\- [MTHFR and LC, CFS, POTS, MCAS, SIBO, EDS: Methylating the Alphabet](https://download.ssrn.com/23/08/12/ssrn_id4538852_code4147980.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEEkaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQDeiqRqndItSG2Hpxub96fVioZc1SEwdaSswFXvZndaGAIgfvTAJ%2Bq4jSKF47iTLY9QM6fsFbqSWcK%2FFdeOiLzo8lYqvQUIERAEGgwzMDg0NzUzMDEyNTciDAMTq%2FPFC6UqSUZoZSqaBeInjTP14MsmnvHAeq0FGChbtH0UVZ91YYRx9%2BBwWoGcbrIx1U%2Bs2YaUUBRUnVOtAxHG7EewCFa9uMUg21tsYojsGc0RPfT9kfavRLaL3e%2F%2F%2FxJiBIoQ2oxPxRHPcB%2FOIzCyhCiUpbI1%2FWURkYHdIJW24MTqX%2BS65D%2Ba6%2FMZZECnTC1jtWXAf3zyOFFLmaopsB6g8P%2B1xi9kyL5SmxrWjbIoQhSjpNsf5vLr0Z%2BhwMAt0qLc3Xa64cvGzyG2%2BlIZZ2drwS%2BWyojVNVf7Zx0%2FRVyqV7Vr9V821owCK%2F%2BEcE0R4zacxbNd0Uy01MAVKOkGOnnL4Bjp%2FM0d4x7OO41MZj%2BykZA%2FNjXuTe2k5dFs550mDgupCzRSSv%2FbpBNYMGefVVSoSJ%2BfaupZsH%2FVK0mklmaI0SiwdHXnPfvPK4HIn%2BUuivMUxwC76g50yoDZGDPPt5aVW2X6iYfx6J5mkqfsh6l6AhbLXkEh80Yn50OLN9B2qNs9L2WSFgleDkcD15X%2FM%2FHvrN9a6FR%2Bnck%2FMtlvvXuehI69ugAX3jSI7GL%2BgxRhGcWenUvcXEABbFIDNCl0CxDpFeB9UxP%2BygafUd2LlDhT1z4%2Fay2YQSrfnOGK7slHEFcv6SnZKlYPVE69FNuCTK4CJGWW3a3khKNYOcvwueciEKJ2nX6TtcrGH%2Bm7JIqBD91vSNPKT2wPRDmHUDy1MCk7hR%2F%2BcuZMsGMv3fOd1Ruqp9pNIAs0ncGb8g9HSBsJSHUtnhQEovZDseuYD8fwNBjhdJg6eZhIjqKbXs5VBbbld1E2oiA3H%2FLIbxjfxpNxIWJ3oK1Aqhw8Ng%2FkbimOfKaex81NFtNDF9j%2FNm%2Bv3Qii8tA8KS2j22vKYHEMpyw4sF3O3jvuY6RwRDCqgsbBBjqxAWQZAhbHuY9RlfDLOYAyDQrurBAxPr1P87TKYugcEEOabRFBrzvec5rbScXWYaYmh3Cng6scsa0erQOrvtSvj7FqnWnY%2BI7Hsc5oK%2BskCM5WdOrUceIJ0qskTlxqEQzwKjx1lZUx4hkCw6l5mBallg3dVRfLETGUgOWQJ4lva1916uBDZiaLDBglCdIbzGqKWkGX6BTt7kqbnfPQ9C44tow2HnZswr5Zsd1RKxah0biy0g%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250524T082925Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAUPUUPRWE2QDTE5JW%2F20250524%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=1a6634dab9e83ef217184cc7d38c435692f1a15d7744d8914465881c4bfcb964&abstractId=4495911)\n\n**g) Digestive Health** *(helpful if you have bloating or cramping)*\n\n* **Digestive Enzymes**\n\n>Explainer: Digestive enzymes help break down fats, carbs, protein, and lactose for improved digestion. Definitely beneficial during periods that digestion needs optimization.\n\n*That's it for my \"non-negotiable\" supplements. I will continue to take these for the next 1-2 years of my recovery journey.*\n\n\\---------\n\n**4) OPTIONAL ADD-ON'S:**\n\nHere are additional supplements I also occasionally take, but consider \"less essential\" than the ones I listed above for my protocol.\n\n* **Curcumin** (anti-inflammatory)\n* **Quercetin** (natural mast cell stabilizer, anti-histamine)\n* **Boswellia** (5-LOX inhibitor, reduces leukotrienes, anti-allergy)\n* **Sulforaphane** (Nrf2 activator, enhanced detox & epigenetics)\n* **Black Seed Oil** (anti-inflammatory)\n* **Palmitoylethanolamide / PEA** (anti-neuroinflammation)\n* **EGCG** (detox and antioxidant)\n* **Luteolin** (anti-inflammatory & theorized [spike protein detox](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37166054/))\n* **Lactoferrin** (iron pathway support)\n* **Liposomal Glutathione** (detox support)\n* **Liposomal PhosphatidylCholine** (cell membrane support)\n* **Calcium AKG** (Krebs cycle support, boost ATP, and mitochondrial energy)\n* **NAC** (Glutathione precursor, enhances detoxification)\n* **Milk Thistle** (liver detox support)\n* **Sodium Butyrate** (HDAC inhibitor / DNA support)\n* **Vitamin A** (Immune regulation)\n* **Larazotide** (Anti-zonulin peptide, repairs leaky gut)\n* **Probiotics** (Enhance microbiome & digestion)\n\n**5) Discontinued Supplements:**\n\nThese some supplements I found \"promising\" but didn't notice any benefit from and/or the science wasn't convincing enough to keep investing IMO. However, there are some anecdotal success stories from others in this forum, so it may still be worth trying these:\n\n* **Nattokinase / Lumbrokinase** (very promising, but lacked results for me).\n* **DAO Enzyme** (helpful for MCAS & histamine issues, which it turns out I don't have).\n* **NAG**\n* **Diosmin & Hesparidin**\n* **Apigenin**\n* **Resveratrol**\n* **Pterostilbene**\n* **Andrographis**\n* **Chinese Skullcap**\n* **Astaxanthin**\n* **DMG**\n* **Inosine**\n* **Shilajit**\n* **Forskolin**\n\n\\---------\n\n**6) Medications & Treatments (previous posts):**\n\n* View [all of the treatments I've tried (what worked).](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1jb6xdg/ive_tried_25_treatments_for_long_covid_heres_what/)\n* View [all of my current medications, testing, and long-covid hypothesis.](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1k271r7/the_best_evidence_for_long_covid_no_more_pem/)\n* View [the top treatments that have helped my shortness of breath.](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1jdbmvd/this_9step_protocol_fixed_my_shortness_of_breath/)\n\n\\---------\n\n**Final Thoughts;**\n\nLook, I get it - the time & money spent on protocols like this may sound excessive to some of you *(these supplements +* [*antihistamines*](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1jdbmvd/this_9step_protocol_fixed_my_shortness_of_breath/) *+* [*NAD+ injection*](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1jb6xdg/ive_tried_25_treatments_for_long_covid_heres_what/) *+* [*TRT*](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1k271r7/the_best_evidence_for_long_covid_no_more_pem/) *+* [*Prescriptions*](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1k271r7/the_best_evidence_for_long_covid_no_more_pem/) *isn't standard by any means).*\n\nBut for me, 12+ months of barely breathing, zero energy, and watching life pass by from my bed? That cost me everything.\n\n30 minutes a day sticking to this protocol & a few hundred bucks a month invested towards my health is a no-brainer for me (especially considering the alternative).\n\nMy protocol isn't perfect. But it took me from completely house-bound to hitting new PR’s in the gym again. From canceling plans with friends to actually showing up & enjoying the night. From wondering if my life was over, to having full confidence a complete recovery is on the horizon.\n\nI still can't do heavy sprints or intense cardio without consequences, but I'll take the weightlifting sessions, social life, and quality of life improvements as a solid win for now.\n\nFor me, health isn't an expense. It's simply the #1 most important thing in my life, and I'm literally willing to do anything to get it back.\n\nAnyways, this stack works for me... maybe it can help you too *(just do your own research & consult with your doctor).*\n\nWishing you health, wealth, and happiness - Julian\n\n\\---------\n\n*Disclaimer: I'm not a medical provider or practitioner.

I'm not sure why, but I'm thinking it may be due to the increased blood circulation & vasdilation post-workout. Delivering more blood and oxygen throughout the body.\n\nThe one thing that does make it worse, and causes me discomfort the rest of the day is when I try to do intense cardio like sprinting, where my heart goes above 150bpm.\n\nWeight lifting is more isolated, with added rests in between so my HR stays between 110-140 during the entire workout. My body seems to tolerate this well. \n\n& yeah, you're in Cape Town? Feel free to DM me.\n\nI got my DNA Methylation tested with DNAlysis here in Cape Town, in case that helps.

Now I am taking the active form that doesn't need magnesium and I don't have issues. \n\nAnyway sides got away after 2 weeks nd I haven't had any problem since then. \n\nI also take different supplements for longevity and health and 3 of them are zinc, apigenin and luteolin, they might help with aromatase inhibition.\n\nI have never taken Minoxidil these progress are from DHT inhibitions only. \n\nI will be 30 years old November, Both my grandfathers were bald, the brother of my mother is bald, but my father and his 2 brothers have a head full of hair with a perfect hairline. \n\nI think I will add topical minoxidil.

    "body": "\nHey all! 👋🏻I want to review hair growth serum from minimalist-\n\nSo i have straight fine hair(little below shoulder length)(30s/F), oily scalp. \n\nI have been suffering from hair loss for past two years. I haven't checked with my derm. I have lost some hair (in patches) because of my tight hairstyle. Then came humidity season and my hair were everywhere. Before taking an appointment I decided to try hair serum. I started on 29th june. \n\n\n29/6: Started with serum. First application was hassle free. No burning or warming of the scalp. I used 4 drops front of scalp(problem area) and 4 drops back of my head, everyday, in the AM(as i take shower in the PM). Rubbed into my fingers and then Massaged only on my scalp and not on length. It was non greasy.\n\n\n01/07: In just two days I started to feel my hair fall is less, like 3-4 strands in my comb. I thought its a placebo effect.\n\n\nI continued it for two weeks straight, every day and my hair fall reduced by 20%. I stopped the application on 14/7 for two weeks as i was traveling and wanted to see if hairfall return and to my luck it Did. But it wasn't alot. I think some people miss understand that after stopping hairfall doubles but it's just the same amount you used to get(at least for me)\nI restarted again and still using it and now i can say I definitely see hair looks bit thicker, have seen baby hair growth especially at the hairline and hair fall has reduced to 80%. \n\nI will keep using it as it dint have any side effects except one stubborn cc which always occurs on my forehead if apply regularly. Thus i now use it 4-5 times a week(depends on which day i ll shampoo and workout)\n\nIts non greasy if applied less but if you directly use the dropper on scalp you might end up using alot and it will give oily look. My scalp normally gets oily on 3rd day but with everyday application of serum hair looks oily on 2nd day. \n\n\nPROS: 1. It works.\n2. New hair growth. \n3. Hair seem thicker.\n4. Less hairfall.\n\n\nCONS: 1.Everyday application is a task for long hair and oily scalp as you need to shampoo.\n2. Give cc on forehead with regular use.\n3. Don't think its a permanent cure.\n4. Expensive.\n\nInci:\nButylene Glycol, Aqua, Dextran, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Trifolium Pratense (Clover) Flower Extract, Propanediol, Arginine, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Gluconolactone, Calcium Gluconate, Glycerin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Apigenin, Oleanolic Acid, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Sprout Extract, Isomalt, Sodium Metabisulfite, Larix Europaea Wood Extract, Glycine, Zinc Chloride, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sanguisorba Officinalis Root Extract, Serenoa Serrulata (Saw Palmetto) Fruit Extract, Capryloyl Glycine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Lactic Acid\n\n\nTL:DR- True to its claims, will repurchase it!\n------------------------------",

I don't mind it because I had dandruff issues before this and I'll take oily hair any day over flaky scalp. My hair looks bulkier too, which I like. I guess it kinda also works a bit like a regular serum. I can also see a lot of baby hair. I have purchased 3 bottles of it and I have dropped 2 of them and spilled more than 50% of the serum both times. I think otherwise it would have lasted longer. But yeah, anyway.

    "body": "# Preamble\n\nI posted most of this as a comment on another sub. I revisited to edit my comment, but as i made the original comment in markdown mode and my edit in rt, it would not save my edits. I decided it was probably worth it's own sub anyway so here we are.\n\n# Introduction\n\nI have successfully eliminated/healed tinnitus for myself more than once. Here's my story.\n\nI've had mild to severe tinnitus for multiple times, from different causes; ear infections, head injuries, eardrum injury… mostly from loud / live music.\n\nOut of desperation I did countless hours of reading and planning to develop a comprehensive protocol, cross-referencing for optimization and safety.\n\nI feel very strongly from my experience that my comprehensive approach with intention and focus led to my personal success. I did everything I could to provide the best possible circumstances and conditions to protect from further damage, support neurogenesis, and facilitate healing.\n\nI have created a list of my remedies to share with you below.\n\n# Notes\n\n* ***IMPORTANT*** **Talk to your doctor. I’m not a medical professional. This is not medical advice. I am simply sharing what works for me.**\n* ***IMPORTANT*** Read up on each on your own. Each has specific mechanisms which apply directly. Find optimal sources and protocols that work for you, your biology, your budget, etc. Know what you’re putting into your body, how it works and interactions. Know proper dosage and timing for you. Don’t over-do them.\n* I'm happy to discuss and answer questions, I just don't have time to explain everything in detail here when we have Google.\n* I use almost all of these to support various aspects of my life anyway; ADHD, Depression, Weight Training, Weight Loss, Work Performance, General Health and Vitality.\n* Everything here has been linked to ear health and healing tinnitus. As with all remedies, extensive empirical research is required before conclusively proven. Like many remedies which are commonly accepted, some of these have not yet reached that status. It’s simply a matter of qualified agents actually prioritizing the work. That said, I obviously cannot say empirically which or if all of these actually helped, nor how much was simply time and my body's own healing.\n* ***IMPORTANT*** **Talk to your doctor. I’m not a medical professional. This is not medical advice. I am simply sharing what works for me.**\n\n# *EDITS\n\n* Anecdotally, I believe I see the most pronounced results from \"Supplement Group 1\" protocol, combined with good habits, diet, and exercise to support total health.\n* Much of what is here is indirect methodology focused around creating the best internal environment and conditions for healing and prevention overall. Most of it is simply healthy habits and associated with better health overall, regardless. \n* This is not presented with the intent to represent one monolithic \"cure\". This is a list of the items I have gathered over time across my various bouts of tinnitus, which means that I saw results from less than all of this. I'm not giving you any advice, technically, but if it were me reading this, I would 1. inform myself about each in this context 2. pick items \"within my reach\" and 3. slowly implement them as I can and monitor for results.\n* Some of these may or may not work for you. Some supplements could even be detrimental, based on your personal biology x many variables. Again, read up, know what you're putting into your body, consider your variables, make informed decisions. You will find conflicting studies, so use your judgement and caution.\n* More direct and indirect neurogenesis-supporting or anti-inflammatory or stress-reducing supplements: Vitamin D3, NAD+, Ashwagandha, L-Theanine, Turmeric, Cordyceps, Reishi.\n* I have highlighted specific foods for known properties which directly or indirectly support ear health and/or neurogenesis, inflammatory response, stress modulation, circulation, etc\n* The app \"Audio Cardio\" is meant for retraining your ears to hear frequencies which you may have lost. Many have also reported tinnitus improvement with use. One could infer retraining the ear to regain hearing would have to involve neuroplasticity and potential neurogenesis... maybe even cochlear hair genesis?? \n* Don't mainline meth\n\n# Supplements\n\n**Supplement Group 1:**  \nSpecifically, Directly For Tinnitus Taken together, on a specific protocol, w/ lemonade + grated lemon zest \\[can add orange juice\\], and enough food to avoid stomach discomfort.\n\n* Tinnitus Vitamins *(LipoFlavonoid or Generic)*\n* Zinc *(Picolinate and/or Bisglycinate)*\n* Magnesium L-Threonate\n* Ginkgo Biloba\n* Lion's Mane\n* Psilocybin *(Find a Good Microdose and Macrodose Protocol)*\n* Niacin *(Flushing)*\n* Vitamin C\n* Vitamin B-Complex *(Methylated)*\n\n**Supplement Group 2:**  \nResearch and follow good supplement protocols to avoid interactions, negative reactions, and optimize timing for best results. \n\n* Antioxidants: Coq10, Astaxanthin, Sage Extract\n* Vitamins: A, B12, C, D3, E\n* Minerals: Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc, Iron\n* Balanced Electrolytes\n* Anti-Inflammatory and Stress: Ashwagandha, L-Theanine, Turmeric\n* Phospholipids: Phosphatidylcholine, Phosphatidylserine *(Taken Early)*\n* Aminos: Collagen Peptides, Taurine (Taken Early), 5-HTP *(****If not on SSRIs****) (Taken at Bedtime)*\n* Omega 3s *(High Dose, High DHA & EPA)*\n* Mushrooms: Reishi, Cordyceps, Lion's Mane, Psilocybin\n\n# Diet\n\n**Stop**\n\n* Caffeine\n* Nicotine\n* Processed Sugar and Refined Carbs\n* Amphetamine and Other Stimulants *(if possible)*\n\n**Start**\n\n* Foods for Choline, Amino Acids, Antioxidants, Flavonoids, Circulation, Omega 3s\n* Hydration: At Least One Ounce of Water per Pound of Bodyweight Daily\n* Vegetables: Ginger, Asparagus, Beets, Cruciferous Veg\n* Fruits: Watermelon, Citrus *(Esp. Lemons + Lemon Zest)*\n* Antioxidant-Rich Foods *(Plant Foods: Dark Reds And Greens)*\n* Tart Cherries/Juice (For Antioxidants, Natural Melatonin)\n* Omega-3-Rich Foods *(e.g. Quality Salmon, Avocado)*\n* Complete Protein / Essential Amino Acid Foods: Eggs, Milk Protein Hydrolysate, Fresh Red Meat\n\n# Direct Physical Care\n\n**Stop**\n\n* Swabs and Other Probes Inside Ear Canal\n\n**Start**\n\n* \"Audio Cardio\" App\n* Diluted 3% Peroxide Drops to Break Up Earwax\n* Glycerine, Food-Safe Mineral Oil, or Baby Oil to Dissolve Earwax\n* Ear-Drying Drops After Showers/Swims/ Sweating, etc. *(****Not if Ruptured Ear Drum, Ear Tubes, Swimmer’s Ear, or Ear Drainage****)*\n* Tinnitus Ear Drops in Clean Ears\n* Saline Solution Irrigation to Clean Sinuses Regularly\n* Air Cleaners, esp Where You Sleep\n* Hydrometer and Humidifiers for Optimal Humidity, esp Where You Sleep\n* Change HVAC Filters Regularly Avoid Dust, Mold, Respiratory Pollutants and Irritants\n\n# Protection\n\n**Stop**\n\n* Earbuds / In-Ear Headphones\n* Bluetooth Headphones/Earphones Of All Kinds\n\n**Start**\n\n* Earplugs: Anywhere Remotely Loud. No Exceptions. Learn Proper Use. Keep On-Hand.\n* Keep Music/Media Very Low, No Exceptions\n* Open-Backed Headphones\n\n# Exercise\n\n* Daily Walking, Work Up To 10k Steps+\n* Daily Strenuous Exercise, esp Weight/Resistance Training\n* Consistent Healthy Sleep *(Use Fitness Trackers, Get A Sleep Study, etc.)*\n   * 10-3-2-1-0 protocol for sleep\n   * THC is bad for sleep. CBD is good for sleep.\n   * Melatonin supplements are under-regulated, inconsistent, and contain detrimentally high dosages. They help fall asleep, not stay asleep, and add no benefit to the \"structure\" of sleep.\n   * Melatonin, in doses proportional to those in human supplements, shrink hamster testes from the size of almonds down to grains of rice, supporting that it is a hormone disruptor. \n   * Dr. Andrew Huberman's sleep supplement \"cocktail\"\n      * can include specific dosages of some or all of: L-Theanine, Magnesium L-Threonate, Apigenin (decreases estrogen, be aware), Inositol, GABA, Glycine, Tart Cherry Juice, CBD (50-200mg)\n\n# Psychological\n\nThere is often a significant psychological component to tinnitus. Some tinnitus is partially or wholly psychosomatic. Psychotherapy cannot undo physical injury, but can help resolve psychosomatic elements. Stress directly affects physical biology. Psychotherapy can greatly reduce stress.\n\n* Reduce Stressors\n* Daily Meditation And Mindfulness Breathing\n* EMDR Therapy (Particularly For Psychosomatic)\n\n\n\n# Thanks for reading! I hope something here helps someone!\n\n\n\n***IMPORTANT*** **Talk to your doctor. I’m not a medical professional. This is not medical advice. I am simply sharing what works for me.**",

I’m happy for you. I’m glad you found a cure and I know you’re just trying to help others. That’s admirable.

    "body": "Na zahtjev u/Jevrejjob danas ćemo saznat što od biljaka možemo jesti u prirodi (naravno ne sve, jer je previše toga).  Ako završi u šumi za koji mjesec nadamo se da će preživjeti.\n\n\\- [Maslačak](https://www.krenizdravo.hr/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/maslacak-ljekovitost.jpg)\n\nMaslačak (Taraxacum officinale) obično doživljavamo samo kao cvijeće, no svi dijelovi maslačka su jestivi. Maslačak je izrazito zdrava biljka,  jedan od najbogatijih izvora beta karotena. Sadrži flavonoide, četiri puta više beta karotena od brokule, lutein, zeaksantin i kriptoksantin, jedan je od najboljih biljnih izvora vitamina K1. Odličan je izvor minerala, uključujući magnezij, kalcij, kalij, mangan i željezo. Maslačak ima antioksidativna svojstva i sadrži brojne spojeve koji mu daju snažna ljekovita svojstva: djeluje kao prirodan laksativ i diuretik, pomaže kod nadutosti i edema, normalizira razinu šećera i kolesterola u krvi, potiče apetit i stimulira rad želuca, čisti i regenerira jetru te pomaže kod opeklina i uboda. Maslačak posjeduje antivirusna svojstva i može biti koristan u borbi protiv herpesa.\n\nListovi prije pojave cvijeta su manje gorki i mogu se jesti svježi (npr. kao salata). Potapanje 30 min u slanu vodu izvući će gorčinu iz listova. Cvjetovima se često odstranjuje bijeli dio na laticama, jer je on prilično gorak, a žuti dio se može jesti svjež, kao ukras u salatama ili drugim jelima. Korijen sadrži veliku količinu inulina, može se kuhati i jesti svjež isječen na trakice.\n\n\\- [Kopriva](https://living.vecernji.hr/zelena-zona/kopriva-apsolutno-najmocniji-lijek-iz-prirode-1014209/galerija-145759?page=1)\n\nJoš jedna samonikla i svima dobro poznata biljka je kopriva (Urtica dioica). Ispod njezinih listova kriju se žarnici – dlačice koje sadrže mješavinu spojeva uključujući histamin, serotonin i acetilkolin. Ako ih dotaknete, dlačice izliju ovaj sok na kožu što izaziva žarenje. Zbog toga se prije konzumiranja kopriva uglavnom kuha. No može se koristiti i sirova, a kemijske tvari koji izazivaju žarenje potrebno je prvo odstraniti namakanjem u hladnoj vodi. Kopriva ima visoki udio željeza, kalija, mangana, kalcija i vitamina A, C, D i K. Jedna šalica koprive sadrži 1.790 IU vitamina A, što je čak 300% preporučenog dnevnog unosa. Dijelovi koprive koji se najčešće konzumiraju su lišće i korijen. Smatra se da je kopriva prirodni afrodizijak. Zbog visokog sadržaja željeza i klorofila pomaže kod anemije i kroničnog umora. Jača kosu i ubrzava njezin rast. Pomaže kod infekcija mokraćnog sustava, zaustavlja krvarenje, liječi osip, ublažava artiritis i drugo.. Listovi se koriste za pripremu raznih jela: čorbi, variva, umaka, kao nadjev za pitu i sl.\n\n\\- [Livadna kozja brada](https://www.plantea.com.hr/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/kozja-brada-7.jpg)\n\nKozju bradu (Tragopogon pratensis) vole i ljudi i pčele. Dugačka plavkastozelena stabljika se razvija u prvoj godini, a iduću cvjeta žutim laticama. Dvogodišnja biljka se lako pronađe u vlažnim tlima uz rijeke i pašnjake. Jestiva je sva i bogata vitaminom C. Može se jesti i sirova jer je ugodnog slatkastog okusa. Jestiva je cijela biljka, a korijen je bogat inulinom. Skupljanjem lateksa može se koristiti kao žvakaća guma.\n\n**-** [Obični koromač ili komorač](https://www.plantea.com.hr/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/komorac-005.jpg)\n\nKoromač (Foeniculum vulgare) nalazimo na vlažnim staništima sjenovitog tla, iako uspijeva i na osunčanim mjestima. Cvate u kasno ljeto, a za salate se koriste listovi. Često ga uzgajamo u vrtovima zbog njegove arome koja opušta pa se koristi i kao sastojak čajeva i jela u kojima ublažava nadutost i probavne tegobe. Najbolje od komorača dobit će se, ako ga poslužimo svježeg. Vrlo su zanimljive kombinacije komorača s povrćem i voćem, u raznim miješanim i složenim salatama: s avokadom i narančama, artičokama i parmezanom, mandarinama i narom ili s pršutom i kruškama. Plod je posebno bogat eteričnim uljem i rabi se kao začin ili čaj protiv nadimanja i kao blago sredstvo protiv kašlja kod djece i kod proljeva i drugih probavnih smetnji kod dojenčadi. Komorač je jedna od najstarijih poznatih ljekovitih biljaka koju su koristili stari Egipćani, Rimljani i Grci, a kod nas su ga, kao prirodni lijek kod probavnih tegoba i prehlada, proslavili benediktinci. Komorač je odličan izvor kalija, koji pomaže kod snižavanja visokog krvnog tlaka, jednog od rizičnih faktora koji mogu utjecati na srčani ili moždani udar. Sjemenke i korijen komorača sastavni su dijelovi čajeva za čišćenje organizma, što se pripisuje eteričnom ulju koje suzbija nadutost, smiruje grčeve želuca i crijeva i djeluje protiv vrenja. Osobito su ga voljele rimske dame, koje su ga grickale radi njegovog diuretičkog svojstva i otapanja masnog tkiva oko struka. Ratnici su pak komorač dodavali u jelo kako bi sačuvali dobro zdravlje i snagu. U Srednjem vijeku koristili su ga za rastjerivanje kukaca. Vjerovalo se da plaši vještice, pa su ga za Ivanjske noći vješali na ulazna vrata. Često su ga stavljali u ključanice da nikakvo zlo noću ne uđe u kuću. Srodne vrste komoraču su anis, celer i kim.\n\n**-** [Lavlji zub](https://www.plantea.com.hr/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ostrodlakavi-lavlji-zub-3.jpg)\n\nLavlji zub (Leontodon hispidus L.)  je biljka iz porodice glavočika *Asteraceae*, a raste na osunčanim terenima, pašnjacima i livadama. U Hrvatskoj raste više vrsta, to su jesenski, kovrčavi, oštrodlakavi, sivkasti, maslačkasti, gomoljasti lavlji zub i Leontodon cichoraceus. Mladi listovi se jedu i u salati, iako se kuhanje preporučuje zbog gorčine. Korijen lavljeg zuba se može konzumirati kao zamjena za kavu. Cvate od svibnja do rujna.\n\n**-** [Cikorija](https://www.plantea.com.hr/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cikorija-2.jpg)\n\nCikorija (Cichorium intybus)  je višegodišnja zeljasta biljka, naraste do 1.5 metar. Biljka ima valjkasto-vretenasti korijen, izvana žućkast, a iznutra bijel. Stabljika je duga, čvrsta i razgranata. Listovi su duguljasti, grubo nazubljeni, suženi u dršku, sliče listovima maslačka. Cvijet biljke je svijetloplave boje, s ljubičastim prašnicima koji imaju svjetliji vrh. Okus biljke je gorak, kako listova, tako i korijena. Bez obzira na takav ukus divlja cikorija je specijalitet u nekim kuhinja. Voli sunčana tla s mnogo vlage, a odlično podnosi i hladnije temperature. Uspijeva i u vrijeme kada nema mnogo drugog povrća. Lako se uzgaja, a mesnati listovi nude bogatstvo vitamina. Iz korijena cikorije se proizvodi sirovina za bijelu kavu.\n\nOd cikorije beru se mladi listovi u proljeće prije cvjetanja. Blagotvorno djeluje na žuč i potiče apetit. Cikorija se koristi već stotinama godina kao biljni lijek za mnoge bolesti. Ona ublažava probavne probleme, sprječava žgaravicu, smanjuje bolove od artritisa, čisti organizam, sprječava bakterijske infekcije, pojačava imunološki sustav te smanjuje rizik od srčanih bolesti. Što se tiče nutritivne vrijednosti, cikorija je odličan izvor vitamina i minerala. Ova biljka sadrži cink, magnezij, mangan, kalcija, željezo, folnu kiselinu i kalij, kao i vitamine A, B6, C, E i K.\n\nIako postoje mnoge prednosti korištenja cikorije za zdravlje, ipak u nekim situacijama treba biti oprezan. Na primjer, trudnicama se ne preporučuje konzumiranje jer postoji mogućnost da izazove komplikacije ili čak pobačaj. Također, dojilje trebaju izbjegavati cikoriju budući da nema dovoljno istraživanja koja se bave prijenosom cikorije između majke i djeteta kroz majčino mlijeko.\n\n**-** [Štavelj (kovrčava kiselica)](https://www.plantea.com.hr/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/stavelj-4.jpg)\n\nKonjska kiselica (Rumex crispus) je biljka iz porodice Polygonaceae. Listove biljke beremo u ožujku i travnju prije rasta stabljike. Raste po livadama i šumarcima. Izuzetno bogat vitaminom C. Mladi  listovi su  bogati vitaminima A i C i mineralima. Odrasla biljka je vrlo gorka te sadrži dosta oksalne kiseline pa može povisiti opasnost od stvaranja bubrežnih kamenaca. Ni mladu biljku ne smije se jesti u većoj količini.\n\n[\\- Broćika](https://www.plantea.com.hr/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/prava-brocika-0003.jpg)\n\nPrava broćika (Galium verum) je višegodišnja zeljasta biljka. Ovu biljku možete pronaći na oranicama, livadama i uz plotove, dok je na selu često iskorjenjivana. Može narasti do 160 centimetara u visinu. Listovi su vretenasti, a cvat šiljasti i zelenobijele boje. Na stabljici se nalaze zaštitne dlačice. Ova biljka je penjačica, tako da naziv broćika priljepača odgovara tom svojstvu. Ivanjsko cvijeće ili obična broćika najčešće raste u višim predjelima i nešto je niža od penjačice. Cvjetovi su joj zlatno-žuti i jako mirišu na med.\n\nČak i kad je suha, osjeti se snažan miris zbog čega nekad skupljala u jastučićima kao miris za kuću. Biljka cvate od svibnja do kolovoza, a bere se gornji dio stabljike u cvatu. Treba ju brzo sušiti na toplom i prozračnom mjestu kako ne bi izgubila svoja ljekovita svojstva i miris. S obzirom na to da broćika stimulira rad imunološkog sustava, ne smiju ju koristiti osobe koje boluju od: teških bolesti kao što je AIDS, bolesti povezanih sa štitnjačom, osobe koje pate od bolesti želudca i žući.\n\n\\-[Divlji mak (Mak turčinak)](https://www.plantea.com.hr/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/mak-turcinjak-2.jpg)\n\nMak turčinak (Papaver rhoeas L.) jednogodišnja je zeljasta biljka iz porodice makovki. Obrasla je dlačicama i sadrži bijeli mliječni sok. Cvate u svibnju, a prije cvatnje nudi mlade jestive listove i sjemenke. Za razliku od vrtnog maka, ne sadrži opijumske alkaloide pa osim što ukrašava polja i vaze s poljskim cvijećem. Sjemenke se koriste kao začin za peciva i kolače.\n\n[\\- Prosenica (kozji rog, jarčev rog, grohotuša, piskavica)](https://www.plantea.com.hr/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/piskavica-0001.jpg)\n\nPiskavica (Trigonella foenum-graecum) jedna je od najstarijih ljekovitih biljaka koja datira od doba starih Egipćana i Hipokrata. U liječenju i prehrani koristi se njeno sjeme, koje je neizbježan sastojak curryja i drugih začinskih mješavina veoma popularnih u Indiji i na Srednjem Istoku. Jestivi su mladi listovi koji se beru u travnju i svibnju. Nema posebnog okusa. Više su u upotrebi sjemenke koje se piju kao čaj i pomažu kod povišenog kolesterola, povećavaju broj eritrocita i smanjuju šećer u krvi. Naziva se još i grčko sjeme jer su ga, prema predaji, olimpijci prije natjecanja u staroj Grčkoj, uzimali za snagu. Jedan od sastojaka u sjemenu piskavice je i fitoestrogen. Zbog tog sastojka žene ga piju kako bi povećale dojke i zadržale vodu u tkivu. Osim toga, može pomoći u stvaranju mlijeka koje će biti bogato željezom. Mlijeko dojilja koje koriste sjeme piskavice pomoći će djeci da dobiju na težini i uz to će ih umiriti. Ovo sjeme može smanjit će bolove u maternici za vrijeme PMS-a, ali i za vrijeme poroda. Također može pomoći u poticanju trudova.\n\n\\- [Mačja muda (Apulijska orjašica)](https://www.plantea.com.hr/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/apulijska-orjasica-4.jpg)\n\nApulijska orjašica (Tordylium apulum L.) je jednogodišnja zeljasta biljka. Kod nas raste u područjima uz Jadransku obalu. Raste na toplim i sunčanim mjestima, na livadama, pašnjacima, obrađenim zemljištima… Poprilično nejestiv naziv krije ukusne mlade listove koji se mogu jesti kuhani i sirovi, a beru se u svibnju i lipnju.\n\n\\- [Tušt](https://www.plantea.com.hr/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tust-4.jpg)\n\nTušt ili portulak (Portulaca oleracea L.) je jednogodišnja sukulentna biljka. Rasprostranjen po čitavom svijetu kao korov u nizinama do 800 metara nadmorske visine. Sukulentna mesnatica slabe hranjive vrijednosti, ali jestiva čitava i otporna na sve vremenske uvjete. Bere se u lipnju i srpnju, a osim ogromne količine vode koju sadrži, nudi i nešto vitamina C, karotina, bjelančevina, ugljikohidrata, masti, željeza, fosfora i kalcija.\n\n\\- [Trputac](https://www.plantea.com.hr/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/trputac-0006.jpg)\n\nTrputac *(Plantago lanceolata)* je biljka koja raste na livadama, u poljskim međama, uz rubove putova, u jarcima i na vlažnom plodnom tlu. Mladi listovi trputca mogu se jesti sirovi ili kuhani. Osobito su vrijedni zbog provitamina A, vitamina C i K, limunske kiseline te kalija. Listovi trputca kuhanjem poprimaju ugodan miris i imaju okus na vrganje. Ova biljka se još od antičkog doba upotrebljava kao lijek. Njegova primjena je vrlo široka, pa se tako trputac naziva „lijekom za sve bolesti\". Trputac sadrži glikozid aukubin, poznati antitoksin. Ovaj „korov\" sadrži i mnoge druge ljekovite tvari, uključujući askorbinsku kiselinu, apigenin (fitonutrijent sa snažnim antioksidativnim svojstvima), benzojevu kiselinu, oleanoličnu kiselinu i salicilnu kiselinu. Zahvaljujući svom bogatom sastavu, trputac ima snažna protuupalna svojstva, te djeluje kao protuotrov i diuretik.\n\nPotvrđeno je da trputac može pomoći kod mnogih bolesti, uključujući: dijabetes, krvarenja iz manjih rana, astmu, kašalj, tuberkulozuvi, groznicu, upalu kože, problem s mjehurom i drugo.\n\n\\- [Kupina](https://www.plantea.com.hr/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/kupine-1.jpg)\n\nKupina je naziv za nekoliko vrsta biljaka penjačica iz roda Rubus iz porodice ruža (Rosaceae). Kupine mogu narasti 50-300 cm u visinu. Stablo im je manje-više pokriveno trnjem i mjestimično odrvenilo. Bodlje služe za penjanje, ali i kao obrambeni mehanizam protiv životinja koje se hrane lišćem kupine. Cvjeta od lipnja do kolovoza. Nakon toga, iz svakog pojedinačnog cvijeta razvija se sitni jagodičasti plod crvene boje, koji kasnije potamni do tamnoplave i skoro crne boje. Kupina ima više vlakana nego većina drugog voća. U šaci punoj kupina naći će se oko 8 grama vlakana, a u 25 grama cjelovitih žitarica, koliko se dnevno preporučuje, samo 4 grama. Osim što su dobra za probavu i održavanje težine, vlakna pomažu sniziti i održavati kolesterol.\n\n\\- [Breza](https://slika.nezavisne.rs/2017/03/750x450/20170324111820_43642.jpg)\n\nObična breza (viseća breza, Betula pendula), bjelogorično je drvo iz porodice Betulaceae. Obična breza je ljekovita biljka. Koriste se pupovi, listovi te katran dobiven suhom destilacijom brezove kore. Pupovi i listovi djeluju diuretično, holeretički, dijaforetički, pročišćavaju krv, djeluju baktericidno te protuupalno. Sok breze dobiven bušenjem debla u proljeće prije listanja može se koristiti za piće,te dobivanje sirupa ili šećera. Sasvim mladi listovi te proljetne rese smatraju se jestivim. Mladi listovi sadrže oko 140 mg% vitamina C te nešto karotina.\n\n\\- [Crni sljez](https://burza.com.hr/static/clanci/crni-sljez-5842-1.jpg)\n\nCrni sljez (šumski sljez, guščja trava, Malva sylvestris) dvogodišnja je ili višegodišnja biljka iz porodice sljezovki. Biljka raste po poljima, uz putove, kuće, kao korov po zapuštenim mjestima. Raste do 1200 m nadmorske visine po čitavoj Europi. Od travnja do srpnja mladi listovi crnoga sljeza pripremaju se kao varivo slično špinatu. Listovi su bogati vitaminom C, karotinom, željezom i kalcijem. Od lipnja do sredine rujna sabiru se listovi i cvjetovi u vrijeme cvatnje. Katkada se sabire i korijen, a sjeme nakon dozrijevanja. Nezreli plodovi crnog sljeza mogu se jesti svježi i stavljati u variva i marinade. Cijeni se od davnina kao sredstvo za otklanjanje probavnih smetnji i rastvaranje sluzi. Od listova se mogu pripremati sluzavi kašasti oblozi za upale.\n\n\\- [Čičak](https://agrosavjet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/%C4%8CI%C4%8CAK.jpg)\n\nČičak (repuh, Arctium), biljni rod od 53 priznate vrste dvogodišnjih biljaka iz porodice zvjezdanovki (Compositae). Najpoznatije vrste su obični ili veliki čičak, mali čičak, šumski čičak i pustenasti čičak. Domovina čička je Europa, odakle se raširio diljem svijeta. U narodu je poznat i kao lopuh, lepuh, lepušina, čakalj, lopuk, repuh, lipalj. Nutritivno bogati i ljekoviti dijelovi čička su – listovi, stabljika, sjeme i korijen. Sadrže brojne nutrijente koji su višestruko korisni za ljudski organizam: vitamine C i E, folnu kiselinu, riboflavin, piridoksin, niacin, kalij, željezo, magnezij, cink, kalcij, selen, fosfor i inulin. Čičak je odličan saveznik imunološkog sustava – jača imunitet, prevenira i liječi gripu, razne infekcije i alergije. Pospješuje znojenje, a time i detoksikaciju organizma putem kože. Oblog od čička koristi se za liječenje kožnih problema poput nečiste kože, modrica, osipa, gnojnih rana, ogrebotina, akni, ekcema i lišaja. Pomaže u pročišćavanju krvi, prevenira i liječi anemiju, a prema najnovijim istraživanjima djelotvoran je i u liječenju leukemije. Zahvaljujući inulinu u svom sastavu ova biljka je od velike pomoći u regulaciji razine šećera u krvi pa se dijabetičarima preporučuje svakodnevna konzumacija tinkture od čička.\n\n\\- [Jaglac](https://www.krenizdravo.hr/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jaglac.jpg?x18533)\n\nKao jedan od vjesnika proljeća, jaglac svojim cvijetom na livadama simbolizira pobjedu nad zimom. U narodu se za njega kaže da je „ključ koji otvara vrata proljeća\". Njegov latinski naziv je Primula acaulis i izveden je od riječi primus, što znači prvi i odnosi se na rano cvjetanje. U narodu je još poznat i kao jaglika, primula. U prirodi jaglac raste na livadama, proplancima i šumama, od ožujka do svibnja, ali zbog ljudskog nemara - prekomjernog i nepravilnog branja, danas je značajno prorijeđen i može se naći na vrlo malo prirodnih staništa.\n\nKod upotrebe jaglaca postoje i izvjesna ograničenja, jer su u rijetkim slučajevima moguće alergijske reakcije ili tegobe probavnih organa. Također, trudnicama i dojiljama se ne preporučuju preparati na bazi ove biljke.\n\n\\- [Šparoga](http://cdn-kastela.r.worldssl.net/images/stories/novosti/2019/03/sparoge.jpg)\n\nŠparoga ili špargla (Asparagus officinalis) je višegodišnja zeljasta biljka iz porodice Asparagaceae. Šparoge su zbog svojega okusa i ljekovitih svojstava cijenjene još u razdoblju starog Rima kad su čitave flote brodova odlazile u prikupljanje šparoga za careve. Šparoge su poznate kao izvrstan izvor folne kiseline, vitamina B skupine, esencijalnog za pravilnu diobu stanica i sintezu DNA te bitnog za zdravlje kardiovaskularnog sustava. Šparoge su također izvor blagotvornih fitonutrijenata za zdravlje, poput beta-karotena, luteina i zeaksantina koji mogu djelovati kao snažni antioksidansi i štititi stanice od oksidativnih oštećenja koja nastaju zbog djelovanja slobodnih radikala. Budući da su bogate nutrijentima, a siromašne kalorijama - jedna šalica kuhanih šparoga osigurava svega 43 kalorije, šparoge je poželjno uvrstiti u ''najzdraviji način prehrane''.\n\nOsim aminokiseline asparagina, po kojoj su i dobile ime, šparoge sadrže glikolnu i folnu kiselinu, flavonoide, saponine, glutation, vitamine A, B, C, E, minerale kalcij, cink, željezo, selen, jod, magnezij i mangan te obilje kalija i fosfora. Takvu kombinaciju  ljekovitih sastojaka nećemo pronaći ni u jednom umjetno proizvedenom lijeku.\n\n\\- [Šumska jagoda](https://www.plantea.com.hr/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/sumska-jagoda-2.jpg)\n\nŠumska Jagoda (Fragaria vesca L.) je višegodišnja biljka iz porodice ruža. Sam naziv, šumska jagoda, govori da je ovo voće koje uglavnom nalazimo u divljini (šumskim područjima). Unatoč tome, šumsku jagodu je moguće uzgajati u vlastitom vrtu. Snažnog je okusa, zbog kojeg je unatoč sitnom plodu vrlo cijenjena. Šumska jagoda koristi se za mnoštvo prerađevina, kao što su: džemovi, likeri, rakije, kozmetika itd. Sadrže visoke količine vitamina C, vlakna, kalij i antioksidanse. Pomažu u prevenciji tumora. Šumske je jagode gotovo nemoguće pronaći u trgovinama, glavni problem je trajanje – one ne mogu dugo stajati nakon branja. Jagode svrstavamo u bobičasto voće, ali ustvari plodovi jagoda nisu prave bobice – sjeme jagoda nalazi se na plodu, izvana su prekrivene sjemenkama– crveni plodovi najviše privlače ptice (koje su zaslužne za širenje sjemena).\n\n\\- [Tratinčica](https://www.plantea.com.hr/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/066.jpg)\n\nTratinčica (krasuljak, Bellis), rod bilja porodice Asteraceae, red Asterales, razred Magnoliopsida, koljeno Magnoliophyta. Tratinčica je od davnina zastupljena u narodnoj medicini za čišćenje organizma, liječenje iscrpljenosti i krvnih bolesti. U nordijskoj je mitologiji posvećena Ostari, božici proljeća, a po kršćanskoj predaji, njeni su cvjetovi nikli iz suza Marijinih, koje je prolila u bijegu za Egipat. Mladi listovi i cvjetovi su jestivi. Tratinčica je idealna za proljetne kure čišćenja organizma od toksina. U tu je svrhu najbolje piti njen svježi sok ili je jesti. Sok treba uvijek svježe pripremiti. Pijte dnevno jednu do tri pune žlice soka s pola količine vode. Pomiješan s medom, sok je kućni lijek kod oboljenja dišnih organa. Lijek je za upaljene rane, problematičnu kožu, opekline, edeme i varikozne vene. U terapijske svrhe stavlja se na oboljela mjesta. Listovi tratinčice su bogati vitaminima C i A . Jedu se u obliku salate, dodaju se varivima, juhama i jelima od povrća. Posebno su ukusni izmiješani sa svježim sirom. Nijemci salatu od listova tratinčice smatraju jednako ukusnom kao onu od matovilca. Tvrdi i zeleni pupoljci mogu se marinirati u octu te koristiti umjesto kapara. Glavice cvjetova također su jestive te se najčešće koriste za ukrašavanje deserta, a mogu se i kandirati.\n\nDakako pri branju nikako ne smijemo biti rukovođeni pohlepom i željom da sve eto uzmemo za sebe jer ne zaboravimo da o ovom resursu zavisi i ne malobrojan životinjski svijet. Naučite dobro raspoznavati samonikle biljke prije nego ih počnete koristiti.\n\nNagradno pitanje: Za jednu od navedenih biljki poslanik Muhamed rekao je: „Da znate vrijednost ove biljke, plaćali bi njenu težinu u zlatu.“ Znate li o kojoj se biljci radi?\n\nZa kraj, jedan zanimljiv [recept](https://gastro.24sata.hr/recepti/maslackovo-vino-15836).\n\nZa više informacija u/cesnjak77 preporučio je [Enciklopediju samoniklog jestivog bilja.](https://knjiga.hr/enciklopedija-samoniklog-jestivog-bilja-ljubisa-grlic-1/)",

I am blinded for a moment, but now wide awake. \n\nThe sun is out, and so are my balls. I lay on the deck and expose my taint to the sun as Huberman recommends. I have developed small growths on my balls which is why I no longer do this at noon. \n\nBack inside. I calm my ADHD by wagging my finger in front of my face and staring at it for a minute without blinking as Huberman pointed out is backed up by research. \n\nI then meditate and perform 15 to 30 cycles of the double inhale method to stimulate my parasympathetic nervous system. Then I fall deep into meditation. \n\nPrecisely 1.5 hours after waking, I eat a small breakfast of 20 to 25 supplements and take caffeine. I work for no less than four hours with total concentration, the day and it's challenges are like putty in my hands. \n\nI break for lunch at noon. After lunch I engage in strength training or HIIT training, as Huberman recommends. Then I take caffeine again, a smaller amount this time, and then engage in two hours of high quality, high productivity work. \n\nWork is done, now I am ready for the sauna. I sweat out the days toxins in a sauna, also meditating and listening to Huberman podcasts on my phone. \n\nWhen I'm finished I attend a pre-arranged social event, as Huberman recommends having friends. I despise these people but I must admit that being around other humans such as my girlfriend and her work friend Javarius brings me some satisfaction. \n\nI return from the social event exhausted, but having stimulated some oxytocin nonetheless. I turn off all devices at 8 PM and wear blue light blocking glasses. \n\nMy girlfriend is still at Javarius's house. He is helping her with a project at work she's been having trouble with. I'm thankful Javarius is so generous with his time. \n\nI take 50 mg of apigenin, 200 mg of magnesium glycinate or 144 mg of magnesium l-threonate (I alternate) and 200 mg of l-theanine, so I will fall asleep and I won't be disturbed when my girlfriend comes in later. \n\nI remove my blue light blocking glasses and put on my sleep mask and Huberman's podcast once again, falling asleep to the sound of his learned voice in my ears. \n\nI can confidently tell you that Huberman's Protocols have enriched my life beyond anything I've ever done. I am more productive than ever. If anybody has any other protocols I could add in here, feel free to share.",

    "body": "Mitochondria, the tiny powerhouses that fuel every process in our body, play a crucial role in how we age. Over time, these energy-producing structures become damaged, leading to fatigue, disease, and the gradual breakdown of our health. This process is known as mitochondrial dysfunction, and it is one of the major hallmarks of aging. But here’s the exciting part: by repairing our mitochondria, we can slow, stop, or even reverse some aspects of aging.\n\nThink about it—when we’re young, we have an abundance of strong, efficient mitochondria that keep us full of energy, help our muscles recover quickly, and allow our brains to function at peak performance. But as we get older, mitochondria start producing less energy and more harmful byproducts, like reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage cells and accelerate aging. This is why aging often feels like running out of battery life. The good news? Just like a rechargeable battery, our mitochondria can be restored.\n\nScientists have discovered multiple ways to repair and rejuvenate mitochondria, and one of the most powerful is boosting NAD+ levels. NAD+ is a vital molecule that mitochondria use to produce energy, but it declines dramatically with age. Compounds like NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide), NR (Nicotinamide Riboside), and Apigenin can replenish NAD+, bringing mitochondria back to life. Fasting and caloric restriction also naturally stimulate NAD+ production, keeping mitochondria in peak condition.\n\nBut restoring energy isn’t enough—we also need to create new, healthier mitochondria through a process called mitochondrial biogenesis. Exercise, especially high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and strength training, triggers the growth of new mitochondria, making cells more efficient. Certain supplements, like PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone) and Urolithin A, also stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis, essentially refreshing our energy systems from the inside out.\n\nAnother key to longevity is mitophagy, the body's natural process of clearing out old, damaged mitochondria. Think of it as taking out the trash—if we don’t remove faulty mitochondria, they start causing harm. Fasting, the ketogenic diet, and compounds like Resveratrol and Spermidine activate mitophagy, keeping mitochondria young and functional. This process is crucial for preventing neurodegenerative diseases, muscle loss, and other age-related conditions.\n\nHowever, while repairing and regenerating mitochondria is essential, we also need to protect them from further damage. Environmental toxins, processed seed oils, heavy metals, and excessive sugar intake all contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction. Meanwhile, antioxidants like CoQ10, Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA), and Astaxanthin act as shields, preventing oxidative stress from wearing down mitochondria. Even red light therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy can improve mitochondrial function by enhancing oxygen delivery and ATP production.\n\nMitochondria are the key to longevity. If we can keep them strong, we can maintain high energy levels, prevent disease, and slow down aging. Future breakthroughs in mitochondrial medicine could allow us to extend lifespan dramatically, but we don’t have to wait—we can start optimizing our mitochondria today. By combining the right nutrients, exercise, fasting, and protective strategies, we can take control of our biology and unlock the potential for a longer, healthier, and more youthful life.",

Some of the higher numbers seemed unlikely to me, but I figure the only way to really know would be to test it ourselves in the lab. My lab director went to Fry's Food And Drug here in town, and we purchased Kroger brand dried parsley. The hunt for apigenin was on!\n\nHere is the product in question: [https://imgur.com/a/CD7Gc1e](https://imgur.com/a/CD7Gc1e)\n\nI want to preface this by saying I am making no qualitative claims to the efficacy of Kroger's dried parsley flakes. I know some people may have had good results from consuming an entire can of these flakes, and I don't want to discount their experiences. Neither Fry's Food nor the Kroger corporation participated in this research. I've had these results for a few weeks, but I have held off on releasing them till now. I fear what the Kroger corporation might do to me, or what agents from big parsley have in store. However, this data has to get out to consumers!\n\nHere are the UPLC results: [https://imgur.com/a/cyqThtu](https://imgur.com/a/cyqThtu)\n\nAs you can see, we submitted the sample to the lab assuming that there was 4.5% apigenin in the flakes. However, we only found 0.001% apigenin! In fact, there was much more hesperidin and baicalin in the sample than apigenin. We did not do the calculations for concentration for the other flavones in the sample, because my lab techs said: \"We have a lot of other shit we need to get done! Can we be done with this stupid parsley shit?!?\" \n\nHere is our workbook calculation of apigenin: [https://imgur.com/a/CqztPKY](https://imgur.com/a/CqztPKY)\n\nSo there you have it. This goes even deeper than anyone imagined! If you can't trust dried parsley in a can, what can you trust these days?",

It's actually on the old Silk Road route from China. These days it is more of a parsley road. Parsley has grown wild there for thousands of years. Being so close to Uzbekistan, it's possible that parsley/Ajuga turkestanica plant hybrids have formed in the mountains near Khodzhapil.",

        "body": "LOL, this post was mostly a joke. However, I just looked at the USDA results. The USDA DID NOT DO THE TESTING... They are citing other papers. That's why the table has reference numbers. Let's look at the two parsley results in there. The dried sample is code 02029, and it is on page 14. However, they tested a second fresh parsley sample as well. NDB number 11297 on page 75. Those results are very different than the other sample.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/BshuX4U\n\nThe second fresh parsley sample they tested had 215.46mg/100g. That's 0.215%. Very low amounts. As I said, it is likely going to vary, as nobody is standardizing to apigenin in parsley sold as a spice. Maybe you get a batch with high amounts. Maybe you don't. That's how non-standardized things work. If you don't see a value in a standardized apigenin, and think eating random parsley for its apigenin content makes more sense, well then you are just being daft. Let's look at the actual primary sources for these numbers now. The dried parsley uses references 119 and 173.\n\n119 is: [Quantitative variation in Brazilian vegetable sources of flavonols and flavones](https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.08.030)\n\n173 is: [Determination of flavonoids in plant material by HPLC with diode-array and electro-array detections](https://sci-hub.se/10.1021/jf000661f)\n\nSo 119 is from Brazilian parsley. [Here are the results](https://imgur.com/a/ZE2Ww1U). As you can see, they are in mcg/g. That's the same as ppm. So that's 1,521ppm and 1,636ppm. That's 0.15% and 0.16%, respectively. Also very low. Let's look at 173. [Here are those results](https://imgur.com/a/1OJCf4U). OHH SNAP! The numbers don't match the USDA claims... Surprise surprise. They found 1,484.2mg/100g. That's 1.48% apigenin. That's higher than the other paper, but nowhere near the table in the USDA paper. Maybe they fat-fingered it? Hard to say, but the numbers don't match up. Also, this is not a USDA lab doing this. The first paper was Universidade Estadual de Campinas in Brazil. The second was the Agricultural Research Centre of Finland. Actually reading the papers you link helps when making claims about them...\n\nLet's look at the references for the fresh parsley. Those are 128, 129, 164, 231, 119. We have already looked at 119.\n\n128 is: [Composition of flavonoids in fresh herbs and calculation of flavonoid intake by use of herbs in traditional Danish dishes](https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/s0308-8146%2801%2900114-5)\n\nMmmm, Danish. They found 510-630mg/100g. That's 0.51% to 0.63%. Also very low.\n\n129 is: [Quantitative analysis of flavonols, flavones, and flavanones in fruits, vegetables and beverages by high-performance liquid chromatography with photo-diode array and mass spectrometric detection](https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/s0021-9673%2897%2901061-3)\n\nThis one is from Denmark. A Møøse once bit my sister... They found 185mg/100g. That's 0.18%. \n\n164 is: [FLAVONOID AGLYCONS IN FOODS OF PLANT ORIGIN I. VEGETABLES](https://sci-hub.se/10.1556/AAlim.29.2000.4.4)\n\nThis one is from Budapest. I actually got robbed in Budapest once. It was at a club down a dark alley. I lost about $500. Bastards! This study found ZERO APIGENIN in the parsley they tested. That's 0.00%, in case you were wondering.\n\n231 is: [Simultaneous Determination of All Polyphenols in Vegetables, Fruits, and Teas](https://sci-hub.se/10.1021/jf020926l)\n\nThis one is from the Department of Life Science, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kobe University Japan. They found 8.6 μmol/100g apigenin in their parsley sample. Apigenin has a molar mass of 270.0528 g/mol. That means they found 0.2% apigenin. Very low again. \n\nSo what did we learn here today? Reading the actual papers linked is crucial to making any scientific determination on things. The USDA did not analyze any samples themselves. It was essentially a meta analysis, where they cited other papers. The cited papers found very small amounts of apigenin in the parsley samples they found. The parsley they tested was from all over the world. The numbers ranged wildly, as you would expect for a non-standardized plant. Eating random fresh or dried parsley is not going to give you much apigenin, and you will never have any real idea of how much is in your specific batch you are consuming. This is why we make standardized products that you can always know exactly what you are getting. If you want to shove random bunches of parsley in your mouth instead of taking a lab tested product that you know exactly what it contains, GO FOR IT!",

    "body": "**TLDR**: Here is everything I've tried for suspected hydrogen/methane SIBO. This is not medical advice intended to treat or diagnose anyone, just my own case study.\n\nI didn't take all of these at once, I usually took no more than 2-4 herbs at a time. For extra liver safety when taking multiple herbs at once, look up CYP interactions between the herbs and any existing medications you take and avoid taking combinations that might interact (or consult with your doctor). Most of the supplements I used are from Thorne Research, Pure Encapsulations, Metagenics, Organic India, Life Extensions, and Designs for Health. Research your brands carefully; the supplement industry is largely unregulated.\n\n# Helpful\n\n**Bolded** are the most helpful; interventions in which I noticed a difference almost immediately.\n\nHerbals:\n\n* **Berberine** (works best on empty stomach)\n* **Allicin** (works best on empty stomach for me, but causes reflux and gastritis after awhile so I can only take it for a couple of weeks at a time)\n* **Neem** (1000mg, with meal)\n* Oil of Oregano (Very strong...I caution against jumping to this one immediately. I always took with meals since I couldn't tolerate this on an empty stomach.)\n* Olive leaf extract (empty stomach)\n* Grape seed extract (empty stomach)\n* Nigella sativa extract (empty stomach)\n* Milk thistle (silymarin)\n\nMotility agents:\n\n* **Ginger** (specifically MotilPro, but it eventually caused heartburn and LPR for me so I had to stop)\n* **Triphala** (empty stomach)\n* **Magnesium citrate** (up to 400mg per day, although I usually take 100-200mg, or 300mg at most)\n* **Artichoke extract** (empty stomach)\n* MCT oil (i'd take a teaspoonful whenever i was feeling particularly backed up, as an emergency treatment)\n* spoonful of olive oil on empty stomach in the morning\n* dark chocolate (Double edged sword as this also increased histamine reactions for me. Also need to be careful what dark chocolate you buy because many sources of chocolate have high levels of heavy metals in them.)\n\nFiber supplements:\n\n* **Bimuno**\n* Sunfiber\n\nDigestive aids:\n\n* **Betaine HCl with pepsin** (I was taking up to 6 500mg pills per meal at one point, and tapered slowly off of that as I started producing more stomach acid. Stress also lowers the amount of stomach acid you produce. The die-off from taking 1 pill of this for the first time frightened me and I almost didn't try it again, I got very dizzy and almost felt like I was going to faint. I'm very glad I tried again.)\n\nLifestyle changes:\n\n* **EMDR** or IBS focused meditation\n* Walking, running, or other forms of low/medium impact cardio exercise\n* Squats/deadlifts (can trigger bowel movements)\n* **Sleeping before 1am**\n* **Sleeping > 6 hours a night**\n* Not eating 3-4 hours before bed\n* **No snacks between meals** (good for motility)\n* Whatever activities or changes you can do in your life to reduce stress\n* Singing or karaoke (stimulates vagus nerve, self-soothing)\n\nDietary changes:\n\n* Avoiding dairy ([How do you think methanogens got into your gut?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5344914/))\n* Increase variety of plant foods - eat the rainbow, and eat organic if possible, or at least avoid the [Dirty Dozen](https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/summary.php)\n* Specific foods that encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria in your gut microbiome: walnuts, kiwi, pomegranate, broccoli sprouts, legumes (lentils and green peas being two of the most easily tolerated ones, especially if you didn't previously eat a lot of legumes), sweet potatoes, spices (black peppercorn). There are many more beneficial whole foods, these are just some of my favorites that I try to eat every couple of days.\n* Eating something like the mediterranean diet (low to medium fat, low to medium protein, medium low-glycemic carb intake, high in fiber, plants, spices, fruits, and polyphenols) turns out to be healthiest for [your gut microbiome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5385025/) - everything in moderation, no major restrictions in diet\n\nProbiotics:\n\nI am especially picky with probiotics because I noticed increased histamine/MCAS-like reactions to some probiotics that I've taken in the past. I try not to take any probiotics these days that aren't single-strain. The strands below should all be non-histamine producing or releasing strains.\n\n* **B. longum bb563**\n* **B. coagulans MTCC 5856 (Lactospore)**\n* B. infantis\n* S. Boulardii CNCM I-745 (Florastor)\n\nBiofilm buster:\n\n* Nattokinase (be careful taking this if you're on blood thinners)\n\n# Didn't notice a big difference, but potentially helpful\n\n**Bolded** are interventions that I felt were more on the \"potentially helpful\" end of \"no difference\" for digestive issues, or things that I would consider trying again. Some of these I took for their adaptogen or mood-boosting effects, hoping that it would lessen stress and help with stomach pain or reflux, but ultimately I didn't notice a huge change from taking them. I'm no longer taking most of these, and of the ones I've continued taking, I'm taking them for reasons other than digestive health.\n\nHerbals:\n\n* **Atrantil** (2x pills per meal)\n* Andrographis\n* Artemisinin (another one to be careful of taking long-term, i suggest no more than 2 weeks at the most)\n* Fenugreek\n* Asafoetida (mostly used in cooking, great for making legumes easier to tolerate)\n* Cinnamon\n* **Parsley oil**\n* **Quercetin** (helped with increased histamine reactions caused by probiotics but didn't do much for stomach problems)\n* Gymnostemma\n* Pomegranate extract (Some research actually shows that this can decrease acidity in your stomach, so be careful about taking it if you already suspect low acid. I always take this for a couple of days when I notice any gastritis symptoms and it helps a lot with that.)\n* Green tea extract\n* **Sulforaphane** (careful taking this for longer than 2-3 weeks at a time, stop immediately if you start feeling any pain in your liver)\n* Apigenin\n* Tumeric/Curcumin (caused increased reflux for me too)\n* Cranberry extract\n* Ashwagandha\n* Mushrooms (reishi, lion's mane, chaga, turkey tail - some of these actually increased constipation for me)\n* Astaxanthin\n* Bittermelon extract\n* **Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice**\n* **Slippery elm**\n* **Marshmallow extract**\n* Aloe Vera extract\n\nFiber:\n\n* Arabinogalactan\n* Acacia fiber\n* Glucomannan\n* Apple pectin\n* Flax seed fiber\n* Psyllium husk ([Taking too much of this (or any fiber) can actually increase constipation too](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435786/).)\n* **Beta-glucan**\n* **HMOs**\n* Modified citrus pectin\n\nOther supplements:\n\n* Inositol (Didn't have any particular improvement in digestive issues, but I've continued taking after noticing increased mood and wellbeing)\n* **Colostrum** (empty stomach in the morning)\n* Magnesium L-threonate\n* Magnesium glycinate (hoping it would help with sleep, but didn't really notice much benefit)\n* L-glutamine\n* **Vitamin C** (reducing severity of histamine reactions)\n* Iodine + Selenium\n* Zinc L-Carnitine\n* **Vitamin B12** (I still take about 1000mg once a week, just because I don't eat that much meat)\n* Vitamin D3 + K2 (I still take this because I don't get that much sunlight)\n* Omega 3 Fish Oil\n* Phosphatidylcholine\n* Ubiquinol\n* D-Limonene (tried for acid reflux)\n* Sodium Alginate (tried for acid reflux)\n\nDigestive aids:\n\n* Swedish bitters\n* **Digestive enzymes**\n* Beano\n\nBiofilm busters:\n\n* Serrapeptase\n* Klaire Labs Interfase Plus\n\nProbiotics:\n\n* Biogaia L. reuteri DSM 17938 (I made yogurt with this too and also didn't notice a huge difference...it may have actually increased my gas a little, as many lactobacilli seem to do)\n* Pendulum Akkermansia (there's chicory inulin in this as a prebiotic which might cause some symptoms for people)\n* B. subtilis\n* Other various bifidobacterium strains\n\n# Possibly harmful\n\n* Any [lactic acid bacteria probiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6006167/) or fermented foods - kefir, kimchi, yogurt, sauerkraut\n* Processed foods\n* Seed oils\n* Sugar alcohols ([sorbitol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35792179/) found in prunes and apricots are often used to trigger bowel movements, but it doesn't seem to be good for you long term)\n* Artificial sweeteners and even some natural sweeteners ([stevia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9028423/)!)\n* Inulin, FOS (feeds everything, including fermenting bacteria)\n* Long-term FODMAP diet (reduces diversity of your gut microbiome over time)\n* Low salt diet (Sodium chloride is one of your main sources of chloride.

If you take anything away from this, let it be that there is always hope as long as you're still alive, and \"do your own research\" - by which I mean, try to read actual scientific articles from pubmed or other journals to confirm what you're reading online or consult with medical professionals (google scholar is a great resource!). Above all, rely on your own judgement: don't abdicate your critical thinking to anything you read on the internet, including this post.\n\nHere's my story. I was going through an intensely stressful period of my life 2 years ago, culminating in a junk food binge (I had nothing but ice cream, chips, and other processed foods for a week or two). Naively, I thought having some kimchi (probiotics are good right?) and various probiotics would make up for the recent binge. Soon after that I started having a bunch of symptoms:\n\n* Extreme bloating after meals, sometimes I was so bloated I was nauseated\n* Lots of burping, sometimes it would wake me up at night\n* Very little flatulence, all the gas felt like it was trapped in my stomach or colon\n* Constipation and a dull, nagging pain in lower left abdomen, near sigmoid colon (when constipated)\n* Sleeping on my left side when gassy was uncomfortable and painful, it felt like I was lying on some sort of bubble, gas trapped near my splenic flexure\n* Trouble taking a full breath when sleeping on my back\n* Waking up in the morning with sour/acidic taste in my mouth and pain in the back of my throat from acid reflux due to increased gas\n* Could not eat anything with FODMAPs in it without a lot of pain and suffering\n* Increased allergies and histamine reactions\n* Brain fog, fatigue and dizziness, especially after eating\n\nI went to multiple doctors and gastroenterologists who just diagnosed me with IBS and told me to try the FODMAP diet. They refused to do diagnostic exams (endoscopy and colonoscopy) due to my younger age (mid 20s) and lack of occult blood in stool. I tested negative for H. Pylori, but I never ended up taking any SIBO-specific breath tests and mostly went by symptoms and how I felt. My guess was that I was mostly dealing with hydrogen and methane SIBO, as I never had sulfuric smelling gas or diarrhea (besides when I accidentally overused motility agents at various times).\n\nI started with one of the standard herbal treatments recommended in this subreddit:\n\n* Candibactin BR, 2x in the morning, 2x at night\n* Candibactin AR, 1x with every meal\n\nI did this for about 2-3 weeks and felt an almost immediate relief after the first week and a half, although the first couple of days were unbearable with increased die-off gas. In hindsight I'm not sure if I did the right thing going with oregano oil right off the bat. It's very strong and I think I may have permanently damaged my microbiome in some way, because after around 3 months of remission, I started to notice the constipation and pain in my sigmoid colon. What followed that was multiple rounds of different types of herbals as I reached a slightly more \"stable\" place and then relapsed repeatedly. I've listed all the things that I tried above. Most of my rounds were 4-6 weeks long, and then I'd take a break. Taking 2-4 herbs at a time seemed to be mostly safe as I had blood tests during my yearly physicals that showed no abnormalities and good liver numbers.\n\nWhat were my root causes? I suspect high stress (slows gut motility, reduces production of stomach acid), improper use of lactic acid bacteria probiotics and fermented food (fermented food might be fine for people who don't have compromised gut motility, but the food just ended up sitting in my stomach and fermenting even more), and binging on dairy (big source of methanogens in the gut). All of my relapses can be traced back to attempts to fix things with lactic acid bacteria probiotics, fermented food, slipping and having dairy (one of my relapses was caused by a cheese binge!), or having another stressful period in my life where I'd start eating poorly, sleeping poorly, skipping meals, and not exercising.\n\nAfter the most recent round, which was 5 months ago, I've been eating onions, garlic, and other FODMAPs with no problems. I have no major restrictions in my diet besides dairy: I eat nuts, fruit, meat, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, oatmeal, etc, many of which I used to find difficult to digest. I'm still taking Triphala, 100mg magnesium citrate, B. longum bb563, Bimuno, and Sunfiber supportively, but no antibiotic herbals. I've been tapering off the magnesium citrate (down from 300mg/day) and have started to taper off Triphala as well. Current schedule: fiber supplements + probiotics in the morning, magnesium citrate with my evening meal, Triphala on an empty stomach before bed.\n\nAm I cured? I'm not sure...this might be something that I'll have to deal with again in the future. But I'm definitely feeling more optimistic than I've ever been about it, and each time I finish a round of herbals, I've noticed that I'm getting closer and closer to normal. So maybe one day! Good luck to everyone reading this!",

I had brought up SIBO and getting breath tested with my doctors early on and they felt that it wasn't a real medical diagnosis and they convinced me that the breath tests were unreliable, and upon further research, it did seem that there was mixed evidence on the reliability of breath tests. I had a bunch of blood tests, stool parasite tests, and other diagnostic exams to rule out other possible differential diagnoses. I also hesitated when I saw the upfront cost of the breath test without a doctor's approval and insurance coverage, and didn't know how much money I would eventually end up sinking into trying various treatments.\n\nHonestly, I should have breath tested anyway, verified my self-diagnosis, and dealt with any confusing data before taking anything, but in the end I was just so bothered by the symptoms and not in a good state of mind at the time that I tried the Candibactin treatments first (thinking then that most herbals were less harmful than antibiotics, which I know now isn't necessarily true).\n\nBy the time I relapsed again after oregano oil, I had done more of my own reading and come to the conclusion that most of the other interventions I was trying (even the herbs) was fairly low risk in terms of long term harm to the gut microbiome compared to oregano oil or antibiotics. I probably would have wanted to do much more rigorous testing if any doctors had proposed putting me on some of the more intense antibiotics (neomycin for example) but the doctors basically told me they had no treatments for me and refused to prescribe antibiotics for my case (since I was mostly having constipation and bloating and no diarrhea, and there was no vomiting or blood in my stool).\n\nMy personal philosophy in trying to fix my own issues is based on general improvement and health of the gut microbiome as a whole, including herbal treatments that may disrupt gut dysbiosis conditions.  There are many interventions that I continue to do (lifestyle and dietary changes, some herbals) that I would have done even if I had a negative breath test or no existing gut dysbiosis. Maybe I should have posted this in a different subreddit, like r/Microbiome. But r/SIBO was the first reddit community that I found and I felt helped me a lot, and I thought sharing my experiences might help others in some way. I don't necessarily think that people should do what I did - I made my own share of careless mistakes during the trial and error process I took. If I were to go back to the beginning with the knowledge I have now I'm not sure I would take the same approach.\n\nI'm feeling well enough now and basically unbothered by symptoms on a day to day basis that I don't think I would necessarily get breath tested at the moment, but I would definitely consider it if I relapsed again.",

Just slept for 8 hours for the first time in 5 years. Woke up after 5 hrs and then slept 3 more hours.\n\nHow did I do it? After hundreds of hours researching I did the following:\n\n1. Corrected my circadian rhythm with the help of bright light therapy after waking up. Went to bed at the same time each night. This rhythm was crucial for falling asleep with ease. \n\n2. Supplemented with magnesium, chamomile tea(for the apigenin) and collagen(for glycine content) just before going to bed. This improved my sleep quality significantly, especially when I started with collagen infused chamomile tea.\n\n3. Stopped eating 2-3 hours before bedtime. This is good both for not leaving work for your stomach to do during the night and also for improving the absorbtion of supplements, especially the collagen.\n\n4. I have obstructive sleep apnea according to my ex which I solved by sewing a small plastic ball to the back of my pyjamas top. This worked really well, I don't roll over to sleep on my back anymore which means I don't get that obstructed breathing during the night.\n\n5. I use blue light blockers on all my screens during the evening.\n\n6. I keep a radio clock next to my bed to get away from morning anxiety which keeps me from getting out of bed sometimes.\n\n7. I blocked all incoming light from my windows, even street lamps could light up my room slightly before, now it's pitch black.\n\n\nToday I woke up feeling rested for the first time in years! I didn't crash 1 hour after waking up like I normally do.\n\nJust wanted to share this maybe it can help someone.",

I realized alot of things were outside of my control but my sleep hygiene was something I could change, and I did.\n\nThe consequence is that I threw alot of solutions at my sleep issue/depression at the same time as they came up through my research. Therefor it's hard to say what really had effect, but all these things combined solved my sleep issues in maybe a week's time. \n\nThe most obvious things for me was morning bright light therapy and going to bed at the same time - this reduced my time to sleep surprisingly fast.  It was fixed in a few days. I think I basically strengthened and adapted to my circadian rhythm with this approach. \n\nRegarding longer and higher quality sleep that is more complex, I guess you could consider one night's sleep as a big wave which pushes your number of sleep cycles and the size of that wave is built up by many different things. But I noticed the largest effect on sleep duration when I added collagen and apigenin.\n\nThe exact effect on my sleep quality is something I haven't measured but that would've been interesting to see what and how the different things affected me in detail. I figured I'd just throw everything at the issue and see where I landed. It worked out fine in the end and I learned alot.",

If enough people feel it would be benificial I could properly compose the results of my research. I'm just writing from my phone now. \n\nThe most important part is to do the bright light therapy in the morning and have enough strength in your light source. Around 10.000 lux is needed for 30min, or less light but for a longer time. Remember 10.000 lux is a measure involving light intensity, surface area and distance so don't fall for the marketing ploy of \"10.000lux, but 1 inch from your face\". I just bought a ceiling LED-panel of 4k lumen(measure of light intensity) to put up on my wall. It's just 40euros while \"bright light therapy lamps\" are more expensive and weaker. \n\nAbout the supplements that's a deep subject as well and I did alot of reading in r/Supplements and r/Nootropics and just generally scavaging the internet for natural sleep aids. Collagen is a protein from animal cartilage which contains large amounts of an Amino acid called glycine. There is some research evidence and anecdotal reports that it helps with sleep through regulating body temperature and lowering cortisol. \nL-glycine is sometimes sold as a supplement for sleep  but my understanding is that isolated amino acids are not good for reasons I won't elaborate on here but mainly you can build tolerance, which is why a broader amino acid spectrum such as provided by collagen may be healthier in the long run. \n\nChamomile contains a flavonoid called apinegin which is also sold as a supplement, I haven't made to much research on it so I can't explain its mechanism.\nSame with magnesium.\n\nThe reason I choose these are because compared to melatonin and similar supplements, these last longer in the body which means they will have an effect on your length of sleep and overall sleep quality. They are also the most natural solution since they are a part of our diet.",

    "body": "([Cross-posted from my Medium](https://moreisdifferent.medium.com/i-tried-all-the-sleep-medications-so-you-dont-have-to-6eb750a80992))  \n\n\nIn July 2022, about a month after getting COVID-19, I developed the worst insomnia I've ever experienced. All through August I was only getting about 5 hours a night. I've only experienced that sort of prolonged insomnia once before and the post-COVID insomnia was worse. No doubt the post-COVID fatigue contributed a lot because I was very inactive during the day. The particular form of insomnia I experienced was \"sleep maintenance insomnia\" --- I would wake up after 4 or 5 hours of sleep and be unable to get back to sleep. I also had tinnitus all through August too. I suspect that [Epstein-Barr reactivation](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/10/6/763) was involved.\n\nIt took over a year to get my sleep straightened out. During that time I decided to try all of the different types of sleep medications that are available. I figured if there was one that worked really well it would be worth finding it. My undertaking was partially inspired by Luisa Rodriguez's [post on trying all the antidepressants](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Eq8nwNPNhfXvt2TWj/my-experience-experimenting-with-a-bunch-of-antidepressants).\n\nI also read a [couple of](https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Solution-Why-Your-Broken/dp/0399583602) [books on](https://www.amazon.com/Say-Good-Night-Insomnia-Drug-Free/dp/0805089586) [sleep](https://www.amazon.com/Sound-Sleep-Mind-Sleeping-through/dp/111851601X). After trying many meds and reading the books I've become rather opposed to the use of sleep medications. Here are my takeaways:\n\n* The best first-line treatment for insomnia is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-i) (I've put a [free CBT-i manual](https://www.moreisdifferent.com/assets/CBTi_Manual.pdf) on my website).\n* Sleep medications can help to resolve treatment resistant insomnia by helping stop various vicious cycles that occur.\n* All sleep medications come with significant negative side effects. Most have tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal effects to one degree or another.\n* Many sleep medications are probably not safe for long term use.\n* Sleep medications should not be used for more than a week or two.\n* The new orexin antagonist sleep aids (Belsomra, Dayvigo, and Quviviq) are safer and have a more tolerable side effect profile than older sleep aids.\n\nFor more on why sleeping pills are bad, I recommend the book [*The Sleep Solution*](https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Solution-Why-Your-Broken/dp/0399583602) by Chris Winter. See also Scott Siskind's [Lorien Psychiatry page on Insomnia](https://lorienpsych.com/2021/01/02/insomnia/).\n\nThe fact is that sleep medications do a poor job addressing the root causes of insomnia. One of those causes is a weakened sleep-wake cycle. Weakening of the sleep-wake cycle is evidenced by the fact that patients with chronic insomnia have a circadian body temperature cycle that is flattened compared to healthy controls. Insomnia causes patients to be less active during the day because they are so tired. Patients with insomnia also spend more time napping and laying in bed long hours without sleeping. These behaviors weaken the sleep-wake cycle and worsen insomnia in a viscous cycle. A patient's bed may become associated with laying awake, not sleeping. CBT-i uses behavioral techniques to strengthen the sleep-wake cycle and condition the brain to associate lying in bed with sleep. Techniques used in CBT-i include restricting time in bed, increasing exercise, and eliminating naps.\n\nAnother root cause of insomnia is anxiety. Sometimes the anxiety is about something external and situational, but often it is about sleep itself. It doesn't help that insomnia messes up the brains ability to properly regulate emotions. In [his book](https://www.amazon.com/Say-Good-Night-Insomnia-Drug-Free/dp/0805089586) Gregg Jacobs talks about \"negative sleep thoughts\" (NSTs). The cognitive interventions of CBT-i address NSTs, by encouraging patients to challenge and recontextualize their NSTs. Over time, NSTs become less frequent, anxiety is reduced, and confidence in one's ability to sleep is regained.\n\nSleep medications may reduce anxiety temporarily, but they don't seem to do a good job re-programming the neural circuits that cause frequent NSTs. When sleep medications are discontinued, insomnia often rebounds and NSTs return. Sleep medications may also condition the user to believe that they need to take a sleep medication in order to sleep. This causes a new NST (\"I can't sleep without XYZ medication\").\n\nAll of that is to say that you should only use sleep medications as a last resort.\n\nHere (in rough chronological order) are the prescription medications I tried along with the doses I tried and mechanism of action:\n\n# Trazodone\n\n(15, 30, 75, 150 mg) (α-2 adrenergic and 5-HT2a antagonist)\n\nTrazodone at low doses causes sedation by antagonising the [α1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-1_adrenergic_receptor) adrenergic receptors, which relaxes muscles, and antagonizing the [α2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-2_adrenergic_receptor) adrenergic receptors, which reduces norepinephrine signaling. Also relevant are the fact it is a 5-HT2a antagonist and a very weak H1 antagonist. A small fraction of trazodone is metabolized via CYP3A4 to an active metabolite, mCPP. mCPP increases anxiety in animal models and has many other unattractive effects. mCPP concentrations vary via genetics and this may account for the widely varying response to trazodone reported online. Several drug interactions are possible with common psychiatric medications which may increase mCPP concentrations. Long story short, a small fraction of people (10%?) have a very bad reaction to this medication due to their CYP genetics, which results in a spike in mCPP in the middle of the night. The half life is 5--12 hours depending on genetics.\n\nThis medication helped end a two month bout of insomnia I had in 2019. However, it did nothing for me when it came to the horrific post-COVID insomnia I experienced in August 2022. I suggest starting with 25 mg and then moving up or down depending on your experience. It's important to tweak the dose. If you only sleep 5--6 hours, increase the dose slightly. If you are too sedated in the morning, make sure to take an hour before bed and decrease the dose. In 2019 12.5--24 mg worked well for me for a few months, after which I tapered off without issue. In 2023 I started at 25 mg and went all the way up to 150 mg but found zero benefit, for reasons that are a bit mysterious to me. At dosages of 12.5--50 mg, I found I noticed sedation and cognitive sluggishness until noon. The sedation is partially off-setable by caffeine. At dosages of 50 mg or higher, the sedation lingered though the next day.\n\n# Ativan\n\n(0.25, 0.5 mg) (benzodiazepine)Quite effective for sleep induction and maintenance, but also quite dangerous to take long term. Can have some carry-over effects to the next day. Would not recommend due to safety issues. It's kind of wild that psychiatrists are still willing to prescribe this for insomnia.\n\n# Zolpidem (Ambien)\n\n(6, 12 mg) (Z-drug)\n\nThe first few times I took this I felt really weird, both during the night and in the morning. You won't remember the night as clearly. Once I got off remeron, I took ambien for about 4--5 months. It does work well, and I can see why people like it. However, dependence sets in after only 2 days. After that, if you don't take it you won't sleep. To get off of it, you have to taper down over a few weeks, which is pretty easy since it can be split. I think it has some subtle negative next day effects. It probably messes with sleep quality. It's very hard to get insurance to cover it. I did randomly manage to get 20 pills a few times but for the most part I only could get 10 at a time. After several months my insurance would only cover 20 every 30 days (apparently this is some sort of mechanism to force you to get off of them? Kinda makes sense, honestly). There are long-term safety concerns with this. I generally don't recommend it except as a last resort.\n\n# Mirtazapine (Remeron)\n\n(2, 3.5, 7.5, 10, 15 mg) (H1 and 5-HT2a antagonist at low doses)\n\nI took this medication in 2015 (15 mg) and again in 2023 for several months (\\~7.5 mg). It is very effective for sleep induction and maintenance, and gives very deep, quality sleep, as shown by sleep trackers (multiple people I know have reported this --- one person I know calls it a \"miracle drug\" --- read this [interesting retrospective](https://mad.science.blog/2021/11/12/remeron-the-dream-drug/)). It transiently causes periodic limb movement which can disrupt sleep quality (there are multiple studies on this). Ultimately for me it caused RLS (restless legs syndrome) after 2 months of use. The RLS and next day sedation were too great of drawback. I will definitely not use again. It is hard to get off this medication too, as when you taper to lower doses it becomes more sedating! At 15 mg the sleep promoting effects are not as great due to the norephinephrine stimulation. The most sedating dose is probably around 3.75 mg or maybe 5 mg if I had to guess.\n\n# Zaleplon (Sonata)\n\n(2.5, 5, 10 mg) (Z-drug)\n\nThis is a bit of a miracle drug since it has very few residual effects due to its short half life (\\~1 hour). You can take it in the middle of the night. However, over time I came to realize that it was causing me slight cognitive problems the next day. My guess is that this was due to it disrupting sleep quality --- there are some studies indicating z-drugs are not good for sleep architecture and quality. As with ambien, dependence sets in after only a few days. My psychiatrist kept prescribing me this even though I told him to stop and I ended up taking for a few months. I'm glad I'm off of it now.\n\n# Clonidine\n\n(0.025, 0.05, 0.1 mg) (α-2 adrenergic antagonist)\n\nThis might help with Long COVID, [similar to guanfacine](https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/potential-new-treatment-for-brain-fog-in-long-covid-patients/#:~:text=Guanfacine%20and%20NAC%20Relieve%20Long%20COVID%20Brain%20Fog&text=Since%20then%2C%20Fesharaki%2DZadeh%20has,2%20mg%20after%20one%20month.). It seemed to help my Long COVID fatigue and brain fog a bit. When I took it clonidine improved my sleep duration a lot, but I could only take it for a few days at a time because it would induce depression-like symptoms. The mechanism of action here is sort of opposite of wellbutrin, so the depression-induction makes sense. I found a tiny, tiny dose was all I needed (1/4 or even 1/8 of a 0.1 mg tablet).\n\nIt seems to help people with ADHD as well, and it can be synergistic with ADHD stimulants or a high dose of wellbutrin.\n\n# Hydroxyzine\n\n(2.5, 5 mg) (H1 antagonist)\n\nThis is a strong antihistamine with a long half life (14--20 hours). I could not tolerate it very well due to the next day sedation. It also killed my libido (probably due to the dopamine receptor antagonism?). This is a safe and effective medication as an \"emergency break\" if you really can't sleep and want to sleep for a long time, but it's not good overall due to the long half life and next day sedation. Still, apparently some people do not find the next day sedation an issue and it is safer than many of the other drugs on this list (like Z-drugs or gabapentin).\n\n# Gabapentin\n\n(100, 200, 300, 400 mg) (Calcium channel blocker, possible GABAnergic)\n\nI was getting restless legs syndrome (RLS) from Remeron in January 2023, so that's when I first experimented with this. I got no restless legs during the 4--5 days I took it but it made me feel like a zombie the next day. In August 2023 a sleep study found that I had really severe periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) which was interfering with my ability to get deep sleep. I also was experiencing severe RLS about once a week even though I had stopped taking Remeron. I started 100 mg gabapentin and it gave me really good sleep. My [Withings sleep tracker](https://www.withings.com/us/en/sleep) showed a perfect cycle for the first time since I had started using it in January 2023. The difference I saw on my sleep tracker was stark and dramatic, almost hard to believe. The \"feeling like a zombie the next day\" thing went away after a few days. However, I developed tolerance to the sleep-promoting effects after about two weeks and had to increase my dose to 200 mg, then 300 mg, and finally 400 mg. At 400 mg it seemed to interfere with my ability to function during the day. As I learned how to manage and treat the PLMD/RLS other ways (like boosting my iron and vitamin D levels and exercising more), I slowly tapered down to 75 mg, which is the dose I currently take (as of January 2024). My plan is to eventually taper off completely, but I am in no rush to do so. Gabapentin has a short half-life of only 5 hours but it seems some of the effects of this medication linger through the next day. Gabapentin [inhibits synaptogensis,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5980510/) which obviously is not good. However, 75-100 mg is a tiny dose (standard dosages for pain management are 1200--3600 mg per day). There is much more that could be said about Gabapentin, given its widespread use for a plethora of conditions, but I think I've written enough. It was helpful for me, but that' only because I was in a bit of a bind with PLDS/RLS. Overall, I recommend avoiding this because of the tolerance and dependence effects. There may be long-term safety issues too.\n\n# Doxepin\n\n(3 mg) (H1 antagonist at low doses)\n\nThis is an antidepressant that hits a lot of receptors, but at low doses it's mostly just hitting the H1 receptor. I took it once and had a bad experience, so never tried it again. I do not recommend. The half-life (15 hours) is too long in my view.\n\n# Dayvigo:\n\n(2.5, 5 mg) (Dual orexin receptor antagonist)\n\nUnfortunately this medication is hard to obtain because many psychiatrists haven't heard of it. The only downside I noticed was that after 2--3 weeks of use I noticed I wasn't functioning very well during the day. I believe this was due to build up due to the long terminal half-life of this drug. While it has a long half-life, the intial peak in concentration and time-on-receptor is only \\~6 hours, so next day sedation is not much of an issue. This drug is pretty gentle overall. I have even taken small amounts of this in the middle of the night with no major downside in the morning. This is one of the best medications I've found personally, along with ultra low dose gabapentin (50--100 mg).\n\n# Quviviq\n\n(12.5, 25 mg) (Dual orexin receptor antagonist)\n\nSimilar effects to Dayvigo but had more next-day sedation. So I've only taken it a few times. (Dayvigo has a longer terminal half life in the blood but shorter initial peak and apparently shorter time on receptor. I believe what happens is Dayvigo is stored in fat and then slowly leaks out, but I'm not sure (see [this plot)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemborexant#/media/File:Peak_normalized-concentrations_of_suvorexant_and_lemborexant_with_administration_at_steady_state_in_humans.png). Pharacokinetics can be complicated!) Some people online with Long COVID or ME/CFS really like this one.\n\n# Ramelteon\n\n(4, 8 mg) (Melatonin receptor agonist)\n\nI found this effective, but will not use again because of the surprising level of next day sedation given the relatively short half life (1--2 hours for the parent drug and \\~3 hours for the active metabolite). It basically left me feeling like a zombie most of the next day. I think you can just take extended release melatonin instead and get a similar effect without the next day sedation (Life Extension IR/XR 1.5 mg is what I take now). Surprisingly, [research shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3173578/) this medication has greater next day sedation than zopiclone (an ambien-like drug with a half life of 4--6 hours). The reason for this is a bit mysterious to me. Studies show it reduces testosterone by \\~15%. If you have lowish testosterone to begin with like I do (mine is around 315) that is a deal-breaker in my book.\n\n# Supplements I've tried\n\n**Apigenin (50 -200 mg)** \\--- I noticed no effect. It's embarassing that Huberman recommends this. There is no science on it, and it has extremely low bioavailability.\n\n**CBD (various brands & doses from 2 mg to 200 mg)** \\--- I noticed no effect. There is no science to back up the use of CBD and some evidence it can make it harder to sleep, not help. IMO stay away from this.\n\n**CBN (10 --300 mg)** \\--- I found this helpful at the higher end of the dose range but the effects went away after a few days. A friend reported a similar experience. The half life is extremely long (32 hours), so it doesn't seem to be a good option for that reason alone. Large doses are also expensive to buy.\n\n**THC (1--2 mg)** \\--- this makes it much harder for me to sleep, not easier. It doesn't make much sense to me that something that increases heart rate would promote sleep. Some people swear by it though. It appears it has dramatically different effects on different people.\n\n**Magnesium glycinate (500 mg)** \\--- did not notice any effect but I take occasionally in an attempt to manage restless legs.\n\n**Glycine (1--2 g)** \\--- I've experimented with this off and on over the years. It's very safe since its an amino acid. I think I've noticed a slight effect from it.\n\n**Taurine (500 mg)** \\- did not notice any effect. I may not have taken enough. I was wary about taking it due to the complete lack of scientific data on it.\n\n**L-theanine -**\\-- I have used this off and on over the years (200 mg before bed, 200--400 mg if I wake up in the middle of night). It seems to help me fall asleep and also increases dreaming and REM sleep. It appears to be quite safe and has a short half life. It is recommended by Andrew Huberman.\n\n**Valerian** \\--- I have used this off and on since 2012. It is mildly effective but might not be safe for long-term use since the mechanism of action is somewhat similar to benzodiazapines. It has a short-ish half life (\\~4 hours) so can be taken in the middle of the night without too many residual effects in the morning.\n\n**Sleep support stack from Nootropics Depot** \\--- This seemed to shorten my sleep slightly but also increase sleep quality (?). I investigated the ingredients and its actually more of a nootropic than a sleep supplement (many of the ingredients are acetylcholine boosters). Acetylcholine boosting is not recommended during sleep since acetylcholine plays an important role in modulating sleep cycles, so I would stay away from this product. Also, [Scott Alexander did a self-blinded study on it and found no effect.](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/02/17/sleep-support-an-individual-randomized-controlled-trial/)\n\n**Lemon balm from Nootropics Depot** \\--- the effect of this is subtle but it does do something. It seems to work on the GABA receptors similar to benzos so may not be safe for long term use. The active ingredient appears to be rosemarinic acid. Rosemarinic acid has short half-life ([about 1 hour?](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1301-8648)) so overall drug exposure is quite low. I have found this useful if I wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep.",

        "body": "I would like to share my experience with quviviq, particularly for those who might benefit from a detailed account. I have struggled with severe insomnia since childhood, compounded by significant restless leg syndrome (RLS). Over the course of my 33 years, I have experimented with many sleep medications. I underwent two separate sleep studies: one failed to identify the underlying cause of my insomnia, while the other revealed that my orexin production was substantially higher than average. Orexin is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating arousal, wakefulness, and appetite. In addition to keeping the body alert, orexin is involved in maintaining the sleep-wake cycle; an overproduction can lead to difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep by perpetuating a state of heightened arousal.\n\nThroughout these years, I tried more than 20 different sleep drugs, along with a wide range of supplements—many of which lack strong scientific backing. It was not until I began taking quviviq that I observed a marked improvement in my sleep quality. Importantly, while OP has reported discontinuing quviviq after only a few days, my experience indicates that it should be administered for at least four weeks to evaluate its full effect. Initially, I noticed little difference aside from a slight daytime drowsiness; however, around three weeks into the regimen, the daytime fatigue subsided and my sleep began to improve. My nightly sleep increased from an average of 2–3 hours to 4–4.5 hours, and I now regularly achieve 7–8 hours of sleep. Although the sleep quality is not perfect, it is significantly better than the poor-quality, minimal sleep I experienced for most of my life.\n\nTwo key factors have contributed to my improved sleep:\n\nOptimizing Sleep Timing: I discovered that my optimal bedtime is around 3:30 a.m., which aligns with my natural circadian rhythm. After years of developing skills that allowed me to secure a job with flexible working hours, I can now go to sleep when I feel naturally tired, rather than forcing sleep within conventional social norms.\n\nConsistent Use of Quviviq: I have now been on quviviq for one year, and its impact on my sleep has been profound. Although my sleep is not perfect every night, the quality is approximately ten times better than before. Additionally, quviviq appears to lessen my RLS symptoms, even if it does not eliminate them entirely.\n\nA word of caution: Quviviq’s studies suggest that the medication is non-dependent, with participants experiencing no withdrawal symptoms even after six months of use. However, my personal experience differed. When my insurance encountered issues, I was unable to take quviviq for three weeks, during which time my sleep quality regressed to 2–3 hours per night and I felt noticeably more fatigued. While I did experience what I consider withdrawal symptoms, I am not asserting that quviviq is solely to blame. Factors such as my age, being 33 years old, and thus lesser resilience to sleep deprivation could be at fault.\n\n\nEdit: Grammar",

Now is that because it actually makes my RLS better, or because I just fall asleep faster and sleep deeper, as such I do not notice the RLS as much, I cannot tell you exactly. However there have been some studies that showed that decreasing Orexin bindings helps reduce RLS. So I would contribute it to both. \n\nAlso OP, if you still have not found something that works for you consistently, I highly recommend QUIVIQ if you can get it with insurance. Just remember it's one of those drugs that builds up in your system, and thus doesn't work right away. If you look into the studies done on it, the highest improvement people saw was 3 months into taking it, which also has been my experience.",

Apigenin is a bioactive plant compound that inhibits cellular aging processes and could protect against age-related cognitive dysfunction, but its mechanisms of action in the brain have not been comprehensively studied. We characterized brain transcriptome changes in young and old mice treated with apigenin in drinking water. We observed improved learning/memory in old treated mice, and our transcriptome analyses indicated that differentially expressed genes with aging and apigenin were primarily related to immune responses, inflammation, and cytokine regulation. Moreover, we found that genes/transcripts that were increased in old vs. young mice but downregulated with apigenin treatment in old animals were associated with immune activation/inflammation, whereas transcripts that were reduced with aging but increased with apigenin were related neuronal function and signaling. We also found that these transcriptome differences with aging and apigenin treatment were driven in part by glial cells. To follow up on these in vivo transcriptome findings, we studied aged astrocytes in vitro, and we found that apigenin reduced markers of inflammation and cellular senescence in these cells. Collectively, our data suggest that apigenin may protect against age-related cognitive dysfunction by suppressing neuro-inflammatory processes.",

    "body": "Hello!\n\nI have noticed in the last year that I have morning boners very sporadically, maybe 1-2 days max a week and loss of morning libido, while for men it should be the moment of the day when reaching the peak.\n\nHowever, surprisingly, my testosterone increased in the last year and during my latest blood work I had total test at 700, which is great.\n\nI am 28, very active (training 5-6 days a week, both weight training and running) and eating a healthy diet, mostly based on animal proteins and fats.\n\nYou have any opinions about it and if it might be something else causing it? Maybe high prolactin?\n\nAny supplements helping?\n\nThanks!\n\nUpdate:\n\nI think I found something that helped me. I started supplementing with 20mg P5P before sleep and it helped me massively. Better sleep quality, feel more rested and recovered, my libido increased again, morning boners some days (and if not in the morning I keep getting spontaneous erections during the day, multiple times a day). I assume that I was dopamine/serotonin deprived and P5P is helping with this. I also introduced one more rest day, to slightly reduce the training load. \n\nJust for the record, in addition to P5P, I also added to my stack Apigenin 50mg and L-theanine 100mg before bed. They might also play a role, especially apigenin reduces aromatase and could then reduce estrogen levels. Also added 400mcg methylfolate in the morning and 60mg Gingko Biloba. But I still think P5P is doing the job since I did some trying and only when I take it I feel this effect more notably. ",

In another study apigenin and genistein have been shown to stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 and T47D cells [estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha-positive)], but do not stimulate the proliferation of an ER alpha-negative cell line (MDA-MB-435 cells) (93). These studies indicate that estrogenicity of the phytochemicals are quantitatively important in inducing cell proliferation or inhibiting aromatase, ***suggesting that perhaps a more cautionary approach should be taken before taken as food supplements*** (94).\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2874462/",

    "body": "Believe it or not, serotonin can act both as a neurotransmitter and a hormone. It is important for both our mental and physical wellbeing, affecting everything from our mood and behavior, to gut, heart, and blood vessel function. Low levels of serotonin are associated with mood disorders, migraines, and gut issues. Read on to discover how you can boost serotonin levels naturally.\n\nWhat is Serotonin?\n\nAccording to selfhacked; Serotonin is an important signaling molecule best known as the “**happiness neurotransmitter**” or the “**happiness hormone**“. It plays a very important role in the brain, where its main job is to transmit messages between nerve cells. In fact, serotonin is involved in virtually all human behavior \\[1, 2\\].\n\nHowever, brain serotonin comprises less than 2% of the total serotonin found in our bodies. Most of the serotonin (over 90%) is actually made, stored, and released by the gut. In addition, about 5-8% of serotonin is stored in platelets circulating in the blood \\[1, 3, 4\\].\n\nAs such, the roles of serotonin in the body are many and perse. Serotonin influences \\[4, 1, 3, 5, 2\\]:\n\n* Mood and emotions\n* Movement (motor function)\n* Sleep-wake cycle\n* Body temperature\n* Appetite\n* Bowel movements\n* Various gut functions\n* Blood clotting (platelet aggregation)\n* Constriction and relaxation of blood vessels\n* Immune responses\n* Bone development\n* Heart function\n* Reproductive function\n* Pain perception\n\n### What Does Serotonin Do?\n\nDiscovered in the 1940’s, **serotonin,** also known as **5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT,** plays pivotal roles in mood, behavior, gut, and overall optimal body function (homeostasis). Imbalances in serotonin are linked to a wide array of symptoms that interfere with mental and physical health, impairing the quality of life \\[6, 7, 8\\].\n\n**Increasing serotonin levels can help those suffering from anxiety, depression, migraines, or constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome**, among other diseases \\[6, 7, 8\\].\n\n### Serotonin Production and Removal\n\n**The majority of serotonin is made, stored, and released by cells in the gut lining (enterochromaffin cells)**. These cells make serotonin from the **amino acidL-tryptophan** \\[9, 10\\].\n\n**Specific bacteria in the human digestive tract can boost serotonin production in the gut.** Gut flora actually balances tryptophan metabolism (via the kynurenine pathway), influencing the amount of L-tryptophan available for making serotonin. \\[11, 12\\].\n\nSerotonin made in the gut cannot cross the **blood-brain barrier**. That is why brain cells must produce their own serotonin, from either L-tryptophan or **5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP),** a by-product of L-tryptophan \\[13, 14\\].\n\nSerotonin in the brain and gut is deactivated in the body by specific proteins (reuptake transporters) that take up excess serotonin \\[15, 9\\].\n\nThe serotonin that gets released into the blood gets either taken up by platelets or rapidly **broken down in the liver and lungs by enzymes called monoamine oxidase (MAO-A)** and aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenase \\[3\\].\n\n### Disorders\n\nWhen we talk about serotonin-associated disorders, it’s important to know that these disorders are not necessarily due to serotonin levels or production as such, but can stem from issues with serotonin reuptake or the availability of certain serotonin receptors. There are over 15 different receptor types discovered to date, including the well known 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C \\[16, 17, 18\\].\n\nAbnormal serotonin levels have been linked to \\[2, 4, 1, 19, 20\\]:\n\n* Mental health disorders, including **depression, anxiety, aggression, obsessive compulsive behavior, substance abuse, and schizophrenia**\n* Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n* Heart disease\n* Osteoporosis\n\nAdditionally, serotonin **connects the** **gut microbiome with the brain** – forming the so called “gut-brain axis.” Decreased persity and stability of beneficial gut bacteria can cause serotonin-related health issues, especially in the elderly \\[21, 22, 23\\].\n\n### Other Neurotransmitters\n\n**Monoamine neurotransmitters** such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine together affect mood. A meta-analysis of 90 studies discovered that patients lacking tryptophan, serotonin, or tyrosine experienced low mood \\[24\\].\n\nAn imbalance in serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine may contribute to bipolar disorder. It has been proposed that the **combined low levels of these 3 neurotransmitters**, and not serotonin alone, cause mood disorders \\[25\\].\n\nIn the pineal gland, serotonin is used to make melatonin, a hormone that synchronizes the body’s “biological clock,” or circadian rhythm. When serotonin is low that limits the amount of melatonin that can be made in the body, **interfering with the sleep-wake cycle** \\[5\\].\n\n40 Ways to Increase Serotonin Naturally\n\nlet’s start with a huge change in your daily routine:\n\n### Lifestyle Changes to Increase Serotonin\n\n### Stress Reduction\n\nOur bodies release cortisol when stressed. **Cortisol decreases serotonin levels in the body**, by increasing serotonin reuptake. Too much cortisol can increase your risk of developing mental health disorders. That is why **reducing mental stress can help balance cortisol levels and increase serotonin** \\[26\\].\n\nMany of the lifestyle changes below can be used to decrease stress.\n\n### Mood Improvement\n\nSerotonin impacts our mood, but mood also affects serotonin production. Studies using brain imaging (PET), showed that **brains of people who are happy produce more serotonin** than brains of people who are sad \\[27\\].\n\nTherefore, engaging in activities and doing things that make you happier can help boost serotonin production.\n\nIn addition, studies show that social interactions also influence serotonin levels. Spend more time with people who make you feel good in general \\[28\\].\n\n### Exercise\n\nFatigue, as a result of exercise, increases the amount of tryptophan that can cross the blood-brain barrier (by decreasing BCAA levels) and thereby boosts serotonin production. Psychological benefits of physical exercise can be more readily achieved with consistent aerobic exercise training \\[29, 30, 31, 32\\].\n\nMice that ran on treadmills had higher levels of serotonin compared to mice that remained inactive. Brain tryptophan remained high even after exercise \\[33\\].\n\n### Getting More Sun\n\nIt has been long known that bright light helps treat seasonal depression. But several studies suggest that light is also an effective treatment for other forms of depression \\[34, 35, 36\\].\n\n**People have higher serotonin levels in the summer compared to winter** \\[37, 38\\].\n\nIn fact, our modern way of life, in which we spend a lot of time indoors, may be depleting our serotonin levels, thereby making us more vulnerable to mood disorders \\[32\\].\n\nPioneer studies suggest that **our skin may produce serotonin when exposed to sunlight** \\[39, 40\\].\n\nIn addition, **you need vitamin D to produce serotonin**, and sun to produce vitamin D \\[41, 42\\].\n\nTherefore, going outside and spending more time in the sun on a regular basis is a great way to boost your serotonin levels.\n\n### Yoga and Meditation\n\nA review of over 200 peer-reviewed RCTs, clinical trials, and meta-analyses studying complementary and alternative medicine suggest that **yoga and meditation may help uplift mood and improve symptoms of mild, moderate, and treatment-resistant depression** \\[43\\].\n\nIn fact, meditation activates many parts of the brain important for understanding the self, emotions, problem-solving, adaptability, and increasing awareness. Serotonin plays a role in wakefulness, along with other **neurotransmitters, which are all raised in meditators** \\[44, 45, 46\\].\n\nThirty minutes of yoga and breathing exercises improved mood in a study of 71 healthy adults \\[47\\].\n\n### Psychotherapy\n\nPsychotherapy or counseling may change brain chemistry and even increase serotonin activity (by increasing serotonin receptors). In a (DB-RCT) study of 23 patients with depression who participated in psychotherapy for 4 months, **therapy significantly increased serotonin activity and improved symptoms of depression** \\[48\\].\n\n### Music Therapy\n\nInterestingly, music has been shown to **increase neurotransmitters like serotonin**.\n\nIn fact, rats exposed to melodic music (e.g. Mozart’s sonatas) released more serotonin in their brains \\[49\\].\n\n### Dance Therapy\n\nA study (RCT) of 40 students around the age of 16 who participated in dance movement therapy had **increased blood serotonin levels** compared to the control group \\[50\\].\n\n### Eat to Increase Serotonin\n\nTryptophan is the amino acid building block for serotonin. Tryptophan is not produced by the body, so it must be taken in through diet.\n\nCurrent research shows that unlike purified tryptophan, **consuming tryptophan-rich foods does not necessarily increase brain serotonin**. That’s because tryptophan-rich foods, such as meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables, also contain many other amino acids. Tryptophan has to compete with these other amino acids for transport across the blood-brain barrier \\[32, 51\\].\n\nOn the other hand, lack of dietary tryptophan (compared to other amino acids) may lead to lower blood and brain tryptophan levels, decreasing serotonin production. **Increased BCAAs also lower tryptophan and serotonin**, as well as dopamine in the brain. This may be especially problematic for people who take protein powders to enhance exercise performance \\[52, 53\\].\n\n### Carbs\n\n**Consuming carbs increases serotonin levels** by increasing the transport of tryptophan into the brain \\[54, 55\\].\n\nHowever, you should use other methods to boost your serotonin, as increasing carbs in your diet can have a plethora of negative effects.\n\n### which Supplements can Increase Serotonin?\n\n### L-Tryptophan and 5-HTP\n\nIn the body, L-tryptophan is used to make 5-HTP from which serotonin is made. Taking L-tryptophan may raise plasma serotonin, improving cognitive, motor, or gut issues in those who are deficient \\[56, 57\\].\n\nA protein called **alpha-Lactalbumin** from milk contains more tryptophan than many other proteins. In a (DB-RCT) study of 18 inpiduals, 12 grams of alpha-Lactalbumin increased the amount of tryptophan in blood plasma by 16% after 90 minutes \\[58\\].\n\nIn another (DB-RCT) study, 12.32 grams of tryptophan increased blood tryptophan by 43% after 1.5 hours and improved memory in 23 subjects vulnerable to high stress \\[59\\].\n\nIn a pilot study of 13 female patients experiencing premenstrual syndrome (PMS), 6 grams of L-tryptophan taken daily for 14 days improved mood, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and carbohydrate craving \\[60\\].\n\nTryptophan can be purchased in the form of L-tryptophan supplements. 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) supplements are also available. It is important to note that 5-HTP is not the same as 5-HT, which is the chemical name for serotonin. 5-HTP freely crosses the blood-brain barrier (serotonin itself does not) to be converted into serotonin \\[14\\].\n\n### Probiotics\n\nIn the digestive tract, **probiotics restore the gut microbiome** and influence the gut-brain axis. Gut bacteria are important because they can produce tryptophan, from which serotonin is made. Many mental health disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, are linked to less perse or fewer gut bacteria \\[61, 62\\].\n\nIn a study (DB-RTC), an 8-week probiotic regimen (2.0 x 109 CFU/g of *Lactobacillus helveticus* and 2.0 x 109 CFU/g of *Bifidobacterium longum*) increased tryptophan levels in 110 inpiduals with depression. Increased tryptophan can increase serotonin production \\[63, 13\\].\n\nA probiotic (*Bifidobacteria infantis*) given to rats for 14 days raised levels of blood tryptophan \\[64\\].\n\n### Vitamin D\n\n**Vitamin D helps the body make, release, and use serotonin in the brain**. Vitamin D activates an enzyme that converts tryptophan into serotonin. If vitamin D levels are low, our brains make less serotonin. Thus, increasing vitamin D intake increases serotonin levels, reducing the risk of mental health disorders \\[41, 42\\].\n\nA cohort study of over 9K subjects demonstrated that taking vitamin D supplements during the first year of life was correlated with a 77% reduced risk of schizophrenia. In other words, **preventing low vitamin D levels early in life may reduce the chance of having schizophrenia later in life** \\[65\\].\n\n### Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n\nWhile vitamin D helps neurons make serotonin, the omega-3 fatty acids, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), **help neurons release serotonin** and improve its activity (increasing serotonin receptor sensitivity). Fish, such as salmon or trout, are high in omega-3 fatty acids. The omega 3 fatty acid supplements are also sold as fish oil capsules \\[42\\].\n\nInadequate omega-3 fatty acids intake may increase susceptibility to psychiatric illnesses, including depression \\[66\\].\n\nIn a (DB-RCT) study of 49 patients that repeatedly self-harm themselves, 1.2 grams of EPA and 0.9 grams of DHA capsules daily for 12 weeks reduced suicidal thinking by 45% and depression by 30% \\[67\\].\n\nAn observational study of 256,118 Japanese participants, discovered that people who ate fish daily had lower rates of suicidal thoughts compared to people who did not eat fish daily. In another observational study of 1,767 Finnish subjects, consuming fish less than twice a week was associated with a higher risk of depression and suicidal thinking \\[68, 69+\\].\n\nIn rats, low levels of omega-3 fatty acids (specifically alpha linoleic acid) are associated with lower serotonin activity, while DHA deficiency reduces brain serotonin in piglets \\[70, 71\\].\n\n**Reduced intake of both EPA and DHA** by pregnant rats resulted in less production, storage, release, and activity (receptor function) of serotonin in the brains of their offspring. Serotonin was not only reduced in the mothers’ brains but also its availability and production were reduced by (65% and 29%, respectively) in the brains of newborn rats \\[72\\].\n\n### St. John’s Wort\n\nSt. John’s Wort is a popular medicinal plant (*Hypericum perforatum*) used as an antidepressant for mild depression.\n\nThe plant **increases serotonin in animals, similar to typical antidepressants**, but with fewer side effects \\[73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78\\].\n\nIn a review (of 35 studies) of 6,993 patients with depression, St. John’s Wort standalone therapy improved mild to moderate symptoms as well as antidepressants and better than placebo. The typical dose is 300 mg of the extract 3 times per day for at least 4 weeks \\[79\\].\n\n### S-Adenosyl Methionine (SAMe)\n\nSAMe is needed to produce serotonin \\[80\\].\n\nIt is a naturally occurring compound that plays a role in methylation, energy breakdown and may help patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who are not responding to conventional, synthetic antidepressants \\[81, 82\\].\n\nIn a (DB-RCT) study involving 73 MDD inpiduals unresponsive to drug therapy, **800 mg twice a day improved symptoms of depression** compared to the placebo \\[81\\].\n\nIn a (DB-RCT) study of 144 inpiduals with MDD, **1,600 – 3,200 mg of SAMe daily** for 12 weeks significantly improved mood \\[83\\].\n\nA review of 132 studies (115 CT and 17 preclinical) concluded **that SAMe can be useful not just for depression**, but for an array of mental health disorders, such as substance abuse and psychosis \\[82\\].\n\n### Vitamin B\n\nLack of vitamin B may be associated with the onset of mental health disorders. The body needs Vitamin B6 to make neurotransmitters like serotonin from 5-HTP (Vitamin B acts as enzyme cofactor) \\[84\\].\n\nVitamin B12 and folate (vitamin B9) are necessary for the folate cycle, which helps convert tryptophan into serotonin (by producing and recycling essential co-factors) \\[85\\].\n\nIn a cohort study of 549 community-dwelling seniors, those with low vitamin B12 and B9 blood levels were more likely to have irreversible problems with cognition (memory, attention, and thought) \\[86\\].\n\nIn Rhesus monkeys, a single dose of vitamin B6 increased serotonin production in the brain \\[87\\].\n\nIn addition, treatment of healthy adult rats with a vitamin B mixture raised serotonin levels in the brain \\[88\\].\n\n### Vitamin C\n\nVitamin C supplements over a period of 6 weeks increased brain serotonin levels in rats with drug-induced dementia \\[89\\].\n\n### Vitamin E\n\nVitamin E supplementation for 8 weeks increased serotonin in rats suffering from spinal cord injury \\[90\\].\n\n### Zinc\n\nZinc can target and activate serotonin receptors \\[91\\].\n\nIn a meta-analysis of 17 observational studies, **blood zinc levels were lower in depressed inpiduals** compared to non-depressed inpiduals \\[92\\].\n\nIn a study (DB-RCT), 25 mg of elemental zinc supplements daily for 12 weeks reduced depressive symptoms in a study of 37 patients with major depressive disorder \\[93\\].\n\nZinc can be increased through diet in foods such as red meat, oysters, and whole grains \\[94\\].\n\n### Magnesium\n\nMagnesium supplements increase serotonin levels by increasing its availability (reducing reuptake) in the brain. In a (DB-RCT) study, 500 mg of magnesium per day for 8 weeks significantly improved symptoms in 60 patients diagnosed with mild to moderate depression \\[95\\].\n\nMagnesium is found in green leafy vegetables, nuts, and legumes \\[94\\].\n\n### Inositol\n\nInositol increases the sensitivity of serotonin receptors\\[96, 97\\].\n\nIn one study of 30 women with a PMS mood disorder, myo-inositol reduced symptoms and improved mood given over 6 menstrual cycles \\[98\\].\n\nInositol decreases depression in rats by binding serotonin receptors \\[99, 100\\].\n\n### Turmeric\n\nCurcumin is the active component of turmeric. In stressed rats, **curcumin extended the length of time serotonin stays active in the brain** (by blocking the reuptake of serotonin). It also improved cognition and reduced serum corticosterone, a cortisol equivalent, in rats \\[101\\].\n\nIn mice, a single dose of curcumin (10 – 80 mg/kg) increased serotonin levels \\[102\\].\n\n### Velvet Bean\n\n*Mucuna* *pruriens*, known as the velvet bean, combats Parkinson’s disease better than the standard treatment (levodopa) in rats. In addition to being a source of dopamine, the long-term use of the powder form of *Mucuna pruriens* also **restored serotonin levels in rat brains** \\[103\\].\n\n### L-Theanine\n\nL-theanine, an amino acid found in tea leaves (e.g. green, black, or oolong tea) and Bay Bolete mushrooms, has relaxing effects on the mind. **Green tea has the highest concentration of L-theanine** \\[104, 105, 106\\].\n\nIn a cohort study of over 42K Japanese inpiduals, those who consumed at least 5 cups of green tea a day experiences less psychological distress that is often associated with reduced serotonin \\[107\\].\n\nIn rat studies, L-theanine raised serotonin levels in the brain \\[108\\].\n\n### Rhodiola\n\n*Rhodiola rosea* is a flowering plant that may help improve anxiety and depression. In a (DB-RCT) clinical trial of 89 patients with mild to moderate depression and low serotonin, *Rhodiola rosea* extracts (340 mg/day and 680 mg/day) for 42 days i**mproved overall depression, including** **insomnia and emotional instability** \\[109\\].\n\nIn 70 depressive rats suffering from chronic mild stress and serotonin deficiency, Rhodiola extract (1.5, 3, or 6g/kg) for 3 weeks **restored normal levels of serotonin** \\[110\\].\n\n### Saffron\n\n**Safranal, one of the main active components of saffron** (*Crocus sativus*), increases serotonin availability in the brain (by blocking reuptake) \\[111, 112\\].\n\nA meta-analysis (5 RCTs) of 177 participants concluded that **30 mg per day of saffron capsules** can improve symptoms of depression in adults with major depressive disorder within 6 to 8 weeks \\[113\\].\n\n### Psychedelics\n\nPsychedelics are hallucinogenic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin mushrooms. **Psychedelics can stimulate serotonin activity** (by directly binding to serotonergic receptors and also increasing their number), raise serotonin levels, and reduce its breakdown \\[114\\].\n\nIn a recent pilot study (DB-RCT) of 12 patients with anxiety, 200 μg of LSD significantly reduced self-reported anxiety. LSD was given in a **safe psychotherapeutic environment with medical supervision** to avoid side effects \\[115\\].\n\nIn a (DB-RCT) study of 17 healthy inpiduals, psilocybin (215 micrograms/kg) enhanced mood, increased goal-directed behavior and decreased recognition of negative facial expressions \\[116\\].\n\nThough psychedelics can activate serotonin signaling, unsupervised use may lead to serious psychological consequences. Certain plant hallucinogens, as well as synthetic hallucinogens, can be especially toxic \\[117, 118, 119, 120\\].\n\n### MDMA\n\nMDMA, otherwise known as ecstasy, stimulates the release of serotonin and increases serotonin activity (inhibits its reuptake) \\[121\\].\n\nA (DB-RCT) pilot study concluded that **MDMA-assisted psychotherapy** (25 mg or 125 mg) helped 12 patients suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) \\[122\\].\n\nIn mice, MDMA increased both serotonin and dopamine release in the brain \\[123\\].\n\n### Magnolia Tree\n\nThe bark and seed cones of the Magnolia tree (*Magnolia officinalis*) appear to have anti-stress, anti-anxiety, and antidepressant effects \\[124\\].\n\n20 and 40 mg/kg of honokiol and magnolol, the main components of *Magnolia officinalis*, **restored low levels of serotonin** in rats with chronic mild stress \\[125\\].\n\nMagnolia bark and ginger rhizome are commonly used to treat mental disorders in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). 30 mg/kg of a **magnolia bark and ginger rhizome mixture increased serotonin in the brains** of depressed mice \\[126\\].\n\n### Essential Oils\n\nEssential oils are commonly used to reduce anxiety, stress, low mood, and other mental health disorders. Smelling the essential oils (inhalation) can **activate pathways in the brain to boost serotonin and dopamine production** \\[127\\].\n\nIn a study of aromatherapy in 60 elderly patients with depression (RCT), **5 ml of essential oil mixture** (containing lavender, sweet orange, bergamot, and almond oil) increased serotonin levels after application two times a week for 8 weeks \\[128\\].\n\n**Ylang-ylang** essential oils increased serotonin levels in mice brains (hippocampus) \\[129\\].\n\n**Bitter orange** is an essential oil that reduced anxiety and improved mood by boosting serotonin activity in mice after 14 days of use \\[130\\].\n\n**Lavender oil** blocked the breakdown/reuptake of serotonin in cell studies \\[131\\].\n\n### Valerian\n\nThe root of the Valerian plant **increases serotonin levels and activity** (by decreasing its turnover) \\[132\\].\n\nValerian may help with irritable bowel syndrome. In a rat study, components of the Valeriani root balanced overactive serotonin in the gut (colon) and serum \\[133\\].\n\n*Valeriana officinalis* root extract **prevented the breakdown of serotonin** in mice exposed to stress \\[134\\].\n\n### Apigenin\n\n**Apigenin is a nutrient in citrus fruits** that may improve cognition and behavior as well as symptoms of depression and stress \\[135, 136\\].\n\nIn mouse models, 20-day treatment with apigenin (10 and 20 mg/kg) **increased serotonin levels, and decreased anxious behavior** \\[137\\].\n\nApigenin was able to **reduce the impact of chronic mild stress in rats by increasing serotonin** availability and reducing its breakdown \\[138\\].\n\n### Berberine\n\nBerberine is a salt derived from plants in the *Berberis* family (the roots, rhizomes, stems, and barks), including **barberry, tree turmeric, Oregon-grape**, and others. It blocks the enzyme MAO-A, which breaks down serotonin, thereby **raising serotonin levels** \\[139\\].\n\nA single berberine dose increased levels of serotonin by 47% in the brains of depressed mice. Long-term treatment with berberine (5 mg/kg for 15 days) increased serotonin by 19% \\[139\\].\n\nMice given berberine in a different study had increased serotonin levels in regions of the brain (hippocampus and frontal cortex) important for memory and mood \\[140\\].\n\n### Acetyl-L-Carnitine\n\n**Carnitine may increase serotonin** in the cerebral cortex, a region of the brain involved in **cognition and memory** \\[141\\].\n\nAcetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) is a modified form of carnitine, a common dietary supplement sold in health food stores. ALCAR protects the brain and may help with depression. In mice, it increased levels of serotonin in the brain when given daily for 25 days \\[141\\].\n\n### Lithium\n\nLithium has long been used in the treatment of mental disorders such as bipolar disorder. It works by increasing serotonin activity in the brain \\[142\\].\n\n### Physical Treatments that Increase Serotonin\n\n### Neurofeedback\n\nNeurofeedback allows inpiduals to consciously **change their brain activity** (EEG waves) and therefore modify their behavior and cognition. Some of its clinical uses are for migraines, ADHD, and PTSD \\[143\\].\n\nIn a study (RCT), neurofeedback (30 minutes, 5 sessions weekly, 4 weeks) was applied to 40 patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS patients have lower serotonin and widespread pain in their muscles and bones. After 2 weeks, patients experienced less pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression \\[143, 144\\].\n\n### Massage\n\n**Massage therapy decreased cortisol and raised serotonin** and dopamine in a broad population with stress-related health problems in 3 studies (review) \\[145\\].\n\nIn one (RCT) study, 24 adults with low back pain were either given two 30 minute massages per week or subjected to standard relaxation procedures over the span of 5 weeks. Urine **serotonin levels were higher in inpiduals who received massage therapy** \\[146\\].\n\n### Acupuncture\n\nIn a randomized clinical trial, 75 women with fibromyalgia, acupuncture increased levels of serotonin in the serum, compared to placebo \\[147\\].\n\nIn rats, acupuncture-like stimulation increased serotonin activity in certain regions of the brain \\[148\\].\n\n### Light Therapy\n\nWhen sun exposure is not possible, bright light therapy can help increase serotonin levels \\[149\\].\n\nBright light therapy (photobiomodulation) shows promising results for depression based on clinical trials \\[150\\].\n\nIn a study of 10 women with chronic headaches (observational), 34 seconds daily use of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) significantly **increased serotonin levels after just 3 days** \\[149\\].\n\nIn a study of 25 drug-free hospitalized veterans with depression or bipolar disorder, **bright white light improved depressive symptoms**. However, further testing needs to be done on the negative consequences of long-term light treatment \\[151\\].\n\n### Vagus Nerve Stimulation\n\nLong-term vagus nerve stimulation (14 days) **increased serotonin levels** in rat brains \\[152\\].\n\nIn rats, sustained vagus nerve stimulation for 14 days also **increased the action of serotonin** \\[153\\].\n\n### Testing Serotonin\n\nSerotonin that gets released into the blood gets rapidly broken down in the liver and lungs, to inactive metabolites (such as 5-HIAA) that are excreted in urine \\[3\\]. That is why normally, blood and urine contain very small amounts of serotonin. Larger quantities of serotonin in the blood/urine can be found in people with serotonin-producing tumors (carcinoid tumors).\n\n**Beware of the use of urine serotonin levels to check for “neurotransmitter imbalances”.** While the companies providing these tests state that the levels in urine correspond to brain neurotransmitter levels, science has repeatedly shown that this is not the case \\[154\\].\n\nSerotonin doesn’t cross the blood-brain barrier. Even if it did, it is released intermittently and influenced by many different stimuli. Furthermore, levels differ within different parts of the brain. And finally, values differ for the same person from one day to another \\[154\\].\n\n**In addition, companies have been known to intentionally use extremely narrow ranges, without any scientific support whatsoever, in order to sell supplements to their clients** \\[155\\]**!**\n\nIf you do have neurotransmitter imbalances in the brain, more reliable tests of serotonin levels are cerebrospinal fluid tests or measurements of serotonin in blood platelets \\[156, 157\\].\n\nA PET scan is the only direct way to detect changes of serotonin production in specific areas of the brain \\[157\\].\n\nSerotonin Risks and Safety\n\nExcess serotonin may result in **serotonin syndrome**, which can be fatal. Usually, though, serotonin syndrome is a result of drug interactions. No cases have been observed just from safe, natural approaches \\[158\\].\n\n**MDMA, LSD, and other synthetic drugs** may cause serotonin syndrome, and should not be taken without medical supervision or outside a psychotherapeutic environment \\[159\\].\n\nMost of the studies mentioned above were performed on adults. More research involving children is needed in order to determine safety.\n\nAbnormally heightened levels of serotonin (hyperserotonemia) is a consistent finding in inpiduals with autism. Pregnant women with hyperserotonemia are more likely to give birth to children with autism \\[160, 161\\].\n\n### Drug Interactions\n\nThe use of **St. John’s Wort, SAMe, or lithium** simultaneously with serotonergic drugs like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-I), and triptans, can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a life-threatening and potentially fatal condition \\[162, 163, 164\\].\n\n### Limitations and Caveats\n\nSome of these studies **have fairly small sample sizes**. Additionally, many of these natural methods of increasing serotonin in the body **have only been tested in animals** and need further research in humans through clinical trials.\n\nIn addition to the concentration of serotonin, both the number of serotonin receptors and their sensitivity may also play an integral role in determining serotonin activity.\n\nThough serotonin is mostly made, stored, and released in the gut, serotonin acts as an important neurotransmitter in the brain. Some of these natural remedies and supplements need further testing to determine if they are able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Long-term application of these remedies should also be further studied.\n\nSource: [http://www.hiwamag.com/health/how-to-increase-serotonin/](http://www.hiwamag.com/health/how-to-increase-serotonin/)",

They also eat very different animals than us and prize many Vitamin C sources such as seal skin and the like, which others would not routinely consume. It's easier to eat a few slices of orange for the same nutrients than it is to go out of your way to consume a large portion of seal skin for the same amount of Vitamin C. You can [read up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit_diet) on the Inuit diet if you like, or watch a documentary or two on it, it's all quite fasincating stuff. I believe there was a Planet Earth type documentary on tribal humans and the Inuit were one of the people showcased, although I can't remember the name of the documentary off hand. The Inuit often get used a lot as an example of people who consume nothing but meat and are perfectly healthy except for the fact that they eat a very specific kind of meat (predominantly seafood) and aren't exactly the healthiest people in the world (see: Japanese and Scandinavians).\n\n[Dietary fiber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soluble_fiber) itself has a great deal of benefit itself. Some types of fiber like [Beta-glucan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_glucan)(found in high amounts in mushrooms and oats) have a *slew* of medical benefits that are currently being examined.\n\nOther flavanoids have favourable effects on boosting immunity (Theanine from green tea), or boosting our metabolism (EGCG from green tea) and some help promote muscle retention while shedding body fat (like anthocyanidins from berries).\n\n**TL;DR**: We didn't evolve as carnivores. All the longest lived and healthiest people in the world aren't carnivores. People who are predominantly carnivores like the Inuit (and not even by choice) have to be very careful to specialize their diets to avoid nutritional deficiencies, and even then they sometimes miss the boat.",

    "body": "Hey everyone! I’m nonbinary, and today I’m going to teach y’all about hormonal options that aren’t testosterone! \nI noticed there’s a disappointing lack of not-T options and so I decided to cobble together what I’ve learned over time. \n\nWas originally posted on r/transdiy. Took out any mention of anything that even sounded DIY-ish, though the original post wasn’t heavy on it either. \n\nYou may to visit [the original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/comments/7iahj2/guide_for_ftm_peepsnb_transmasc_people/?st=JAY892D7&sh=2f3d43cd) to get some input on various things. \n\nThis is simply copy-pasted from an amalgamation of replies I’ve made in the past few months. \n\nLet me know if the formatting needs to be adjusted any! I added everything I could think of. \n\nI’d like to add that though I’m a gender nerd, **I am not a doctor and this is not meant to be medical advice**. If you can double check behind me and ask your doctor about hormones and how they work, that would be fantastic. \n\nI mean for this to be informative, which is why I’ve taken out the names of certain shops and what-not. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me! \n\n*cracks knuckles* Let’s get this ball rolling. \n\n*** \n\n### **Why antiestrogens aren’t as effective as you might think**  \n\nFirst off, I’m ashamed to say that **anti-estrogens do diddly-squat about body-wide estrogen**, despite the naming scheme. \n\nAlmost all anti-estrogens are SERMS, which (in current medical development) only block E in the breasts, and act like E in the bones— **they don’t limit it body wide**. \n\nSERMs are honestly only useful if you have breast cancer, fibrocystic breasts, in the prevention of osteoporosis, or **are AMAB and don’t want breast growth**. \n\nThe other category of anti-estrogens are **aromatase blockers**, which prevent T from being converted to E. While this sounds great, and while a fair amount of T is converted to E in the AFAB body, this is **unhelpful for premenopausal people in breast cancer treatment** [if their gonads are not suppressed first.](https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/breast-hormone-therapy-fact-sheet) \n\n**AI blockers do very little if your ovaries aren’t taken out or suppressed**, or at least if E production isn't partially supressed, as [AIs are hindered by the higher T production in premenopausal women, and the ovaries will produce more AI if E is lowered](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/424077_20) therefore if you aren't on T or have your E at least partially supressed through other methods (like danazol or progesterone) I would not recommend an AI at high doses. \n\n*** \n\n### **Getting testosterone (legally)**\n\nIf you’re in the US and you can hide it, you could go informed consent for T and **pay out of pocket**. You have to be over 18 if you have unsupportive parents. \n\nYou drive to a clinic, fill out some forms, go back to a doctor’s office, they explain what T does, more forms, then you’re given a prescription in at most a few appointments, usually after blood work but sometimes before it or on the first appointment. \n\nT would range about $30-$50 without insurance, and since you’re binary and probably want what DHT offers, you can just start out on only T. Blood tests would be most expensive. \n\nInsurance sends paperwork home so if you’re 18 and still live at home with unsupportive parents, you’ll want to go uninsured for T. Plenty of insurance companies cover HRT (like BCBS Federal) and then you’d pay anywhere from $5-$20 a month, most likely.\n\n**You could go and get your T shots at the clinic** if you can’t keep the T vial at home and do the shots yourself or have a friend do them, and there’s a way for you to easily out get of the house. \n\n***\n\n### **Birth control to lower E production**:\n\n**Provera** is a birth control (mostly) medication that lowers your E levels by using **progesterone**, which basically tells the ovaries to stop producing E (by lowering levels of GnRH). [how progesterone works](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22822163/) \n\nYou could tell your parents you want to go on it for birth control or because your periods are annoying. It’s somewhat important that for this purpose it be **progesterone/progestin only**. \n\nnote: Progestin and Progesterone are a little different. \n\nProgestin is synthetic progesterone which fits into the progestin receptor, and sometimes may produce unwanted effects, while progesterone usually refers to bio-identical progesterone. They usually both prevent the period (again by messing with GnRH levels). \n\nJust progesterone would stop things like your hips widening, etc., as would a GnRH blocker, which I’ll cover in a later section. GnRH blockers may be helpful for enbies who don’t want to go on T, but **make sure to go on a SERM like raloxifene after a few years, as this will help prevent osteoporosis**. \n\nedit: **You may want to look into more androgenic forms of birth control and take one of those**, again, **not as a comination pill-set**. The most androgenic progestins that are used are **levonogestrel** and the progestin in **Depo-Provera**, which is too long for me spell out here. \n\n*** \n\n### **Danazol: The Mysterious Benefactor** \n\n**Danazol** is a mild androgen, and a mild GnRH inhibitor— it will lower E levels (least enough to stop your period, hip widening, etc) and may give you some of the effects of T. It’s not a scheduled substance/as scheduled as T is, either. It activates both androgen and progesterone receptors. [it's also shown to cause vocal changes over time](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/3966015/) as evidenced by a study from the 80s.\n\nThat being said, if you decide to go on it, get your liver enzymes checked after about 6 months or so (least a year). Danazol can be a bit hard on the liver, it’s a pill. \n\nI think this is a totally viable option for AFAB enbies on its own (slow changes, no lower growth), or even to binary guys before starting T, as it will likely stop periods too. \n\nIf you want to legally use it as a precursor to T and have access to a doc, **I would recommend asking your doctor about it first**, instead of going DIY or something. \n\nDosages are based on what the health issue is: \n\nhttps://reference.medscape.com/drug/danazol-342756\n\nmild endo: 200-400 mg, divided into twice a day moderate-severe: 800 mg, divided into twice a day\n\nfibrosystic chest tissue: 100-400 mg (divided into) twice a day \n\nFuthermore, danazol has been proven to [slowly lower the voice over time](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19195957_Effect_of_danazol_on_vocal_pitch_a_case_study) and so danazol may be a viable option if you want really slow voice changes.\n\n*** \n\n### **GnRH blockers: systematic E blockage** \n\nAnother medication that’s an option is **buserelin**. Like progesterone, it blocks E production. It’s available as a nasal spray if you look around. It will make your E levels go up at first, but then your E levels will drop as your pituitary gland gets desensitized to GnRH overproduction. \n\nThere are also other GnRH blockers, like cetrorelix, degarelix, and ganirelix (**antagonists**, no initial hormone spike), or leuprolide (Lupron), goserelin (Zoladex), and buserelin, which are **agonists** (yes hormone spike, for at most a month). \n\nDanazol, progesterone, or an GnRH **antagonist** may be preferred over **agonists**, at least initially. \n\nGnRH blockers may be helpful for enbies who don’t want to go on T, but **make sure to go on a SERM like raloxifene after a few years, as this will help prevent osteoporosis**. \n\nKeep your eyes peeled for **relugolix**. It’s a **GnRH oral antagonist in development** that has a pretty long half life and has proven effective in trials and tests (so far). \n\nI really do think that [hormones currently under investigation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_investigational_hormonal_agents) (such as relugolix) will be the future of hormonal healthcare for everyone, but especially trans people! \n\n*** \n\n### **DHEA**\n\nIf you've been on sites about natural transition, you may have heard of a substance called DHEA (prasterone). It is a **precursor to steriodal sex hormones** (largely E and T in this case), and can therefore be used to increase greatly raise levels of both T and E, [which it has been proven to do in clinical studies](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/71/3/696/2652450?redirectedFrom=fulltext) **at high levels (1600 mg)**, increasing T by nine-fold, DHT by 20-fold, and estrone and estradiol by 2-fold **in post-menopausal women**. \n\nDespite this, I wouldn't advise taking high levels of DHEA unless you have no other options (due to it inadvertenly raising E too) and you were taking something to either supress E, or something to catalyze the production of DHEA to T, such as royal jelly. \n\n### **Using phytoandrogens** \n\n**I have a private document listing a bunch of phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens. For the link I simply ask that you PM me.**\n\nI honestly kind of hesitate to put this section, simply because these are the least effective options for transitioning. \n\nOne thing you may want to consider is a phytoandrogen like **pine pollen** (contains the closest thing to androgens you can get in a natural product) mixed with a transdermal solvent. \n\nThis is to **bypass the liver and increase effectiveness**. It’s preferred over tea, since ingesting too many herbs (honestly like.. ounces and ounces of the stuff) **can mess with liver enzymes, even if they do have effects on hormone levels**. If you’re worried you’ve been taking too high of a dosage you would want to get your liver enzymes tested.  \n\nIn addition, [here’s a list of natural sources of HRT](https://madgenderscience.wiki/wiki/Naturally_occurring_masculinizing_HRT). \n\nThese are **actually proven to raise T levels**, though except for **royal jelly and pine pollen**, I suspect the rest of the substances may be aromatase inhibitors and **probably shouldn’t be taken in super high/often dosages** (because high amounts of aromatase blockers given to pre-menopausal people will just raise E). \n\nHowever, you will be fine with something like chamomile (a slight aromatase blocker) or one of the other (non pine pollen/royal jelly) herbs on the list, taken as a tea everyday or something like that, fyi. \n\nApigenin (in chamomile and other substances) and Genistein (soy) are anti estrogenic: the reason they’re called phytoestrogens is because they [activate/agonize a different estrogen receptor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17132221/) called ER beta that is anti-physical estrogen effects. I.E., soymilk is fine, great, even. \n\nYou’d have to be eating a lot of them to see any noticeable effects, so for that it’s better to take a supplement. **Don’t take licorice supplements** (the actual herb is fine) as they can increase the risk of DVT. \n\nI recently found that [royal jelly works by increasing DHEA to T conversion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3499288/) and likely does this in AFAB people too, so you may want to take RJ in conjunction with DHEA to increase its effectiveness.\n\nYou will want to be careful to **have clean hands** while using a transdermal solvent or molecular transporter, and I would advise not getting too high of a concentration of solvent. While this method is not going to be as effective as T, it could possibly get you up to mild androgenic effects. \n\nA note on tribulus: [there's no definitive proof that tribulus actually works to raise T, especially not in AFAB people, though it may help to increase muscle strength](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120469/#__sec5title) \n\nI’m not sure if any trans guys have done this before, but if you do, post the outcome if you want!  It would be pretty interesting to hear about. \n\nAdding phytoestrogens to this list. Soy [can somewhat inhibit ovarian function or LH/FSH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139237/#__sec5title), and phytoestrogens also work through [decreasing gene expression of aromatase, inhibiting aromatase, or both](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/er/2015/594656/). They include compounds like apigenin, coumestrol (strongest phytoestrogen, present in red clover), and genistein. \n\n*** \n\n### **DHT blockers** \n\nI couldn’t come up with a fancy name for this section, sorry! \n\nIf you don’t want bottom growth, body hair growth, and want to preemptively stop possible hair loss, you may be interested in checking out **DHT blockers** such as **finasteride** or **dutasteride**. \n\nFin and Duta work by **permanently** blocking the production of *5a reductase*, which is converts T to a more androgenic form, dihydrotestosterone. \n\nDHT is associated with **partial hair loss or baldness, body hair, acne, and penis/clitoral growth** (as androgen receptors are located in all of these places). \n\nBlocking DHT means that (in theory) **these effects should occur slower/not at all**, and therefore good if you don’t want to possibly lose your hair or have acne! It will also raise your T levels a small amount. \n\nNonbinary people may also be very interested in **stopping bottom growth** (I know I am), and **DHT blockers will likely aid with that**. \n\nA comprehensive list of natural DHT blockers is available on [this SelfHacked article](https://selfhacked.com/blog/hidden-benefits-dht-increase-reduce/#How_To_Naturally_BlockDHT), which also has **functions of DHT**, and [this wiki article](https://madgenderscience.wiki/Dihydrotestosterone#DHT_inhibitors). \n\nIf you’re really interesting in blocking bottom growth, you may want to look at an article I wrote on [limiting bottom growth](https://madgenderscience.wiki/wiki/Experimental_regimen:_Limiting_bottom_growth) . It is a little complicated, a work in progress,and largely theoretical, but despite this, I hope that someone gets something out of it! \n\n*** \n\n### **Anabolic-androgenic steriods** \n\nThere are substances called **anabolic-androgenic** steriods that have varying amounts of androgenic and anabolic properties, due to their chemical makeup. These include drugs like nandrolone, stanozolol, and esters of testerone. \n\nNandrolone may be of particular interest to some enbies, as it [has descreased effects in tissues effected by 5a reductasse/DHT](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/bjp.2008.165/full) meaning it would have lowered effects on hair, scalp hair loss, and possibly less bottom growth. **It is an extremely scheduled substance** and therefore you would need to check with your doctor to see if you can get it, and **as always, if you're going to DIY, check with a doctor, get bloodwork, etc. be safe, in essence**. \n\n***\n\nreferences: to make things easier, basically all of https://madgenderscience.wiki .

It’s in essence a losing battle and the exact reason why aromatase blockers aren’t used on premenopausal people unless they have suppressed gonads/ovaries. \n\nYou might as well use an GnRH agonist for the initially boosted E levels, and at least those will actually work on those with ovaries to reduce suppression of E (as they’re designed to). \n\n[“Aromatase inhibitors are used primarily in postmenopausal women because the ovaries in premenopausal women produce too much aromatase for the inhibitors to block effectively.”](https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/breast-hormone-therapy-fact-sheet) \n\nAlso, if you’re on T there’s little reason to go on an AI as T already blocks E to a certain extent. If you’re super worried about E you could ask your GP about taking a bit of progesterone (however I wouldn’t personally recommend it).",

    "body": "Hey Professor Peterson & the Peterson family,\n\nI've been a biohacker/neurohacker of many years and have some experience with GABAergic hacking. This is going to be quite technical but I hope I've explained it clearly with lots of notes/clarifications (by all means ask me anything). This covers GABAergic, glutamatergic, glycinergic, endocannabinoid, tryptaminergic/serotonergic, ion channel, catecholaminergic neurotransmission systems, neurotrophins, nootropics, and non-drug interventions.\n\nFirst, about neurotransmission itself: Neurotransmission is an electrochemical neural communication process, whereby neurons (brain cells) via their dendrites (like legs of an octopus) release neurotransmitters into the synapse (tiny space between dendrites of presynaptic and neighbor/postsynaptic neurons), where they float around until they bind (attach) to receptors on the neighboring (postsynaptic) neuron, which induces an electrical potential, which opens an ion channel (e.g. sodium channel) and then fires when it exceeds a voltage threshold (action potential), inducing the release of neurotransmitters in the next neuron. This is happening trillions of times per second, and is assumed by physicalists to be the underlying mechanism of consciousness/qualia/experience.\n\nThere are dozens of different neurotransmitters\\[1\\] (and corresponding types of neurons), and some you can mess with less than others before getting into trouble. The mammalian nervous system's principal mechanism regulating general excitatory/inhibitory activity is the glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission system\\[2\\], where the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA bind (get attached) to glutamate receptors (4 major types) and GABA receptors (2 or 3 major types) respectively. If you've eaten a spicy meal containing high amounts of MSG (monosodium glutamate, which has the 'umami'/savory or 5th taste on tastebuds that can cheaply replace salt+spices) at an Asian (often Chinese or Thai) restaurant, then (if you're sensitive enough) you know what excessive glutamate neurotransmission feels like -- not an effect anyone enjoys (aka 'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome'); and there are other sources worth knowing about if you're extra sensitive\\[2\\]. Likewise, almost everyone is familiar with increased or excessive GABAergic neurotransmission from alcoholic beverages, and many from the 2nd most used (and abused) type of GABAergic drug: benzodiazepines/z-drugs.\n\nThere are a few different ways worth distinguishing of inducing a state of increased GABA neurotransmission in the brain\\[3\\]:\n\na) GABA receptor agonism, meaning using a drug that binds (attaches) to GABA receptors just like GABA does (such as Phenibut, or you can also take GABA itself, but it has extremely low oral bioavailability)\n\nb) GABA positive allosteric modulation, meaning using a drug (GABA PAMs e.g. benzos/z-drugs) that binds to a secondary (allosteric) site on GABA receptors, where it makes the normal receptor site (orthosteric/agonist site) more sensitive to GABA agonists\n\nc) GABA reuptake inhibition, meaning using a drug that inhibits the function of the GABA transporter protein, which grabs neurotransmitters (in this case GABA) from the synapse and transports them back into the presynaptic neuron to be recycled (the other possible fate of a neurotransmitter is being metabolized/changed by an enzyme), which increases the amount of time GABA neurotransmitters float around in the synapse and thus the amount of binding to GABA receptors\n\nd) GABA releasing agents (these could exist in theory but none are known; drugs that increase the release of GABA into the synapse; included for completeness as this does apply to other neurotransmission systems)\n\ne) GABA transaminase inhibitors (drugs that block the function of the enzyme that degrades/metabolizes GABA)\\[4\\]\n\nThe problem/side-effect with all of these, if administering chronically any of those types of drugs, is that the brain will soon try to compensate for chronically elevated GABA neurotransmission. The principal mechanism underlying benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, as well as alcohol dependence, is downregulation (a decrease in quantity and/or sensitivity) of GABA receptors, due to chronic excessive activation of GABA receptors. The result is too much (excitatory) glutamatergic neurotransmission happening with too little GABAergic neurotransmission to regulate the excitatory brain activity with inhibitory activity. I'd say the \"paradoxical\" reaction is simply GABA downregulation happening sooner than normal/average (which is 2-4 weeks). This may be influenced by previous toxic doses of GABAergics including alcohol overdose, or by unpredictable autoimmune reactions (consider that GABA receptors exist also beyond the brain, such as in the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract), and possibly by (epi)genetic predispositions.\n\nThe same model applies to most neurotransmission systems, with the exception that most don't have, or we haven't discovered any, allosteric modulatory site (e.g. there are no known dopamine allosteric modulators). This is one of the factors making GABA PAMs one of the few drugs that can cause extra strong long-term downregulation, while with most other neurotransmitter systems, only shorter-term receptor downregulation can occur from excessive neurotransmission. This is why recovering even from meth (dopamine/noradrenaline/serotonin releasing agent) dependence can be easier than recovering from benzo dependence. Another one with longer-term downregulation is the serotonergic neurotransmission system, which is why quitting SSRIs is often also very difficult (people taper off slowly for up to 9 months).\n\nQuitting all agonists, PAMs, or reuptake inhibitors, will eventually cause receptor upregulation and a return to homeostasis. However, as you know better than most, this is no fun, if you have reached the point where your baseline is now one of dependence on benzo/z-drug PAM. As it happened, increasing the chronic dose of benzo/z-drug may then have induced a greater downregulation of GABA receptors, causing the ratio of glutamatergic to GABAergic neurotransmission to become further skewed towards glutamatergic to the point of experiencing unbearable/crippling anxiety, in your case worse yet, accompanied by intense akathisia (perhaps involving an additional autoimmune reaction?).\n\nConsider also that there exists a number of weak or superweak benzo-site agonists (weak GABA PAMs), such as EGCG in green tea, or apigenin (in Bacopa, artichoke, parsley, celery, chamomile) -- these may provide a mild type of relief/anxiolisis and may or may not influence the desired long-term GABA receptor upregulation.\n\nThere are ways to induce faster receptor upregulation, using \"opposite\" effect drugs:\n\nf) GABA receptor (uncompetitive) antagonism, meaning using a drug that binds to GABA receptors and sticks to them for long periods but doesn't cause a downstream effect (electrical impulse that induces neighboring GABA neurons to release GABA), preventing GABA (or other GABA agonists) from binding to them, thus temporarily reducing GABA neurotransmission, which if sustained for some period tends to induce GABA receptor upregulation (increase in receptor quantity/sensitivity).\n\ng) GABA negative allosteric modulator, the opposite of a benzo/z-drug, where a drug decreases GABA receptor sensitivity so that GABA binds less.\n\nUnfortunately there aren't a lot of these for GABA that have been thoroughly investigated, and their effects/usefulness vary as there are a bunch of GABA receptor subtypes (there's 16 GABAA subunits alone and they're grouped together in pentamers). If you've reached the stage of a certain degree of stability where akathisia and seizures are no longer happening, that's when you might be able to introduce a GABA antagonist or negative allosteric modulator\\[5\\], which can induce some of the unwanted/negative effects, but in exchange could cause rapid upregulation, helping to return sooner to a normal/stable GABA receptor state. I heard Mikhaila say in an interview with The Sun (Aug 6) that you're already doing this.\n\nOne possibly useful GABA antagonist is hyperforin in St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), but it also has an array of other interesting effects (including increasing the number of postsynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors -- that serotonin2A receptor being the single most impactful receptor type as agonizing it induces psychedelic/hallucinogenic/hyperdimensional/transcendental/frequency-increasing/reality-shifting effects). In fact SJW (that's the original SJW!) is an alternative to SSRIs without the dependence/side-effects that could help \"hold you up\" via serotonin (without risk of downregulation) while GABA heals.\n\nSo GABA receptor antagonists or GABA NAMs could help, but other than that the best you can do is leave GABA alone as much as possible until the system heals by upregulating GABA receptors.\n\nNow, that's addressing GABA neurotransmission imbalance only. The next most direct type of biochemical intervention might be glutamate antagonism... As mentioned there are 4 major types of glutamate receptors: NMDA, AMPA, kainate (3 ionotropic receptors), and metabotropic receptors. Drugs targeting the last 3 are largely experimental with unclear/mild/useless effects. But drugs targeting NMDA glutamate receptors are well-known and range from mild (magnesium) to incredibly strong (ketamine), depending on where they block ion channels opened by glutamate agonism on NMDA receptors. In addition to those two, a top antiglutamatergic drug worth knowing about is memantine (or its sibling amantadine). Perhaps the most relevant way to categorize these 3 drugs (also nutrient in the case of magnesium) is by duration: ketamine lasts about 1h, magnesium about 4h, memantine >12h. In the right doses, the effects are comparable, but in higher doses ketamine is much more powerful (a full-on dissociative anesthetic). Memantine also has dopamine D2 agonist (pro-motivation) effects, and magnesium deficiency is extremely common so supplementing with it is typically a good idea anyway (deficiency causes anxiety, fatigue, and worse). There are many forms of magnesium, with the best one being probably magnesium L-threonate as it enters the brain more effectively than other forms (so much so that it's considered a nootropic). A dosing regimen for these might look like: Magnesium L-threonate 1-3 times per day (maybe higher dose at night); ketamine maybe 10-20mg oral 1-5 times a day (note that oral is about 2-3x less potent than nasal or other routes of administration); memantine maybe 5mg 1-2 times a day, or 10-15mg every night or a few times a week if you can sleep on it (I do and wake up very refreshed). Sustained or even single-dose NMDA antagonism has been shown to repair/regenerate/modulate neurons, and it seems that it doesn't cause NMDA receptor upregulation because the up/downregulation mechanism itself involves NMDA receptors, but nonetheless just to be safest I wouldn't use them daily for too long (except magnesium).\n\nBut, because glutamate neurotransmission is affected by almost every other neurotransmission system, there are several other ways to decrease glutamatergic neurotransmission. Here are a few suggestions of other ones with anti-glutamate (and often pro-happiness) effects:\n\n* Bromocriptine (dopamine D2 and serotonin agonist, reverses glutamate GLT1 transporter)\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamotrigine#Pharmacology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamotrigine#Pharmacology), a low-side-effects sodium channel blocker used as antiepileptic drug that \"acts presynaptically on voltage-gated sodium channels to decrease glutamate release\"\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zonisamide#Mechanism\\_of\\_action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zonisamide#Mechanism_of_action), an antiseizure agent that seems to block sodium and T-type calcium channels\n* Lithium is an interesting drug/mineral that upregulates a large number of systems, increases neurotrophins, increases brain gray matter, and lowers glutamate (iodine and boron also lower glutamate, as do the herbs Boswellia and wormwood).\n* [https://nootropicsexpert.com/forskolin/](https://nootropicsexpert.com/forskolin/) is a cAMP increaser, a weird/unusual type of (naturally-occurring) drug with some anxiolitic effects that increases long-term potentiation (synaptic strength), which has been compared to benzos like alprazolam (Xanax) even though it doesn't touch GABA\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianeptine#Pharmacology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianeptine#Pharmacology) is a fascinating multi-mechanism drug thought to be an atypical agonist of the µ-opioid receptor but more interestingly is a glutamatergic, neurotrophic (BDNF releaser), and neuroplastic modulator\n* Another factor to consider is B vitamin sufficiency, because various vitamins in this family are co-factors required for the brain to synthesize neurotransmitters (a sip of red bull would be enough to replenish B vitamins, but nutritional yeast is better/healthier). Wikipedia reports \"One study showed vitamin B6 to be effective for the treatment of neuroleptic-induced akathisia\", which might have to do with B6 being required for the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase to convert glutamate to GABA.\n\nI think ideally you'd check if a sodium-channel blocker is enough or if one that also blocks calcium channels is more effective (calcium channel antagonism can induce hypotension). Don't quote me on that though as I should note I have almost no experience messing with ion channels directly.\n\nSo there's GABAergics and antiGABAergics, antiglutamatergics (NMDA antagonists and atypical modulators like tianeptine), and ion channel blockers that patch the damage done by chronic GABAergic/glutamatergic dysregulation.\n\nThere is another, much simpler, related neurotransmission system worth knowing about: the glycinergic system, which is the brainstem's version of GABA. So the human and mammalian part of the brain/CNS uses GABA to inhibit/relax, while the older reptilian part uses glycine, the simplest of the amino acids. In this case it's as simple as taking a glycine supplement, to see if it has a positive relaxing/anxiolitic effect. It might not because glycine also acts as a co-agonist for glutamate receptors. Another glycine receptor agonist is taurine, which has many interesting additional effects\\[6\\] without being required for glutamate receptor activation, such as increasing the level of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme that converts glutamate to GABA. In contrast, strychnine is a poison that acts as a strong glycine receptor antagonist. So I'd try glycine and taurine, separately (and then together if no noticeable effects), to see if boosting glycinergic neurotransmission and/or GAD is useful in this case.\n\nAfter that, the neurotransmission system I'd target (try to hack) next would be the endocannabinoid system. It might even be #1, depending on the individual. Have you seen the research of Professor Robert Melamede of University of California\\[7\\]? He seems to show that the endocannabinoid system regulates homeostasis itself. Many people have also had success using cannabis to heal cancer (the top researcher to look at for this is probably Rick Simpson), although this will never be officially admitted. Also, as Wikipedia says, \"some sufferers of chronic akathisia get relief from using Medical cannabis.\" The swarm of phytocannabinoids in cannabis activate/modulate the endocannabinoid neurotransmission system, which can help relax or keep at bay the symptoms of glutamatergic/GABAergic dysregulation while that system heals. Higher-THC strains may induce effects a bit more on the anxiogenic side, while lower-THC or higher-CBD strains may be a bit more on the anxiolitic/couchlocking side. Many people make the mistake of trying it the first time alongside tobacco/nicotine, which therefore has very different effects. It is also far more recommended to use a vaporization method/device, or cannabis edibles, rather than combustion mixed with tobacco in a cigarette, as the long-term negative effects of smoking are primarily due to the hundreds of toxic combustion byproducs, not the tobacco itself.\n\nThen there's the higher-layer tryptaminergic (i.e. serotonergic, melatonergic, and DMT) neurotransmission system, the latter of which binds to serotonin2A receptors like the psychedelics (psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline from cacti, LSD, etc). Messing with this system is generally safer (provided you use single-dose agonists and not any of the chronic drugs the pharmaceutical industry offers). There are two very different ways to mess with the serotonergic/tryptaminergic system. One is using chronic reuptake inhibitors like SSRIs or releasing agents such as MDMA -- you don't want to mess with those except in cases of MDMA-assisted trauma-healing psychotherapy or maybe for carefully-dosed party purposes. The second type is a subset where you're targeting a serotonin receptor subtype called 5-HT2A (5-HT meaning 5-hydroxytryptamine aka serotonin), the disturbance of the normal function of which causes psychedelic/hallucinogenic effects. The idea for psychedelics (serotonin2A agonists) is that a single dose, taken with great consideration as to dose and set & setting\\[8\\], can be a highly healing experience, and, in the case of DMT/ayahuasca, is the most mentally challenging experience one could have while incarnated. Here we're talking about frequency shifts, or belief system transmutation, where one can emerge a (somewhat or completely) new person at the other end. If you're willing to try medically-induced coma, it's hard to imagine you would not want to try DMT.\n\nA somewhat different type of neurochemical/biochemical signalling system worth considering/researching are the neurotrophins -- these are substances that promote neurogenesis and regulate synaptic strength and plasticity in the mammalian nervous system. The best known neurotrophin is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which binds to TrkB receptors. Normally BDNF and other TrkB agonists are produced after intense exercise, fasting, meditation, sleep (by the action of normelatonin), visiting new places / being in unfamiliar situations, situations of sense of momentary danger in a controlled or low-risk manner (rollercoasters, water parks, high speeds, balancing, parkour, skydiving, etc etc), learning new games or skills... but there are a few nootropics that also act as TrkB agonists or BDNF releasers, and even TrkB upregulators, such as the Russian nootropic Semax (and Selank)\\[9\\]. And, as WP notes, \"one mechanism through which BDNF appears to maintain elevated levels of neuronal excitation is through preventing GABAergic signaling activities\". So it's possible that increased TrkB signalling could accelerate processes of neurogenesis and specifically GABA receptor upregulation (by acting as an antiGABAergic). Another one is Lion's Mane, a mushroom which increases Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and myelination, also used as a nootropic.\n\nSpeaking of nootropics (smart drugs), consider trying some of the greatest nootropics\\[10\\], such as Bacopa (ayurvedic herb of the gods, maybe \"as effective\" as the benzo lorazepam, yet may upregulate GABA), aniracetam or other racetams (glutamate modulators), CDP-choline (aka citicoline, helps repair brain cell membranes and more), phosphatidylserine (lowers cortisol, promotes NGF and LTP), sulbutiamine (improves glutamatergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic function), or even caffeine if used right (can theoretically increase density of, i.e. upregulate, GABA receptors). Though if you're hooked to caffeine, I'd recommend tapering off to allow for normalization/homeostasis as caffeine (an adenosine receptor antagonist) affects a bunch of different neurotransmission systems.\n\nOnly after getting some grip on neuromodulation of GABAergic, glutamatergic/NMDA, glycinergic, cannabinoidergic, tryptaminergic and maybe ion channel systems, would I recommend looking into catecholaminergic (referring to dopamine/noradrenaline) or monoaminergic (referring to the monoamines dopamine/noradrenaline/serotonin) interventions, while a typical doctor may be quick to want to prescribe SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) -- or often worse yet benzos -- for anything involving/causing depressive symptoms. The reason is that some dopamine and noradrenaline (aka norepinephrine) receptor subtypes are inhibitory (i.e. activating of GABA), but on average they are excitatory (activating of glutamate), so a general/nonselective increase in dopaminergic and/or noradrenergic neurotransmission can each cause increased glutamatergic neurotransmission. The #1 cause of akathisia seems to be use of antipsychotic drugs, which primarily act as dopamine receptor antagonists, causing dopamine receptor upregulation, which causes higher baseline dopamine neurotransmission, which in turn induces higher baseline glutamatergic neurotransmission. Wikipedia also says \"It was discovered that akathisia involves increased levels of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine\".\n\nOne exception here might be serotonin antagonists, which are \"often a very effective treatment\" for akathisia, presumably either because lowering serotonergic neurotransmission lowers glutamatergic neurotransmission, or because it induces serotonin receptor upregulation, which increases tryptaminergic (including DMT) neurotranmission, which is just a wonderful all-around healing mechanism that remains vastly underestimated/underappreciated. However, serotonin antagonism is a biochemical definition of the opposite of fun/happiness. If you want to mess with serotonin, and you probably should, I'd go for SJW, and the natural serotonin2A agonists, as mentioned.\n\nIf you want to hack/mess with dopaminergic/catecholaminergic neurotransmission, I'd recommend trying something indirect like bromantane (sibling of memantine/amantadine but is only a weak NDMA antagonist), which increases the TH and AAAD enzymes that make dopamine from L-tyrosine. IME if you need a \"dopamine patch\" (enhanced motivation) while recovering from non-dopamine neural dysfunction, this one could be effective and is rather unintrusive. Another one to consider if you need a motivation boost is modafinil (dopamine reuptake inhibitor), as well as the aforementioned memantine (dopamine D2 receptor agonist).\n\nAnother neurotransmission system affected by high glutamate is the cholinergic system, but unless you have any indication of dysfunction of this system, I wouldn't touch it (beyond occasional use of the natural nootropic citicoline). Likewise with the opioidergic system, unless you want even greater trouble. I think hacking of your glutamatergic, cannabinoidergic, glycinergic, and tryptaminergic/serotonergic systems are better \"patch\" candidates to hold you over until your GABA neurotransmission normalizes.\n\nBeyond biochemistry, there are often higher-level causal mechanisms underlying physical biochemical imbalances, the emerging science of which has been called or is grouped under biophysics, i.e. the study of how always-present or ubiquitous physical elements (such as photons, electromagnetic frequencies, magnetic fields, Earth electron flow aka grounding/earthing, oxygen, hydrogen, water) influence the body to degrees that our established scientific paradigms can scarcely suppose, involving especially our much-overlooked mitochondria. For example, sunlight frequencies from infrared to red-yellow seem to induce mitochondria to produce water, and it's not even H2O, it's \"structured\" or exclusion zone water (H3O2) which holds cellular charge\\[11\\] -- in addition to the well-known but still vastly underappreciated extreme health benefits of superhigh/optimal vitamin D levels\\[12\\]. In other words, vitamin D supplementation is highly useful, but it may not fully replace regular sunshine exposure. Grounding/earthing is another concept worth researching. In summary, spending time in nature is more essential than we tend to assume these days.\n\nLastly (but not least), there are also several non-drug ideas to consider, such as (in no particular order):\n\n* meditate often (maybe make it 1st and last thing every day), if your body/brain allows, as meditation enhances all manner of brain abilities, generates new neuronal connections, upregulates neurotrophic (neuron-generating) factors, etc (may be easier if combined with sensory deprivation tech like veil+earplugs or flotation tank)\n* avoid common deficiencies, especially magnesium and DHA/EPA (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids); the latter increase BDNF and decrease pro-inflammatory molecules like COX-2, and DHA deficiency directly causes depression\n* avoid toxins as much as you can (GMOs, fluoride, glyphosate/pesticides, heavy metals like mercury in seafood, chemtrails dust, amalgam fillings, and vaccine adjuvants like injected aluminum), and sugary/carby foods which although natural are also quite toxic in high doses, and insulin spikes increase glutamate (and as you know, low-carb/clean-keto or zero-carb is used to treat seizures)\n* avoid calcium metabolism dysfunction, as glutamate excitotoxicity is mediated via calcium ions, and excess free calcium is caused by deficiency of either vitamin D, vitamin K2, or magnesium, which are required for the body to be able to deposit calcium where it's needed (such as bones and teeth but not arteries or glands or kidneys)\n* try NAC (N-acetylcysteine), the main precursor to glutathione, the body's master antioxidant (also serves along with vitamin D3 as prophylaxis/treatment against CV), as many strange conditions have to do with glutathione depletion (made using cysteine+glycine+glutamate)\n* if you fast for about 36-48h, stem cells and other deep cellular repair processes activate, where if you push the fasting the right amount of time, you'll emerge on the other side feeling renewed, similar to when you emerge from a flu or similar condition (but less dramatic). Fasting for about 7 days can induce massive general neurotransmitter receptor upregulation\\[13\\] -- this could be the single best thing you could do.\n* obviously adequate sleep is essential; when you're groggy and foggy, that's largely because neuronal repair processes didn't finish, and those will be faster if you're not digesting any food while sleeping\n* destressing in every way you can, as chronic stress and (its biochemical correlate) elevated cortisol keeps you in sympathetic/fight-or-flight mode (low GABA/serotonin), also attenuating the immune system (the main tip in this regard for most people is turn. off. the. TV.)\n* a type of toxin that deserves its own point is heavy metals poisoning, which causes/aggravates a large number of health conditions -- and the way to discard this possibility is by taking purified zeolites\\[14\\], which people are using to heal even supposedly incurable conditions\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n* GABAergic drugs: avoid all agonists (alcohol/benzos/etc), try some antagonists such as Muira Puama\\[15\\] (to induce upregulation) for some time, or try St. John's Wort which may upregulate without noticeable antagonist/anxiogenic effects\n* Antiglutamatergic drugs: magnesium L-threonate (or glycinate, bisglycinate, taurate, citrate, orotate, lysinate, malate -- but not the common largely-unabsorbable oxide), ketamine (both as microdosing and used entheogenically), memantine/amantadine\n* ion channel antagonist drugs: the less intrusive (the less targeted ion channels) the better, if it works\n* Glycinergic drugs: glycine, taurine\n* Cannabinoidergic drugs: cannabis (and to a much lesser extent, CBD extracts)\n* tryptaminergic drugs: DMT (and this one will change your life more than anything else that exists if you use it appropriately -- research Terence McKenna first), other classical psychedelics, melatonin supplementation at night (a superantioxidant along with its metabolite normelatonin), but not SSRIs (reuptake inhibitors) as these taken chronically will cause (highly-unpleasant) downregulation, rather than a desirable frequency shift (even from a single use!)\n* Neurotrophins, generally preferrably induced by exercise (which comes with additional benefits), but TrkB upregulators like Semax could be useful too, as well as nootropics like Lion's Mane\n\nGo slow if you can -- be methodic, as it'll be better if you know which ones are having positive effects and which ones seem to do nothing or have net negative effects. Some people say it can take up to 36 months (but more commonly 18 months) to heal profound GABA downregulation, but with many of these tips you might be able to reduce that time by a significant amount.\n\nI hope this helps deepen your understanding of your GABAergic troubles.

What makes \"synthetic\", \"chronic\", often \"high-side effects\" and \"expensive\" appealing?\n\n\"Do you think anything synthetic is automatically bad for you? Even vaccines and other modern medicines?\"\n\nAbsolutely not; I use and give to others (occasionally, NEVER chronically if I can avoid it) a ton of different synthetic substances of a bunch of different chemical classes for a large number of different reasons. Vaccines can be useful tools in principle, but in practice they have become vehicles for the generation of life-long customers (by means of adding neurotoxic and immunotoxic adjuvants such as aluminum; see full list in post below), which is far from strange or unexpected when you realize we have allowed absurdly lax standards (far lower safety requirements than for regular drugs) and then given vaccine manufacturers full legal immunity from any damages caused -- as e.g. [Robert F. Kennedy Jr explains in this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmbYYl-lHMA).\n\n\"For example, he opposes immunization, fluoridation, mammography, and the routine administration of vitamin K shots to the newborn; claims that amalgam fillings are toxic; and makes many unsubstantiated recommendations for dietary supplements.\"\n\nLOL, he's absolutely right about all that, and the idea that those things are good for your health is absurd. How can you POSSIBLY believe those things to be good for you? It's flabbergasting. Fluoridation being bad is now actually pretty much officially admitted, but you missed this news... oh wait, they didn't tell you! They just quietly revised policies, if even that. Mercury in your mouth is a good idea? Almost everyone in odontology has accepted it's one of the worst ideas ever, regardless of what corrupted regulatory agencies may still claim. Brother, I highly recommend you be far, far more careful about the sources of information you allow to influence you, otherwise you'll end up with terrible health problems soon enough, if you don't have them already.\n\n\"He has advised against eating many foods that the scientific community regards as healthful, such as bananas, oranges, red potatoes, white potatoes, all milk products, and almost all grains.\n\nWhich makes complete sense when you don't just appeal to perceived \"authoritative\" sources from corrupted \"health authorities\" and government regulatory agencies and passively receive their information (i.e. look only at one set of industry-approved scientists and studies while ignoring the other sets) instead of researching for yourself (which does require time). Our bodies are not adapted to modern high-carb lifestyles, which causes many of the chronic disease conditions; they're still adapted to very-low-carb keto/paleo diets prior to the terribly unhealthy junk food and SAD most people eat today (you could even argue also prior to the invention of agriculture 11,000 years ago, which is like yesterday in biological time). There's nothing natural about guzzling down meal after meal filled with HFCS and a bunch of other toxic crap. How about you try reducing carbs for a month and see how you feel? It's one of the best things you can do for your health. I haven't been to a doctor in over 15 years (I am my own doctor thanks to people like Dr. Mercola), how about you?\n\n\"He has also given silly advice, such as minimizing exposure to electromagnetic fields by avoiding electric razors, microwaving of foods, watches with batteries.\"\n\nHow is that silly? We are electrochemical beings, we're affected by both chemicals and electromagnetism. Used in the right way, magnetism can actually be one of the most powerful healing mechanisms of all. The opposite is also true. That you may not have heard about the myriad studies addressing the effects of EMFs on the human body (which is not suprising once you become aware of the corruption) doesn't mean they have no effect. Watch for example the documentary [Resonance: Beings of Frequency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FttrOK1ec4Q).\n\n\"In 2005, the FDA ordered Mercola and his Optimal Wellness Center to stop making illegal claims for products sold through his Web site. ...\"\n\nYeah, the FDA (as with other corrupted \"revolving door\" govt regulatory agencies) is used by Big Pharma to stamp out the competition that they perceive as the greatest threat. They target individual doctors and scientists and groups, companies, herbs, drugs, even entire mechanisms of action. They even went after doctors saying Vitamin C can be useful against Covid (despite NYC hospitals successfully using it). It's beyond unacceptable and should enrage you, not cause you to promote them as legitimate \"health authorities\". Researchers, insiders/whisteblowers, scientists, etc have been pointing out this corruption for many many years, see for example the documentary [The War of Health](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0CQrL5nzwo). It's primarily a war based on control over information sources.\n\n\"You like tanning beds? Hardly seems natural to me.\"\n\nThere are 3 ways to get the all-important vitamin D into your body: sunshine exposure (by far the best), tanning beds, and supplementation. They're all good ways. Much better to use a tanning bed (artificial UV light exposure) than not getting any vitamin D.\n\nHowever, THANK YOU for addressing actual points/arguments, unlike the other guy who shills for Big Ag without any actual arguments.",

The doctors have no idea what it's like and just think you're trying to get some opiates. Kind of nasty feeling that way but it's understandable considering the crises. Since I understood the nuerochemistry of how opiates work I was terrified of them and didn't want them anyway. At most I was willing to try them on an as needed basis during a bad panic.

I would stay far away unless you know you do not have an addictive personality.\n* **propranolol:** received a script to no effect. apparently my anxiety is not triggered by a strong adrenal response.\n* **dextroamp-amphetamin:** threw me into a full blown panic attack and consequent psychosis.\n* **n-acetyl l-tyrosyne:**  noticeably worsened my anxiety. my dopamine to serotonin ratio must be out of balance as i cannot cope with anything stimulating dopamine or norepinephrine.\n* **holy basil, l-theanine, rhodiola blend** (total calm brand): anxiety remained unaffected with some accompanying lethargy. good for sleep but no benefits for daytime use.\n* **glycine**, i purchased 1 kg of the stuff thinking it would reduce anxiety. turns out glycine can also be stimulating for reasons i don't understand too well. made me noticeably more anxious for 3 hours after supplementing. I put aside several days of only glycine supplementation to test this to the same effect.\n* ***some redeemable qualities for anxiety or insomnia:***\n   * **chrysin**: failed as an anxiolytic but perhaps shows promise in inhibiting estrogen\n      * (passion flower extract) raises testosterone and is a GABAᵃ receptor agonist.\n   * **SAMe** (ineffective in the short term for anxiety at least, nothing uncomfortable)\n   * **aniracetam**\n   * **bacoppa monnieri*****:*** upregulates gaba ^(a) in mice, had no noticeable effect on anxiety. perhaps long term there could be a noticeable difference.\n   * **valerian root**, minuscule reduction in anxiety accompanied by a great feeling of lethargy. better sleep aid than daytime anxiolytic.\n   * **turmeric**, no noticeable difference in anxiety\n   * **linalool oil** (500mg pill):  (lowers glutamate) very large reduction in anxiety accompanied by a lot of lethargy and loss of focus. I also read afterwards that this stuff potentially nukes your microbiome so be careful.)\n   * **thiamin b1** \\- no real noticeable effect on anxiety but it remains a part of my dietary supplementation.\n   * **apigenin** \\- A flavinoid found in chamomile and passionflower responsible for their sedative effects. Strong anxiolytic effect on general anxiety, not much of a pro social. It lasts about an hour and has a terrible rebound effect.

    "body": "Probably the most frustrating thing about using products like NMN and NR for longevity is the price. It ain't cheap!\n\nSo I've been studying to see if there was a way to boost NAD+ on the cheap. I don't think there's a way around using NR and NMN, but you can use less of it and thereby save money. Here's what I found out:\n\nOne of the primary reasons that we have less NAD+ in our bodies as we age is because of [something called CD38](https://neurohacker.com/what-is-cd38-an-exploration-of-nad-consumption-uses-and-functions-of-cd38). The amount of CD38 goes up as we age, and because CD38 consumes NAD+ we get less NAD+ in our cells to keep our immune system working and keeping our DNA functioning as it should.\n\nSo is there a way to keep CD38 down you ask? And fortunately yes there is! There are [studies that show that Quercetin and Apigenin inhibits CD38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609577/) and raises intracellular NAD+. Quercetin is found in many plants but it can be bought as a cheap supplement too. Apigenin is hard to buy as a pure supplement, but luckily it's found [abundantly in chamomile tea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5791748/). Chamomile tea contains between 0.8 - 1.2% of Apigenin. By drinking around 0.5 liters of Chamomile tea each day you get around 5 grams of Apigenin. [Mouse studies that treated mice with Apigenin found that they had 50% higher NAD](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/comments/S1550-4131(18)30122-0?fbclid=IwAR0uL4qAaC6djsu6o1gi0hEh_D632At-c9MQuZC8fgA7KExSscneyb4VOFc) than mice who were not treated with Apigenin.\n\nSo what's the take away here? I think you can drastically boost NAD+ in your body relatively cheap by taking a relatively low amount of NR or NMN (depending on your age) and combine it with Quercetine and Apigenin to lower CD38. This is of course my own conclusions which haven't been tried scientifically. However I urge you to read the links I've provided to come to your own conclusions.\n\nAnyway here is my longevity stack on the (relatively of course) cheap:\n\n* 500 mg of NMN or NR [(raises NAD with about 100%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278280)).\n* [1 g of Quercetin](http://www.isoquercetin.net/sirt1/) (inhibits CD 38 and activates SIRT1)\n* [1 g of Berberin](http://www.isoquercetin.net/sirt1/) (works like Metformin and activates SIRT1, increases AMPK and decreases mTOR)\n* About 0.5 dl of Extra Virgin Olive oil (for [Tyrosol which is a powerful SIRT activator)](http://www.isoquercetin.net/sirt1/)\n* About 0.5 liters of chamomile tea which gives about 5 g of Apigenin.",

Dried parsley has been reported to have the maximum quantity of  apigenin, at 45,035 μg/g. Additional sources of apigenin are dried  flower of chamomile, containing 3,000 to 5,000 μg/g; celery seeds,  containing 786.5 μg/g; and vine spinach and Chinese celery, containing  622 μg/g and 240.2 μg/g\n\nYou can eat parsley, but you would need to eat quite a lot of it to get 5 grams of Apigenin - about 100 gram of dried parsley if my math is right (it probably isn't!). I think it's easier to drink 0.5 liter of chamomile tea which also gives 5 gram of Apigenin,",

I have chronic sleep issues so I decided to give it a try.\n\nI ordered a bottle of 50mg capsules from Nootropics Depot and was *blown away* by how effective it was.  Taking one capsule at 3-4am would knock me out more quickly and effectively than anything else in my arsenal of sleep aides (tryptophan, melatonin cream, valerian root, etc.)  A few times when the insomnia was really bad, I took two capsules and got the same effect.  One really horrible night I went all the way up to three capsules before I was knocked out.\n\nI quickly realized that this was going to be a staple supplement for me so I went to order another bottle before I ran out of the first.  That's when I noticed the Double Wood Supplements version for almost half the price.\n\nI'd already ordered several different supplements from Double Wood but always felt some nagging misgiving about their bizarrely low prices.  I wondered how their quality could possibly be good at that price point?  But I couldn't tell for sure, because the supplements I was using from them don't produce a consciously noticeable effect.\n\nI decided to order my second bottle of apigenin from Double Wood as a kind of test, because this was a supplement that I absolutely *would* be able to notice whether it was real and potent or not.\n\nYou can probably see where this is going.\n\nI ran out of Nootropics Depot aginenin and cracked open my bottle from Double Wood Supplements.\n\n***Absolutely no effect whatsoever*** even after taking 6 capsules (300 mg!)\n\nWhere 50mg usually worked with the Nootropics Depot brand, even 600 mg from Double Wood produced *no noticeable effect at all!*\n\nThis confirmed what I was already suspecting. Double Wood Supplements is not reliable.  And I know some of you will say that you've had noticeable effects from some of their other supplements.  That's great.  I'm sure some of their other offerings are real and potent.  The problem is that *some are clearly not, a*nd I don't have a magic 8 ball that tells me which is which.\n\nFurthermore, that shouldn't even be my problem.  I shouldn't have to guess which offering is real and potent, and which is not.  *Every supplement* a manufacturer offers should be real and potent.  If they're not then they lose my business. \n\nI will never buy another Double Wood supplement again and if you looked in my trash can right now, you would see several half full bottles with their name on them.\n\nI thought you should know.\n\nTl;dr I got a bottle of aginenin from Double Wood Supplements that had zero effect, whereas a different brand with the same size dose was the most effective natural sleep aide I've ever used.   \n\n\n&#x200B;",

It can then become any cell you may want to turn it into, but it will have the same genetic code. It has been shown that by activating O, S, and K you can partially reprogram a cell back to a previous age safely, as well as repair tissue and restore function to areas of the body that have been damaged.\n\nWhat we are doing here, is activating O,S, and M. This is actually done by allot of people all the time. The primary activator for this is a beloved supplement and it along with NAD/NMN has been used by a fair number of people and there are no known safety concerns. I myself have used these two on the regular for about two years. Some form of NAD or NMN for about 4.\n\n***Apigenin*** is what we are using to activate the Yamanaka Factor genes, as opposed to using Forskolin and RepSox, which is what they used in the resource at the top.  \n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27449921/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27449921/)\n\nWhy Apigenin? The simple answer is that there isn't anything else you can find out there that is produced in plants/vegetables that will activate multiple Yamanaka Factor Genes, AND its only shown to be safe. Even in the high dosages we will be taking it.\n\nAnd it does this activation via the immune system.\n\nNFATc1 Nucleur Factor of Activated T Cells  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEs5x78EWRY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEs5x78EWRY)\n\nNMN/NAD synergy with Apigenin  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609577/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609577/)\n\nCD38 as a vector for Immune system modulation  \n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35834988/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35834988/)  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7408359/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7408359/)  \n[https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.00225-23](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.00225-23)\n\n***More resources have been added at the very end***\n\nHere is a compiled analysis of many small molecules for their use in cellular reprogramming  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8751603/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8751603/)\n\nThe following outlines the minimal requirements for a combination of chemicals to work.  \n\"Functional analysis of SMs and their targets revealed that they are distributed between three major categories: epigenetics, intra- and inter-cellular signaling, and metabolic “switchers”. All these categories appear to be mandatorily presented in each SM cocktail to induce cell reprogramming. Specifically, it seems that sufficient components for a “minimal reprogramming” cocktail have to include an inhibitor of HDAC (e.g. VPA or NaB), an inhibitor of TGFβ signaling (e.g. RepSox), and GSK3-inhibiting SMs (e.g. CHIR99021 or LiCl). This assumption was further confirmed by the KEGG pathways enrichment analysis. The unusually significant enrichment of epigenetic and signaling pathways highlights their importance in chemical iP. Remarkably, many enriched pathways were related to aging, longevity and age-related diseases, thus presumably connecting them with the processes of cell reprogramming. \"\n\nSo that's the inhibition of three things  \nTGFβ  \nGSK3  \nHDAC\n\nAnd incidentally, Apigenin does all three. The HDAC inhibition is done by conditioning the gut over time to increase levels of Butyrate. Butyrate is listed in the compiled analysis as a inducer of re-programming. Apigenin is labeled as a enhancer. However when in concert with several other compounds, the breakthrough is in the acknowledgement of Apigenin as a master director of cellular activity in relation to human health.\n\nHowever in my experience with taking Apigenin in combo with NAD/NMN/NR there was always an upper limit. This is because there is additional effort needed specifically to unpackage your DNA from your histones. That's the HDAC inhibition. Once additional Butyrate was added I was able to properly access my record and have my cells begin to transcribe my previous epigenetic code.\n\nHDACi - Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors  \n[https://youtu.be/J9jhg90A7Lw](https://youtu.be/J9jhg90A7Lw)  \n[https://youtu.be/9heRdhW6PNw](https://youtu.be/9heRdhW6PNw)\n\nIf you look at the article at the very top involving Sinclair's cocktails they observe that a much higher concentration of the HDACi is required compared to the primary activators.\n\nButyrate seems to do the job of an HDACi very well, and is available to us without a prescription which is also a very good indicator of its safety. Valporic Acid is used alternatively and is a restricted substance. Butyrate a class 1 HDACi and not dependent on NAD. Tributryn is what I have used myself because its just butyrate that's made to be more easily absorbed into the gut.\n\nIt would seem that the unpackaging of your DNA leads your cells into wanting to try and repair themselves alone without additional prompting.  \n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41368-019-0053-2#Sec11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41368-019-0053-2#Sec11)\n\n***Theory***  \nApigenin overall is being used to activate a immune response involved in repair and has the ability to pop the hood on epigenetic code/cell identity and can be further augmented by supplementation and augmentation of the processes involved to deliver results **beyond** what have been previously documented. This would result in the slow restoration of epigenetic code from the immune system out to every cell that can be reached. The body will require time to catch up with the re-programing, and there may be relative limits to how much reprogramming you can effectively do in a certain amount of time. I have experienced ongoing regenerative effects from using this combination, even after cessation, from fixing a ringing ear, my lungs, joint pain, I don't get cross eyed after working hard anymore, I had damage to my cardiovascular system due to covid that's now gone, and smoother skin.\n\n***Additional Components***\n\nB12 is required to avoid encoding logarithmic scale errors.  \n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00916-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00916-6)  \nMake sure you use Methycobalamin, and I would recommend using it sublingually.\n\nWe will want to have a handle on the inflammation/GSK3 inhibition outside of what Apigenin is trying to do like CHIR990021 is, although it should be noted CHIR990021 inhibits both the alpha and beta sub pathways of GSK3 and nothing listed here inhibits GSK3a. The simple explanation being that you wouldent see much sanity in trying to repair a home thats still on fire.\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18720192/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18720192/)  \nCurcumin has a very big reputation with reducing inflammation. It's recommended you take it as Curcumin Phytosome. I have not felt the need to take it 1:1 with Apigenin like you will see in Sinclairs cocktails with 1:1 RepSox/CHIR990021.\n\nLithium has been brought up as an alternative GSK3 inhibitor but it would be the only item on this list that would have any known toxicity issues in humans.\n\nGenistein would be something people looking to experiment and report on alternatives could try. Very likely it has some unique synergetic impacts of it's own that might make it better instead of or perhaps mixed with a lower dose of the curcumin.  \n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35447103/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35447103/)\n\nIn the video above for NFATc1  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEs5x78EWRY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEs5x78EWRY)  \nThere is a 2 minute oscillation on the pathway, meaning it can take in more calcium every two minutes. For me it has been smoother with some Long Release Calcium.\n\n***/Putting it all together/***\n\nI think of it more like a reaction occuring between the Apigenin and hightened butyrate levels and everything else is about maintaining smooth operation under the best conditions you can to ensure no errors. Ultimately I think there is enough autocorrect going on between mechaisms so to speak that you get as naturally holistic result as you could as for. It's incredibly unlikely in my opinion that there will be a better molecule that can do this kind of wor so to speak than Apigenin.\n\nI Haven't felt the need to use more than 500mg of curcumin a day to get the effect I want. In the concern too much could smother effects.  \nIll start off with the 500mg curcumin/600mg sr Calcium/550mg CoreBIOME Tributryn about an hour beforehand.  \nBe sure you have plenty of B12 and take a good multivitamin you feel comfortable with for your bodytype/physical characteristics etc.\n\nThen in packaged dosages, not needing this more than twice in a day.  \n300mg of liposomal Apigenin, a half gram of the NAD/NMN/NR complex, and then another half a gram of the CoreBIOME Tributryn.\n\nThen I will take a second pill of calcium with the second shot. It's possible you are already getting enough calcium, vut that's just how I do it.  \nAfter the second shot I'm well enough for a nap. I repeat it again when I wake up, but take breaks when you feel you have had enough.\n\nDidn't feel like I needed more than a gram of the slow release calcium per day. Some think you don't need it but just be mindful of your overall nutritious intake and watch the B12.\n\nI also had damage to my lungs due to a bad smoking habit that was specifically aided by adding NAC.\n\n5ft11.5inches  \nI'd guess I'm about 200 lbs.  \nNo notable change in body weight.  \nI will also submit for the record that pizza rolls are more common in my diet than would be recommended for someone doing this.\n\nYou will also want to know this works for animals awell, their immune systems are very similar. More data is needed to determine dosing for any specific one though.\n\nBecause of optics and being the Chicago Pile - Body of One, I do not feel comfortable yet with recommending specific vendors for products. I have some immediate concerns to be sure these natural components you can already buy without limit are made fairly and cheaply accessiable to everyone, but I believe it is incumbent on everyone that this medicine be delivered to those that may need it the most by some lind of honor system we can all agree on. I have been told it has succsessfully treated some cancers and even Sinclair's latest work on OSK will confirm what i've been told anonymously.\n\n***This is the first human technology capable of regrowing bone/limbs***\n\nThe mechanisms involved are based on core immunological functions the body already has. There is no reason it should have taken this long to get this to people, which is why I put it on everyone reading this to investigate this to the full capacity you have as a human being. This is also for your dog, cat, and birds by the way. It works on theoretically all eukaryotic life.\n\nI submit it to the world for everyone's empowerment and greater fulfillment in their life.\n\nIt has come out via my description of my dosage I could have only gotten the Apigenin and NAD/NMN/NR complex from Renue, which I will confirm.\n\nAnyone reading this is reading was at the front of human experimentation several months ago but given how far I have already heard of this spreading there is still so\n\nThe first time I did it it was for almost two weeks straight (along with Ca-AKG and Forskolin, which to me felt like they augmented the process) and I regrettably did not have enough B12 which caused tons of problems. I needed about a week of reprogramming back on while getting the proper supplementation before I was back to normal. After that I took roughly a weekend additionally doing it right. In spite of the transcription errors I incurred to my epigenetic code I still repaired allot of things wrong with my body. It was a cumulatively positive outcome none the less.\n\nI started using butyrate around the end of October 23. The paper regarding B12 wasn't out till weeks later. I wasn't using it till the beginning of December and shortly thereafter I added a dedicated GSK3 inhibitor, curcumim. Both of these additions were made as timely as they were because of help I got from individuals I shared my experience with online. For that I am incredibly grateful.\n\nThe reprogramming is being done by your immune system, the overall health you come into this with will also be a factor. I have had years to be sure about my vendor for Liposomal Apigenin and NAD/NMN but have not shopped around for Tributryn. Your results may differ from mine, for one because we have figured out so much more than where I started thanks to the improvements made along the way.\n\nExactly how much deaging for how much time you do this is up for grabs. I didn't have multiple decades to shave off, I can say that even when done improperly the first two weeks of this were the most noticeably impactful. Although it should be said that I've still noticed small changes and improvements even weeks after cessation.\n\nChronologically I turn 33 in spring 24, my body has not felt like this since I was around 25 and I have tried to push things further but definitely am not feeling extreme changes like I did at the beginning. This could be limited from lots of things. Namely that there aren't really as many differences to notice in dropping another half decade. It could be that my body has to catch up with my programming a bit more before It can worry about going back further.\n\nOSK activation is also thought to take you back to around your mid 20s.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that I have tested the safety parameters of this concept in multiple ways and am still very much alive. I am only grateful to be able to be useful in the narrow ways I have been.\n\nI wouldn't expect your hairline to come back immediately given it is on a cycle that takes months to years. Your skin takes 30 days to regrow. Shoot for one week on one week off to avoid Immune system exhaustion and listen to your body, it will do the best it can.  \n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-019-0221-9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-019-0221-9)\n\n-Best  \nDude Wearing Shoes\n\n***Additional Resources***\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-49546-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-49546-8)  \nMore on how Transcription Factors do this kind of reprogramming.\n\nLatest work showing that aging is more or less the sum of all parts, with some parts further worn in than others depending on behavior/lifestyle choices.  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10700136/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10700136/)  \nMy experience has felt to me like it's those parts of the body that are further worn in that this targets first.

Essentially, you have to somehow be taking it even after it makes you pass out for it to start causing problems.  \n[https://cdn.caymanchem.com/cdn/msds/10010275m.pdf](https://cdn.caymanchem.com/cdn/msds/10010275m.pdf)  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3281105/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3281105/)  \nNo documentation of issues with humans because Apigenin is not ordinarily delivered intravenously, and especially nobody is out there pumping the gas on it while you are already asleep from it.\n\nRegular metabolization (I experience it faster once adding the tributyrin during the protocol.)  \n\"For all participants, plasma apigenin concentration rose after bolus ingestion and fell within 28 h under the detection limit (2.3 nmol/l).\"  \n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16407641](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16407641)\n\nApigenin is listed as having a degree of GSK3 inhibition.  \n[https://applbiolchem.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s13765-017-0271-2#](https://applbiolchem.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s13765-017-0271-2#)\n\nFrom what I have read, there is overlap between GSK3a and GSK3b (and it might not be of overall consequence), however it should be noted that CHIR990021 inhibits both. Apigenin, Curcumin, and Genestein only inhibit GSK3b.\n\nApigenin continues to prove to be an ameliorating agent in the human body for all sorts of problems, across every tissue, every part of the body.  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554558/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554558/)  \n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34076830/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34076830/)  \n[https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00118.2021](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00118.2021)  \n[https://cancerci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12935-021-01888-x](https://cancerci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12935-021-01888-x)\n\nIt's extremely safe.\n\n***And the fact it boosts butyrate is by far my biggest signaler to apigenins core destiny in human function.***  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6152273](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6152273)  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019962/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019962/)  \n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32610574/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32610574/)\n\n***Telomeres***  \nTelomeres come up in conversation allot, but are better to be thought of as biomarkers or clockhands rather than the gears driving aging. None of the data held in your telomeres is ever permanently lost. Apigenin is documented here to be able to modulate transcriptional telomerase when interacting with cancer.  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6949317/#:\\~:text=Several%20studies%20showed%20that%20pluripotency,activate%20telomerase%20genes%20during%20reprogramming](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6949317/#:~:text=Several%20studies%20showed%20that%20pluripotency,activate%20telomerase%20genes%20during%20reprogramming).\n\nAnd in general Yamanaka Factor gene activation will restore their length.  \n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3317569/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3317569/)\n\nNanog suppression/expression depending on context  \n[https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/13/3/404](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/13/3/404)  \n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35310040/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35310040/)\n\nFrom the way I look at it, this is exactly what Apigenin was made to do. It's a generalist and a specialist.  \nWe need to situate the body for, and ultimately activate Yamanaka factors - CHECK  \nInflammation/GSK3 inhibition (to its own small degree it can manage) - CHECK  \nIncrease HDAC inhibition via butyrate - CHECK\n\nRemember, Apigenin can make pluripotent stem cells retain their pluripotency, unaided. This power is also safely orchestrated in adult cells, further underlying the contextual power this substance really has in ameliorating states safely.\n\nBut we cant do all of this work effectively enough in the body with Apigenin alone.\n\nSo we add Butyrate to ensure we have a separate chemical pathway unfurling your DNA from your histones for easier access, and it's synergistically amplified by the Apigenin, and we add the curcumin which has it's own synergistic HDAC inhibition with the Butyrate AND helps handle the inflammation.  \nThe added Calcium is there to make sure that when conditions are well enough for OSM activation they are fueled.  \n[TDWS1991@protonmail.com](mailto:TDWS1991@protonmail.com)  \nu/Mattsth3dud3\n\nBTC  \n36n38UTwD2qXgeDdShwNp8tNeC1HP96gYx",

After all, thanks for the information, i will definitely dive deeper into high dose melatonin. Sadly in germany it is limited to 1 mg per „dose“, so i would need massive amounts to get in the 1g range… i was unfamiliar with it until you made me familiar with it, now i am part of the movement. We all should learn everyday. Like i said, appreciated and feel blessed buddy. Maybe you improved the life of myself or someone i will recommend your recommendation to :-) cheers",

    "body": "Most people don’t realize it, but many common sleeping pills are doing more harm than good. Sure, they knock you out fast—but they also mess with your brain, weaken your body, and can even shorten your life. What starts as a simple pill for a restless night can slowly chip away at your health, memory, and long-term well-being. The truth is, real sleep doesn’t come from forcing your brain to shut down—it comes from restoring balance in your body. And science is finally catching up to show us better, safer ways to sleep deeply and live longer.\n\nBenzodiazepines like diazepam or lorazepam are among the worst offenders. They’ve been linked to memory loss, dependence, and even a higher risk of dementia. Studies have shown that long-term users have up to 50% higher risk of dying early. That’s not a small number. And then there are the so-called “Z-drugs” like Ambien or Lunesta. These might seem gentler, but research shows they’re connected to hallucinations, rebound insomnia, and even higher cancer risk. When you rely on these pills, you’re not really sleeping—you’re sedated. Your brain doesn’t get to do the healing work it’s supposed to during natural sleep.\n\nEven over-the-counter stuff like antihistamines isn’t safe for long-term use. Medications like Benadryl seem harmless but can cause long-lasting brain fog and increase dementia risk, especially in older people. They block critical brain chemicals that help you think clearly and sleep properly. And some antidepressants used for sleep might help you feel drowsy, but they come with risks like heart rhythm changes and blood pressure spikes—definitely not what you want when trying to relax and recover.\n\nBut there’s good news—you don’t need to rely on these dangerous drugs. Nature already gave us powerful tools to sleep better. Melatonin, for example, helps reset your internal clock and is perfect for gently guiding your body into rest, especially if your schedule is out of sync. Magnesium glycinate is another star—it calms the nervous system and helps with deep, uninterrupted sleep without the morning fog.\n\nL-theanine, an amino acid found in green tea, promotes a relaxed but alert state, helping the mind slow down without shutting it off. And glycine, a simple amino acid, helps lower your core body temperature, which is essential for falling asleep faster and getting into deeper stages of rest. Then there’s apigenin, the compound that makes chamomile so soothing. It helps activate calming brain pathways without messing with your natural rhythm.\n\nAll these natural supplements work with your body, not against it. They don’t sedate you or shut your brain off—they support the systems that help real sleep happen. And they’re safe to use long-term, backed by science, and don’t come with the terrifying risks of prescription drugs. They help you wake up feeling rested, not groggy. They protect your memory, instead of stealing it.\n\nIf you care about living longer, staying sharp, and feeling better every day, then switching from synthetic sleep drugs to natural sleep enhancers could be one of the best health decisions you ever make. Sleep is not just about rest—it’s about brain repair, hormonal balance, immune strength, and energy for life. The difference between chemical sleep and natural sleep is like night and day—literally.\n\nSo if you or someone you love is stuck on sleep meds, it’s time to gently take back control. Start with simple, proven tools like magnesium, melatonin, or glycine, and pair them with good sleep habits—like turning off screens early, keeping your room dark, and waking up with sunlight. Your brain, your heart, your whole future self will thank you. You don’t have to trade sleep for safety—you can have both, naturally.",

    "body": "I'm a 25 year old man who has had very bad anger bouts no thanks to severe depression. It would range from getting riled up at the prospect of little things (such as random nerds on the internet) to bigger things (such as becoming homeless). My anger got to the point where it was out of control and I was afraid I would hurt someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast year, I was eating lunch as usual, with thoughts of the next person who I wanted to smash lingering in my head. All of a sudden, I felt like I was about to faint and my heart fluttered. I couldn't feel my face and the left side of my neck hurt and felt stiff. I thought it was a heart attack. The doctor ended up telling me I had an anxiety attack due to severe stress. It was at that moment I realized I had a problem. I needed to calm down. I really searched for a root cause but realized it was my addiction to getting angry and getting in random fights with people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt has been nearly a year now since I had that panic attack and not once this entire year have I had any anger towards someone. I am uncharacteristically calm and people in my life are VERY confused. Many people tell me I'm not my usual self; as if they're speaking with someone completely new. To be honest, they are. I have been reborn. A couple days ago, someone lost their shit at me and told me they would kill me/ruin my life etc. I was able to just calmly let him finish his rant and tell him everything was OK. I felt so in control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese were the steps I took to calming down:\n\n* Drink chamomile tea. The tea itself contains apigenin which binds to receptors in your brain that calm you down. Drinking it daily can train your mind to calm down. Sort of like exercise for the receptors in your brain.\n* Didn't touch my phone unless I needed to call or text someone. I went from using my phone literally the entire day to using it maybe once a day. It made me realize just how disconnected I really am from friends and how little I see them. It also made me appreciate what was going on around me and gave my mind a rest.\n* I did things that made me happy. I began watching a show that I loved as a child named Dragon Ball Z. The innocence of that show rubbed off on me and made me feel happy. The world doesn't seem so dark anymore because Akira Toriyama (the animator) makes his nature drawings really bring out the beauty and colour of the world.\n* I began running. I used to lift heavy weights all the time (which may have contributed to my anger issues as I was very much used to the strain on my heart/body). I barely lift weights anymore. Running has made me feel a lot more at peace with the world. It made me realize I didn't have to be big and beefy to survive. I just have to be happy.\n* I realized it's OK not to fight. I used to not allow anyone to cross me and anyone who did, would be dealt with. After a while, it got tiring but I kept it on because I thought if I didn't, I would not survive. I realized the majority of people are not worth any energy and for the most part are all talk. I was right. \n* I began making friends. This was not really contributing to 'the cure' but more a result of my new persona. I joke around with people on the street now. I joke around with people I know and with family. Everyone around me seems happy and it makes me very happy. Prior to this, people would avoid me, thinking I'd blow up on them.\n* People seem less sinister. When I had my anger issues, I thought people were sadistic and enjoyed watching others suffer. That's what contributed to my anger (considering I'm an empath). Now that I've stepped back a little, I realize most people are like grown children. They just act in certain ways the same way we played policeman or doctor on the schoolyard. Nobody really knows what they're doing and for the most part, don't want any trouble.\n\nA couple days ago, I was dealing with a VERY angry older man (in his 50's). And it reminded me of the old me. I couldn't get angry at him because he didn't know what it's like to be on the other side of the fence. Please let me know if this helped you or if you want to vent.  \n\n\nThanks guys!",

I like to read but I find self-help books usually repeat a mantra over and over again to fill up the pages.\n\nBest way to do it is to think of the energy you have as a wallet. Everything you do expends a bit of that energy. Learning how to budget energy is very crucial to overcoming anger, I find. I don't spend anything on random people anymore. Nothing on bad thoughts about situations that never happened. Not a drop of energy goes to saying bad things in my head.\n\nSay good things about random people in your head when you see them (eg. I like the way this guy dresses). In a few months you'll see a big difference in how your mind works.\n\nAs the ancient Persians lived by: good words, good thoughts, good deeds.",

Also persistent swollen lymph nodes across my body mainly around the neck and armpits. I even had a massive lymph node removed from my armpit for biopsy. I already had some distrust of Western medicine from previous experience but, when they told me there's nothing causing my swollen lymph nodes and referred me to a rheumatologist I basically said F you and never went back. \n\nI did a ton of my own research and got big into health and supplements. I created this protocol before I even knew I had mold, and have since made small adjustments after recently discovering it. \n\n-Daily meditation\n\n-Multiple HEPA air purifiers (recently added Austin Air healthmate and air oasis)\n\n-Strict gluten free diet, restricting added sugars to 25g daily. 100+ grams of quality protein per day with additional amino acid supplements. Minimizing processed foods and seeds oils. Absolutely zero fast food or prepackaged foods. \n\n-Raw live kraut 2-3 servings daily\n\n-Raw apple cider vinegar\n\n-Strength training 2+ days weekly (I would incorporate cardio if my job wasn't so physical and if I wasn't so slim built) \n\n-Infrared sauna at least once per week\n\n-Glutathione injections at least once per week (this is relatively inexpensive if you get it IM as a stand alone shot)\n\n-Sovereign silver nose spray 3x daily\n\n-High dose fish oil morning and night (I feel like this is huge) \n\n-10k iu vitamin D3 (somewhat of a high dose if you haven't had your levels checked) with K2\n\n-Liposomal vitamin c 3x daily\n\n-Resveratrol\n\n-NMN\n\n-Cats claw 3x daily \n\n-Irish sea moss\n\n-Copper (again could be risky if you don't know levels but I feel most of us are deficient) \n\n-Shilajit \n\n-Shelf stable probiotics 2x daily after meals\n\n-Nattokinase \n\n-Curcumin/Tumeric\n\n-Quercetin\n\n-Andrographis \n\n-Boswelia\n\n-Methylated B vitamins\n\n-Magnesium glycinate (before bed) \n\n-Red light therapy daily\n\n-Citicholine or other choline source or alternatively eggs (I'm allergic to eggs)\n\n-Liposomal Glutathione \n\n-Optimize sleep as much as possible. 8+ hours using sleep tracker. No screen time 3 hours before bed and/or bluelight filters. No afternoon caffeine. Eye mask or complete blackout. Lowered temperature in sleeping area (think like 64 degrees or so). Get to sleep at the same time every night. I also use a grounding sheet.\n  Sleep stack\n-Valerian Root\n-Magnesium glycinate (previously mentioned) \n-Apigenin\n\nAlso notable \n-Sunlight exposure (preferably first sun) \n-Grounding\n-Getting off psychiatric meds and antihistamines\n-Optimizing gut health with bpc-157, aloe, probiotics, and raw kraut previously mentioned\n\nThis has gotten me by. Obviously your mileage may vary. I didn't get too detailed for sake of time and I'm probably forgetting stuff but ask me anything. I am not a doctor and nobody should take any of this as advice. These supplements and anything in this protocol could have side effects.",

Perhaps the single best option when supplemented with ubiquinol. Recent studies continue to demonstrate that PQQ, might be highly indicated for diseases of mitochondrial dysfunction.)\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19861415\n\n2)COQ10 (Ubiquinol):\nSimilar findings as to PQQ suggest that coq10 when supplemented in the ubiquinol form, is highly synergistic with PQQ in direct stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. (2)\n\n3)Benfotiamine:\n(Fat soluble vitamin B1 analog, benfotiamine increases mitochondrial glucose oxidation. Reversal of reduced glucose oxidation and mitochondrial function is an increasingly desirable target with global glucose levels on the rise, most notably in those with type 2 diabetes.) (3)\n\n4)Pantethine:\n(Water soluble vitamin B5 analog, pantethine exerts effects on the serum lipid metabolism by two primary mechanisms: (1) increasing coenzyme A levels in the, thereby reducing the synthesis of cholesterol and triglycerides, and promoting lipolysis; and (2) modulating the activity of hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. It appears to show strong synergy with benfotiamine.) (4)\n\n5)D-Ribose:\n(Also marketed as a popular gym supplement, D-ribose is a naturally occurring cellular ATP substrate. D-ribose is demonstrated to be effective in stimulating the recovery of these molecules of energy. D-ribose supplementation may indeed help to move adenine nucleotides back to the cells, thus serving as an efficacious therapeutic option for numerous indications of pathophysiological origin.) (5)\n\n6)Creatine:\n(Also marketed as a popular gym, supplement, creatine in multiple cellular studies both in vitro and in vivo, has shown to be effective in restoring mitochondrial function, protecting against structural damage and oxidative stress, and reducing the overall impact of mitochondrial DNA mutations. Also believed to be synergistic when supplemented with d-ribose.) (6)\n\n7)Niacinamide:\n(No flush vitamin B3, niacinamide may cause cellular autophagy, improving mitochondrial quality of cells, but stimulating cellular division of dysfunctional cells. This effect was seen in human cells, subsequently reducing levels of mitochondria but increasing function of normal functioning mitochondria.) (7)\n\n8)Magnesium:\n(Magnesium, the second most abundant chemical element in mammalian cells, is critical for many core cellular processes, forming many compounds including enzymatic reactions, ion channel functions, metabolic cycles, cellular signaling, and DNA/RNA stabilities. Proven magnesium levels are essential in homeostasis of intracellular, physiologically attributed growth, proliferation, differentiation, energy metabolism, and overall cellular health.) (8)\n\n9)NAC:\n(In multiple cellular studies, NAC was reviewed for its potent effects on mitochondrial function and oxidative stress.) (9)\n\n10)Malic Acid:\n(Popular gym supplement, malic acid, (malate), supplementation enhanced strength and endurance during exercise in studies, and most likely by increased mitochondrial pathway function. Large-scale studies should be able to possible replicate these findings.) (10)\n\n(Others: Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Apigenin, Berberine, Beta Alanine, Bitter Melon, Butyrate, Caffeic Acid, C60, Chinese Skullcap, Curcumin, Danshen, ECGC (Green Tea), Gotu Kola, Gynostemma, HMB, Hydroxytyrosol, Inosine, Luecine Magnesium, MitoQ, Nicotinamide, Oxaloacetate, Piracetam, Potassium, Resveratrol, Riboside, Succinic Acid, Taurine, TMG, Vitamin E.)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTop Recommended Brands:\nhttp://www.MaxHealthSecret.com/Mitochondria\n\n(This review is not to be deemed nor to be accepted as professional medical advice or opinion, and instead a review and analysis of certified no-conflict of interest health sciences research.

    "body": "As we grow older, something quiet but powerful fades inside us — our NAD⁺ levels. This tiny molecule isn’t something you hear about every day, but it’s at the core of how our cells make energy, repair damage, and stay young. When NAD⁺ drops, everything from our metabolism to our DNA repair starts to slow down. That’s why scientists around the world are now racing to find ways to keep NAD⁺ high — because it just might hold the key to longer, healthier lives.\n\nLuckily, we’re not helpless in this. One of the most exciting discoveries is that we can actually rebuild our NAD⁺ levels. Some of the best ways are through simple supplements like NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) and NR (Nicotinamide Riboside). They’re natural compounds that our bodies convert directly into NAD⁺. Studies show that they can raise NAD⁺ by up to 100% — helping with everything from energy and blood sugar to brain function and even exercise recovery. Many longevity scientists take them every day.\n\nBut it’s not just about pills. How you live your life matters just as much. Fasting — or even just cutting back on late-night snacks — flips a metabolic switch in your body. That switch boosts NAD⁺ naturally, giving your cells more power and activating survival pathways that make you stronger, leaner, and more resilient. Think of it as your body sharpening itself in response to challenge.\n\nThen there’s movement. Exercise, especially high-intensity workouts, can directly increase the enzymes your body uses to make NAD⁺. People who stay active into old age don’t just feel younger — they actually have more NAD⁺ in their cells. Every time you sweat, your body is renewing itself at the cellular level. That’s a gift you give your future self.\n\nEven cold showers or ice baths — uncomfortable as they may be — have real effects. Cold exposure activates your mitochondria, the powerhouses of your cells, and they use NAD⁺ to fuel your body. You may shiver at first, but you're literally boosting your inner engine when you do it.\n\nPlants can help too. Polyphenols like resveratrol (from red wine and grapes), quercetin (in apples and onions), and apigenin (in parsley and chamomile) all support NAD⁺ by either activating longevity genes or blocking CD38 — a nasty enzyme that breaks down NAD⁺ as we age. These compounds don’t just help you feel better — they help you age slower.\n\nAnd let’s not forget sleep. Deep, regular rest keeps your circadian rhythms in check, which boosts the natural enzymes that create NAD⁺. Without good sleep, no supplement or diet can fully save you. Your cells need that time to reset, rebuild, and renew.\n\nSo yes, aging is real — but the decline in NAD⁺ isn’t a death sentence. It’s a call to action. With the right supplements, smart habits, and a bit of grit, we can fight back. We can rebuild our energy, protect our DNA, and maybe even unlock decades of extra life. NAD⁺ may be small, but it’s mighty. And now that we know how to boost it, the future looks just a little bit brighter.",

I'm a bit tired and all over the place, but I want to get this off my chest finally. If you have the time, I would appreciate any advice or encouragement you have to share about my situation!\n\nSo, I am a witchling (started researching and lightly practicing about two months ago). I was raised Christian and have been agnostic for a while. I've always had a strong intuition, belief in some kind of \"spiritual/earthy power\" or higher power(s) in general, and a few other aspects of the metaphysical that never fit well into the Christian lessons I was taught growing up. When I first discovered witchcraft, I felt like something clicked inside me. \"Yes! This is what  I've been feeling all these years!\" As I did more research on what it means to be a witch, I became more and more overjoyed with finding a place in witchcraft. I felt at home.\n\nNaturally, I started looking into different resources: commonly recommended books, blogs, websites, social media - anywhere I could find information on witchcraft. Lately while doing research, I began to feel...weird. Sometimes I would read something and think to myself, \"Okay, that's a bit...out there\" and then press onward. If I read something about a crystal, herb, or other tool used in witchcraft, I would try to look into *why* that particular tool or ingredient is used. More often than not, I would only get a surface-level answer. \n\nTo better illustrate, let's say an anti-anxiety spell calls for chamomile. That makes sense because chamomile contains apigenin, which binds to specific receptors in your brain that may decrease anxiety and initiate sleep. People often also recommend chamomile tea to calm you for the same reason. Makes sense, right? But when I look up the reason why, let's say, amethyst has calming effects, it doesn't say *why* it has calming effects, only that it *does.* I wish I could think of more examples right now, but that's the most recent one I have and something I've come across often since I began my research.\n\nI also have an issue with the \"ask ten witches, get ten different answers\" saying. This might be a product of my Christian upbringing (and please tell me if it is!), but it makes me uncomfortable knowing that I can receive totally opposite answers to the same question depending on who I ask. It makes me feel kinda shaky, I guess? I don't want to accidentally be doing woo because I'm unsure what I read is \"true witchcraft\" or made up/appropriated without any foundation. \n\nThis back and forth has really affected my ability to practice. I used to be so into it - doing research and meditations every day, feeling the stirring in my soul, and my life felt a lot better as well. Now? I feel almost an aversion to learning about witchcraft because any research I do just makes me beyond overwhelmed and confused. \n\nI don't want to continue feeling that way because I love what I've learned about the craft so far, and I love the way it makes me feel. Placebo effect or not, I enjoy the feeling and what it means to be a witch! I guess I just want to be sure I know what to look for when doing research, or rather how to find more \"concrete\" reseources? I often hear that witchcraft is a personal journey, and I for sure understand that. I suppose I don't want to fall for \"snake oil witchcraft.\" That's the best way I can put it.\n\nSo, witches! Any advice? Have any of you struggled with this? How do you comb through materials and learn what's not woo while still maintaining the \"magickal mindset\" that allows you the freedom to believe in your practice? \n\nThank you in advance for your help! Stay safe out there.\n\nEdit: wow, I got way more feedback than I was expecting! Thank you so so much for all your advice and offering different perspectives. I'll do my best to respond to everyone's comments, but if I don't get to you, know that I still appreciated your comment and the time you took to write it.",

        "body": "Maybe I can add another way of looking at this, although I think everyone who's posted pretty much has the right of it.\n\nI think of witchcraft as \"spicy self care.\" It's basically a catch-all for any religious practice that you mix and match. You can have Christian witches, Jewish witches, and Buddhist witches just like you can have Satanist witches and atheist witches. But one scientific thing to remember about religion in general is that it was basically self-care and social psychology before either of those studies were a thing. Thousands and thousands of years before either of those studies were a thing, people had religion and religious healing.\n\nTherefore, some of it is true. Take this as a (hypothetical made up) example. Lavender does have calming effects. People didn't always know why, but those who realized it was useful were pagan healers. Now imagine they found amethyst, a beautiful stone with the same color as lavender. In their pre-scientific method way of thinking, those two things became symbolic of the same use. Colors gained symbolic properties, rather than the chemicals that produced those colors. They had the \"what\" right, but not the \"why.\"\n\nSo you have these long lists of things that symbolize calm, and only a few of those things are scientifically calming. Lavender. Amethyst. Amethyst adjacent crystals. Lavender adjacent plants. The color purple. Purple flowers. Flowers that are sometimes purple but not always. Not all of them have scientifically calming properties, but all of them have embedded themselves in our traditional understanding of calm.\n\nAt first this may appear to be a pitfall, and it can be (crystals don't have energies). But it can also be a tool. You can still use purple as a visual symbol to remind you of the idea of calm and it will still have a placebo effect. Or you can use it as a cue to remind yourself to do a calming habit. Or you can use it to create a calming context for shifting your mindset. That is what witchcraft is all about: using symbols alongside true scientific effects to affect your mindset and behavior.\n\nSo this is where keeping a grimoire comes in.\n\nIn Christianity, you have a set of holy texts that tell you, in no uncertain terms, what symbols mean what. The body and blood. Jacob's ladder. The virgin mother. The three purple and one pink candles of advent. The dove form of the holy spirit and the apple of temptation. The serpent and the tree. These symbols were all defined for you.\n\nIn witchcraft, you have to define your own symbols. You have to write your own holy text that defines what those symbols are, what they mean, and how to use them. Furthermore, it's useful to keep track of which are symbols (amethyst) and which have scientific effects (lavender). When you are working a spell, you want to try and keep the scientific parts, but you can change out the symbolic parts freely.\n\nYou really need your own record of symbols because different symbols mean different things to different people. The cross may be a symbol of comfort to some, and a symbol of hatred to others. By their nature, there can be no one true record of symbols. This is why you'll find completely contradictory definitions of symbols like colors or stones. In some practices, a sword is a symbol of intellect and communication, while in others it's a symbol of war. The material components of your spells are no different.\n\nBut symbols are still important, because we are human, and we do attach symbolism to everything. Magick means using that.\n\nSo I have a spell to help me predict potential road blocks in a new project. The scientific components are a tea to help me focus, meditation, and a brainstorming tool. The symbolic components are the incantations, the removal of a mask from my face, some incense, and some candles of a certain color. None of the symbolic components do anything except get me in the right mindset, and they wouldn't work for anyone else besides me. If I was to share this spell with someone else, I would assume they would replace my symbolic components with their own. And if they don't like tea I would also expect them to replace that with peppermint or music or something.\n\nSo it sounds weird to say \"just ignore that symbolism stuff\" and it's a bit of an oversimplification. Hopefully this long drawn out train of thought helps lol.",

That makes sense because chamomile contains apigenin, which binds to specific receptors in your brain that may decrease anxiety and initiate sleep. People often also recommend chamomile tea to calm you for the same reason. Makes sense, right?”\n\nWelcome to SASSWitches! I think you’re going to feel right at home here. \n\nTo try to answer your questions, I think what you’re running into now is that for every practitioner there comes a point when it’s time to start listening to *yourself*. In most witchcraft, there is no higher authority who’s going to tell you what to believe. There are plenty of books, blogs, courses, etc. that can guide you, but at some point you’ve got to take the reins of your own practice. \n\nWhat archetypes speak to you, personally? What tools do you feel called to use? What is your intuition telling you? \n\nI would look at your current conundrum as, not a call to disengage, but a call to *action*. Experiment, find what works for you. Keeping a journal helps a lot with this, because you can look back and start to notice patterns. If you’ve already found positive effects on your life from practicing, keep at it. Think about what aspects have been beneficial to you, and why. Build on those. And if you want to branch out, you can always suspend your disbelief briefly, see if a new way is beneficial to you, and if it is keep it, if not scrap it. You don’t need to work with crystals if you don’t believe in them, nor any other tool or method that doesn’t make sense to you. \n\nI’d say the doubt you’re experiencing is an indicator of the need to transition from witchling/baby witch/beginner on to the next stage. You do that by trusting yourself - embracing your own knowing, discernment and authority. This is both a test, and a graduation.\n\nEdit: I say this to you, because you’ve clearly done your research and I don’t think you’re likely to use your own “knowing” to do something dangerous. I would not be saying the same thing to someone who might, for example, suddenly decide poisonous plants are safe to ingest. I think you’re ready to take that next leap of having faith in yourself because you’ve demonstrated that you have a good head on your shoulders.",

        "body": "Hello, friend. There's been some great responses already, I wanted to address the notion of truth-seeking and its importance in your journey. \n\n> I don't want to accidentally be doing woo because I'm unsure what I read is \"true witchcraft\" or made up/appropriated without any foundation. \n\nI invite you, as an exercise, to consider, irrespective of witchcraft, how many of your current beliefs, practices, and patterns of thought are made up, and without foundation in sound science or big-T Truth. I bet a whole bunch of them. I don't say this to be insulting or dismissive, my point is to suggest that two of our brain's default functions are to secrete thoughts, and to recognize and reinforce patterns, including in our own thinking. \n\nAs a matter of course, we begin with conclusions that affirm the validity of our present thinking and pattern recognition, and we retroactively seek comforting information to reinforce the things we already know. Confirmation bias comes in many flavours, it's mostly benign. If you want to prove this to yourself, again, an exercise you can do is to ask yourself a simple question: when's the last time I sought out the opinion of an intelligent person who fundamentally disagrees with me, in the interest of having my mind changed about a close-held idea? You could also ask yourself: is there a belief I hold that I am unwilling to change, even if I am provided with contrary evidence? \n\nThis all serves as a preamble for an assertion I'd like to offer for your consideration: everything is made up; everything is a metaphor. We say that things *are* a certain way, but I think what we're actually saying is things *appear* a certain way, based on our assumptions and our habits of thought and perception. That doesn't mean that everything is equally valid or truthful, but the information being presented to you is not \"truth,\" it's an attempt at meaning-making through a nebulous aggregation of symbols (words, numbers).  \n\nOkay, what's the point of bringing this up? You'll find the placebo effect, for example, getting a lot of play on this subreddit. But how many people citing its influence in their practice are cognitive research scientists who've done years of study in this very strange domain at the blurry intersection of psychophysiology and belief, and could actually explain the placebo effect to you, referencing sufficiently sound data and metadata? I'd wager not very many. The placebo effect isn't *true*, it's an attempt to symbolize and encapsulate an extremely complicated suite of causes and effects within a generally agreeable framework that suggests our beliefs and preconceptions have a lot to do with our experience of the sensual world. People who cite the placebo effect aren't *wrong* to do so; it's part of the orthodoxy in this community, and it's a way for people to demonstrate that they understand and conform to the community norm that says \"citing supernatural causes for tangible effects is anathema to our project, so we cite this scientific-sounding thing instead.\" But the placebo effect isn't a *real thing*, in the same sense that the ego is not a *real thing*, the self is not a *real thing*, even though we talk about them like they are. These things are symbolic assumptions, not bastions of truth. Make sense?\n\nSo where do we go from here? Quoting Lucien Greaves, one of the founders of the Satanic Temple, \"let us reason our solutions with agnosticism in all things.\" Your desire not to fall for \"snake oil witchcraft\" is a good one, and your skepticism will serve you well in navigating spiritual communities, especially online ones. There are a lot of people out there on the forums who will offer profoundly misguided advice to you, even with the best of intentions; there are even a few people who are charlatans, who will deliberately misguide you. Aleister Crowley famously provoked his followers by telling them not to believe him, and poked fun at them for taking his doctrines seriously or literally, even retroactively contradicting himself just to see who would go along. It would serve you well to adopt a similar approach - don't take anyone at their word, test things out for yourself.\n\nStarting from these principles - everything is a metaphor, and agnosticism is a virtue - I think the next logical move is to put some additional filters in place. If you want to test some ideas against your own experience (remembering to be mindful of your pre-conceptions and the biases they put in place), you need to band-limit the data you're downloading into your brain. \n\n> Now? I feel almost an aversion to learning about witchcraft because any research I do just makes me beyond overwhelmed and confused. \n\nThere's a quote I love, I wish I could find the source to attribute the author: \"we've sacrificed knowledge on the altar of information.\" Witchcraft, as several have mentioned, is a decentralized practice. There is no \"true\" witchcraft, there is no primary source; there is a massive proliferation of data online, as witchcraft is having a cultural resurgence. The initial disadvantage here is that you have to act as your own adjudicator with the spiritual realm, in a domain where there are many paths, many practitioners trying to convince you of the validity of their particular brand of occultism. This can be scary, especially coming from a Christian background where there's a primary text and a priest-class of mediators who can guide you along your way. \n\n> How do you comb through materials and learn what's not woo while still maintaining the \"magickal mindset\" that allows you the freedom to believe in your practice? \n\nThere's a relatively simple solution here. The difficulty is in convincing yourself to apply it. I say this as someone who struggles mightily with the advice I'm about to give, but I'll offer it for your consideration: pick one thing, and study that one thing for a while. You can even ritualize the filter - design a spell of protection that'll remind you to deflect incoming data, no matter how interesting or valid it might seem, if it doesn't fit the bill for the one thing you're currently studying. I can help you do this if you're not sure, please feel free to ask about how such a spell could be crafted and applied, I'd be happy to give further guidance in this domain. I even offer a guarantee if you're able to convince yourself to try this; I guarantee that the feelings of anxiety, confusion, and overwhelm you feel when you approach your research will subside considerably if you apply a carefully designed filter to your information diet. \n\nYou'll find, upon choosing a thing to study, whether it's concentration meditation, sigil design, herbalism, ceremonial magic, what have you, that witchcraft is a highly interdisciplinary practice. There are fascinating elements to the theory and practice in all these domains, and if you're able to hold your focus in one of them for a while, then permit a bit of branching once you're in a good groove with your practice, you'll start to see common threads weaving through all of them. You'll become more attuned to the many synchronicities that arise in your life, and more interested in seeing them as a source of enchantment and fascination rather than simply novel curiosity or chance. You'll find yourself more inclined to read deeper meaning into things you previously found mundane or unremarkable. \n\nOr maybe I'm an internet charlatan who's trying to lead you astray with a bunch of philosophical-sounding bullshit. Don't take me at my word, try it out and see for yourself.",

    "body": "Hello, I just want to share my personal opinion and the way I cured my years lasted insomnia. Maybe it will help somebody because I strongly believe that this issue might be much more common than you may think.\n\nAbout me - 35yo Male with good physical shape (180cm, 75kg). After I hit 30 I got bad insomnia, not just long latency to fall asleep but early waking 2-3am as well. I have tried EVERYTHING.. Perfect sleep habits, hygiene, dark, cold, quiet room, different pillows, beds, blue light blockers, relax sounds, eye latteral movements, watching sunrise - sunset, training - no training, meditation and enormous amount of sleepstacks, drugs, supplements, AD, etc.. I found out that most of these things are just part of the story, but it did not solve main cause of insomnia so these things helps, but it is not long term solution or if it forces your sleeping too much (like mirtazapine for example) the sleep despite proper lenght is not as good as you would like it to be.\n\nSo, what cures my insomnia!!! Most ridiculous thing nobody speaks about.. You probably heard about metabolic syndrome, Insulin resistance etc.. You also heard about cortisol (should be high at the morning and low at the evening), mental health and insomnia relation etc. All these things have one thing in common.. UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR..\n\nI know it sounds like no big thing but I believe it is.. Even If you have standar eating habits - fries, ice cream, pizza every other day like 30% of your diet and then 70% of good stuff (weggies, fruits, meat, complex carbs etc) even that you can develop metabolic syndrom like in your 30's.... insulin resistance causes hyperinulinemia and that causes hypoglycemia.. So huge meals (even good ones like brown rice) can really significantly raise your blood sugar, then skyrocket your insulin, then causes hypoglycemia (sugar in normal but there is still huge amount of sugar lowering insulin, so you will go below baseline..).. You brain does not like this rollercoaster scenario.. It might be one of contributors to bad mental state, cortisol releases etc..\n\nFor me the main issue was early waking up with unability to fall asleep again.. Why? Because of hypoglycemia and high cortisol and adrenalin at the night!!! Your brain does not like hypoglycemia and tells you that you need to eat so no sleep go eat breakfast even at 2 am...!! So what was the solution for me? Once I realised that, I changed my eating habits drastically and after few days it starts to getting much better and now after about month I sleep pretty good even without my sleep stack (tryptophan, magnesium glycinate + later theanine, apigenin, inositol). If I get sleep stack I also fall asleep in 10 mins and sleep 6-7,5 hours which is perfectlly fine and sufficient for me.\n\nSo if you found out, that carbs are the main contributor to your sleep (if you eat carbs at evening - you fall asleep better, or if you eat snack in the middle of the night and it is easier to fall back asleep again) then there is high probability that you have same issue as I had. But eating sugar at the evening or in the middle of night is not the solution, it actually makes the problem worse.. It helps you to get out of hypoglycemia and inhibits cortisol, but it does not solve the issue - unstable blood sugar.. So you need:\n\n* Dont eat/drink refined sugar..\n* eat SMALL portions, never overeat - it is very important!!\n* Try Intermittent fasting but more like early restricted (eTRF), late eating is bad for your circadian rhythm and later day blood sugar.. Eat breakfast 9am - lunch at 12-13 and dinner at 16-17, after that nothing, only water!!!! (get enoght cals tho, it might raise cortisol if you are long term in big caloric deficit)\n* watch glycemix load of your meals\n* low carb, limit carbs intake, very low carbs might be cruel, but it affects blood sugar the most and you dont want huge load of carbs = huge spikes.. I have about 150-200g per day, max 50g per meal.\n* eat fats, fiber and protein first, then carbs\n* walk or exercise after meal (it is easy if you are not full, only half full as I mentioned in point 2)\n* eat a little bit bigger earlier in the day and less calories in the evening. Huge dinner was worst thing for me in terms of sleep. It helps develop insulin resistance as you digest few hours but dont lower your sugar by moving (evening siting on the couch and then bed) Then you have raised insulin thru whole night and it also causes that sugar drop. Huge meal at evening also disrupt initial falling asleep, releasing hunger hormoones other day, inhibits growth hormone, was bad for my skin and raised insulin causes raised ADH = water retention other day, but especially big thing for sleep is the fact, it probably disrupt your circadian rhythm as you are telling the body that you are getting a lot of energy before somehing big which is supposed to be done during the day, not in the night.. This same might be actually similar with drinking water, it also might affect your rhythm a little bit..  I was used to have huge salty dinners where I was drinking water a lot, but I think more water at the evening is not just bad for peeing during night, but for circadian rhythm as well. Also I am not sure if this point is relevant on level of overal calories or more like on level of carbs. Because I think the calories part is more important as small low glyc carbs at the evening might be good for cortisol. so you probably need find balance.\n\nIf you do these things it should help you to avoid these bad spikes. It should prevent you from hypoglycemia (subsequent drop) and cortisol waking up. I also for some reason initially fall asleep at 22:00 faster than before despite being \"hungry\"(last meal about 17:00).. But it is probably due to not being in some huge hypoglycemia because my b. sugar was stable during the day.. So I usually initially fall asleep as fast as if I eat carbs before bed but without unwanted night waking up.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI am not refering to KETO, I was actually sleeping bad on KETO (0-50carbs/day). I guess I need some amount of carbs a day (at least 150 maybe). Carbs inhibits cortisol and helps with serotonin. All I was refering was actually stable sugar. Find balance between have enought carbs but dont have insulin spikes. So low glycemix carbs, small amount of them in one meal (max 50g), so have them equally during the day. Dont overeat and move imediatelly after meal to lower blood glucose.\n\nI am not KETO hater tho, it has amazing benefits, I got amazing skin on 14days of keto, but something was bad in my case and I needed to add some carbs, maybe if something heals up or check then it can work even in my case. But I really believe to people who are amazingly well and sleep well on keto, something just needs to be right in order to make it work.\n\nAlso I was not doing any testing. As my standard blood test was \"fine\" (no diabetes) 2years ago- fasting blood glucose was at higher end - 5,5 tho. (normal range  somewhere 4-5.6.) But I believe I was watching Sten Ekberg video, where he was talking about to this test and he told that it actually does not tell you the whole truth. You can have huge insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and have ridiculous blood spikes and drops and metabolic syndrome without have out of range this type of test. Because your body is releasing ridiculous amount of insulin to stay in normal range in long term, but you still have huge glucose spikes and drops in meanwhile. But If you get that test after some 12+ hours of fasting you probably get pretty normal blood sugar values. When you get out of range blood sugar it is probably late and you are diabetic.. But you can have this unstable blood sugar issue without being classified as diabetic. Maybe fasting insulin or some continuos blood sugar tests might give you better info about this issue. For me it was just easier to try it on myself as I was seeing benefits after 1-2 days, than do a lot of blood testing.\n\nAnother thing, definitelly not a placebo. As I mentioned, I tried a lot of stuff in these 5years, like 30+ supplements. Placebo might have some positive effect for day-two, but it deffinitely does not work consistentlly for 4 weeks.. But I want to be objective, so I agree that there might be some false correlation, coincidence or miracuously good time period this whole month.\n\n  \nEDIT 2: It has been almost 2 months since I changed my eating habits and my sleep is pretty much perfect for whole time. I got blood test week ago, Everything was perfect (glucose, hba1c, insulin). I believe the main part is the fact that you need more your cals early in the day (biggest meal - breakfast) and dont overeat especially later in the day (ruins circadian rhythm), while stable sugar should help with mental aspect/cortisol etc in my opinion. \n\nSo I know everyone is different but hope it will help to somebody.",

Also you can easily test this theory with a glucose monitor you can get off Amazon; the kind that diabetics use to test their blood sugar. \n\nBut I'm wondering what diet has to do with cortisol? I mean, my insomnia issues were driven by conditioned hyper-arousal. This happens due to night after night of struggling in bed, my brain basically started to learn and associate bed=stress/struggle. Just like we can develop a fear response to anything we have negative encounters with (e.g. dogs or public speaking) we can develop this conditioned \"fear\" response around sleep and our bed.\n\nAs a result, when I would get into bed at night, I would feel my body flip into a hyper-alert state. I'm sure cortisol/adrenaline were some hormones underlying that process. But the surge in cortisol was not due to diet. It was just due to this learnt response.",

It might get worse and I might be wrong and this is only coincidence tho..  \nI am just average european dude who googles stuff on reddit, quora and is trying to find some studies about topics and test stuff on myself. I read about cortisol before. Cortisol is affected by countless stuff and I found out on myself that for example calories intake or carbs have huge impact on cortisol. I read that carbs helps with serotonin and inhibits cortisol, I also heard about blood sugar spikes and theirs contribution to mental state. There might be some relation, so if you have hypoglycemia it might stimulate cortisoll, I just dont know. I actually think, that only way to find it out is to try everything like trial and error. But I feel better mentally on stable sugar diet.\n\nI dont have this condition so your cause might ´be completely different. But I actually know this situation. Fully awake at 2am with brain racing, anxiety, bad mental state, sleepy everywhere except my bed.. but due to anxiety/adrenalin/cortisol unable to fall asleep..  And due to huge stress I was scared to go to bed because I knew I will watch ceiling of my room for hours.. My insomnia was pretty bad at some point .. Man, i was taking antidepressants - mirtazapine for 2 years.. Now I mentally feel pretty amazing as I am thinking about it right now. maybe due to stable sugar maybe not.\n\nI just think that Anxiety, cortisol, bad mental state, hypoglycemia, metabolic syndrome etc, unstable sugar might be connected and the cause might be based in your daily habits.

Also tried to avoid negative thoughts by engaging myself in some interesting yet requiring mental work.\n\n  \nDetailed: I stopped eating sugar and substituted that with stevia. I normally have four cups of tea during the day and that many spoons of sugar. Within three days, some kind of normalcy returned to my sleep. But still around 4 hours of sleep. I became convinced that it is the way to go.\n\n  \nA few days later, the olympics started and I kind of became engrossed in it. For the 1st half of the day, I did my chores and after that, I watched the games rooting for my home country. During the entire duration of the games I slept 5-6 hours, without any interruptions. I didnt do any exercise, just watched tv and some newspaper reading.\n\nI went to sleep at a fixed time. Always at 11 or just before that, If I am up beyond 11:30, it was a wasted night.\n\nI used to have some revenge kind of thoughts (pls dont ask towards whom). When I start thinking about revenge, it is a spiral and it ends with a racing heart and agitated mind. I recognized that it is a problem and trying my best to avoid it, either by engaging my mind or with what they call 'mindfulness'.\n\nSo, the last couple of months, I have been having 5 -6 hr sleeps with one break.\n\nOnce again, many thanks to OP.",

Today we will be discussing migraines, the worst kind of headache that you can imagine. A migraine is a primary headache (not the result of another condition) and is characterized by recurrent episodes of localized pain. Most people suffering from migraines also report other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light as well as extreme disruptions to daily living. Despite our best knowledge, we still aren’t sure what causes migraines and don’t have a definite answer to this debilitating condition. Likewise, we have two special guests who add their perspective on what it is to have a migraine, say hello to Robert and Kate!\n\n**Disclaimer**: this post is **not designed to be medical advice**. It is merely a look at the chemistry of medications and their **general** effect on the body. Each person responds differently to antidepressant therapy.

In fair Verona…\n\nOur story is about two people living on opposite coasts that share the same affliction: unrequited love—er, I mean migraines. Our Romeo in this case, Robert, is a 34 year old based in the Los Angeles area who works as a healthcare manager. A training facilitator by day, by night he dabbles in the dark arts of DnD and painting figurines of tabletop games as a way to feel closer to his recently passed father. Now, if I know anything about painting models (Age of Sigmar fans hmu) then it’s a lot of squinting and focusing on a small object, two things probably impossible during a migraine. Our Juliet is Kate, a 26 year old studying law in the Big Apple! She is an avid gamer when she isn’t modeling at her theater costume shop although she uses a lot of sealants, paints, and sprays to create and maintain her hobby which she knows is a major trigger of her migraines. Alas, the show must go on. \n\nA migraine is a headache but not all headaches are migraines and oh boy are they terrible. They are a recurrent attack that typically presents as a pattern of four stages and a person who suffers from migraines can identify this pattern and hopefully treat it ahead of time:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jgep0rejkiz81.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bed20103e2eba66ed7a0e45eb34296fd9028078\n\n1. **Prodrome** \\- generally as a result of the environment and triggers, rather than a genetic cause. \n   1. The prodrome is a pre-headache and can signal that a migraine is about to start. Treatment during this phase may stop or lessen the severity of the migraine attack. \n   2. Some triggers of migraines include certain foods (alcohol, nicotine, citrus, dairy, and aged foods like wine or cheese), poor sleep, emotional stress, hormonal changes especially around the menses or oral contraceptive use, and even weather changes. \n2. **Aura** \\- about 25% of patients have a characteristic neurological set of symptoms that precede just before the headache.\n   1. If a person has an aura, this can be the biggest indication that finding a quiet place to rest is best. In general, an aura presents as positive symptoms or negative symptoms\n      1. *Positive symptoms (addition of something bad)* \\- flashing lights, spots or lines in the vision, pins and needles feeling around the eye\n      2. *Negative symptoms (subtraction of something good)* \\- blurry vision, numbness, sensory deficits, inability to understand language, dizziness, muscle dysfunction\n   2. The first time a person develops an aura, it can be incredibly frightening. It can develop slowly as the vision distorted but luckily it is completely reversible and usually lasts less than 60 minutes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7upwgm0lkiz81.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c62e87785fa302c8738695adb1ac4654d7afec0\n\n1. **Headache** \\- the migraine headache is the worst part of the attack itself. Although many patients would argue waiting for it to happen may be worse than having the attack itself. \n   1. A migraine headache is a **localized attack** that usually affects an entire side of the head but can sometimes be bilateral. Likewise, a unilateral migraine may oscillate from one side to another or front to back in waves. \n   2. The headache may last as little as 4 hours or up to 24 hours (although up to 72 hours has been reported). Patients report it as a pulsating and pounding pain that inhibits their ability to think about anything. \n   3. Other symptoms like photophobia (light insensitivity), phonophobia (sound insensitivity) and nausea or vomiting may mean that a dark quiet place is needed, further disrupting a person’s day. \n2. **Postdrome** \\- described as the migraine hangover\n   1. With such an intense condition, patients can often feel exhausted and weak following a migraine attack. Likewise, patients can feel a loss of appetite for up to a day or have intense food cravings. Paradoxically, some people report a euphoria-like “high” following the migraine and actually come out of it feeling great (lucky them!)\n\n>*“I was diagnosed with migraines when I was 11. That was when I experienced my first headache. I inherited them from my dad. I knew he got severe headaches, but I had never had one until then. As I got older, I experienced more and more headaches to the point that some weeks I would get the migraine aura every other day. The pain was so much I wanted to die or take a drill to my head to relieve the pressure. I didn't obviously, but the thought was there that anything was better than this constant slew of migraines. I was over diagnosed when I was a kid with hemiplegic migraines, which is a super rare disorder that causes paralysis on one side of the body. That wasn't the case with me. I think that was the encouragement of an over protective mom. I still don't know why.” — Robert*\n\nA quick word about diagnostics as I think it will be informative for some people. Migraines are widespread, about 17% of females and 6% of males suffer from them. a migraine is often the most common cause of ER visits for headache too, but whenever a patient presents to the ER with intense head pain, providers often think of the worse like stroke and hemorrhage and must rule out those emergency situations first. When a patient clears that hurdle, the process of diagnosing a patient with migraines is driven by their patient history and the physical exam. \n\n* From here the diagnostician must rule out any more serious reasons for why the person is experiencing the intense headache. Could it be a symptom of another disease like an infection? Is it tenderness and swelling of the temporal artery leading to intense pain? Does the patient have a history of cancer suggesting metastases? Perhaps an HIV opportunistic disease or Lyme infection that has spread to the brain? Did the headache happen during sex, which is an indication of intracranial hermorrhage? Lots of different potential pathologies.\n   * If those can be ruled out, then the doctor focuses on differentiating just what kind of headache it could be:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqbau6jmkiz81.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=83d7339fa1e361e1a819fdf4ff5f851466a1f674\n\n>*“Before my diagnosis, I was much harder on myself.  I was (and still am, really) an overachiever, and I consumed an unhealthy amount of caffeine.  My peers did the same, so I saw nothing wrong with it.  However, after my migraines became much more severe in May, I could not consume any caffeine.  Even the tiniest little bit triggered the most painful migraines. Some other things I’ve had to give up that turned out to be triggers are chocolate, caffeinated tea, gluten, and alcohol.  Living in New York and going into law with that set of triggers is not exactly a cakewalk.*  \n*Since I was a teenager, I’ve had less severe migraines, many of them being “silent” migraines.  That made it extremely hard to diagnose, so I was bouncing between doctors, with many of them shrugging or throwing out diagnoses that landed nowhere.  I got a lot of “it’s all in your head”s, which, in hindsight, wasn’t completely off.  It’s still frustrating that such things are dismissed so easily as hypochondria though.” —* Kate\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Cause of Migraines… we think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/elihhbunkiz81.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=97981c71694f549840c8a87dff8923a76fff7365\n\nThe cause of migraines has been hotly debated back and forth for the past century. One school of thought centers on neurotransmitter and neurotoxicity build up but a larger proportion of pathologists now subscribe to a new theory. In 1982, a new compound was discovered in the process of pain neurotransmission: calcitonin gene-related peptide or CGRP. \n\n1. It all starts with some sort of stimulus. Like we discussed, this could be a known trigger like a food or stress or it could be unknown (perhaps too much light or sound). This stimulus activates the trigeminal nerves (base of the skull) which causes **the release of CGRP and substance P**.\n2. Both CGRP and substance P (which stands for substance Pain by the way) are **pro-inflammatory** proteins that cause intracranial blood vessels to dilate. This dilation is further increased by other proinflammatory molecules like histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandins. The result is a much wider brain blood vessel than what was there before. \n3. This super wide blood vessel then pushes on the inside of the brain causing pressure. Our brain detects pressure through our nociceptors and relays it as a pain, yay! \n4. Likewise, excitation and inhibition in the cortex and thalamus causes further dysregulation of the trigeminal nerves leading to even more inflammation and hypersensitivity. This culminates in the intense nausea, vomiting, and visual effects.\n5. To top it all off, the autonomic nervous system now tries to regulate this sudden increase of pressure in the brain by randomly constricting and dilating other blood vessels through the brain. This leads to an uneven pressure distribution activating the parasympathetic tone of the brain which may account for the tears and nasal congestion some get during their migraine. \n\nTL;DR the brain fucks itself up during a migraine. But in all seriousness, remember that the vasodilation is a **result** of CGRP release leading to the migraine NOT the cause directly. This’ll be important later. \n\n>*“When I was younger, I saw several doctors who could not pinpoint an exact issue.  I had the other symptoms, including aura, but I am also severely nearsighted, so they assumed it was something to do with my vision instead.  Unfortunately, the first time I received a proper diagnosis of migraine was when they turned chronic in May 2020.  It immediately became evident that headaches took up at least half of the month, and a solid 2/3 days per week were legitimate, full-on migraines.”* — Kate \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Making a Hole for the Mind Demons\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6baiwmpkiz81.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=953b516e8f95762449bb41239dc7dadccce66cfa\n\nFinding a cure for migraines was a question that people have been trying to solve since… well since tools were invented it seems. Peoples in prehistory unsurprisingly had a very limited knowledge of the human body and the origin of disease but that didn’t stop them from trying certain treatments to solve the world’s first problems. For the first time I am starting before the ancient Egyptians and Greeks and instead looking at our good ol’ great-grandparents about 9000 years ago! Early human skulls found in this period display trepanation—or the removal of a piece of bone from the skull. While documented cases of headaches only start 4000 years ago, the use of trepanation for a treatment of headaches dates back much further. It is believed that early peoples drilled holes into the skull using bone, flint, and obsidian to create a hole for evil spirits a way to leave the head. Results varied…\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\[Left\\] Photograph of the Ebers Papyrus, dated circa 1550 BC and known to be one of the oldest medical texts. It was found in Egypt in the 1870s and contains prescriptions written in hieroglyphics for more than 700 remedies for a wide variety of afflictions, along with early descriptions of the circulatory system. The papyrus is kept at the library of the University of Leipzig in Germany.

The Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BC) is thought of as the oldest textbook in the world. According to the scroll, Egyptians would “bind a clay crocodile holding grain in its mouth to the head of the patient using linen” which was engraved with the names of Egyptians gods and spirits. Thus appeasing the gods would cure the headache! While the mission may have been misplaced the result was actually beneficial—compressing the skull in this way could have relieved the pain as well as collapsing the blood vessels that were causing pain. The Egyptians were also known to do trepanation.\n   * The use of trepanation as a headache relief is actually much more common than we may even initially believe. For those savvy in Greek mythology you may remember the story of Athena’s birth: mighty Zeus, god of all heaven and all that exists was struck ill by a terrible headache. He called upon his son Hephaestus to relieve this pain, to which Hephaestus split Zeus’ skull in two, thus allowing Athena to burst forth. Despite the pretty metal origin story, remember that myths are stories that guide everyday people and it could be thought that this myth was actually a parallel to Greek trepanation too. \n   * The story of Athena’s birth was first established 700 BC, much before the birth of the Father of Medicine Hippocrates (460-370 BC). Hippocrates revolutionized medicine for one great reason: he thought of disease as a malfunction of the body rather than a spell from demons or the gods. In his work, *On Injuries of the Head*, Hippocrates details instructions for proper trepanation and its dangers. Likewise, he described the first account of the visual symptoms of migraines—a shining light in the right eye followed by terrible pain in the temples that spread to the entire head and neck. \n      * About 500 years after Hippocrates, the great Roman physician Galen (129-216 AD) described the connection between food and migraines. \n\n>*“Lately my day to day is normal. Ever since I found out what my main trigger is for migraines, I've had a relatively normal life. Still need to watch certain foods that I eat, no red 40 for example. And get regular sleep, which can be hard with kids and work. Before, when my migraines were more frequent, it had a huge influence. Couldn't party late with friends. Or sleep in on the weekends. At the time I didn't know what my main trigger was. I didn't know red 40 could have such a huge impact. I love m&ms and didn't understand that those were a cause of my migraines. How could something so small have such a huge impact? (I'm using that as an example and don't want any misunderstanding that I was eating copious amounts of m&ms.)”* — Robert\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Migraines, Pen on Watercolor paper by u\\/AnthonyChristopher](https://preview.redd.it/vmomnf54niz81.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=69087c84eb139f88094177b500a01a2f870dc0d7)\n\n# So what if I don't want a hole in my head?\n\n>“*I try not to let my illness stop me too much, but there are only so many things I can do.  Before things became this severe, I would not sleep, eat, or take care of myself very well.  However, if I do not get enough sleep (or sleep too much), if I do not eat on time or stress myself out too much, that’s almost always a migraine trigger.  If it’s storming out, that’s a migraine day.  If someone around me has on a pungent perfume, my head starts to pound.  I have to plan around things that I cannot control and hope for the best, but the lack of predictability can be frustrating.  The pain, nausea, and vision loss are just the icing on top. Migraines can be an “invisible” disability because we do not “look sick.”  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had people tell me that, thinking it’s reassuring.  I feel very fortunate that I can still exercise and am able-bodied in most other ways.  However, saying someone “does not look sick” is rude, dismissive, and ableist.”* — Kate\n\nSo at what point did we abandon the whole head drilling thing? Well we didn’t really want to it seems; in fact as far as I can tell the only reason why trepanation really stopped in the early 1500s was because the opium trade finally reached the European markets in a cheap enough way that it could be prescribed as a pain relief for the masses. Ahh, sweet opiates. Laudanum (the posh term for opium) wasn't the only plant used for the treatment of migraines either. Avicenna (\\~1000 AD), a persian physician, dictated that migraines occurring in different regions of the head benefit from a cocktail of plants and remedies. As such, later herbalists worked to find more cost effective and native remedies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Feverfew \\[Left\\] Parthenolide \\[Right\\]](https://preview.redd.it/my19983zkiz81.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=a595dccaa988314ee1786265dec270880b49fc7e)\n\n* One of the first plants used for the treatment of migraines is **Feverfew**, a very unassuming daisy. In ancient Greece and Persia, Feverfew was known as Parthenium, named after the Pathenon which was the Doric temple of Athena on the Acropolis in Athens. One of the greatest herbalists (perhaps ever) Nicolas Culpepper described the many benefits of Feverfew, especially for headaches. He also had a penchant for describing herbs with astrology and likened Feverfew to Venus: “\\[Venus\\] commands this herb, and has commended it to succor her sisters (women), to be a general strengthener of their wombs.” In later editions he would describe how Feverfew could be used to relieve teething pain in infants as well as a useful douche and enema to reduce inflammation as well for “St. Anthonies fire, to all hot inflammations and hot swellings.”\n   * The principal chemical in Feverfew is thought to be **Parthenolide**, a sesquiterpene lactone of the germacranolide class. Parthenolide is found in the highest concentrations of the leaves and flowers and works by decreasing pro-inflammatory molecules. In migraines, it is thought to modulate the downstream activity of CGRP and substance P, thus limiting the effect of the migraine. Interestingly, Parthenolide is being researched for its anti-cancer properties in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Yarrow \\[Left\\] Apigenin \\[Right\\]](https://preview.redd.it/0cnjoai0liz81.png?width=746&format=png&auto=webp&s=c13de11aafcdec413894c92e485918fedb8b0b65)\n\n* **Yarrow** is a wide, flat flower from the Aster family which includes other favorites such as sunflowers, chicory, and artichokes. Yarrow is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and the Americas and I would bet that you’ve seen this plant growing in meadows and sunny areas. Yarrow’s latin name, *Achillea millefolium*, is derived from Achilles who apparently relied heavily on the herb to heal his wounds. In fact, yarrow has a long history as a battlefield herb for its ability to slow and stop the flow of blood. For headaches, Yarrow contains the compound **Apigenin** which has a potent anti-inflammatory property. \n\n# Will a plant solve my migraines? Let’s talk serotonin\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h4zjk2n2liz81.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ed88c9073338dfe83aa997e16a5ef4779bd16d8\n\nThe story of migraine drugs starts with a fungus—no it's not a plant so technically we are talking about a different thing. Since the cultivation of rye began in prehistory, farmers noticed a blight that would grow among the rye kernels: Ergot of rye. This fungi attacks the kernels where it grows its black fruit. The issue with Ergot is that it is extremely difficult to detect among a couple hundred acres of rye, especially when the harvest season may only last for a few days before rain ruins the crop. Farmers would quickly collect the grain not noticing that a deadly poison was being ground into the flour as well. \n\n* Ergotism swept through communities for as long as humans cultivated rye. Ingestion of the fungi would cause one of two effects: convulsive ergotism or gangrenous ergotism. The convulsive type was characterized by nervous dysfunction where a person would be twisting and contorting in extreme pain. According to some reports the muscle spasms could be so bad it would “tear limb from body” and “wrench the head from the neck, leaving nothing but a stump.” Gangrenous ergotism resulted in major deformations of the extremities which often resulted in auto-amputation. The Ergot would constrict blood vessels so tightly that it would cut off the flow of blood allowing infection to take hold without the immune system getting to the site of infection. Once gangrene had occurred in the fingers, toes, or ears the appendage would become mummified and eventually fall off. In both conditions, patients would have intense hallucinations. \n   * In 857 AD, the first documented outbreak of Ergotism in the Rhine valley and was called the Holy Fire due to the burning sensation one felt. In 1039, another outbreak in France compelled Gaston de la Valloire to construct the first hospital for Holy Fire, dedicated to St. Anthony. Eventually over 400 hospitals would be built across France to treat the disease locking in the association as **St. Anthony’s Fire.** In 1056, over 40,000 people would die from a single outbreak of Ergotism. It wouldn’t be until 1670 that Dr. Thuillier would discover the link between rye and Holy Fire. \n   * So what is going on here? Why was Ergot so deadly?. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ergotamine](https://preview.redd.it/zk1dg5i4liz81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=db1a565ee18caeee495407639c458e3d907ee100)\n\nErgot can be thought of as a chemical factory where it synthesizes simple molecules like amides and acids up to complex polycyclic structures. In 1918, Arthur Stoll managed to isolate **Ergotamine**, one of the principal alkaloids from the fungi. Later investigations in the 1920s and 1930s would reveal just how ergot managed to cause such drastic symptoms in its victims: muscle contraction. Surrounding our blood vessels is smooth muscle, a type of muscle that is controlled by the autonomic nervous system and as such isn’t controlled by our brains. Ergotamine would hijack this smooth muscle and cause it contract immensely resulting in intense vasoconstriction. The result: cutting off blood flow to fingers and toes causing the gangrene or starving the brain of oxygen resulting in convulsions. Likewise, smooth muscle contractions in the uterus would cause spontaneous abortion of the fetus and oxytoic effects would cut off milk production for a mother resulting in a starved child. Brutal. The discovery of ergotamine like any other chemical begged the questions: 1) how does it work? 2) Can it be used for anything?\n\n* Ergotamine sparked investigations in improving its structure for therapeutic use. One of the first synthetic ergot alkaloids produced was lysergic acid diethylamide or **LSD** in 1943. The potent hallucinogenic activity enraptured the scientific community and sparked a huge uproar for what the mechanism is. Their result: **serotonin (5HT)**. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/by3upkkpniz81.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&s=8134a169888b57b8fd3266ec4767f5ac01e4caaf\n\n* If any neurotransmitter deserves to be personified, it's serotonin. Serotonin was discovered in the 1940s and triggered a massive investigation into its potential therapeutic benefit. By the 60s, it had grown a bit and decided that it didn’t have to listen to the ‘man’, went out partying on LSD and pretty much died of an overdose by the 1970s—the scientific community was over serotonin. While it was interesting to talk about the neurotransmitter implicated in regulating sexual behavior and hallucinogens, by the 80s everyone cared about methamphetamine. At one point, it was thought that serotonin doesn’t do anything. \n   * It's true, serotonin doesn’t do any *one* thing, it's the case of doing too many things. Serotonin is implicated in the treatment of psychiatric disorders like anxiety and depression to more physiological symptoms like vomiting, cardiovascular function, and sedation. Most receptors have a few subtypes with tight regulation dictating exactly what the effect will be. Serotonin on the other hand has 15 *known* subtypes of receptors with some estimates putting the true amount at 20 to 25. Today we will be looking at the 5HT-1 receptor family and its related drugs.\n\n>*“Treatments… hooo boy.  I’m very, very lucky - I managed to talk my doctors into trying different treatments without any resistance, but this is very much the exception, not the norm.  I was first prescribed sumatriptan as an acute medication.  It did help at first, but there’s a “hangover” that leaves you feeling drained and sick the next day.  Over time, the sumatriptan made the pain much worse and lost efficacy, so I tried other triptans instead.  Ultimately, I settled on eletriptan, which I still use.”*   \n>  \n>— Kate\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e201a8y9liz81.png?width=818&format=png&auto=webp&s=02a9c95d3b9c1daec3ad629ea49366841040763f\n\n* Let’s take another look at Ergotamine now that we believe serotonin is useful. Up in the top right we can see how Ergots work in two ways: direct vasoconstriction on blood vessels in the periphery (causing abortion and cutting off blood flow to fingers and toes) but it also works works on serotonin receptors in the brain. Activation of the 5HT-1B, 1D, and 1F receptors reduces the release of CGRP, which is the pro-inflammatory molecule we talked about in section 2. Remember that CGRP causes vasodilation which increases intracranial pressure resulting in the migraine. Blocking the release of CGRP stops that from happening and would decreases the effect of the migraine and potentially prevent it (or at least make it better).\n   * Ergotamine is still used to this day as an anti-migraine medication although has been largely replaced by safer agents. Ergots as a class can have nasty side effects that don't make them the best choice anymore. Firstly, activation of 5HT-1b receptor can cause constriction in the arteries that feed the heart blood and oxygen. This can cause a feeling of heaviness and may even cause a heart attack in some patients. Likewise, nonselective activity on the 5HT-2a receptor found in the uterus is responsible for the spontaneous abortion and is contraindicated in pregnant patients. Finally, activation of 5HT-2b on the cardiac valves can lead to overgrowth of the valve tissue, sealing them closed resulting in pulmonary hypertension or death. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Triptans compared to Serotonin \\(Right\\)](https://preview.redd.it/1cntv5i8miz81.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f44498ee8ce2f0a3f0ee8f7a9fb7d60e69af34f)\n\n* So the hunt for something better began. By the 1970s, the effects of Ergotamine was widely known and the pathology of migraines was developing. Scientists knew that vasodilatory drugs could induce a migraine, like alcohol, and vasoconstriction medications could abort one. When serotonin was implicated in intracranial vasoconstriction, modifications of serotonin began almost immediately. By 1991 the first drug in a new class was discovered: **Sumatriptan** (Imitrex). All triptans have an tryptamine structure identical to serotonin; however it was soon discovered that modifying the backbone could produce potent 5HT-1B/1D effects which would results in vasoconstriction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5eh18mr9miz81.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=e71b947d0790f161f876ec06d633c8e9ddd9d356\n\n* All triptans operate on the same basic pharmacophore: the aromatic group (indole), protonated amine (a hydrogen donator), a hydrogen bond acceptor like oxygen or nitrogen, and a hydrophobic region. This resulted in a structure that was hydrophobic on one side while hydrophilic on the other (amphipathic).\n* What is interesting about triptans is their administration. After Sumatriptan pioneered the group, the second generation of triptans were given a different formulation to aid in a quick onset of action. The most common form is an orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) whose function is to dissolve on the tongue leading to higher blood concentrations quicker than swallowing the tablet. Likewise, bypassing GI tract absorption prevents first pass metabolism or the ability of the body to deactivate a drug once ingested. Most triptans have low bioavailability (40-60%) while sumatriptan has a bioavailability of just 14% of the dose being available following absorption. Later formulations included subcutaneous injections, nasal sprays, and suppositories. \n\n>*“I was first treated over 20 years ago when I was 11. The medications I've taken over the years are: imitrex (Sumatriptan) (both nasal and pill), depakote (Valproic Acid) (which had altering personality effects on me when I was 16, Maxalt (Rizatriptan), Zomig (Zolmitriptan), Relpax (Eletriptan), Lamictal (Lamotrigine), and other injectables like Emgality. Studies apparently showed that anti seizure meds have helped prevent migraines in some patients. I tried quite a few and none really decreased the consistency or intensity of my migraines.” —* Robert\n\n* The triptans changed the game for migraines as abortive agents—they stop a migraine as it is happening. In the 2000s and 2010s, a series of other drugs classes came on the market to assist in resistant abortive migraine treatment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Lasmiditan](https://preview.redd.it/k4cnuxzbmiz81.png?width=465&format=png&auto=webp&s=452ec1bf64d5cd27e7ee1df822b4e1093fc4a4ed)\n\n* In 2019, **Lasmiditan** (Reyvow) was discovered as the first drug part of the Ditan drug class. Right now Lasmiditan is the only drug of its class but there are two other drugs under investigation that show similar results. Lasmiditan acts exclusively on the 5HT-1F receptor which decreases the release of CGRP thus stopping vasodilation. As with any new drug, physicians have been apprehensive to use the drug first line but many view it is as an effective second or third line agent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w8fxb3femiz81.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c524abd456cc67837022bbd3156982137c765ad\n\n* The real breakthrough came with the gepants or the CGRP receptor antagonists (CGRPRAs). Instead of focusing on serotonin, these drugs prevent the binding of CGRP to its receptor, thus blocking the downstream vasodilation. Both **Rimegepant** (Nurtec ODT) and **Ubrogepant** (Ubrelvy) have shown great efficacy in aborting migraines as they happen. Likewise, since they don’t activate the serotonin receptors, there is no cardiovascular risk making them safe for patients with heart complications. \n\n*“All of this was possible for me because I have fantastic health insurance.  I had  federal BCBS, which provided coverage for all of the above, but Nurtec alone costs $1k+ for 8 pills without insurance. That’s obscene.” -* Kate\n\nUp till now, we have discussed medications that stop migraines as they happen but only recently have we started to develop drugs that are *preventative*. The use of monoclonal antibodies has been an exciting new field in pharmacology since 1986; way before COVID and its vaccines put mabs in the public eye. Currently, mabs are used to treat several previously untreatable diseases, giving patients a fighting chance in surviving or at least improving their lives. Migraines are no different and talking abouts mabs warrants a larger discussion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1i52yxfmiz81.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=96afbab7237a2afba03540830a288e8d9bb7fd99\n\n* Currently the three most used monoclonal antibody treatments for migraines are **Aimovig** (Erenumab), **Ajovy** (Fremanezumab), and **Emgality** (Galcanezumab). All three injections work by blocking CGRP from getting to its receptor, thus preventing the migraine. Each is administered each month or sometimes every 3 months but can be extremely expensive costing up to $700 per injection. \n* A final word on some of the other adjunctive medications some may have come across are worth talking about. Since anti-migraine medications can be expensive, sometimes using a less expensive, older drug for an off label use can be just as effective as the expensive ones. \n   * For pain relief, **Acetaminophen, Aspirin** and NSAIDs like **Ibuprofen** or **Naproxen** are often used first. **Ketorolac** or **Diclofenac** can often be added in too for anti-nausea and anti-vomiting effects. NSAIDs block the production of thromboxane which reduces platelet aggregation. This results in a reduction in the release of serotonin across the body as well providing some pain relief. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ic1fg4ygmiz81.png?width=465&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0c031dd12008adbf7a2642ca8c12656645b9683\n\n* Often you will also see **Caffeine** added in to boost the pain relieving properties of the NSAIDs but it also has intrinsic vasoconstrictive properties, thus acting against the pathology of the migraine. However, caffeine can also be a trigger for some, so careful use is needed. \n* Another prescription combo out there is **Fioricet**, a combination product of acetaminophen, caffeine, and **butalbital**. Butalbital is a barbiturate which acts as a sedative in this combination.\n* Another approach is using antihypertensive medications to help relax the vasodilation happening in the brain. \n   * Beta blockers like **propranolol** and **timolol** are used to block vasodilation mediated by beta-2 adrenoreceptors. Likewise, by slowing down the heart rate, it leads to a reflexive vasoconstriction thus helping with the migraine. \n\n# Some final words from our not-so love birds\n\n>*“Artificial food coloring was a huge trigger of my migraines that I recently uncovered. I know it's a trigger for others. The elimination diet, and strictly sticking to the process, I think could help figure out what food related triggers there are. Some such as strobe lights or loud sounds are easier to avoid while foods are a hit or miss. There are a lot of diets out there, might as well try out a diet to avoid migraines.”* — Robert\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*“I just want to say I am so sorry that you have to go through this too.  To everyone else crying in a dark room, praying for the pain to stop, to everyone else gritting their teeth and trying their best to get through the workday without calling out yet again, you are so valid. To our families and loved ones, please be patient.  I know that this condition doesn’t just affect the migraineurs themselves, but sometimes, there is nothing else we can do.  I can’t speak for everyone, but I know I’ve tried almost everything under the sun, and I still get my ass handed to me.  Trust me; we don’t like sitting out on vacations or rescheduling dates and hangouts last minute any more than you.  But more than that, thank you for bearing with us and supporting us when we need it most.*  \n>  \n>*Many people on* r/migraine *say that you feel a lot freer once you accept that there is no “cure” to migraines.  I get where they’re coming from, even if I don’t agree entirely.  There is only so much you can do.  I’m obnoxiously tenacious, but even I’ve come to see that sometimes, you just have to forgive yourself for not “doing more” and just meet yourself where you can be in the moment.*  \n>  \n>*Good luck, and hang in there.  Here’s to getting through another day.” —* Kate\n\n**And that’s our story!** Hopefully this provides some insight and you learned something new about the history and treatment of migraines!

When we think of serotonin receptors, often we think of them in the CNS but that’s not always the case. 5HT2b is found in high density in the heart cells that make up the valves controlling the heart. These fibroblasts are responsible for painting the webbing that supports and controls the opening and closing of the valves, allowing for the correct flow and timing of the heart beat. With Ergotamine, we discovered that chronic administration led to a valvulopathy, or an over stimulation of those fibroblasts thus creating a thick webbing around the valve. The valve then isn’t suspended correctly and isn’t able to open and close at the right interval nor open enough. Genetically engineered mice that didn’t have those 5HT2b receptors on the heart valves were unaffected, cluing us in on the mechanism. Generally this pathology can takes years to develop, but the higher the blood concentration and for longer, the quicker and more sustained the response. \n\nDrugs that are in development that are discovered to be 5HT2b agonists are generally scrapped then and there. The risk is just too high. That being said, there are some older drugs that were later implicated in valvulopathies too. Cabergoline, an egot derivative, was given for Parkinson’s but was removed from the market in 2007 because of this cardiac issue. Pergolide, another ergot derivative, is used to treat hyperprolactinemia (too much prolactin). However since the doses are so low to treat the disease, it wasn’t found to cause the valvulopathy and was kept on the market. MDMA (ecstasy) is another drug implicated in valvulopathy but because it’s taken recreationally, chronic daily users are unlikely to be checked for these complication until it’s too late. \n\nOther drugs that are being investigated for 5HT2b are guanfacine, oxymetazoline (Afrin), and ropinirole (Requip). You can read more about this all [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0192623310378027)",

One gram before bed is an absolutely perfect dose. I'm taking it down with ND's Lemon Balm extract, 500mcg of melatonin, and CBD/CBN/CBC.\n\nIt's a much cheaper source of apigenin than anything else out there with no off target effects, aside from i've noticed 0 need for antiperspirant since taking it, which is interesting as there's tales of ancient Romans using parsley tea to control body odor.\n\nFigured i'd pass the tip on, you can get 4oz or dried parsley from my local co-op for like 6 dollars, that's 112 doses that you don't want to take daily because of the halflife. Apigenin is already cheap, sure, but this is pennies on the dollar.",

On the first night using it, I actually woke up, and about 2–3 minutes later, the monitor’s alarm went off (these devices have a slight delay). It scared the hell out of me because the alarm is insanely loud—it's designed to wake up diabetics so they don’t just slip into a coma in their sleep.\n\nI've noticed this happens mostly when I go to the gym late in the evening.\n\nAccording to my doctor, it’s not a medical issue since my blood sugar stabilizes within ~15 minutes without food or medication. However, my body releases a significant amount of adrenaline to bring my blood sugar back up, which wakes me up and keeps me alert for 30–60 minutes.\n\nWhat completely solved the issue for me was eating Greek yogurt (high-fat, low-to-no sugar—a bit of honey is fine) and a handful of nuts right before bed.\n\nBefore figuring this out, I tried at least 30 different supplements to fix my sleep issues—none of them worked. Turns out, all I needed was this simple dietary change.\n\nI highly recommend trying it. These glucose monitors are relatively affordable (around €80 for 14 days of continuous monitoring), and the insights I gained were incredibly helpful.",

It has been shown to possess antibacterial, antidiabetic, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antihypercholesterolemia, and antioxidant activities. Its nonnutritive biologically active components include alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, isoflavones, phenols, phytosterols, phytic acid, protease inhibitors, saponins, and tannins. This plant is rich in apigenin, hydroxybenzoic, hydroxycinnamic, luteolin, and quercetin, all of which have been reported to contribute to its remedial properties.\n\n         \n\nPea is one of the major food legumes that can grow in different regions, and it ranks the fourth in world food legume productions next to soybean, peanut, and dry bean. Seed and sprout of pea have become increasingly consumed because people concern about their health problem by changing dietary habits.\n\nIt has different names in different languages such as English Name(Field pea, Garden pea),  Hindi Name(Matar, Mattar),  Marathi Name(Vataane, Vatana, Mattar, Watane),  Sanskrit[..................(read more)](https://kbjawadwar.blogspot.com/2021/07/amazing-health-benefits-of-green.html)\n\n\n[click here for more information about Antioxidants and Free radicals](https://kbjawadwar.blogspot.com/2020/07/everything-that-you-should-know-about.html)\n\n\n\n\n\nVitamin and Mineral content\n\nVitamin : A, B1, B2, B3, B6, B9, C, E, K\n\nMineral : Calcium, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc\n\nThe active phytochemical substances of P. sativum are as follows: Asparaginase; flavonoids including apigenin, daidzein, genistein, and kaempferol; lectin; \n\n          -Phenolic compounds including caffeic, catechin, coumaric acids, gentisic acids, ferulic, protocatechuic, and vanillic acids; pisatin and an allelopathic active substances; proanthocyanidin; saponins; steroid phytohormone including brassinosteroid; and tannins.  \n\nThe most abundant isoflavones in the legume sprouts were found as genistein followed by daidzein.\n\nA total of 17 pigments were identified in the pea cultivars including 8 xanthophylls ((all-E)-neoxanthin, (9‘Z)-neoxanthin, (all-E)-violaxanthin, neochrome, (all-E)-lutein epoxide, (all-E)-lutein, neolutein B, neolutein A), 4 chlorophyll b related compounds (chlorophyll b derivative, chlorophyll b, chloro[................(read more)](https://kbjawadwar.blogspot.com/2021/07/amazing-health-benefits-of-green.html)\n\n\n\nProperties and Benefits\n\nTaste – Sweet\n\nTaste conversion after digestion – sweet\n\nRuksha – dry in nature\n\nVirya (potency) – cold (sheetala)\n\nLaghu – light to digest\n\nSangrahi – absorbent in nature\n\nEffect on Tridosha – Balances kapha and pitta dosha but Increases vata\n\n             [Click here for more information about Tridosha](https://kbjawadwar.blogspot.com/2020/07/what-is-doshas.html)\n\nDahapaha – relieves burning sensation\n\nRuchi prada – improves taste\n\nPushti prada – improves physical strength\n\n> Peas, mature seeds, sprouted, raw\n\nTaste – sweet\n\nProperties – heavy, unctuous\n\nPoten[...............(read more)](https://kbjawadwar.blogspot.com/2021/07/amazing-health-benefits-of-green.html)\n\n\n\n\nUses, benefits and application\n\n1) Peas can be consumed in raw form as well as cooked or frozen form.\n\n\n2) Dried peas are often made into a soup or simply eaten on their own. \n\n\n3) One of the benefits of pea includes cardiovascular health in controlling blood pressure cholesterol levels, particularly from the fiber content.\n\n\n4) The classic way of cooking garden peas is to line a saucepan with several leaves of washed lettuce and then place the peas on the lettuce. You can then add fresh herbs(mint or coriander leaves) and spices(Cinnamon, pepper, cumin seed powder, clove, bay leaves, etc) if you desire. Cover the peas with more lettuce leaves, add one or two tablespoons of water, and cover the pan. Cook the peas for about 15 to 20 minutes.   \n\n              [Click here for more information about Cinnamon](https://kbjawadwar.blogspot.com/2020/06/cinnamon.html)    \n\n              [Click here for more information about Bay leaves](https://kbjawadwar.blogspot.com/2021/05/bay-leaves-health-benefits-application.html)\n\n              [Click here for more information about Cumin seed powder](https://kbjawadwar.blogspot.com/2020/08/cumin-is-dried-white-fruit-with-greyish.html)\n\n              [Click here for more information about Clove](https://kbjawadwar.blogspot.com/2020/10/everything-that-you-should-know-about.html)\n\n       \n\n5) In India, fresh peas are used in various dishes such as aloo matar (curried potatoes with peas) or mattar paneer (paneer cheese with peas), though they can be substituted with frozen peas as well.\n\n\n5) peas are usually boiled or steamed, which breaks down the cell walls and makes the taste sweeter and the nutrients more bioavailable. \n\n6) Green peas stand out as an environmentally friendly food. Agricultural research has shown that pea crops can provide the soil with important benefits. First, peas belong to a category of crops called \"nitrogen fixing\" crops. With the help of bacteria in the soil, peas and other pulse crops are able to take nitrogen gas from the air and convert it into more complex and usable forms. This process increases nitrogen available in the soil without the need for added fertiliz[...................(read more)](https://kbjawadwar.blogspot.com/2021/07/amazing-health-benefits-of-green.html)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nutrient-Rich Way of Cooking\n\nMinimal necessary heat exposure\n\nMinimal necessary cooking duration\n\nMinimal necessary food surface contact with cooking liq[..................(read more)](https://kbjawadwar.blogspot.com/2021/07/amazing-health-benefits-of-green.html)\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther read on following link\n\nhttps://kbjawadwar.blogspot.com/2021/07/amazing-health-benefits-of-green.html\n\n\n\n\nRefrence :\n\n1) Pharmacogn Rev. 2017 Jan-Jun; 11(21): 39–42.

Autophagy is intimately associated with the metabolism of lipid droplets (LDs) and is considered to be one of the lipid breakdown pathways. However, there is no study to elucidate the lipid-lowering mechanism of apigenin from the perspective of autophagy. Here, we investigated the possible role of apigenin in autophagy and lipid accumulation in palmitic acid (PA)-induced HepG2 cells. Our results showed that apigenin increased autophagosome formation and the LC3-II/I ratio, but decreased the p-mTOR/mTOR ratio and P62 protein expression. The effects of apigenin were blocked by chloroquine (CQ). Likewise, apigenin significantly stimulated autophagic flux in the cytoplasm. This effect also could be blocked by CQ. Moreover, apigenin decreased the lipid content and co-localization of LDs with LC3, and CQ could block these effects. Thus, we proposed that apigenin induced autophagy and stimulated autophagic lipid degradation in PA-treated HepG2 cells.",

I took the semitic cocktail of pills and was instantly knocked out on my bed and put into a deep sleep.\n\nNext thing I know, Matthew McConaughey is whispering in my ear that to be initiated as a freemason I need to bend over and take it in the ass! I started struggling but then I realized it's Matthew McConaughey. It's not gay if it's with McConaughey.\n\nI'm not gay, but I've experimented a bit with butt stuff. (The male g spot is the in the butt after all. Although andrew Schulz said this was gay propaganda). So I thought ok, maybe if McConaughey just sticks the tip in, it's not gay. I asked him please just the tip ok? He said all right all right all right. \n\nSo Matthew McConaughey bends me over and slowly inserts the tip of his uncut cowboy cock into my ass. My asshole on fire! The fucker forgot to use lube! Disrespectful fuck. So much for southern hospitality.\n\nSnap back to reality. My eyes are wide open. Asshole throbbing. And McConaughey is nowhere in sight. I seriously thought I was raped. But I sleep with my bedroom door locked so there's no way in hell. Am I gay?",

Buddhist priests are celibate (they decide not to have sex, so they won't get distracted from their religious goals).\n\nTantric sex was never a real phenomenon, but was derived from hindu buddhist paintings of gods sitting like [this](http://vitalcoaching.com/images/yabyum8.jpg). Tantric sex is difficult to learn about because Tantric buddhism is full of secrets and there aren't very many old books about it.\n\nThe idea of tantric sex is that a woman will sit in a man's lap with his pee pee insider her hooha and they will meditate (which is what buddhists do to think about everything and nothing at once). The woman will bring the man great \"insight\" (new ideas and understandings) that he wouldn't be able to have otherwise.\n\nSting, the musician, was quoted in an interview talking about having tantric sex, and insisted it was about a \"journey\" but all anyone would pay attention to was the fact that he said he would have sex for many hours on end.\n\nThe western world has bastardized and appropriated tantric sex\n\nEdit: that's a very shortened version... it would take me five pages of big words to adequately explain it.",

    "body": "Redensyl is like a Minoxidil alternative. You apply it topically. I am reading about it and compiling my notes here. It is hardly discussed on tressless and appears to be massively underrated. There are only 8 posts in total mentioning it: https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/search?q=redensyl&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all . Since there is such little information available...\n\nAdvantages of Redensyl over Minoxidil:\n\n* does not make hair greasy\n* not known to make your face age, give bags under eyes, or cause very minor cardiovascular damage like Minox.\n* It appears (though I cannot find confirmation) that, unlike minoxidil, you don't lose all your gains when quitting.\n* You can take once a day, before bed, and sleep with it in. no greasy pillow, no need to apply twice a day.\n* has a near instant increase of hair volume visual effect according to users\n* Promising results in studies. \n* Looks like it will synergise with microneedling effectively ( the mechanisms of action revolve around divising and multiplying number of bulge stem cells which are crucial to anagen stage initiation (like minox) - so it should become further effective with collagen response from microneedling in the same way minox does). However I have not seen one single person online who has combined both. Which is exciting as the best potential results possible have not yet been realised. I am starting to today and will post results in 6 months. Anyone want to join me?\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n* less information\n* not FDA approved yet apparently. \n* supposed to be good for hair but not for beard growth. dont try making a minoxbeard with redensyl.\n* still possible its LESS effective\n\nOne tressless user says:\n\n> I saw the clinical study that said Redensyl had better results than minoxidil and worked faster. i have tried both. both worked. [...] Between the two I have to admit, I am liking the redensyl. [...] I don't mind being regular with the redensyl its fairly easy to apply and it doesn't make your hair look greasy like the minoxidil. [...]\n\nHere is a study that was linked on here a few weeks ago that found it (in combination with Capaxil and Procapil) superior to Minoxidil. Scroll down to see the images of people after 24 weeks, they are very encouraging. https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/a-comparative-study-between-topical-5-minoxidil-and-topical-redensyl-capixyl-and-procapil-combination-in-men-with-androgenetic-alo-2471-9323-1000140-108138.html\n\nA rough overview of the mechnism of action of the active ingredients of redensyl is here: https://www.cosmeticsbusiness.com/news/article_page/Redensyl_the_hair_growth_galvanizer/96717\n\nAnother tressless user pointed out a similarity to onion juice: \n\n> The chemical structure of Redensyl looks uncannily similar to quercetin and apigenin. I don't know about apigenin, but I know that quercetin is highly abundant in onion, and there have been numerous anecdotal accounts of people growing their hair back on topical onion juice.  https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/6daeju/redensyl_follicle_stem_cell_activator_any/di3hm4w/\n\nAnother user noticed it gave him pimples. He also applied it (only) 2-3 times a week for 5 months and found no noticeable gain in hair: https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/bwvhmh/the_ordinary_hair_serum_redensyl_taxifolin/f86361d/\n\nAnother user found no results from it: https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/dntzet/does_anyone_here_have_used_redensyl_and_how_was/f5h3mpo/\n\nA cosmetic formulation chemist on HaircareScience says:\n\n> The studies on Redensyl are compelling. It’s easiest to say this : I don’t feel as though it wouldn’t work. The methods of their studies seem to be legitimate. Their results are obvious in their photos. My only hesitancy is that they used relatively small groups of people for the studies. However, I wouldn’t discount it as being useless. I would be willing to give it a shot in a shampoo for hair loss, if the customer could afford it at active levels. That’s a big problem: people will often make hair care products that don’t contain active amounts of ingredients just to say it’s in there. With no information on the specific formula, I can’t say for sure whether or not I’d trust this brand. But this ingredient looks really compelling. https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/b98fu0/is_the_science_of_revivhair_brand_legit/\n\nThis user had a doctor/dermatologist recommend they try Redensyl instead of Minoxidil:  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/e6o86s/redensyl_over_minoxidil/\n\nAnother user has said (about 'The Ordinary' hair serum that contains Redensyl):\n> I’m a scientist by trade so I was super skeptical of this product, but also pretty desperate to not lose any more hair. I’m n=1 but I saw really good results with this product. Within the first week my scalp was noticeably less flakey. I’m almost finished with the first bottle right now, and my hair is noticeably thicker at the sides and I can see new growth at the temples where I was receding. https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/9srok8/psa_the_ordinarys_marine_hyaluronics_and/e8rh22c/\n\nIn the above thread one user wrote a very positive post about it. Then two others posted to say they noticed no difference at all after using it : https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/9srok8/psa_the_ordinarys_marine_hyaluronics_and/egs179m/ . Then another user said something positive: https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/9srok8/psa_the_ordinarys_marine_hyaluronics_and/elbzmvp/\n\nBeware the positive Amazon reviews of Redensyl products - many people rate them highly because it makes hair appear more volumous within a day, then they leave a positive review straight away as they are surprised and encouraged. But at the same time you shouldnt take the negative reviews too seriously - most people are not disciplined with habits or they have too high of expetations. \n\n**Information I REALLY want to see:**\n\n1. Combining Minox with microneedling has been found to be far more effective than either one their own. I am not seeing any studies or anecdotes where people combine microneedling with redensyl. How effective will redensyl be with microneedling? Its as if nobody has ever tried it, not one mention on internet. According to the mechanisms of action (multiplying bulge stem cells which are crucial to anagen stage initiation) it looks like it should synergise nicely with collagen response from micronedling. I have bought Ordinary Company hair peptide serum, which has Redensyl, Capixyl, Bacaipal as in study linked above. I have also got a dermapen. Starting both today. Already on fin for 2 months now. I am not ever going to use minox and never have in the past because the sides are not worth it to me. So I will test microneedling with redensyl and take pictures and update with results in 6 months. PM me if I forget. **Will anyone here not taking minoxidil wish to join me?**\n\n2. Redensyl is composed of a greentea derivative, dihydroquercetin-­glucoside (which causes division (multiplication) of bulge stem cells (the bulge stem cells ' have a crucial function in the initiation of the anagen phase, which is the growth phase of the hair') and glycine and zinc. How soon after microneedling will it be safe to use this product? 24 hours should be fine as your skin will have recovered by then. Should we be using it sooner than 24 hours though? With microneedling you dont want minox entering you blood system because of what can happen. That seems less true with redenysl but how much less true is it?",

    "body": "Focus on the microbiome, on enhancing cerebral blood flow, dissolving micro clots, and improving mitochondrial function if you want your symptoms to improve.\n\n------\n\n D3. It acts as an immunomodulator, and is protective from all kinds of infections not just SARS2. Everyone with long COVID should be supplementing with D3 \n\n-----\n\n Sulbutiamine or Benfotiamine. Synthetic versions of thiamine, vitamin B1. The former compound Sulbutiamine is prescribed in France for post-viral fatigue, and it has potential for ME/CFS and fatigue in general.\n\n-----\n\n Niacin / NAD+ / NMN. SARS-CoV-2 seems to decrease NAD+ levels which could contribute to brain fog and fatigue among other symptoms. Niacin also protects diseased mitochondria, which is one of the problems contributing to LC. \n\n-----\n\n Mexidol. It's a synthetic vitamin B6 analogue, attached to a GABA molecule. It enhances cerebral blood flow, which is severely compromised in Long COVID patients, by up to 30-40%. Sulbutiamine, as a synthetic B vitamin, also enhances cerebral blood flow. \n\n-----\n\n Pantogam Active. It's a synthetic analogue of vitamin B5, pantothenic acid, attached to a GABA molecule like Mexidol. It enhances cerebral blood flow, which again, is diminished in people with long COVID. The reductions in cerebral blood flow likely contributes to brain fog and fatigue. \n\n-----\n\n Hydroxyzine / Diphenhydramine / Zyzal & etc. First generation antihistamines seem to help with COVID infections via ACE2 inhibition. The virus also seems to benefit from increased histamine levels so keeping your baseline histamine levels low is important. \n\n-----\n\n Melatonin. There's quite a bit of research on melatonin having antiviral effects towards SARS2, via ACE2 inhibition iirc, and it also seems to protect from the damage inflicted by the spike protein\n\n You need to take large doses that saturate the brain, CNS and gut, to benefit from it. Lower dosages won't cut it. I started with 10mg at night and slowly raised it up to around 50mg until I started to feel better. I've heard of people taking upwards of 500mg. \n\n\nMelatonin is one of the most important compounds to use for treating LC. It also preserves mitochondrial function. \n\n-----\n\nFluvoxamine. Not much to say here, going on any psychiatric medication is a big ask but it's worth mentioning. There's a fair amount of research on Fluvoxamine protecting people from the acute phase of the infection, which is likely because it modulates melatonin levels in the body. \n\n\nTHC also increases melatonin levels, I'm not suggesting you use THC or fluvoxamine but I felt it's worth mentioning. I smoke everyday and it could have played a role in my recovery for all I know. \n\n-----\n\n Nattokinase and Serrapeptase. These enhance blood flow and dissolve micro clots which is thought to contribute to fatigue, brain fog and POTS. They dissolve fibrin in the blood, preventing it from clumping together and forming blood clots. I can't find the study, but they're safe to take alongside blood thinners, no risks were found. Just in case someone is worried about that.  \n\n-----\n\n CBD. CBD is an mPro inhibitor and has antiviral properties towards the virus. I recommend using CBD prodrugs, like CBDA or CBDVA, as they have a longer lasting effect. If you can afford it, use both water soluble CBD and fat soluble CBD for a more full effect. \n\n-----\n\n Liposomal Quercetin. Not only is it an ACE2 inhibitor, meaning it has antiviral properties like most other flavonoids,  and I'm not listing all of them, but some notable ones are curcumin, luteolin, apigenin, and berberine. \n\n\nI recommend mixing multiple of these phytonutrients together to make sure it's most effective. It lowers baseline histamine levels, although not as much as the first generation antihistamines listed above. The real benefit from quercetin and other flavonoids though, is that they augment the microbiome by acting as prebiotics, feeding the good bacteria in the gut, restoring it from dysbiosis, which seems to happen in some people subsequent to a COVID infection\n\nQuercetin is also a zinc ionophore, meaning it transports zinc into the cell, which is related to its antiviral activity. So supplement the Liposomal quercetin with zinc. \n\n-----\n\n Liposomal Sulforaphane. Like a lot of plant compounds, it has antiviral properties towards SARS2. These antiviral plant compounds are most effective when combined, by the way. And I recommend getting Liposomal forms so they absorb into the body effectively. Like quercetin it also seems to restore the microbiome after dysbiosis.\n\n-----\n\n Cistanche Tubulosa Extract (Phenethylanoid Glycoside Extract) \n\n>Echinacoside stimulates the creation of T helper cells, and stimulates a growth factor the promotion of naive T-cells, and also minimizes autoimmune reactions. Cistanche also increased the ratio of beneficial CD4 T-cells to CD8 T-cells, a sign of a youthful immune system. These actions together make cistanche an incredible immune herb. Together with it's other effects make cistanche much more powerful than previously believed.  (5,6)\n\n iirc, COVID infections lower CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts. I also remember reading a loss of naive T cells, which Cistanche Tubulosa promotes the production of. Plus it helps with autoimmune reactions which seems to be a problem for some people with LC\n\n-----\n\n S. Boulardii. It's a probiotic and one of the only ones I can recommend as it's the only one that improved my symptoms. It promotes the growth of beneficial microbes while managing populations of harmful microbes like candida albicans and H. Pylori. It essentially attaches itself to harmful microbes and pulls them out with the stool, all while helping maintain optimal health of the microbiome. Make sure to take all probiotics with prebiotics like quercetin, epicatechin or sulforaphane for them to be most effective. I've read anecdotal reports of it helping with gut symptoms subsequent to an infection. \n\n-----\n\nI didn't start to improve and suffered for upwards of a year without help from my doctor. What helped me recover was focusing on restoring my microbiome from dysbiosis, taking compounds that enhance cerebral blood flow, restoring NAD+ reserves, using antihistamines and plenty of melatonin. High dose melatonin is one of the most important things you can do for your LC symptoms. \n\n-----\n\nI took many more compounds besides these ones, but found the ones listed most effective at treating my symptoms.",

        "body": "I got HPPD/VSS and DPDR in middle school and dealt with it for years. I've gone through periods of intense derealization and depersonalization, dissociation. I also suffered from extreme fatigue for a very long time. \n\nBoth of these things have improved dramatically over the past year or so. For me, my trauma triggered my DPDR and caused me to dissociate, and this got worse as my body stopped functioning properly due to long COVID. The trauma of your body not working properly can trigger dissociation and depersonalization, which you should try to keep in mind as you work on recovery. Overcoming the trauma I experienced was crucial for me, but that only got easy to do when my long COVID symptoms started to improve. \n\nI'm 90-95% recovered at this point. \n\nFor fatigue, you need to get a stack of multiple nutraceuticals (vitamins, minerals, nutrients, supplements in general, herbal extracts and more)\n\nI focused on things that improve mitochondrial dysfunction for fatigue, which helped me quite a bit. \n\n\n**Mitochondrial Dysfunction**\n\n- Melatonin\n\nThe study thus showed that melatonin administration counteracted age-dependent oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in senescence accelerated mice by improving mitochondrial function as reflected by the increase in ATP production and a prolonged longevity\n\n- L-Theanine\n\nl-Theanine is an active constituent of green tea which prevents neuronal loss, mitochondrial failure and improves dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin levels and in the central nervous system (CNS) via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuromodulatory properties\n\n- ALCAR\n\nThe acetyl group of ALCAR is used to produce the antioxidant glutathione (GSH), reducing oxidative stress, and protecting cells against lipid peroxidation [23, 24]. ALCAR also contributes to the bioenergetics processes, therefore, it plays a vital role in mitochondrial-related disorders\n\n- Selenium\n\nSelenium protects neurons against hypoxic/ischemic damage by reducing oxidative stress, restoring mitochondrial functional activities and stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis\n\n- Magnesium Glycinate\n\nMg deficiency caused a reversible diastolic cardiomyopathy associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative modification of cMyBPC\n\n- NMN / NR / NAD+ precursors, or plain old niacin (B3) works just as well at NAD+ repletion. Personally I use both niacin and NMN / NR, but you may find niacin to be more helpful\n\nNAD+ repletion improves mitochondrial and stem cell function and enhances life span in mice.\nZhang et al. found that feeding the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) to aging mice protected them from muscle degeneration (see the Perspective by Guarente). NR treatment enhanced muscle function and also protected mice from the loss of muscle stem cells. The treatment was similarly protective of neural and melanocyte stem cells, which may have contributed to the extended life span of the NR-treated animals\n\n- P5P / B6 \n\nActive vitamin B6 participates in hundreds of enzymatic reactions and is very important for maintaining mitochondria's activities. In the SCA3 Drosophila model, Vitamin B6 supplementation significantly suppressed ECs mitochondria damage in guts and inhibited cellular polyQ aggregates in fat bodies, indicating a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of polyQ. Taken together, our results reveal a crucial role for the Vitamin B6-mediated mitochondrial protection in polyQ-induced cellular toxicity\n\n- L-Methylfolate / Folate\n\nSeveral studies in model systems have also demonstrated that folate deficiency can lead to accumulation of mtDNA deletions (58–63), which may cause reduced expression of genes within mtDNA that are essential to mitochondrial function and energy production\n\n- B12\n\nVitamin B12 Reduces TDP-43 Toxicity by Alleviating Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction\n\n- D-Ribose\n\nSupplemental D-ribose has been shown to improve cellular processes when there is mitochondrial dysfunction. When individuals take supplemental D-ribose, it can bypass part of the pentose pathway to produce D-ribose-5-phosphate for the production of energy\n\n- DHEA\n\nDHEA prevents mitochondrial dysfunction by decreasing the activation of DNM1L and MFF, and increasing MFN1 expression\n\n- Alpha Lipoic Acid\n\nAlpha-lipoic acid has also been shown to improve mitochondrial function. A single dose of alpha-lipoic acid (100 mg/kg i.p.) resulted in improvement in mitochondrial function, determined by mitochondrial oxygen consumption and complex I, II, and IV activities, in endotoxemic rats\n\n- CoQ10\n\nTacrolimus-induced impairment of mitochondrial respiration was significantly improved by coenzyme Q10, as evidenced by the increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP production\n\n- γ-Tocotrienol\n\nγ-Tocotrienol Protects against Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Renal Cell Death\n\n- D3\n\nVitamin D Deficiency Is Associated with Muscle Atrophy and Reduced Mitochondrial Function in Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain\n\n- Vitamin K (K2 / MK4 / MK7)\n\nVitamin K2 can promote the balance of mitochondrial dynamics in mitochondrial dysfunction induced by high oxidative stress and regulate the mitochondrial quality-control loop through the Pink1/Parkin signaling pathway, thereby alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction and cell damage\n\n- Liposomal Sulforaphane\n\nSulforaphane prevents quinolinic acid-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in rat striatum\n\n- Liposomal Curcumin\n\nIn recent years, many researchers have shown evidence that curcumin has the ability to reduce the oxidative stress- and mitochondrial dysfunction-associated diseases\n\n- Liposomal Quercetin\n\nHistopathological analysis of 3-NP treated rats revealed pyknotic nuclei and astrogliosis in striatum, which were reduced or absent in quercetin supplemented animals. Altogether, our results show that quercetin supplementation to 3-NP induced HD animals ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunctions, oxidative stress and neurobehavioral deficits in rats showing potential of this flavonoid in maintaining mitochondrial functions",

But here’s what happened.\n\nBack in January, I caught a really nasty norovirus. The diarrhea wasn’t even the worst part—what really got me was the stomach pain. It was so inflamed and sore that I couldn’t eat anything for days. Then I remembered what my grandmother used to say about stomach issues: *Drink chamomile tea.*\n\nSo that’s what I did. I went all in—like 8 cups a day of really strong chamomile tea. And not only did my stomach start to feel better, but something unexpected happened: I felt like I was on benzos, lol. Suddenly I was sleeping better, and my depression and anxiety just... lifted.\n\nI asked ChatGPT about it, and it explained that studies suggest chamomile—especially the active compound apigenin—might help regulate cortisol levels, probably through its calming effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. That conversation went even deeper: it touched on the gut-brain axis, the vagus nerve, leaky gut (which connects to my gluten intolerance), and even gave me insights into my C-PTSD. It honestly felt like the entire conversation explained my life to me.\n\nNeedless to say, I’m still drinking chamomile tea every day. Now I'm making an iced tea version with lemon balm and sweetened with stevia, which I drink instead of water.\n\nJust thought I would share my little story. I’m finally feeling a bit of hope in life again. To give you guys a sense of how bad it was before... I used to think about how peaceful it might be to just lie down on a train track. So yeah—this is a big shift for me. Edit: Thank you Mutti (granny in my language)",

State of mind is a powerful thing but for someone like me who can literally NOT fall asleep even if I do all of the above, the apigenin combo with magnesium glycinate is as good if not better than Ambien for me. Sometimes even Ambien wouldnt work if you have severe insomnia spurts. Nights where I'd take 2 doses and still couldn't sleep. With apigenin, at worst I go one night without sleep and to me that's manageable. If I get my full 8 hours every other night, I think that's a huge success. Plus it's good for you and it doesn't require a doctor approval it's just a natural supplement. It's the stuff found in chamomile tea. Look up all the other positive benefits of apigenin!

They didnt do much of anything for me and 60-90 minutes after taking them had to resort to ambien or zzzquil. Its really hard for me to get to sleep.  Doing some more research chatgpt suggested i incorporate apigenin for sleep. I saw the dose was 50mg but you said 150mg works for you?  You combine it with Mag glycinate?

    "body": "Just wanted to share a story on my HRV and resting heart rate improvements for those that would find it helpful.\n\nI spent most of the last few years  always fatigued and with an HRV in the range of the 30s, and I just thought thats how my body was. Even when I was exercising consistently I would get up to the 50s at most.\n\nMore recently I've tried a new protocol following a lot of advice I've heard on the show, and instituted a protocol that in a very short window I've seen my HRV jump very significantly from:\n\n1. An average HRV of 32 in February-March (baseline) and a resting heart rate of 73\n2. A jump to 47 in April and most of May, and a resting heart rate of 63\n3. And now towards the end of May I am regularly at 97-137 HRV and a resting heart rate of 47\n\nI've been feeling really awake and active, after spending what feels like a lifetime suffering chronic fatigue; and I think its amazing how in a very short window you can make very rapid changes to your HRV, and the profound effects it has on you when it is higher. This is obviously not medical advice, but for those of you that were similar to me feeling like there was no way out of low energy and low HRV, I thought I would share my story.  I did a number of changes at the same time so I cannot attribute the rise to anything specific, but for those that would find it helpful, the changes I did were as follows:\n\n1. Resistance training 3 times a week and Zone 2 Cardio 2-3 times a week, either golf, swimming, biking, rowing, walking or cycling (This is directly attributable to the jump from 30s to  40s-50s HRV)\n2. Replaced standing desk with treadmill desk (I had a standing desk for a year prior to this)\n3. Got a temperature regulating bed cover (I won't say the name to avoid this being misinterpreted as an advert)\n4. Began a supplement protocol of:\n   * Morning: Tongkat Ali, Tyrosine, Fadogia Agrestis, Creatine, Alpha GPC, Fish oil\n   * Prior to bed: Magnesium L-Threonate, L-Theanine, Inositol, Apigenin, Creatine\n5. Drinking a modified version of Rhonda Patricks Green Smoothie #2 with added Pea Protein (to reduce glucose spikes), and drinking electrolytes every morning\n6. Drinking Yerba Mate every morning\n7. Following a balanced macro diet with a higher amount of total calories and protein than I would consume if left to my own devices.\n8. 40hz light and sound therapy 1 hour a day while working\n9. Walking at least 6,000 steps a day\n\n# Next Steps:\n\nWhile I am happy with my current state, I am planning on making the following changes to my protocol over the next few weeks, some of which I've already started.\n\n1. Wim Hof Breathing every day, 3 rounds, and Cold Plunges, 3 times a week in the morning totaling to 11 minutes a week\n2. Updating my supplements to the following:\n   * Morning: N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine, Alpha GPC, Creatine, Fish oil, Tongkat Ali Berberine + Hesperdin + OptimAla+Nigella Sativa Extract, CoQSOL-CF + OptimALA + Salidorsol + Gotu Kola, Lions Mane + Omega Tau, Ashwaganda + Shaljit\n   * Before Bed: Oleamide, Magnolia Bark, Apigenin, Magnesium Glycinate, L-Theanine, Creatine\n3. 10,000 lumen SAD lamp for 30 minutes when I wake up\n4. Sauna 2-3x a week split across 2x15/30 minute sessions, totaling to no more than 1 hour a week\n5. Full body red light therapy, 20-30 minute session 2-3 times a week\n\nAgain this isn't medical advice, and I know those are a lot of supplements and nootropics to be taking daily, and everyone will react differently so they should find their own stack.  I also blood test every 3 months  and use a CGM so I'll be able to quickly see if there are any issues the stack is introducing to my body. But I wanted to share because I never in my life thought I would really reach an HRV this high and such a low resting heart rate  ever, let alone in such a short window.\n\nSo for those of you that are demotivated, as I had been, I hope this helps you know how quickly things can turn around with the right protocol for you!\n\n*Edit* - I measure my resting HRV and heart rate on both my bed cover and wearable. Generally they can have a gap by as much as 20 on the HRV, but both directionally and magnitude measured the same. So this is of course  an imprecise but accurate measurement confirmed across two devices\n\nEdit 2 - I added in the light therapy I've been doing for the last month, because I didn't earlier think it would be linked to HRV and heart rate but after posting this I've read that some studies currently underway are studying the link between HRV and light therapy",

I tried a million different things to try and promote parasympathetic nervous system response to try and calm me down with no or only limited benefit.\n\nFrom as soon as I woke up until late at night it would be normal for my RHR to be 80-95 (It's now about 55-70). While sleeping no issue with my RHR. Normal to have very little HVR (for Garmin users, my stress level would be >75 for 5-6 hours a day during the middle of the day and for hours post exercise)\n\nThe thing I changed? SSRI Antidepressants (Escitalopram / Lexapro)\n\nI'm not mentally depressed and don't meet any of the mental symptoms of anxiety. But clearly the body disagreed with the brain. I only started taking them because I've had globus sensation in my throat for 8 months now with all medical tests and exemptions by specialists showing nothing. That globus is not gone for me yet but is better than pre-treatment and hopefully fading away. Can't not express how different I physically feel having proper HRH and HVR during the day now. Body feels lighter. Much more at ease. Don't get tension in my back and upper neck anymore. Am more keen to exercise knowing that my heart rate will go back down again after I stop and I don't have to mentally prepare myself for 4 hours of my heart rate above 100 just because I went for a 30 minute jog.\n\nSomething to keep in mind for any of you out there that seem to suffer from horrible RHR and HRV despite living otherwise healthy lifestyles... you might have GAD bros",

Mate increases fat oxidation and metabolic rate during exercise and at rest (which is important to me as I'm not purely solving for heart rate and HRV), it also uniquely causes a slight decrease in heart rate. This is contrasted to caffeine which typically increases heart rate. \n\nThis is because it contains Polyphenols and Theobromine which seemingly counteract the effect of caffeine on heart rate, and its adaptogenic properties may also be contributing to stabilising heart rate in terms of your overall health.\n\n  \nEdit - That being said, different people will have different responses to it so you need to see how you react to it.",

Just literally everything.. Nothing works for long and some things I didn't want to continue with due to other health issues.\nI am at Wit's and my dollar's end, but will try this last supplement someone just recommended.

It took quite a bit of work to fine tune the exact composition of the baikal skullcap extract and we were able to very accurately dial in the percentages of the different bioactives. The overall subjective effects profile we settled on, was one which is significantly calming without inducing much if any lethargy. Futhermore, the subjective effects I personally experience, include a very nice mood boost and I feel like I can focus better after taking it. The focus effect is something I get from quite a few calming and GABAergic compounds and extracts, however not all of them have this focus effect, so this is something I am always on the lookout for and this baikal skullcap extract definitely fits the bill for me!\n\nOne of the things that makes this extract unique is the relatively high apigenin content. Most baikal skullcap extracts are high in baicalin and baicalein, but the addition of apigenin seemed to add an extra layer of effects that made this specific ratio of bioactives really stand out to all of the beta-testers. I'm excited to hear some more subjective reports from all of you in the coming weeks/months but this is one we are quite proud of and took a lot of work to get right!",

While this may put some people to sleep, for other people it may allow them to slow down and relax, allowing them to focus better. This is what I experience from baikal skullcap. That being said, I also experience this with sibelius sage, magnolia bark and to a lesser extent with lemon balm. Calming my mind down a little with these supplements, gives me a much better chance at focusing. That being said, it is important for me that it does not induce lethargy. For example, the nigella sativa 10% thymoquinone is a little bit too lethargy inducing for me, as is our generic bacopa. However, both of these do wonders for my sleep.  \n\n\nWith the baikal skullcap, I get significant relaxing effects, yet at the same time it does not induce much or any lethargy for me. This is an effect I am always on the lookout for as this effects profile really helps me to get in the zone interestingly enough, so with that in mind, baikal skullcap seems to be a very good fit for my biochemistry.",

The focus boost that I described is mainly coming from the unique GABAergic effects actually. This is a focus enhancing effect loose from stimulation. Focus does not always mean you need stimulation as is the case here for me.   \n\n\nThat being said, apigenin and baicalin both have interesting dopaminergic effects. Apigenin appears to be a mild dopamine D2 agonist and baicalin appears to enhances dopamine synthesis + release. These effects, combined with the GABAergic effects of baicalin, baicalein and apigenin is likely what causes the interesting calming yet non-lethargy inducing effects that are not stimulating yet do seem to enhance focus. That being said, this still appears to work great for sleep too, so by exlcuding oroxylin A, we have a very fexible extract that can be used during the day for its calming focus or at night in order to promote sleep quality.",

That being said, I do like giving people the ability to experiment on their own with amounts and ratios, so we will likely bring out a bunch of flavonoids as standalones to give people that opportunity. Baicalin and baicalein will definitely be two of them.",

        "body": "Baicalein is just the aglycone of baicalin. Your body will deglycosylate it in the GI tract. Your microbiome will determine how quickly that happens, though. Interestingly enough, it is not baicalein that goes into systemic circulation after you take it. It's baicalin. The baicalein you take will convert to baicalin systemically by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase after absorption. Taking baicalin will convert to baicalein hydrolysis by β-glucuronidase derived from intestinal bacteria, which will then absorb, which will then convert back to baicalin in serum by UGT. So while baicalin has low direct bioavailability, it does concert to baicalein in the GI tract. It's just funny that is also converts back in serum, and that baicalin is the active form once in the bloodstream. You could certainly use some strategies to make baicalin more bioavailable, but it might just be better to take a higher dose and let your microbiome convert it.\n\nThe whole liposome thing is a big scam to me. We have been doing a lot of testing on the supposed liposomal products on the market, and I am leaning towards the whole things being a scam. I am not saying the concept of liposomes is a scam. Clearly they are made and used properly in the pharmaceutical industry. However, I think most/all of the liposomal products in the supplement market are a scam. I am not referring to Rephyll or some of the patented stuff we sell. Those are made properly. I am talking about the generic liposomal shit out there. Our testing is pointing to it all just being whatever the compound is mixed with soy lecithin in a sonicator. That's NOT how you properly make a liposome... We have found this out by trying to bring our our own generic liposomal products, and digging through the data and pushing the manufacturers to explain their production processes. We have also done some SEM/TEM analysis, and are going to be doing some flow cytometry and HP-TLC work to really prove it. From what we have seen so far, all the generic liposomes are just soy lecithin mixed with whatever active ingredient you want in a sonicator. The real way to make it is using thin-film hydration with the Bangham method. That method involves dissolution of the lipid in an organic solvent, evaporation of the solvent, and the dispersion of the obtained lipid film in aqueous media. The compound to be entrapped can be included in the aqueous media (for hydrophilic drugs) or in the lipid film (for lipophilic drugs). However, the encapsulation efficiency of water-soluble drugs is low (5%–15%). Moreover, this method produces large and nonhomogeneous MLVs that require sonication or extrusion processes to be produced in homogeneous small ULVs. So this is much more complicated than just mixing shit in a sonicator with soy lecithin and calling it a day. I honestly think most of the generic \"liposomes\" on the market right now are not even liposomes.",

    "body": "General background: I am in my mid-30s and have been training consecutively with different styles of programming since I was 15. As I have gotten older, I do less strength and hypertrophy  training and more body weight and gymnastics style movements, with great success; Less injury and happy with a more toned physique, But I’m definitely not as strong as I used to be. About three months ago I bought a squat rack and have started to re-introduce 5x5 strength training with a much slower progression model than SL, and slower than what I used to do (Was constantly battling minor injuries when I did the normal SL progression once I got strong). Since it had been about three years from the time I stopped SL, I started light, 135 for bench and squat, and 185 for dead’s, but have since progressed to 185 bench, 225 squat, 315 dead (I don’t have much intent on breaking these numbers, if anything I have been increasing volume, not weight). Outside of those two training days, I do 4 sets of pull ups to toes-2-bar to failure and 4 sets of push ups to failure at least 5x a week(2sets AM, 2 sets PM). I have a healthy diet but I am usually running on a caloric deficit throughout the week and then have a massive feast day on Sundays, where anything goes.\n\nWhat I saw in my six weeks with 5 days on 2 days off b-ecty: I didn’t feel any noticeable, or accelerated gains in any of my strength movements, but with my pull ups and push ups I saw significant improvement. Prior to supplementation, on a good day my first set of push-ups would be anywhere between 45 and 50, and on a good day my pull ups would be between 18 and 22 (full ROM, legs straight out for AMRAP). I kind of felt like I had hit a plateau in both of those movements, but when I introduced b-ecty within a week I was consistently getting 1-3 more reps, per set, a week. Yesterday I hit, in one set, 29 pull ups in a L-sit, and I’m getting around 70-80 push ups on my first and second set of push ups. \n\nMy daily(M-F) stack consists of:\n\nRight when I wake up - 1 OptimALA, 1-2g ALCAR, 20mg micro zinc, 1 cap of immuse, and alternate CoQH-CF and CoQsol-CF\n\nAround noon (empty stomach) - 500 mg green tea extract, 250mg Milk Thistle, 500mg reduced glutathione \n\nBefore bed: 500mg Sensoril, 500mg schisandra, 750mg lemon balm extract, 200mg apigenin 300mg skullcap extract, 700mg micro mag, 200mg nigella 10%, 25mg TAU, 500mg Red rishi extract\n\nOutside of these, I take the occasional protein shake, and green vibrance daily. \n\nSide note to anyone interested: i’ve struggled with insomnia most of my adult life and my PM stack knocks me the fuck out. \n\nAnyway, getting back to b-ecty, In my experience, it appears to help increase with endurance more than brute strength.  It definitely helped me get back to a bodyweight strength that I haven’t had in several years. I look slightly more cut (was already pretty lean) but nothing out of this world, But it’s definitely giving me a confidence boost in terms of hitting numbers I haven’t hit in sometime. It’s also worth mentioning that I probably don’t eat enough to see significant strength gains, so that probably factors in to the lack of perceived effectiveness of b-ecty on raw strength.\n\nI now plan to take a few weeks off b-ecty before getting another tub. If I notice any changes in physical performance, I will make a new post. \n\nCheers!",

They range from vitamins, minerals, amino acids, hormones and pharmaceuticals. In context, I do combine this with a calm life and pro metabolic diet (a different talk). Also, I believe that a large majority of these substances put me on the right track even after quitting. It really creates momentum, that you can still ride off, after you stop using them.  \n\nHope this helps people decide what to try.\n\nAll rated out of 10. A 10/10 is based off experience compared to other experiences. Once my experience changes with new substances they may change.\n\n10/10s for those who don’t want to read are caffeine, t3 and progesterone \n\n\nA: \n\nAspirin - My FIRST thing I tried from Ray Peat. I instantly got a greater appreciation of life, so I think it lowered my serotonin. It is destressing, metabolic too. I buy it in powder form, very cheap.\n\n7/10\n\nAndrosterone - I love this. I can take it and have no worries of if it’s going to have harmful effects as it cannot go into estrogen or harmful metabolites. I feel very horny when using large doses (15mg), and definetley increases metabolism, DHT, mood while lowering estrogren and prolactin. This week, 5 days on 20mg and my ‘beard’ had grown dramatically. I think 4-6mg is a good dose. \n\n9/10\n\nAshwaghanda: I felt very comfy and fuzzy when taking this before going to meet friends - It made me appreciative. But I think it is very serotenogic and choligernic, I remember having racing thoughts and being in a dazed, tranced state before taking this at bed. \n\n3/10\n\n\nApigenin:\n\nHelped with sleep.\n\n7/10\n\nB:\nBCAA - I used this with Tyrosine. I used to take it at work and I thought I felt warmer. In recent times I used 10g a day with 4.5g tyrosine, separated in 3 doses. I didn’t feel much but after quitting my motivation was less and I was more lazy. Dopaminic substances have this silent effect, so it could be expected.\n\n6.5/10\n\nBenadryl (Diphenhydramine). Refer to crypoheptadine review. Similar but less intense. \n\n6.5/10\n\n\nB3 (Niacinamide) - definetley increases metabolism. It can help me sleep in large doses. There is so much research behind its benefits and is very cheap so for insurance I’m going to keep taking it.\n\n6.5/10\n\nB6 (P5P) - the pill I was taking was 50mg. Way too high. It correlated with me getting insomnia while still functioning in the day wel. I think it supercharged me with dopamine or something. After quitting my insomnia basically went away  (after 2 fucking months) but my motivation fell. Less productive. I have to be fair and say my dose was too high. With this taken in mind:\n\n6.5/10 ( maybe at Lower doses it could be 7+)\n\nBoron - felt nothing. \n0/10\n\nC:\n\nCaffeine: More than>2000mg a day taken for 2 months. Stupid idea but an experiment I am proud of. In these doses it gave me crazy anxiety. Helped me lose weight. If taken at a dose which is tolerable it’s pretty awesome. Instant benefits, we all love coffee for these reasons. Not addictive. Gotta give this a:\n\n10/10.\n\nCalcium (calcium carbonate) - disgusting. But it helped me lose weight when I started to take it at the start of my journey. Powder is cheaper than dirt.\n\n7/10\n\nCyproheptadine - what a life saver. I used to work retail. Standing behind those tills drove me crazy. It was a never ending barrage of customers. Just scan scan scan. Standing still. Saying the same stuff. Only break being your lunchbreak. Hoping you don’t fuck up a customers order or be too rude to them so they don’t report you . It’s truly an environment for high serotonin. Benadryl and Cypro’s anti cholinergic effect and anti serotonin effect carried me through those days. It just stopped the rapid thoughts and dread, and just allowed me to do my job without the depression, stress and anxiety. Doesn’t really help with sleep.\n\n9/10\n\nVitamin D: (Vitamin D3) I have been taking this maybe since I was 15. I don’t feel any immediate effects from it, but I think it’s one of the reasons why my health never fell really down the hole when I was dieting, doing low carb etc. loads of research behind it and cheap as well.\n\n6.5/10\n\nDHEA: I most notably felt the anti serotonin effects. I consistently start questioning my views ( open mindedness) when I start taking this and when I stop, this goes away. I think it did increase my DHT (more beard growth ) but not much libido boost. It can get so easily aromatised, I use it in less than 4mg doses at a time. 12 hour wait before each dose. Most of the time on scrotum but back of hand works very well as well. \n\n8/10\n\nDoxycycline:\n\nI think it helped my digestion when I was abroad. It lowered my serotonin I feel as well. \n\n7/10\n\nF:\n\nFamotadine: I think it really boosted my insulin sensitivity. No low blood sugar issues when taking it. Stopped taking it due to high price in my country. Would take it again.\n\n7/10\n\nG:\n\nGlycine - helped me get over my broken heart, which disappeared upon taking it. Helped me lose weight. Probably anti estrogenic\n\n8/10\n\nK:\n\nVitamin K2(MK4): I used this topically using quinone. I think it’s a metabolism booster. Very cheap (from idealabs at least) and I get none from my diet so I still take it.\n\n6.5/10\n\nL:\n\nLisuride: very androgenic and makes me into a kid again at the same time. I get so excited and happy over random things when taking this. My sex drive is also very high when taking this. I took 500mcg on my wrists and at the end of the day I had pimples all over my chest. Maybe a bit too androgenic in this case ( estrogren increasing too much, even though the whole point of lisuride is increasing dopamine which reduces prolactin and estrogren allowing for more testosterone). Grew my beard. I only use this if I am going to a place where I am forced to eat like crap. It’s too strong otherwise and dopamine desensitisation is an issue in the long term.\n\n9/10\n\nLysine:\n\nMay help with sleep. Not much benefit.\n\n4/10\n\nM:\n\nMagnesium (Threonate) : helped with sleep.\n\n7/10\n\nP:\n\nProgesterone: helps me sleep, mellows me out, makes me hungry. I have used 64mg a day at max. No anti androgenic effects. Probably the second most noticeable effects out of any hormone I tried\n\n10/10\n\nPregnelelone: I always took this mixed with DHEA. So please refer to the DHEA review, I think some of the effects were from the preg.\n\nPhenyalynine: Again one of those dopaminic substances that I didn’t notice its effect until I stopped it. Felt a  drop in motivation when stopping using it.\n\n6.5/10\n\nT:\n\nTaurine: I think it’s dopaminergic. Might be improving metabolism. I think it’s very protective in harsh environments, where I think a lot of the research shows its benefits.\n\n6.5/10\n\nTheanine: helps with sleep \n\n7/10\n\nThyroid (T3): gets me very warm. Great mood booster. Really makes me hungry. Effects very obvious.\n\n10/10",

I would say in high doses (200mcg topically applied), it is like a very small microdose of LSD, but without the serotonin elements. The serotonin side of LSD, is what makes LSD recreationally used and create the trip.\n\nBut even though it is almost a small microdose of modified LSD, it's effects compare nothing to recreational drugs, a very small dose of weed, I think would affect you even more.\n\nThe best way to describe it, is that it amplifies your surroundings. I swear, it made me the HAPPIEST I have ever felt - I was listening to some great music, drinking a coke, and just walking around a random old run down car park. It wasn't even that great of a moment, I have obviously had much more exciting experiences in my life, but the dopamine agonism, just made my enjoyment artificially high. I should say, that not all the time it was this potent, but it's amplifying effects were always present.\n\nLisuride has been shown to reverse hypogonadism, as it reduces prolactin, which takes off the breaks of the testosterone production signals in your brain, increasing the amount of testosterone you produce in your gonads. This combined with the dopaminergic effects described, basically made my libido incredibly high. If you have done NoFap, I would describe the libido similar to that. It increased my assertiveness as well, I take more risks, when talking to females, etc.",

Please remove the widget, restart your device, and re-add it.**\n\n**Version 5.7.0**\n\nHappy Holidays from the Athlytic Team (Jaclyn and Gary)! \n\n📱 **iPhone Updates:** \n\n🚺  For our female users, Health coaching on the Today tab will relate your vitals to the current phase of your cycle if you track menstruation with Apple Health or an app that writes the data to Apple Health. Great job Jaclyn on building out and beta testing this important feature! \n\n📓 New Tags for the Journal:  Acid Reflux, Apigenin, Antihistamines, Bulking, Cutting, Diet, Digestive Issues, Daylight Eating, Hot Tub, and Sauna. (Hot Tub and Sauna will eventually replace the current Hot Tub Or Sauna Tag which just confused people...it will be removed at some point). \n\n📈 Most recent, average, and chart selection (e.g. tap on the chart to see a given day's value) have been added to the Average Sleep Stress, Average Waking Stress, Steps, Body Weight, and Daily Average Battery Charge Charts. \n\n30 and 60 day Recovery, Exertion, Recovery vs. Exertion,  and Restorative Sleep Charts now also support chart selection as well. \n\nThe Sleep Stages chart has had a slight design refresh, and this should also help users who's sleep trackers save many more Sleep Stage samples like Oura Ring users. \n\nCleaned up the xAxis times formatting on the sleeping HRV, RHR, Respiratory Rate, Blood Oxygen, and Wrist Temp (found when you tap on Sleep Quality and scroll to the bottom). \n\nFixed an issue where the Average Waking Stress chart might not properly exclude periods of workouts and walking. \n\n🔋 Added the ability to pull to refresh data to the Stress and Battery screens on iPhone. \n\n⌚ **Watch Updates:**\n\n📈 Restorative Sleep has been added to the watch app, and so has the Sleep Stage chart. \n\nAdded your latest Stress value and time above the Stress Chart on the watch app (like Battery). \n\n🔽 On the watch app, added a chevron below Battery on the home screen so users know that you can swipe down to start a workout, see past workouts, and settings. (This was based on some feedback users didn't know they could swipe down to start a workout etc.) \n\n🕧 Fixed an issue where if you are logging a workout using the Athlytic Apple Watch App, using the Always On display feature would only update once per minute, it should now update every second. \n\nThanks! \n\nGary\n\n[Phase 1 of the Cycle Feature - Vitals synced to your current menstrual phase](https://preview.redd.it/mcomnxnd697e1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=e50667059827bcd41f3605154e03398e4c6882f1)\n\n  \n",

Apigenin, Luteolin, Kaempferol, Myricetin, Quercetin, Fisetin, Rhamnazin, Catechins, Hesperidin, Naringin, Naringenin, Cyanidin, Pelargonidin, Delphinidin. But basically they're the things you get from eating a variety of fruits and vegetables with anti-cancer potential and other possible health effects. These fall beyond the 1950s/cereal box view of eating/nutritional guidance that soylent reflects.\n\nI don't know anything about nutrition on either a holistic or biochemical level, and one of the appeals of Soylent for me was that I could just drink something when I'm hungry and know that I'm getting the nutrients I need to be healthy without having to research and worry about diet plans or food preparation techniques. \n\nLooking up some of these chemicals just seems to reinforce how intimidating and overwhelming nutritional science really is, as the list of what the human body needs to function optimally is long and complicated and potentially impossible to include in a single food source. Throw in the fact that there are tons of different, conflicting opinions about what even constitutes a healthy diet, and it seems like there's just too much information to process.\n\nI never intended to go 100% Soylent because I like food in social situations, but I am concerned that even at 75% Soylent I might be missing out on important chemicals without even realizing it. What foods do you like to augment your Soylent diet with for nutritional completeness? Is there anything that you think Soylent 1.5 is missing, from the above list or otherwise? Is the above criticism exaggerated or even valid?",

Also, trazodone is safer long term than Seroquel for memory impairment.\n\nI'm not a doctor of course, I said to my psychiatrist which supplements/nootropics I take on daily basis like NAC, magnesium, tryptophan etc and said it's fine, he's gonna research better but I already mentioned that before and he said that doesn't interfere with my therapy.\n\nAlso, this is a personal experience, doesn't mean you react the same way I did, for individual metabolism, brand taken etc...

I just read a lot and have saved info as I find it and this shouldn't be taken as a suggestion to go out and buy any particular thing.\n\nThe purpose of this is two-fold, firstly that it may trigger some new thinking in a medically qualified person to take further, and secondly it is intended to discuss theoretically how to help reduce the risk of serious outcomes in the event of infections and possibly shift the odds in favour of a non lethal resolution, and used as a prophylactic would have low risk of side-effects, be generally safe and may also be generally beneficial to the preexisting conditions identified as risk factors for mortality (so not a complete waste of time even if it doesn't work). It's important to note that current front-line antivirals can often have significant toxicity including cause organ failure, one of the nasty outcomes of COVID-19. So as a prophylactic aid treatments must be safer than the disease by a very large margin.\n\nBecause of the low likelihood these treatments might work significantly, they should at least be useful in the sense of being comparatively safe, and beneficial to health in general.\n\nBecause of the low death rate and the demographics of deaths, COVID-19 appears to be most dangerous when combined with prior poor health at the time of infection, and so that is where the greatest potential probably lies in finding a treatment.\n\nTreatments may be divided into three avenues.\n\n1 - those that are antiviral, by blocking virus entry or replication. These in turn may work best taken during or prior to infection, or both.\n\n2 - those that reduce the disease and injury associated with the infection, of excess and poorly targeted immune response and inflammation. In mice at least, inhibiting NF-kB increases survival against SARS coronavirus [https://jvi.asm.org/content/88/2/913](https://jvi.asm.org/content/88/2/913)\n\n3 - those that are aimed at enhancing immune health and preventing exhaustion and loss of key antiviral defences and this presumably would lower both viral load and the risk of other infections and sepsis, which we assume along with 2, are the primary causes of injury and death. In addition, treatments that reduce the bacterial and viral load prior to infection would reduce the risk of sepsis and infection complications, and make it potentially easier to mount an efficient, targeted immune response to the infection, which may mean it never develops. Certain cells are depleted in COVID-19 infection, such as lymphocytes. Substances such as selenium may increase these cell counts during infection in other viral diseases, and improve antibody production in diabetics, another COVID-19 risk group. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381341/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381341/), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3762230/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3762230/)\n\nWe might assume that impaired antibody responses are a factor here, especially as some people resolve the infection almost without symptoms, and for whom the infection is simply a live vaccine, and also in general many pathogens already present in the human body produce 'super-antigens', substances that cause antibody production, but cause inaccurate antibodies to be made, which causes collateral damage. As a result of prolonged collateral damage, the immune system normally goes into 'anergy' and tolerance, which are risk factors in the death rate due to measles, especially in malnourished people. A person already suffering from multiple infections of viral, fungal and bacterial super-antigen producers would be in a bad place to mount efficient humoral responses. So, because of immune stresses like this, taking compounds that are broad spectrum antimicrobials may be of help either prior to or during an infection.\n\n4 - Those that may generally improve health and protect against the preexisting conditions that seem to be large risk factors in the death rate of COVID-19, such as potentially reducing liver injury via oxidative stress, metabolic impairments in type 2 diabetes etc. These factors also can increase translation and presumably quantity of the ACE2 protein that the virus uses to gain entry, and this is theoretically a risk factor. Inflammation can increase this, and it therefore a good time to consider giving up bad habits like smoking and excessive drinking, and increase the intake of apples, nuts and berries and lower your blood glucose.\n\nViruses generally target mitochondria as part of their strategy to establish themselves in cells, because mitochondria are critical parts of the intracellular defence against viruses, conducting virtually every antiviral pathway in the cell, and just about every means of degrading intracellular material and parasites are directly controlled by mitochondria. Human coronaviruses are known to target mitochondria. In addition, this targeting may play an important role in the loss of certain immune cells in this infection, which we presume means higher viral load and worse outcome.\n\nIt is noteworthy that conditions associated with abnormal Redox status, oxidative stress, energy impairment, like diabetes, are unsurprisingly risk factors for death and injury from this virus.\n\nSome background on the early clinical aspects of the infection - [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ewxsfj/coronavirus\\_notes\\_immunal\\_deficiency\\_theoretical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ewxsfj/coronavirus_notes_immunal_deficiency_theoretical/)\n\nThe general ideas I have are not novel, and are even being trialed -\n\n[https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-virus-new-antivirus-spray-used-in-shanghai-emergency-wards](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-virus-new-antivirus-spray-used-in-shanghai-emergency-wards)\n\nThe new spray contains two active ingredients, Prof Xu said. One restrains the duplication of the virus and the other controls the process of the virus causing illness in people. **The virus made people sick by causing inflammation**, he explained. The active ingredients can suppress the inflammation and repair the respiratory tract mucosa.\n\nHere is an interesting paper I found recently which explores natural compounds as treatments for COVID-19 [https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202001.0358/v1](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202001.0358/v1)\n\nSo, with this in mind, here is what I have found of potential interest; Many have shown broad antiviral properties. They show antiviral effects in a variety of species and across a spectrum of viruses, and a few also against coronaviruses. However an agent that works against one coronavirus does not necessarily affect another variety of coronavirus. In general I assume that a compound that has a broad antiviral effect against dissimilar viruses, but including similar viruses to coronaviruses, are of more interest, and especially if they showed effect against at least one coronovirus.\n\nSelenium\n\nSelenium has broad antiviral properties, and other health benefits (when not taken excessively), see this earlier post [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/f2hyun/selenium\\_infectious\\_viral\\_disease\\_and\\_pneumonia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/f2hyun/selenium_infectious_viral_disease_and_pneumonia/)\n\nIn addition, organic selenium compounds in fish like sardines are ACE inhibitors, although this may not include ACE2, which is the key one. It is not known if ACE inhibitors are effective against COVID-19, but it has been proposed ([https://f1000research.com/articles/9-72](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-72)). The type of inhibition we might want is probably in the translation aspect which reduces the quantity of ACE on cell membranes, which is how COVID gets in. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12562-019-01321-3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12562-019-01321-3) . On the other hand, ACE2, in contrast to ACE, can be anti-inflammatory and so inhibiting it may not be a good idea.\n\nPolyphenols, Terpenoids, Lignans, Lectins\n\nBetulinic Acid (mainly from birch bark) and lignin [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17663539](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17663539)\n\n*The selective index values (SI = CC50/EC50) of the most potent compounds 1, 5, 6, 8, 14, and 16 were 58, >510, 111, 193, 180, and >667, respectively.

The decrease in nosocomial infections in patients receiving omega-3 fatty acid was mainly due to reduced incidence of pneumonia (omega-3 fatty acid, 4/32, 12.5% vs control, 11/31, 35.48%, respectively). \n\n.....In contrast to previous reports[20], there was no difference in mortality between two groups during hospital stay and the 6-month follow up. However, the short period of follow up in this study may be the culprit. In the study, we find that the length of hospital stay was shorter in the omega-3 fatty acid group than that of the control group, which is due to the reduction of infection, especially the reduction of pneumonia and increased rate of recovery of liver function.\n\nOmega 3 also inactivates enveloped viruses. There are components of breast milk that, after storage, are highly active against a wide range of enveloped viruses, which include long chain, medium and short chain fatty acids.\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/83/2/390/4650073\n\nThe recent study in the Journal by Merchant et al (1) that showed that higher intakes of α-linolenic and cis-linoleic acids (ALA and LA, respectively) and fish may reduce the risk pneumonia is interesting but not surprising. Previously, I proposed that long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), such as γ-linolenic acid (GLA), dihomo-GLA (DGLA), arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may behave as endogenous antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and immunostimulating agents (2).\n\nBut there is also indication that Omega 3 PUFA can increase the risk of colds, by immuno-suppresion, which may be positive in the event of infection but rather a problem in terms of acquiring one. To guard against this a maintanence dose of O3 is probably preferable to starting on large doses.\n\nLactoferrin, bth anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antiviral, can be taken orally or inhaled.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X14002864\n\nHelps clear bacteria from lungs https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27628783\n\nMay help with airway inflammation https://www.rtmagazine.com/disorders-diseases/chronic-pulmonary-disorders/asthma/lactoferrin-research-holds-promise-for-asthma-treatment/\n\nhttps://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1164/ajrccm.156.2.9607012",

Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed four large-scale datasets of normal lung tissue to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression. No significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression were found between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in smoker samples compared to non-smoker samples. This indicates the smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and thus smoking history should be considered in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.",

There is indication that the virus does get 'triggered' to replicate more via inflammatory pathways such as NF-kB.\n\nIt appears there is a synergy between the stress caused by the virus and the viral load, and via that feedback, the injury that is more life threatening results.\n\nSome viruses are effectively inhibited by raising glutathione. and others are stimulated and made worse by raising glutathione. Since glutathione is upstream of these processes and is easy to nutritionally modulate via cheap, widely available substances with excellent safety profiles, then it would be particularly good news if this was a virus that was inhibited by raising glutathione.\n\nAs yet I cannot find any info on this.\n\nHowever, I have found studies that indicate that the injury caused by resiratory infections like SARS can be effectively reduced by substances including Lipoic Acid and Carnosine, which tend to raise glutathione but also some other enzymatic antioxidants in the body.

If COVID19 coronavirus is inhibited by glutathione it will make an even strong case for N Acetyl Cysteine, Lipoic Acid, and Carnosine;\n\nGlutathione has been reported to block replication of HIV, HSV-1, and influenza virus, whereas cells treated with BSO exhibit increased replication of Sendai virus. Pre-treatment of HeLa cell monolayers with BSO inhibited replication of CVB3, CVB4, and HRV14 with viral titers reduced by approximately 6, 5, and 3 log10, respectively. The addition of glutathione ethyl ester, but not dithiothreitol or 2-mercaptoethanol, to the culture medium reversed the inhibitory effect of BSO. Viral RNA and protein synthesis were not inhibited by BSO treatment. Fractionation of lysates from CVB3-infected BSO-treated cells on cesium chloride and sucrose gradients revealed that empty capsids but not mature virions were being produced. The levels of the 5S and 14S assembly intermediates, however, were not affected by BSO treatment. These results demonstrate that glutathione is important for production of mature infectious picornavirus virions.\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206004077](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206004077)\n\nGrowing evidence indicates that viral replication is regulated by the redox state of the host cell. We demonstrate that cells of different origins display differential permissivity for influenza A virus replication, depending on their intracellular redox power as reflected by Bcl-2 expression and glutathione (GSH) content. Bcl-2 expressing cells were found to have higher intracellular levels of GSH and to produce lower amounts of virus than Bcl-2 negative cells. Two different steps in the virus life-cycle were involved in Bcl-2/GSH mediated viral inhibition: 1) expression of late viral proteins (in particular hemagglutinin and matrix); and 2) nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). Buthionine-sulfoximine-induced inhibition of GSH synthesis in Bcl-2 expressing cells caused an increase in the expression of late viral proteins but did not restore vRNP export to the cytoplasm. Collectively, our findings show that both Bcl-2 expression and GSH content contribute to the host cell's ability to down-regulate influenza virus replication, although their effects are exerted at different stages of the viral life-cycle. In certain cell populations, this form of down-regulation might conceivably favor the establishment of persistent viral infection.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12594179](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12594179)\n\nAn interaction between glutathione and the capsid is required for the morphogenesis of C-cluster enteroviruses.\n\n\".... the aim of our study was to determine the role of GSH in the growth of two C-cluster enteroviruses, poliovirus type 1 (PV1) and coxsackievirus A20 (CAV20). Our results show that the growth of both PV1 and CAV20 is strongly inhibited by BSO and can be partially reversed by the addition of GSH\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722315?dopt=Abstract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722315?dopt=Abstract)\n\nBinding of glutathione to enterovirus capsids is essential for virion morphogenesis.\n\n\"... We report the discovery of TP219 as a novel inhibitor of the replication of several enteroviruses, including coxsackievirus and poliovirus. We show that TP219 binds directly glutathione (GSH), thereby rapidly depleting intracellular GSH levels and that this interferes with virus morphogenesis without affecting viral RNA replication. The inhibitory effect on assembly was shown not to depend on an altered reducing environment. Using TP219, we show that GSH is an essential stabilizing cofactor during the transition of protomeric particles into pentameric particles \"\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722756?dopt=Abstract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722756?dopt=Abstract)",

    "body": "I took 2.5g creatine per day for about 6 months, took a couple months of break and took it again for 3 months. In addition to that, I take Vit D3, a multivitamin, fish oil, and turmeric daily and occasionally ashwaghanda and L-theanine for days that I work. I noticed with creatine my previously 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep became slightly fragmented. I began noticing in the first 6 months, a few months into taking creatine, that my sleep pattern became 6 hours then 1.5 hours with little trouble falling asleep again for the extra 1.5. I eventually stopped taking creatine thinking I felt that my sleep depth was decreased. I subjectively felt less rested even though I was still totalling 7.5 hours roughly per night.\n\nThe reason I was taking creatine is because I love working out and train 3-4 days a week. Over time, the performance and mass gains were noticeable. I didn't really want to stop but I was also concerned that perhaps creatine was causing lighter sleep. I only had looked into the fact that in lab studies rats slept more lightly. I wasn't aware of the small amount of discussions that some people were already having on reddit about creatine and insomnia, nor the numerous posts out there about methylation, creatine and the imbalances that can result from that.\n\nAfter a couple months off creatine, I restarted it again at 2.5g per day. My sleep actually hadn't improved while being off it. I was still getting 6 hours + 1.5 hours and my sleep didn't feel deep so I figured why the heck not.\n\nI took creatine again for 3 months. My sleep mostly remained the same. However, once I stopped creatine at the end of month 3, progressively over the next 4 weeks, my sleep linearly decreased from that 6+1.5 to then 6 a week later, then 4-5 hours, then 3, then I had some nights where I didn't sleep at all. This period of 0-3 hours lasted a couple weeks. Strangely enough, I didn't feel drowsy during the day. I felt awake but fatigued but could perform my tasks at work without the threat of falling asleep.\n\nI'm not normally an anxious person but this period of 1.5 months of worsening insomnia also started making me extremely stressed. I started having stress urinary incontinence, worsening hemorrhoids, constant blepharospasms and tossed and turned all night. I did notice after about 1.5 months of worsening sleep (7.5 to then 0-3) my sleep slightly improved and I began to get slightly longer total sleep times of 3 to 4.5 hours.\n\nBut then I went to see a sleep specialist who put me on 7.5mg mirtazapine for 3 weeks. This helped and was both a blessing and a curse. It knocked me out for 6-7 hours a night. I then stopped it and once again experienced a period of sleeplessness for about 10-12 days of only 3-4 hours a night on average. This was perhaps mirtazapine discontinuation syndrome which supposedly lasts a few days to a couple weeks. I did notice that unlike before I actually felt slightly drowsier during the day. I sensed something was rebalancing in my body hormonally.\n\nI eventually stumbled across methylation discussions and Chris Masterjohn's suggestion of taking glycine to buffer methylation. I started taking 2g of glycine twice daily and also Vit A in the mornings about two weeks ago. Ever since I started doing this, I noticed significant improvements in sleep quality over time. I started sleeping DEEPLY to the point where I could barely open my eyes some mornings. My body was finally resting again. My sleep is still fragmented but instead of waking up after 3 hours. I usually wake up after 4.5 and then fall back asleep quickly for another 3. I'm back to totalling 7-8 hours per night. I'll eventually stop the glycine and Vit A but I'll give it another couple weeks and see if I maintain normal sleep after discontinuing.\n\nMy opinion though is that creatine is what caused my body to be thrown into this crazy insidious insomnia issue and it may have something to do with COMT, methylation, and SAMe. Who knows since I get that there are always confounding variables. I just wanted to share since this has been a really devastating couple months for me but I'm finally seeing the light.\n\nUpdate: Since making this post well more than a month ago, I wanted to give an update. My sleep has relatively linearly improved from sleeping that 4.5 + 3. My patterns have some fluctuations like 4.5 hours one night or 7 on another. Typically I'll sleep for about 4.5 to 6 hours and then fall back asleep for another hour and a half or 3 for totals of about 7. My sleep also feels much deeper and restorative. Not long after this post, I also discontinued all sleep supplements. I don't take Ashwaghanda, L-Theanine, Magnesium, Glycine, Myo Inositol, GABA or Apigenin anymore. I didn't notice any difference in sleep depth or duration after discontinuing so those supplements didn't seem to have much of an effect. Nowadays, I just take Fish Oil, Multivitamin, Turmeric, probiotic and Vit D in the mornings.\n\nThis has been a months long saga. Perhaps 6 months at this point but so glad that things have worked out better for me over time. It was really tough to imagine living with chronic insomnia.",

I would take out everything and add everything back in one at a time to see what is causing the issue. Your multivitamin may also have something in it causing the sleep issue or it could be a combination of what you are taking including the Creatine. The fact that it continued after you stopped the Creatine makes me thing it is something else possibly. Overall I would narrow it down but taking everything away and then adding them back one at a time. Hope this helps somehow. Best of luck. Sleep issues are the worst.",

    "body": "I’ve struggled with sleep as long as I can remember and spent more time than I can admit trying to fix my sleep - listened to every podcast I could find (Huberman, Matthew Walker, etc), read books, even tested random advice from blogs & reddit lol. Sleep messes with everything you do and unless you have it sorted, youll never really feel like youre in control.\n\nNow I'm at a place where I can fix my sleep whenever I want and I want to share all my learnings with you guys here. Not perfect ofcourse but my sleep is 10x better, I wake up fresher, and no longer feel like I need to drag myself through the day. Here's everything that helped me -\n\n**1. Mornings are where the fix begins**\n\n* Get bright light in your eyes within 30 minutes of waking up. That means balcony, terrace, or even just sitting by a window without sunglasses or cap. This one habit resets your internal clock.\n* Delay chai or coffee for 90–120 minutes after waking. Sounds wrong, I know. But try it. It helps avoid the dreaded afternoon crash and keeps your energy more stable.\n* Eat a real breakfast. Could be eggs, poha, oats, paratha with curd – doesn’t matter. Just don’t skip it. Eating early in the day helps set your circadian rhythm.\n* Move your body a bit. Doesn’t need to be a workout. A walk, skipping, Surya Namaskar – anything that gets your body temperature up helps kickstart alertness.\n\n**2. Afternoon = maintain, don’t ruin**\n\n* Stop caffeine by 3 PM max. Your 5 PM chai is probably the reason you can’t fall asleep till 1 AM.\n* Avoid naps. If you’re tired, search “Yoga Nidra” or “NSDR” on YouTube. These 10–20 minute sessions help reset your brain without screwing up night sleep.\n* Get some sunlight again before sunset. Just 5–10 minutes. Evening light helps your body prepare for the transition into night.\n\n**3. Evening is where the real game is**\n\n* Eat dinner at least 3–4 hours before sleeping. Keep it lighter if possible. Add some carbs (roti, rice) – it actually helps you sleep better.\n* Stop drinking water 1 hour before bed. Avoids midnight bathroom trips.\n* Dim your lights after 8 PM. Overhead tube lights trick your brain into thinking it’s still daytime. Use warm lamps or night bulbs if possible.\n* Avoid screens and stimulation 45 minutes before sleep. No Instagram loops, Netflix binging, or heavy convos. Keep your brain calm.\n* Build a wind-down routine. Mine includes a warm shower, a bit of journaling, chamomile tea, and maybe a sleep story or meditation. Whatever relaxes you, do that consistently.\n\n**4. Bedroom setup that made a difference**\n\n* Keep the room cool. Fan or AC doesn’t matter — just make sure it’s not hot and stuffy.\n* Stick one hand or foot out of the blanket — helps your body cool itself naturally.\n* If noise is a problem, try earplugs or white noise. It really does help if you’re in a loud area.\n* Keep the bed for sleeping only. Don’t use it for work, scrolling, or eating. Your brain starts to associate the bed with alertness if you do.\n\n**5. What to do if your brain won’t shut up at night**\n\n* Journaling helps. Just write down what’s on your mind.\n* Chamomile tea, ashwagandha, or magnesium supplements (especially biglycinate) can calm the nervous system.\n* Breathing exercises (like 4-7-8) or guided meditations (use apps like Insight Timer) help slow things down.\n* Yoga Nidra or NSDR — amazing for calming down a racing mind.\n\n**6. Extra stuff that helped me**\n\n* Don’t miss your “sleepy window.” When you feel naturally drowsy, go to bed. Don’t push through it or you’ll be weirdly wide awake again.\n* Set an alarm to start your sleep routine, not just for waking up. It’s easy to lose track at night.\n* Sleep and wake up around the same time every day — even weekends. Otherwise, your body’s internal clock keeps resetting and you never stabilize.\n* The 4 biggest signals for your sleep-wake cycle: light, movement, meals, and social interaction (especially early in the day). Anchor those and your body will follow.\n\n**7. Supplements I tried (occasionally, not daily)**\n\n* Magnesium (biglycinate or threonate)\n* Chamomile tea or apigenin\n* Ashwagandha\n* Melatonin (only very occasionally — low dose)\n* Myo-inositol + GABA + glycine (if I kept waking up in the middle of the night)\n\nHappy to answer if you have any questions. I've also created an entire 30 minute video on this but if I share it here it will be removed for self-promotion lol so I just created this short summary of the pointers the video explains in detail. If mods allow I can share the video too but hopefully this helps someone :)\n\nEdit: I remember I created a short cheatsheet on Notion if you guys find it useful - [https://wary-justice-a2f.notion.site/Rajat-s-Sleep-Hacking-Cheat-Sheet-16915f6ff96b801e9a1acf1599847229?pvs=74](https://wary-justice-a2f.notion.site/Rajat-s-Sleep-Hacking-Cheat-Sheet-16915f6ff96b801e9a1acf1599847229?pvs=74)",

    "body": "Huberman emphasizes many times how important it is, for sleep quality, to watch the sunrise and sunset.  Indeed this is helpful.  However he has another tip which is even more important for sleep (for me at least) even though he doesn't discuss it in the context of sleep (he should!) and that is lateral eye scanning, derived from the EMDR therapy developed by Dr. Francine Shapiro, also from Stanford.\n\nWatching (from outside, not through windows and not through sunglasses) the sunrise and sunset AND doing lateral eye scanning in bed (while your eyes are shut and you're lying in bed, look towards your left earlobe and then towards your right earlobe and then gradually back and forth like that a few times then give yourself a chance to fall asleep and if you're still awake later then repeat - you may have to repeat this hundreds of times) finally resolved my crippling insomnia. Sleep hygiene is still important too, so avoid naps, minimize light exposure in the later hours and also do relaxing wind-down things in the later hours, and go to bed at night when you feel sleepy.\n\nAfter 52 months straight of horrific insomnia, having seen 18 doctors several of whom were sleep specialists and having taking a mountain of various drugs/herbs/supplements, where I would typically have multiple (often consecutive) nights each week with zero seconds of sleep and on the other nights when I did sleep it'd average around 2 hrs/night, I finally found a solution. And amazingly it did not involve any drugs, supplements or herbs.\n\nIt all started three months ago after listening to Andrew Huberman's podcasts about sleep where he emphasizes again and again how important it is to watch the sunrise and sunset. He says not to harm your eyes by looking into the sun but that you do want to look in that general direction up towards the well-lit morning sky to get a lot of those early morning photons. He says it sets up a chemical countdown that will make you sleepy \\~12 hours later. He also says to watch the sunset as it will counteract some of the negative effects of blue light from your TV/computer/phone. I started doing this and I noticed that my sleep average improved by about an hour/night. However I was still having many \"zero\" nights where I didn't sleep at all and my sleep average was around 3.5 hrs/night which is still unhealthy. Then one night at 2:30am in the morning it occurred to me that perhaps another thing that Huberman talks about - not in the context of sleep but rather in the context of treating anxiety and PTSD - may be of help, which is lateral eye scanning. He explained how Dr. Francine Shapiro discovered that lateral eye scanning suppresses the activity of the amygdala (the primitive part of our brain responsible for fight-and-flight response) and that it also activates the calming parasympathetic nervous system. So while I was lying there thinking about that I considered how it was likely that anxiety was a major component of my insomnia and that it was likely acting in a negative-reinforcement loop (anxiety causing insomnia causing more anxiety about sleep etc.) and so I thought why not give the lateral eye scanning a try and so with my eyes closed I began to look towards my left ear lobe and then back towards my right ear lobe (gradually panning) and did this a few times and then stopped and gave my body a chance to fall asleep for a while and if I was still awake I'd repeat this. This technique alone increased my sleep average by about 2 hours so I now get around 5.5 hrs/night which is sufficient for me to feel just fine, but more importantly I don't have any more \"zero\" nights at all. None. It has completely pulled me out of that state. It's been over a month now (I waited to be sure it was definitely working consistently) that this has been working and I'm still amazed that every morning I feel fine even if the prior night involved many dozens of wakeful periods where I did the lateral eye scanning.\n\nAs to the background of the lateral eye scanning, my understanding is that the theory behind how it is believed to operate is that when we are walking forward we are unconsciously doing this back-and-forth lateral eye scanning and our brain takes this as a signal that we're okay and safe, because when we're in danger we're either stopped or running and in either of those danger scenarios we're not casually scanning back and forth. So apparently the research has been done to understand exactly what is happening here and it was discovered that this lateral eye scanning calms down the amygdala. So it was leveraged as a critical component of a therapeutic technique invented to take advantage of this, called EMDR, used to treat anxiety and PTSD.\n\nAlso it occurred to me to mention that I did try some of the other things Huberman suggests for sleep such as Magnesium L-Threonate and Apigenin but they didn't make any noticeable difference to my profound insomna.  I'm quite pleased by the fact that the things that have made the difference for me are free and don't involve any drugs/supplements/herbs.\n\nUpdate: I should have also mentioned that I typically go to bed right after watching the sunset because that activity naturally makes me start to yawn and feel sleepy and Huberman advises that you should go to bed when you feel sleepy.",

        "body": "I too started suffering profound and miserable insomnia about 54 months ago, January of 2021.my sorry is very much like yours - some nights with zero sleep, others with 3 or so hours. This persistent despite many doctors visits, attempts at sleeping pills, counselling you name it. Over time and through countless hours of my own research I also came to accept that this was brought on by persistent exposure to extreme stress and that my sympathetic nervous system had gone haywire. Extreme afternoon fatigue, jaw pain, night sweats, a drum heartbeat in my left ear, increased anxiety, sound sensitivity, difficulty regulating temperature - all classic symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and specific anxiety about sleep. I'm not 100 percent the way I was before (could sleep anywhere, anytime) and I don't know if I'll ever be, but I'm close. I was working long hours, I dragged a business kicking and screaming through the pandemic, and I was still working out 5-6 days per week intensly when this all started.\n\nSome of the things that helped me were:\n\n-recognizing that anxiety was specifically a factor and watching for signs and symptoms.\n-accepting I would have good and bad nights and specifically not having negative emotional reactions to bad ones. Just embracing them as normal which took the pressure the next night.\n-setting a strict two yawns after 9 PM means immediately go to bed policy. I always had the best chance if feeling fatigued at the moment. \n-if not asleep in 30 minutes, get up and try again later\n-Not doing work after 8 PM. No reading email. Avoiding cognitive load and emotional labour.\n-Box breathing paired with a relaxed jaw.\n-Ear plugs to screen out minor annoyances.\n-taking more light workout or rest days.\n-spending more time on things I enjoy for pleasure.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the most significant improvement came when I got my diet in check and started counting macros. I had been significantly under eating overall calories for a long time. Once I started fueling properly again the bad nights started getting further and further apart until I would have two bad nights every 4-5 weeks. This is about my pattern now, and I can usually trace any bad nights to a lapse in my hygiene patterns, especially around food.\n\nCortisol is a hell of a drug.",

    "body": "i shared this with the menopause community earlier today and someone suggested cross-posting here\n\nTLDR: glycine (the \"glycinate\" part of magnesium glycinate) can raise estrogen levels in animals and can stimulate the growth of hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells in-vitro almost as well as estrogen. wanted to share for those like myself who can't be exposed to additional estrogen\n\ni have a history of ER+/PR+ DCIS. i struggle immensely with perimenopausal insomnia and tried magnesium glycinate, which helped a lot\n\nunfortunately shortly after i started taking it, i experienced a significant endometriosis flare, which i hadn't had since giving up HRT when i was first diagnosed almost a year ago. that made me wonder if the magnesium glycinate could have hormonal effects \n\ni found some research documenting that glycine adminstration raises serum estrogen levels in animals: https://karger.com/goi/article-abstract/12/4/187/149604/Effects-of-Glycine-on-Serum-Gonadotropins-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext\n\nand that glycine stimulates the growth of estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cells in vitro almost as powerfully as estradiol: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Glycine-increased-the-proliferation-of-MCF-7-cell-a-MCF-7-cells-were-treated-with_fig2_283753911\n\njust wanted to pass along in case it's relevant for anyone else who can't have estrogen and may be taking glycinate\n\n**edit: digging into some limitations / notes on the studies:** a commenter describing themselves as a scientist has written that the rat study \"measures luteinizing hormone in the hypothalamus after injection with a lot of glycine.\" that is a somewhat misleading / incomplete statement: the study specifically measured estradiol (E2) in addition to LH, and found a significant increase: \"200 mg of glycine significantly elevated serum LH levels at 20 and 50 min and serum E2 levels at 50 and 80 min after intraperitoneal injection\"\n\nthe same commenter also wrote that the breast cancer cells in the in-vitro study were \"derived from bone and placenta.\" i wasn't able to find any additional information on this claim, and the commenter did not respond when i asked for more detail. here is some additional context on the cell line used in the study:\n\n>MCF-7 is a commonly used breast cancer cell line, that has been propagated for many years by multiple groups (7). It proves to be a suitable model cell line for breast cancer investigations worldwide, including those regarding anticancer drugs (8). With time, MCF-7 has produced more data of practical knowledge for patient care than any other breast cancer cell line (4)\n\nhttps://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/35/6/3147\n\n>MCF-7 cells have the following characteristics: Primary tumor (invasive breast ductal carcinoma)\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCF-7\n\nfinally the commenter also mentioned that the 10ug/ml dose in that study seemed high. it's worth noting that the study also tested 0.1ug/mL (a 100-fold dilution of the higher concentration) and saw very similar results \n\nobviously both of the studies i have linked above are preliminary rather than conclusive, and carry all the inherent limitations of animal and in-vitro investigations. i would not fault anyone for examining them and deciding they are no big deal. personally i would always rather have more information than less, and i figured there might be others who might want to be aware and take this data into account in their own decision making. i've decided i no longer feel comfortable with this supplement and support everyone deciding what is best for their individual situation!\n\n**some other topics that came up in the comments:**\n\n* **safety of other forms of magnesium:** nothing i've found indicates risks with magnesium itself -- just the glycine from the glycinate form. i haven't come across any potential issues with magnesium citrate or magnesium oxide (but unfortunately neither of those helps sleep for me -- the glycine itself seems to have been the effective part, which is not surprising since it's a well-documented sleep aid). magnesium threonate may be more complicated, as an animal study suggests threonine intake may affect glycine levels in tissue-dependent ways https://www.nature.com/articles/pr1998580z\n\n* **magnesium glycinate is not listed as a contraindication for breast cancer patients in MSK's All About Herbs database:** breast cancer is not listed under the magnesium contraindications: https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/magnesium but i'll note that that list addresses magnesium in general rather than specific formulations. additionally, the studies i linked were examining glycine rather than the magnesium glycinate salt, so unless the database makers have specifically searched for glycine safety, i'm not sure if they would have come across this data. i haven't found any evidence of safety of magnesium glycinate specifically in breast cancer populations -- if anyone else does, i would appreciate you sharing here! there is some evidence that glycine in general may be problematic in the context of cancer (see for example https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb2542 and https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22056 )\n\n* **many people's oncologists have OK'd magnesium glycinate:** yep! mine has too (though i haven't yet shown her these studies. but i've already decided to stop taking it so at this point it's moot). i would never contradict anyone's doc, but at the same time, i don't think it's reasonable to expect that every doctor has searched exhaustively for every possible concern relating to every supplement and reviewed every relevant study. again, i am not telling anyone what to do, just sharing an FYI of what i've found so you can decide for yourself. (my feelings were, if someone had found something small and possibly relevant like this about a supplement i was taking, i would want them to let me know. thus this post!)\n\n* **someone asks about the safety of apigenin:** i had been looking into this recently as well but found a few studies that gave me pause in the context of hormone-receptor positive cancers. obviously again this is limited evidence but personally left me uncomfortable with the risk:\n\n>We found that apigenin can function as both an estrogen and antiestrogen, in a dose-dependent manner. At low concentrations (1μM), apigenin stimulated MCF7 [breast cancer] cell growth but had no effect on the antiestrogen-resistant MCF7 sublines. In contrast, at high concentrations (≥10μM), the drug inhibited growth of MCF7 cells and the antiestrogen-resistant sublines, and the combination of apigenin with either tamoxifen or fulvestrant demonstrated synergistic, growth-inhibitory effects on both antiestrogen-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cells. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2559959/ \n\n> We previously identified apigenin as a potential phytoprogestin, a natural product with a chemical scaffold that interacts with the progesterone receptor... apigenin and progesterone both stimulated proliferation of T47D cells [breast cancer cells that are sensitive to progesterone] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6222006/",

But neither one of the cited studies can  be correlated with humans in any meaningful way. The first one is from 1981 and measures luteinizing hormone in the hypothalamus after injection with a lot of glycine.\nAnd in  the second, they are dumping  10ug/ml which is a LOT of  glycine on to a dish of cells that are not breast tissue. In fact they are cells derived from bone and placenta. Which again is not breast tissue. \n\nYou can probably find a study linking *insert supplement here* to cancer in any model system. It doesn’t mean it translates to human health. \n\n**again please do what you think is right for you**",

FWIW, I also take a morning probiotic and 1000mg shiitake, and other things at night to assist with sleep and inflammation. I can list those if needed.\n\nFor the first week or so I was taking the whole 200mg capsule. Almost immediately I started having vivid dreams, some nightmares, like another user noted. It is tasteless. Going down to half a capsule (emptied onto the tongue directly, then swallowed) seemed to lower the intensity of the dreams. I still have them, but they don't seem to be particularly scary or wild like they were at first. No immediate noticable increase in sleep or sleep quality but over the last week or so I have noticed an improvement in feeling better after I've woken up and having a little more energy, but that could also be the NMN taking effect.\n \nI do want to note that I've been getting more of those warm fuzzy feelings towards coworkers and regular customers, and towards my fiance. I often struggle with a bit of social anxiety (mostly managed these days) and difficulty relating to other people. Over the last few weeks, though, I've had more instances where I feel love and connection with others. This is a new occurance for me in its consistency. I don't know if it's related to taking apigenin. I thought it was noteworthy to mention in this post.\n \nI have not stopped everything else and taken apigenin on it's own. I'm sure that would reveal more about it's singular effects. I'm happy with my current experience and will likely get another bottle after I finish this one.\n \nPlease note my experience is subjective. I'm happy to answer questions if I can. Have you tried it too? Please tell me what you've experienced!",

This flavone analogue binds with the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV and thus can interfere with the entry of the virus into the host cells. However, the related flavone quercetin (83) and its derivatives exhibited modest inhibitory activity against the SARS virus (Figure ​Figure1818).\n\nThey mention luteolin as well, it might be complementary, at least in other semi-related studies: \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5133941/\n\nEMIQ version of quercetin may be superior:\n\n>Rutin and quercetin are poorly absorbed when administered orally, which diminishes their positive health effects [1]. Therefore, several trials have been conducted to increase the bioavailability of these compounds. Since quercetin is nearly insoluble in water (<0.1 g/100 mL at 21 °C), enzymatic glucosyl conjugation has been performed to enhance its water solubility [7, 8]. Enzymatically modified isoquercitrin (EMIQ) (Fig. ​(Fig.1)1) is one of water soluble glucoside derivatives of quercetin. EMIQ is produced from rutin via enzymatic hydrolysis, which removes the rhamnosyl group, followed by treatment of the product with glycosyltransferase in the presence of dextrin to add glucose residues. The bioavailability of EMIQ, which is absorbed as quercetin and metabolized like rutin, is about 17-fold greater than that of quercetin [8]. It is therefore reasonable to expect considerably greater health benefits with EMIQ.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5581924/",

    "body": "Apigenin is a bioactive flavone found in many plants, particularly known for its calming effect upon the nervous system through the common herb chamomile. Although more research is needed into Apigenin, and phytochemical plant compounds as a whole, there have been studies showing that it helps to reduce inflammation in the myelin sheath which is a protective layer surrounding nerves while also aiding in the process of neurogenesis. Covid targets the myelin specifically and causes inflammation in this outer layer. In my personal experience, for whatever reason dependent upon my own genetic makeup, this herbal compound had an immensely positive effect on my neuroinflammatory condition caused by Covid. After trying several herbs and supplements, there was a noticeable improvement after I began using high doses of chamomile extract. I have yet to try the isolated form of Apigenin, but, as with many herbal medicines, the plant matrix of chamomile as a whole seemed to make it bioavailable enough to improve my symptoms after months of struggling to find answers. I’m curious to see what a higher dose of Apigenin would do for me if even a lower dose from a plant source could provide such relief. I am not saying that this will work for everyone because we each are genetically unique, but I thought I would offer some information and insight on this compound for those who may benefit from it as I did. \n\n\n——Apigenin and neuroinflammatory disease: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32607691/\n\n“Neuroinflammation leads to tissue injury causing many of the clinical symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis, an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). While T cells, specifically Th1 and Th17 cells, are the ultimate effectors of this disease, dendritic cells (DCs) mediate T cell polarization, activation, etc. In our previous study, Apigenin, a natural flavonoid, has been shown to reduce EAE disease severity through amelioration of demyelination in the CNS as well as the sequestering of DCs and other myeloid cells in the periphery. Here, we show that Apigenin exerts its effects possibly through shifting DC modulated T cell responses from Th1 and Th17 type towards Treg directed responses evident through the decrease in T-bet, IFN-γ (Th1), IL-17 (Th17) and increase in IL-10, TGF-β and FoxP3 (Treg) expression in cells from both normal human donors and EAE mice. RelB, an NF-κβ pathway protein is central to DC maturation, its antigen presentation capabilities and DC-mediated T cell activation. Apigenin reduced mRNA and protein levels of RelB and also reduced its nuclear translocation. Additionally, siRNA-mediated silencing of RelB further potentiated the RelB-mediated effects of Apigenin thus confirming its role in Apigenin directed regulation of DC biology. These results provide key information about the molecular events controlled by Apigenin in its regulation of DC activity marking its potential as a therapy for neuroinflammatory disease.”\n\n\n——Myelin Sheath, Basic Neurochemistry: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22974-myelin-sheath\n\n“The myelin sheath is a protective membrane that wraps around part of certain nerve cells. Myelin also affects how fast signals travel through those nerve cells. Several diseases and conditions — multiple sclerosis being the most well-known — damage or destroy myelin. Ongoing research is aimed at protecting, repairing or regenerating myelin.” \n\n\n——Apigenin and neurogenesis: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19441930/\n\n“Apigenin and related compounds are derivatives used in food products. They were administered intraperitoneally and orally in adult rodents and assessed for their activity in promoting the generation of neuronal cells and learning and memory performance. They were also tested on adult rat hippocampal-derived neural progenitor and stem cells to assess their neurogenic property. Apigenin and related compounds stimulate adult neurogenesis in vivo and in vitro, by promoting neuronal differentiation. Apigenin promotes learning and memory performance in the Morris water task. The application claims the use of apigenin and related compounds for stimulating adult neurogenesis and for the treatment of neurological diseases, disorders and injuries, by stimulating the generation of neuronal cells in the adult brain.”\n\n\n——Apigenin, overview of therapeutic potential: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6472148/\n\n“Apigenin as a Nutraceutical: Introduction of the Concept and its Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) Behavior\n\nAmong the wide variety of phenolic compounds, apigenin is one of the most renowned, with countless nutritional and organoleptic characteristics. Nonetheless and more interestingly, it can also contribute with its beneficial health properties, which could lead to a possible inclusion in nutraceutical formulations [12,41]. Due to apigenin’s variety of pharmacological activities and importance for human health, a deepen knowledge of its mechanism of action would be of utmost importance for possible nutraceutical applications. The term nutraceutical, originally coined by Stephen De Felice [42], is, in this context, intended as: (i) the phytocomplex for food or part of food of vegetal origin; and (ii) the pool of secondary metabolites for food or part of food of animal origin [43]. This novel concept’ definition has been proposed to better evaluate the standard term of the word nutraceutical, and to highlight the difference between nutraceuticals, food supplements, and the many other plant-food-derived compounds that claim health-promoting effects. Nutraceuticals must be administered in a proper pharmaceutical way to guarantee high bioavailability and efficacy, and used in areas that go “beyond the diet and before the drugs”",

        "body": "The short simple answer to choosing 200 mg is, research! A lot of research studies are using higher doses, in my opinion, 50 mg is way too low of a dose, and 200 mg is where the effects really shine. With that being said, 200 mg could surprisingly still be seen as a very moderate dose. Here is a good study, which albeit focused on cancer, provides some valuable insight into the dosing of apigenin:\n\n[Does Oral Apigenin Have Real Potential for a Therapeutic Effect in the Context of Human Gastrointestinal and Other Cancers?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8167032/)\n\nHere are two good excerpt from that study:\n\n\"Comprehensive in vivo studies looking at the pharmacokinetic properties of purified apigenin given by the oral route have not yet been conducted in humans. In rats, doses of apigenin assessed were 13.5 and 60mg/kg (see Table 1 above). While it is difficult to compare the gastrointestinal physiology of rats to humans, in a 70kg adult person, this is equivalent to apigenin doses of 0.9 and 4.2 g, respectively. Compared with the dosing with dietary parsley mentioned above, this would be approximately a 50–240-fold reduction in bulk intake yet should take plasma concentrations into the bioactive range in humans (by simple extrapolation, to at least 5μmol/L). Measurements in rats at the higher oral dose gave a maximal plasma concentration of 1330ng/ml(Ding et al., 2014). With a molecular mass for apigenin of 270g/mol, this equates to 4.9μmol/L. Although an approximation based upon limited data, both the rat model and extrapolation from human data therefore suggest that doses used and approved in experimentation reach systemic levels into the range to achieve biological effects.\"\n\n\"Parsley leaf itself is available in capsule form as a health supplement, with the typical recommended ingestion amount being 2 capsules for a total dose of 900mg. Using an apigenin content for dried parsley of 45mg/g (Sung et al., 2016), this would equate to a daily dose of approximately 40mg apigenin, less than 1% of what is needed for a meaningful clinical outcome on cancer cell behavior, although it may have other beneficial effects on health. Crude plant products are therefore not adequate in this context.\"\n\nThey are suggesting all the way up to 4.2 GRAMS of apigenin. Now that is clearly due to the researchers looking for a way to achieve very high cellular levels of apigenin, but it goes to show that a higher dose is certainly warranted. \n\nThen of course, we tried it out ourselves and really enjoyed the effects at the 200 mg dose. So we decided to go with a real proper dose of apigenin so that you can actually experience the full range of effects that are possible. \n\nThe half life for apigenin is certainly not 91.8 hours by the way! I see the same study you got this from, but its a singular study and other studies are indicating the half life is closer to 12 hours, some even suggesting that the half life is much lower than this too. From personal experience with apigenin, I would say the effects last about 6-8 hours for me, which would then agree somewhat with the suggested 12 hour half life.",

        "body": "Yeah, it's pretty good! Honestly, we need to be better about taking into account dosage when talking about bioavailability, it's something I often see people miss. For example, if we need 50 mg of compound 'X' in our blood stream and only 10% of compound 'X' absorbs, then we'll need to dose 500 mg. Now let's say we figure out a very advanced bioavailability solution that now allows 50% of compound 'X' to absorb, this means we now only need to take 100 mg of compound X in the new bioavailability matrix. However, perhaps the fancy bioavailability formulation is incredibly expensive, complex to manufacture or simply not available. In this case, our best option is simply to dose it higher and this is often the best and most straightforward way to get around bioavailability issues. \n\nOf course, you see issues associated with this strategy. For example, higher doses of magnesium oxide start to alter GI pH levels which then further decreases its bioavailability. Worse yet, higher doses of magnesium don't really work, because it will have a strong laxative effect. Furthermore, magnesium chelates, like magnesium glycinate, circumvent this problem while also being cheap. With apigenin however, we find ourselves in a perfect situation. It is not all too expensive, so higher doses are doable, and higher doses don't appear to cause GI issues. So for apigenin, it makes a lot of sense to just dose it higher to compensate for the less than stellar pharmacokinetics. \n\nFrom personal experience, I will say that the apigenin is plenty potent at the 200 mg dose, and I like it a lot. In my opinion, apigenin would likely not be the best candidate for bioavailability enhancement but it is always an interesting topic to look into and when a simple and affordable solution can be found, then an optimized apigenin could be very interesting to explore. I actually have a few ideas for sublingual absorption of apigenin that I'm going to explore in the coming months, and perhaps this could be an interesting way to optimize the pharmacokinetics!",

    "body": "A few weeks ago we found a bird's nest with six eggs in it in the BBQ at church, and I've been thinking subsequently about \"traditional\" spring eating and what types of foods might be included in that. \n\nWe've already talked about leafy greens, especially the bitter spring greens that are often up before anything else: dandelion greens and various brassicas, sure, but also Alexander's, probably also nettles, asparagus and so on. \n\nOne traditional Easter food was a tansy omelette or tansy pudding -- somewhere between an omelette and a pancake, it was made with tansy (another aromatic bitter herb -- not eaten much now and it can have serious and toxic effects, so do your reading carefully please, don't just eat it because I said so) and eggs. I think the tansy was partly because it is anti-helminthic and people would get worms from eating badly-preserved fish, ugh. But it's also high in various polyphenols, probably including our old friend apigenin.\n\nI think eggs, or something in them, could conceivably be part of the get-out-of-torpor diet. They store for a while, but not forever, and generally would have been available in the wild in spring and early summer. Even domestic chickens bred for egg production will go off laying in winter if light levels fall enough -- they don't eat in the dark, and they don't produce eggs if they don't eat enough. It's one reason modern commercial hens are provided with electric light in winter, to keep production going. \n\nThinking about it further, the traditional Lenten fast would have been pretty low in fat, and therefore low in PUFA. You'd finish up your stored bacon and any remaining eggs from autumn (if you had hens) beforehand, and then it was a no-meat fast for 40 days (fish would have been dried salted cod or maybe pickled herring; and probably only minimal dairy, as cows produce less over winter too -- some Orthodox Christians I know go completely vegan for Lent and also avoid olive oil and other plant oils, which seems to me like it would be a pretty hard diet to follow longer-term), then at Easter you're roasting a lamb and chowing down on things like tansy cakes fried in butter, egg production is picking up (depending on exactly when Easter is -- and whether you wanted to incubate the first few clutches of eggs to produce more chickens) and lots of ruminant meat. The Easter Octave is 8 days, so I would expect a decent amount of feasting then, but the *season* of Eastertide is 50 days. \n\nSome of this would have been in response to the availability of various foods, of course, rather than relatively recent religious customs being \"designed\" to end torpor after a winter spent mostly huddling indoors out of the cold and trying to conserve calories so you don't starve. But that's sortof the point: if you look at traditional/mediaeval Christian European food ways, there are still traces of a way of eating that is very tied to the seasonal availability of different foods, and would make sense as a signal to begin torpor in autumn or late winter (Christmas pudding is full of nuts, so are things like marzipan and stollen, and before we started eating goose (higher PUFA) or more recently turkey for the big Christmas meal we ate.... a nice fatty ham; and Christmas was 12 days of feasting, not just one big meal) in preparation for a few months of caloric scarcity, and end it and burn off any remaining surplus body fat stores in spring when there's more fresh food around (though not, at first, many calories) and plenty of work to be done. \n\nEating too much PUFA year-round is not great as it leaves us in a sortof forever-autumn, always trying to conserve energy. But I also wonder if the spring \"ending torpor\" process is also best if it's transient and has two parts: six or seven weeks of low-calorie, low-fat eating in European Christian practice would be followed by a real calorie and satfat bonanza. And I wonder if maybe for some people, that two-part process is important for getting out of torpor. What happens if you stay in the Lenten fast too long, after light levels get higher, temperatures get warmer, and you're increasing the amount of exercise you do? You're not going to get enough fat-soluble vitamins, you're maybe not going to get thermogenesis going properly, you're basically going to be stuck in a low-energy holding pattern. That sounds an awful lot like what some chronic calorie restriction dieters experience, tired and cold and irritable and eventually sick. Maybe they should have a pancake with bitter herbs fried in butter, and some roast lamb. \n\nAt this stage of the year, we're getting to the horrible end of the root vegetables; we ate the last of our own homegrown ones several weeks ago, and even shop-bought carrots are frankly not amazing at this time of year, kindof spongy and sad. I have one winter squash left from autumn's harvest. I can imagine roasting the last of the root veg in the Easter meal, and then switching to (longer-storing) grains as a calorie supplement until the new season of root vegetables are available.\n\nBut the early spring lettuce is doing okay now, and the mustard greens, and we've been eating asparagus and lovage and leeks and rhubarb. Soon there will be strawberries and raspberries, and fresh peas (not just the shoots), and broad beans. I am super excited; once the strawberries start I generally have a harvest of fresh fruit of some description twice a week until sometime in October. This summer I plan to mostly eat it with cream or yoghurt. I'm almost more excited about the peas and beans, though. We had enough beans last year to freeze some for winter, but we've never managed that with peas, and they are so much better fresh! I like to make a cold cream of pea soup and serve it with chive flowers on floating on top, absolutely delicious. \n\nI already eat pretty seasonally, because it sortof comes with growing my own veg. But I do have a fair bit of weight I would prefer to lose, and realistically I am going to eat at least some PUFA in autumn and winter in the form of nuts (we have three hazelnut trees, plus various walnuts and chestnuts in the park which produce well in some years, though chestnuts are low in fat as far as nuts go) and goose (so so so tasty), and probably some fructose (I can't reasonably make much more jam or chutney out of our fruit this summer as we still haven't finished that from the 2021 season, and there's a limit to how much fruit wine we can store and drink, so I'm considering just drying some of it -- at least that way we still get the fibre), so I expect that whatever progress I make by avoiding PUFA in the coming months is going to slow down at least a little bit over winter. Maybe next spring I'll do my own little n=1 experiment with a low-fat, high-starch-and-greens eating pattern during Lent -- sourdough and salads and vegetable soups -- followed by yummy lamb etc at Easter, and see what the effects are on my waist:height ratio, body temperature and work capacity. \n\nI'd be interested in anecdotes or even studies about seasonal patterns of eating in other cultures, too. I imagine latitude might have a big effect.",

        "body": "I think you have some excellent thoughts.\n\nI do try to remember for myself that religious fasting has been heavily influenced by plant-based dogma that plagues organizations like the Seventh Day Adventists. Given their (lengthy and readily searchable) history, it is fairly safe to say they prioritize their beliefs about the second coming of Jesus, and active hormonal suppression, above human health and well-being.\n\nBut factoring that out I’m a big believer in seasonality. \n\nWe can already readily accept that foods that contain Linoleic Acid (especially in conjunction with fructose and a reduction in vitamin D) specifically characterize the fall. Most of us have already learned that combining PUFA with sugar is highly obesogenic. Our ancestors would have considered this very favorable for their survival.\n\nWinter was likely a time of high fat (specifically fasting, but also that any animals hunted would be high fat themselves) so likely somewhat Keto/Carnivore macros. Then by Spring everything and everyone is probably leaning out quite a bit. Whatever early plant matter is available is low sugar and low starch. So spring macros probably looked a lot like a PSMF.\n\nSummer brings fruits, so probably closest to a typical high carb Peat style diet, but still low fat as the animals hunted were all still in their swimsuit bodies.\n\nThe torpor cascade is put into motion by D6D, and part of its mechanism is to increase Oleic Acid relative to Stearic Acid. Conversely, Mead acid forms endogenously in the absence of PUFA (especially Linoleic Acid) and Mead Acid uses Oleic Acid as a substrate, and actively shuts down D6D. \n\nSo if we consider that EFA “deficiency” actively depletes oleic acid (bringing it back in line with stearic acid) while shutting down the pathway that causes torpor, it isn’t that far of a leap to think well, hey, maybe spring (PSMF) followed by summer (very low fat) makes sense to deplete EFA, encourage mead acid production, and shut off D6D.",

        "body": "Yeah, the Christian observance of fasting during Lent and at select other times is several hundred years older than the Seventh Day Adventists. There *is* a fairly long tradition of gluttony being considered a sin, but I think that isn't really on the same scale as fasting and mostly it isn't connected with the Second Coming stuff. I could go into a long tangent about gluttony being about social repercussions and taking more than one's fair share and therefore denying the needy their due rather than something that occurs in a purely individual context as assumed by most Protestant interpretations, or I could write a bunch about Jesus feeding people, but this isn't a theology sub, and I'm not a theologian or indeed a church historian, so it would probably annoy a lot of people and also I'd get a lot of details wrong.\n\nI think a lot of modern fasting practice does get tangled up with weird morality-of-food stuff, where people have some idea that eating anything nice, or sometimes anything at all, is somehow bad or sinful. There are even weight loss diet clubs where higher-energy foods are counted in \"syns\". There's also a lot of \"if you do everything right you'll have perfect health; your health isn't perfect, therefore you must be doing something wrong\" nonsense floating around, where the \"something wrong\" is taken to be \"eating too much of the wrong things\". That kind of victim-blaming is not something I have much time for, either in my relationship with food or in my religious life. \n\nI do joke sometimes that if there's ever an actual famine I am going to outlive my skinny neighbours.",

If I have blackberries and hazelnuts I'm going to have to eat the blackberries first. Apples keep better than blackberries do, but they're bulky and it makes sense to eat them before the hazelnuts, too, with the exception of any that get made into cider or dried. Nuts you might even be able to dig up in winter, if you've paid attention to where the squirrel put them.\n\nWinter could also be moderate carb, either if the nuts are providing a large part of the diet, or if the ground is warm enough to dig up roots.

        "body": "I think it would vary from year to year. Whole grain of most descriptions, correctly dried, will keep for a few years in fairly simple storage situations; the big challenge is keeping the rodents and other pests away from it. Many grains can also be made into foods that take less preparation before eating than whole grains, and stored that way for weeks or months (depending on humidity); dried noodles/pasta and various types of crackers are examples that come to mind. \n\nHypothetically, my own preference would be to grow enough grain to supply my household and pay any tithes, plus substantial extra for supporting neighbours in need and so on. Any left over at the start of the next harvest could be used for any of the following:\n- brewing beer to sell\n- feeding livestock (chickens and pigs both do well on it, as do horses if you're rich enough to keep them)\n- sowing for the next year's harvest\n- keeping some longer-term in case of future crop failure or expansion of growing area (though it doesn't keep indefinitely, so I wouldn't aim to keep years and years of it in stock; it would depend on what scale I might expect famine to occur locally.) \n\nIdeally you want some parts of the preparation to be done on a community level rather than a household level; think windmills for grinding the grain, rather than just bashing it between two rocks, and teams of people at work for sowing and harvest -- the time between \"this grain is ripe\" and \"this grain is being devoured by birds\" is often short, so harvesting as much as possible all at once is often the best way forward. \n\nIf you do it right and have enough land and your climate is stable enough, grains can really even out energy availability through the course of the year. If you don't have enough to feed your household and your livestock, you eat the livestock, not the seed corn. \n\nUnfortunately I only have access to a tenth of an acre (across three different sites) on which to grow, which is simply not enough to support three adults. Grains are very cheap to buy compared to vegetables here, so intensive horticulture makes a lot more sense for me.  I do have a small experimental patch of winter wheat. So far it's doing less well this year than it did last year, but the winter was harder, and I'm only on my second year growing it so not entirely sure what to expect in terms of variation from year to year.\n\nMy understanding is that we've only really been using grains for around ten to twelve thousand years, so their availability might not, evolutionarily, be as important as roots and tubers. A lot of the roots we eat are biennial plants that produce seed in their second year. Just before they do that, the roots become more bitter and tough, rather than starchy or sweet.",

I will probably add to this post over time as well.\n\n## Polyphenols/Flavonoids/Etc.\n#### Naringenin\n*Positive*\n- https://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-7075-12-1\n- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33234364/\n- https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/156/6/2087/2422904\n#### Apigenin\n*Neutral to Negative*\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696737/\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4882717/\n#### EGCG\n*Positive*\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6262053/\n- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464620304850\n- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15738931/\n#### Theobromine\n*Positive*\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4735603/\n#### Coffee/Caffeine\n*Positive/Mixed*\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5897652/ (Positive/Mixed)\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4026430/ (Positive)\n#### Walnut\n*Positive*\n- https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/146/9/1641/4584898\n- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21871057/\n#### Mangiferin\n*Positive*\n- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24598864/\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5077701/\n\n## Fatty Acids\n#### Alpha-Lipoic Acid\n*Positive*\n- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.20846\n\n## Amino Acids\n#### Cysteine/NAC/Methionine vs. Taurine/Glycine\n*Positive in favor of Taurine/Glycine*\n- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20871132/\n- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026049512003873\n- https://www.jlr.org/content/early/2010/09/25/jlr.M010215.full.pdf\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4498306/\n- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32062620/3\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055845/\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4229262/\n\n## Hormones and Vitamins\n#### T3 (Thyroid)\n*Positive*\n- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9168944/\n#### Vitamin A\n*Conflicting*\n- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9070250/ (Negative)\n- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X08005421 (Neutral/Positive)\n\n## Other\n#### Fiber/SCFA/Microbiome\n*Negative*\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6138742/\n- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26525535/",

    "body": "So, my husband and I are back from a 5-week vacation. We stayed with my dad, so maintaining a TCD diet was largely unhampered, although we both ate very heavily (4000-4500 calories daily average, a few 5000+ calorie days when other people were visiting us, and a few lighter days around 3000 calories if we skipped breakfast) but I controlled all the food, so it was clean albeit very rich. We did eat food out a few times (a big stone fired pizza, and two visits to a particular fish & chips place that fries everything in pure beef tallow) and of course the road trip there and back was “dirty TCD” with a little PUFA in the bread/buns/rolls and a couple Buffalo Wild Wings dinners, etc. The trip overall was extremely high in sugar. Cookies, pastries, sodas, bubble tea, candies, chocolate, etc. featured daily. Definitely about 2-3x the sugar we normally consume. \n\nI was taking a pretty heavy cocktail of supplements the whole time that included Metformin, ALA, Apigenin, Gymnostemma, Hesperidin, a B-Complex, Selenium, and Magnesium. My husband took Metformin, B-Complex, and Magnesium only.\n\nI returned home exactly 2 Lbs heavier than when I left 5 weeks ago, which I expect to be gone in a couple of days. My waist is exactly the same so it’s probably cyclical/water retention anyway. As someone who used to (re)gain 3+ Lbs *weekly* on PUFA, I’m very happy with this. I had really worried about a big rebound after ending my PSMF and going right into vacation eating, so I’m glad that didn’t happen. Of course, as a sedentary female I *do not* have a 4000-calorie per day caloric requirement, so lots of thermogenesis was happening. It works very well for me.\n\nMy husband, on the other hand, returned home almost 12 Lbs heavier, which is a lot for his lean physique. He looks like he has a basketball in his belly, can’t put his arms flat to his sides, is chafing like crazy and started snoring. So *that’s* fun for both of us.\n\nI’ve been pondering what could be going on with him. Here are some thoughts:\n\nHe’s always been lean and able to handle glucose properly. Well, until he became dysregulated by PUFA in early adulthood anyway. But his “infrastructure” for handing sugar existed since birth and then “broke” whereas mine never has been correct. Perhaps metformin wasn’t benefiting him (a lean phenotype) metabolically the way it benefits me (an individual dysregulated metabolically since birth?)\n\nAlso, he pulled his back before we left and he was taking NSAID for a week or so. Nothing too severe, mostly just some Advil. I think these can be metabolic disrupters though… I avoid them whenever I can and didn’t take any this trip for any reason.\n\nAnother thought… Maybe the ALA does more than we realize to help manage weight over the long term? Maybe the herbal supplements do too? I was kind of throwing everything at myself trying to head off regain after my PSMF, so it certainly hasn’t been a scientific approach to figuring out what works. But the combination certainly staved off gain at a very sensitive post-diet rebound time.\n\nFood wise, we ate almost identically. Same food, same portions. If I’m being honest, he even ate a little less (eg. One slice of toast where I had 2-3 sometimes) Even same dinners out and same treats/sweet drinks for the most part. The only 2 major differences I can think of is 1) he tends to drink a lot more whole milk than I do throughout the day although I do have some too. And 2) he was munching on sweets and cookies *a little* more than I was overall even though I certainly wasn’t restricting those either. But he has a sweet tooth that I don’t have as much of so I find it easy not to grab cookies every couple of hours. Maybe the insulinogenic nature of the milk and/or the really excessive sweets made a metabolic difference potentially due to SCD1 elevation? Our calories were similar and his metabolic rate should be higher than mine as a 6’1” male with about 4x as much muscle as I have.\n\nObservationally, he’s still running low temperature (high 97’s to low 98’s) and only showed 98.6+ a few times. I generally woke up at 98+ and was 98.8-99+ most of the time. That’s pretty standard for us both.\n\nAnyway, these are just some things I’m mulling over. I figured I’d share in case it helps anyone else on their own path. I’m happy for any thoughts or discussion. \n\nMy plan for the rest of the year now is to settle into another weight loss stint in the coming weeks. Fasting plus small fatty meals, perhaps. I’d like to hit my goal by Christmas, but as my BMI gets lower the weight loss comes a lot slower.\n\nMy husband just wants to fit into his clothes again ASAP and then he will go back to his usual maintenance. He’s off the metformin now just in case that was messing with him somehow.\n\nEdit: So, it’s been a week. My 2 Lbs came off completely and my hubby is down about half of his gain. No special action on our part, just a return to normalized eating which happens to mean quite a bit less sugar overall (no soda, no constantly munching on cookies) and not stuffing ourselves when we’re not hungry. Have still been enjoying full TCD-compliant meals. My hubby also hasn’t taken any NSAID’s since.",

It’s pretty wild.\n\nThis is why I am clear that I do not have a 4000 calorie metabolism. I don’t actually know what my metabolic rate is. A year ago, before I was considering PUFA a factor, I was maintaining on around 800 calories a day and gaining if I ate much over 1000 calories. I literally fell asleep in tears one night because I knew that if I was like this at just 38 then what would I be like at 50?! Obese or dead.\n\nI begged the universe for this answer, and it delivered. It’s really as simple as that for me. TCD started appearing everywhere and I thought it was a stupid name and ignored it. Then after around 2 weeks I finally capitulated and looked into it. I saw Brad reference Peter at Hyperlipid, with whom I was already familiar, and then I decided the blog was worth reading. Dove into it and the rest is history.\n\nSo now I figure my metabolism is somewhere between what it originally was and what I eat. Thermogenesis only happens to deal with excess calories, so the fact that I experience so much of it means my body is viewing a lot of my calories as “excess”\n\nI would hypothesize that in the coming years, my metabolic rate might actually normalize and I will require (and experience) less thermogenic effect to maintain my weight.

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nIt’s been almost a year since I purchased my Ōura Ring last year for Christmas. I got it because I was having some issues with my sleep, and wanted a way to get actionable data to improve my sleep. \n\nLong story short, I would say that it helped a lot and I was able to refine my sleep hygiene, routines, supplements and other tools to have substantially better sleep.\n\nWith the sleep habits I detail below, I was able to increase on average, my deep sleep by 20%, my REM by 15%, my sleep efficiency from 75% to a ranger of 85% - 90%.\n\nI’ve broken up my habits from Morning, Day, and Night depending on when I do them.\n\nMorning:\n\n1. Use sunlight alarm clock to wake up. Allows yourself to wake up naturally during light sleep and not deep / REM which will make you feel groggy.\n2. Get sunlight for 10 min as soon as you can when you wake up. Helps set you circadian Rhythm and tell your brain it’s day time.\n3. Avoid caffeine for the first 90 min after wake up to allow your body to flush the adenosine from your brain, release cortisol, and prevent a mid day crash.\n\nDay:\n\n1. I try to keep my exercise >3 hr from bed time. Otherwise I feel to awake before bed. Ideally in the morning to be more alert. Exercise too close to bed elevates your body temperature, your body needs to cool to fall asleep\n2. I save my carbs for the evening instead of breakfast or lunch as it makes you feel sleepy. It increases the uptake of tryptophan into the brain, which is converted to serotonin and melatonin.\n3. No caffeine after noon, though this depends on when you wake up and go to bed. Caffeine has a half life of 5 hrs, so giving yourself 10 hrs between caffeine intake and sleep gives you some time to remove it from your system.\n\nNight:\n\n1. Try to have your last intake of food >3hrs before bed. Digestion makes you have a lighter sleep.\n2. Try to stop looking at screens >1hr before bed. Blue light prevents the production of melatonin.\n3. Wear blue light blockers >1hr before bed, for the same reason. Also helps if you have to state at a screen closer to bed time.\n4. Try to dim the light in your house >3 hrs before bed time.\n5. Try to see the light of sunset. Huberman says the frequency of light then also helps tell your brain sleep is coming soon.\n6. Take a hot bath or hot shower before bed. This will elevate the heat in your body and cause you blood vessels to dilate. Your body temperature will then decrease telling you body it’s time to sleep.\n7. My sleep supplement stack (as per Huberman): 1 hr before bed I take 250mg L-Theanine, 145mg Magnesium L-Threonate, 50mg Apigenin. On alternating days I take 100mg GABA & 2g Glycine, and the other day 900mg Inositol. \n8. When shifting my sleep schedule I will take 0.3mg of melatonin (the physiological dose). I’ll usually take it for 3 days of the new sleep schedule, though this is just what works for me. There are some studies that say chronically taking melatonin isn’t great for you, and also most brands have way too high a dose, with some brands having quality control issues on the actual dose vs reported dose.\n9. Have a wind down routine. Can be journaling, reading, meditation, listening to relaxing music. Just has to be a calm activity that you do regularly before bed that you will associate with sleep. I like to read a fiction book that isn’t too exciting.\n10. Silk sleep mask. Blocks out any light and I like the pressure on the eyes.\n11. Weighted blanket. I find it calms me, and I move a lot less in my sleep.\n12. Keep your room cool. The average temperature that is optimal for sleep is 60 - 67 °f / 15.6 - 19.4 °C\n13. If you are feeling anxious, write down what is stressing you down on paper, and tell yourself you will address it tomorrow.\n14. If you wake up and have a hard time falling back asleep, check out NSDR or Yoga Nidra. They are good ways to calm down the mind and rest. Remember, even if you aren’t sleeping, if you are relaxed and laying with your eyes closed doing this passive meditation you will still enjoy many of the benefits of sleep.\n15. Also, if you do wake up at night, do not look at your clock! This will only stress you out if you have to get up soon!\n\nAnyway those are the main things. I’ve been experimenting with nose strips and mouth taping but still not sure if it helps. \n\nPlease comment any other tips & tricks you’ve found that helps your sleep!\n\nAll of the habits and protocols were pulled from these resources:\n\n1.

You mentioned that this has been an issue your whole life, so it would be very reasonable to see a sleep specialist for a sleep study. They can also evaluate for narcolepsy,  etc.\n\nThey now have 2 stages of testing for apnea.  The first is wearing a take-home device for one night.  It's basically a finger oxymeter and a wrist heartbeat monitor that records the results. However, these are more accurate than the devices we can purchase ourselves. It screens for irregular oxygen andheart rate.  If these results show possible apnea, then they do a full sleep study that includes EEG (brain wave monitoring), leg movement, etc.\n\nLeg movement can also disrupt sleep. Do you ever have restless legs?  There is a medication that you can take before bedtime that treats for restless legs. \n\nDo you take any Calcium and Vit D?  If not, give that a try.\n\nAlso remove any scents. For example, laundry soap. I use Arm&Hammer Fragrance Free (white bottle) laundry soap.  Look for fragrance free soap, shampoo, deodorant,  etc.",

    "body": "&#x200B;\n\nFirst off - I started this genetic investigation mainly to learn why I am so negatively affected by certain substances and what I need to AVOID, in order to optimize my mind and body.  It took me a long time to draw parallels and only recently did I discovered things that were doing damage to my well being that I never considered. Prior to getting my genetic data, based on reading alone, I thought i was most certainly slow-comt.  Post data analysis shows that I am slow-MAOA.  Finding this out led me down a trail of connecting the dots.  Below is what I have compiled.\n\n**I am looking for feedback. I just want to ensure my information and theory makes sense and is articulated correctly.**\n\nI knew I was sensitive to increased acetylcholine - but, if i am right, the \"why\" is explained below.\n\n(when reading this - bear in mind that I was compiling this information in a format written specifically for my primary care, so forgive any redundancies)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Slow-MAOA and Acetylcholine (Why I've felt like garbage and didn't know why)\n\n# Section 1\n\n(all credit for Section 1 data to u/Tawinn , link at the bottom to his original post. Thank you, you are a wonderful human being.)\n\nMAO-A = Monoamine oxidase A\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMAO-A breaks down amines. These amines include:\n\n* Dopamine\n* Serotonin\n\nBiogenic amines:\n\n* Histamine\n* Tyramine\n* Possibly also putrescine and cadaverine\n\nHomozygous rs6323 slow MAO-A (T or T/T) has reduced ability to break down these amines.\n\nHeterozygous rs6323 MAO-A (T/G) has somewhat reduced ability to break down these amines.\n\nNOTE: Since the MAO-A gene is on the X chromosome, only women can have heterozygous MAO-A. Similarly, since men will only have one copy of MAO-A, it is often reported as a single letter 'T' or 'G' instead of 'T/T' or 'G/G'.\n\n**I am Homozygous rs6323 slow MAO-A ( T/T)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINTERACTIONS WITH FOLATE-PATHWAY\n\nREDUCTIONS AND SLOWED COMT\n\nMAO-A is slowed further by high estrogen, so higher estrogen levels due to slowed COMT further reduce MAO-A functionality. ***(I have no labs to make this estrogen link as exasperating my slow MAO-A issue, but thankfully do not have slow-comt issues based on my genetic profile)***\n\nDecreased dopamine breakdown by slowed COMT increases dopamine breakdown burden on MAO-A. ***(Thankfully I do not have slow-COMT issues based on my genetic data that could compound my slow MAO-A issues)***\n\nDecreased SAM production due to folate-pathway reductions causes reduced HNMT activity, thereby increasing intracellular histamines, likely also increasing burden on MAO-A. ***(Due to my MTHFR genetic profile I do have an estimated 65% reduction in my folate-pathway that left untreated, can, in theory, amplify my slow-MAOA burden.)***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WHAT THIS DOES**\n\nThe result of slow MAO-A is:\n\n* Higher tonic dopamine and serotonin\n* Higher levels of histamine and tyramine (and possibly other biogenic amines)\n\nNOTE: MAO-A/MAO-B are slowed further by:\n\n* Hypothyroidism.\n* Iron deficiency.\n* MAO Inhibitors (MAOIs)\n* Some prescribed drugs.\n* Natural MAOIs, such as turmeric, curcumin, quercetin, piperine, luteolin, apigenin, chrysin, naringenin, and others.\n\n**TYPICAL SYMPTOMS**\n\nCommon symptoms can include:\n\n* Histamine-intolerance - wide variety of symptoms\n* Tyramine-intolerance - headaches, migraine, blood-pressure increases\n* Food intolerances\n\nNOTE: Since high estrogen can slow MAO-A further, fluctuating estrogen levels in women's cycles can also cause fluctuating symptom appearance and intensity.\n\nHistamine-intolerance may be involved inPMS/PMDD symptoms, according to many websites.\n\n***(My horrible seasonal allergies could likely be linked my histamine intolerance and my higher blood pressure could be linked to a tyramine intolerance. Obviously this is all theoretical at the moment but I would be interested to see what limiting tyramine, or, adding in a supplement to reduce tyramine absorption would do.*** (DAO enzyme) ***)***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Section 2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Acetylcholine and it’s role in further compounding Slow-MAOA issues**\n\n“Acetylcholine (CAS 60-31-1, ACh), which is similar in its chemical structure to the carbamate aldicarb, was found to inhibit brain monoamine oxidase isoenzymes, namely MAO-A and B.”\n\n“The results indicated that ACh inhibited MAO-A from the cerebellum and MAO-B from the basal ganglia more than MAO iso-enzymes from other brain parts. The inhibition was of the competitive type. It was also found that the enzyme inhibitor dissociation constants (Ki) and the affinity constants (Ki/Km) of MAO-A were higher than those of MAO-B.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19025057/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19025057/)\n\nBeing that I am genetically proven to have slow acting Monoamine oxidase A, which directly affects the break down of neurotransmitters, this link would explain my extreme sensitivity to acetylcholine AND the following supplements that have caused undesirable effects on my well being and mental health due to increased acetylcholine inhibiting my already slow acting, Monoamine oxidase A.\n\nThe following supplements cause increased acetylcholine in the brain, or interrupt the enzymatic process that breaks acetylcholine down, thus causing a greater accumulation of acetylcholine in the brain. The first three on this list I took together for an extended amount of time from 2020 to 2022, during which time I felt horrible, but assumed the majority my negative well being issues were due to stress and burn out. Before discovering my sensitivity, I have used fish oil independently of any other substance netting the same negative results. Only recently taking GSE and GTE did I realize a drastic effect on my mental health and well being that immediately improved once discontinuing supplementation after a short duration following cessation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fish Oil -** “Dietary Fish Oil Increases Acetylcholine- and Eicosanoid-Induced Contractility of Isolated Rat Ileum1.”\n\n[https://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/03/20/fish-oil-causing-depression-or-anxiety-consider-acetylcholine/](https://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/03/20/fish-oil-causing-depression-or-anxiety-consider-acetylcholine/)\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12221201/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12221201/)\n\n**Grape Seed Extract -** inhibits acetylcholinesterase. “Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme whose primary function is to catalyze and promote the breakdown of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.”\n\n[https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/19/7/9403](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/19/7/9403)\n\n**Green Tea Extract -** “The study concludes that green tea extract administration is effective in enhancing learning and memory in aged rats and also demonstrates selectivity for inhibition of acetylcholinesterase.”\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278262607001777#:\\~:text=The%20study%20concludes%20that%20green,selectivity%20for%20inhibition%20of%20acetylcholinesterase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278262607001777#:~:text=The%20study%20concludes%20that%20green,selectivity%20for%20inhibition%20of%20acetylcholinesterase)\n\n**Huperzine A -** “Huperzine A inhibits the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.”\n\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huperzine\\_A](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huperzine_A)\n\n**Thymoquinone (Black Seed Oil)  -** “TQ has been shown in clinical studies to block acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, which increases acetylcholine (ACh).”\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9026861/#:\\~:text=Several%20studies%20did%20not%20show,which%20increases%20acetylcholine%20(ACh)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9026861/#:~:text=Several%20studies%20did%20not%20show,which%20increases%20acetylcholine%20(ACh))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe effects huperzine A and thymoquinone were substantially problematic after a short time; huperzine-A being the absolute worst of them all taking me the longest to recover. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe above list is incomplete, but the most apparent regarding how negatively these substances affected me. It took me a long time to realize how badly my brain was reacting to fish oil, GSE, and GTE simply because I thought they were rather benign regarding negative side effects, especially mental and emotional side effects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final summation:**\n\nDue to my Homozygous rs6323 slow MAO-A ( T/T) gene, I am specifically sensitive to increased levels of acetylcholine in my brain due to acetylcholine inhibiting my already slow, monoamine oxidase isoenzyme,  MAO-A. This “extra slow down” of MAO-A prevents the breakdown of certain neurotransmitters that is causing an imbalance resulting in negative mental health effects.\n\nEdit:\n\nI would be interested to find out if my [acetylcholinesterase](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30969557/#:~:text=Acetylcholinesterase%20(AChE)%20is%20a%20cholinergic,into%20acetic%20acid%20and%20choline) is acting slow, as this would only compound my acetylcholine imbalance stemming from certain supplements, thus causing the chain reaction further down the line. \n\n\nEdit: 2       10-20-24\n\nI’ve been doing great regarding my ACh issues until this past week. The only new thing I introduced to my diet was 2 Brazil nuts per day. I couldn’t find any info regarding Brazil nuts impacting ACh so I google the bioactive compounds of Brazil nuts and ran it through chat GPT:\n\nI asked chat gpt this:\n\nDo any of these bioactive compounds in Brazil nuts affect ACh in the brain?\n\n“The investigation found the following in the composition of the BN: phenolic compounds (mainly flavan-3-ols as Catechin (and glycosides or derivatives), Epicatechin (and glycosides or derivatives), Quercetin and Myricetin-3-O-rhamnoside, hydroxybenzoic acids as Gallic acid (and derivatives), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, ellagic acid, Vanillic acid, p-Coumaric acid and Ferulic acid, bioactive minor lipid components (β-Sitosterol, γ-Tocopherol, α-Tocopherol and squalene), and a high level of selenium. In beverages, WBM had a higher lipid content than BM-S, a factor that influenced the energy characteristics and the content of bioactive minor lipid components.”\n\nChatGPT’s response:\n\nYes, several bioactive compounds in Brazil nuts may influence acetylcholine (ACh) levels or activity in the brain, either directly or indirectly:\n\n\t1.\tFlavonoids (Catechin, Epicatechin, Quercetin, Myricetin) – These compounds have neuroprotective effects, partly through their antioxidant properties. Quercetin, for example, has been shown to inhibit acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that breaks down ACh, potentially increasing ACh levels in the brain. Catechins and epicatechins also improve cognitive function and may support neurotransmission.\n\t2.\tPhenolic Acids (Gallic acid, Ellagic acid, Ferulic acid, etc.) – These acids are known for their antioxidant properties and may protect neurons from oxidative stress, which can indirectly support cholinergic function by preserving brain health and ACh-related signaling.\n\t3.\tSelenium – Brazil nuts are particularly high in selenium, an essential trace element. Selenium is crucial for brain function and has been linked to reduced cognitive decline. Although selenium’s direct effect on ACh is not well-studied, its role in maintaining overall neural health can support the cholinergic system.\n\t4.\tTocopherols (Vitamin E) – Both α-Tocopherol and γ-Tocopherol are forms of vitamin E, which protect neurons from oxidative stress. By reducing oxidative damage, vitamin E indirectly supports cholinergic neurons and may help maintain ACh levels in the brain.\n\nThese compounds, particularly flavonoids like quercetin, may help enhance ACh levels or cholinergic activity through neuroprotective and enzyme-inhibiting mechanisms.\n\n Needless to say, I stopped taking them yesterday (10-19-24). We shall see how long it takes to get back to normal.  My mind is blown yet again at how sensitive I am to ACh. \n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Credit: all information in \"Section 1\" to** u/Tawinn **from Reddit.**\n\n[reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1aocoqb/mthfr_comt_and_maoa_a_symptom_triumvirate/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n&#x200B;",

After taking fish oil - Nordic Naturals, Biosil (contains choline) and Amazing Grass Greens Superfood supplement (with lots of COMT inhibitors) for 6 months, I developed severe anxiety, fear of leaving the house, gallbladder discomfort and high histamine symptoms. \n\nI spent thousands of dollars on different tests (blood, hair analysis, scans) and treatments, worked with a holistic practitioner and things got worst. I finally understand why: the practitioner suggested me to do a holistic heavy metal detox and I had to take so many COMT inhibiting supplements: Turmeric, Astragalus, Ashwagandha, Methylatedvitamins & more.\n\nI ended up going to the psychiatrist and was prescribed: Zoloft & Xanax. I tried Zoloft without Xanax and it was a nightmare, couldn’t tolerate it (most probably because I did not have a serotonin issue). Things got better after taking Xanax. I took the medication for one year, got off it under doctor’s supervision and had 0 side effects when stopping the medication.\n\nI was fine for several months and then, since I want to get pregnant, I was recommended to take several supplements: Prenatal Omega 3 - Nordic Naturals, Digestive Enzymes (they contain ginger and other COMT inhibitors too), Seeking Health Optimal GI (almost all ingredients are COMT inhibitors), Seeking Health Optimal Prenatal (inositol, choline, methylated B’s and many more). \n\nI am back to square one: gallbladder pain (probably because of choline), anxiety and high histamine.  2 days ago I decided to stop all supplements and now waiting for the symptoms to subside.\n\n\nA few days ago I sent in my saliva test for the DNA test, as I follow Dr. Ben Lynch & Tyler Panzner on IG. I am waiting now for the results.  Nobody talks about fish oil being an issue, all doctors and influencers take it. I took half of the recommended dosage and I ended up going insane trying to figure out what’s wrong with me.\n\nPlus, my cabinet is full of expensive supplements that will end up in garbage. \n\nToday, I just happened to see your post and it enlightened me, it all makes sense.  \n\nI would like to thank you so much for posting your experience in detail, it helped me tremendously, I wish you all health, happiness and a long beautiful life!",

        "body": "**Discovering My Condition: A Journey of Self-Advocacy**\n\nI've come to realize that understanding my health issues required more effort than any doctor has ever invested. Like you, I've identified slow COMT and slow MAO-A genes as significant factors in my condition. This realization came after years of feeling misunderstood by the medical community. My journey began with a simple visit to a general practitioner, someone who has known my family and me since childhood. Their well-meaning advice to \"take a break\" or \"retreat to the mountains\" felt dismissive, ignoring the neurochemical intricacies of my situation.\n\n**Navigating ADHD and OCD: Beyond General Advice**\n\nMy suspicions about the neurochemical basis of my symptoms led me to seek psychiatric help, where I was first diagnosed with ADHD. Initially seeking performance enhancement through Ritalin or methylphenidate, I was surprised to find this diagnosis confirmed by my genetics. Treatment with Elvanse (up to 70mg) and other stimulants has been pivotal in managing my ADHD, OCD symptoms, and overall mood. However, my reactions to substances like caffeine and cannabis, as well as the varied effects of medications like Ritalin and Modafinil, highlight the complexity of my condition. Interestingly, nicotine and N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) have offered me some relief, suggesting a nuanced interaction between my neurochemistry and these substances.\n\n**Seeking Specialized Care: The Quest for Comprehensive Treatment**\n\nDespite presenting genetic evidence to my psychiatrist and family doctor, the focus remains symptomatically driven. This approach overlooks the potential insights my genetic profile offers, particularly regarding slow COMT and MAO-A. Consequently, I find myself at a crossroads, questioning where to turn for a more holistic and thorough examination. The possibility of a histamine intolerance further complicates my condition, affecting my reaction to various substances and prompting a deeper exploration of my symptoms.\n\n**Reaching Out for Guidance: A Community's Wisdom**\n\nAs I navigate this complex landscape, I'm turning to you, the Reddit community, for advice. Your threads have been incredibly informative and supportive, offering hope and a sense of camaraderie. Now, I seek your guidance on the next steps. Should I consult a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation? How can I find a healthcare provider willing to consider my genetic predispositions and their manifestation in my symptoms? Your insights and experiences could illuminate the path forward, helping me to address not just the symptoms but the root causes of my challenges.\n\n---\n\nI hope this revised version effectively captures the essence of your experiences and queries while ensuring clarity and coherence.",

If you upload your raw data file into Promethease you may get more detail by looking up the specific snp.\n\nFor me being a non metabolizer, my body does not breakdown and use certain drugs.  So there is no positive effect and side effects can be much worse than the average person.\n\nThis variant would be important for you in considering psych drugs and or pain meds in particular.  It may or may not relate to the supplements you took which made you feel unwell.  You might find more information  on those and how they are metabolized on examine.com.\n\nFor psych drugs you would want to ensure you get a Genesight test to help you and the doctor pick the best meds for you.  Similar tests are available for pain meds.  A company called ClarityXDNA does a similar report for a broader range of drugs,  so it may cover both, but it is pretty expensive.  $350 on sale out of pocket last time I checked.",

According to [Examine.com](https://examine.com/supplements/apigenin/#dosage-information), the recommended dose is \"2.4-8.1 mg/kg of bodyweight\" for anxiolytic effects without sedation; \"higher doses may induce sedation in addition to reductions in anxiety.\"\n\nThe Examine dose is \"derived from a study in mice and is post-conversion.\"\n\nWeighing 180 lbs (82 kg), I would need to take approx. 200-665 mg. For context, I'm interested in Apigenin as a sleep aid.\n\nHow much do you take, and what do you take it for? Do you notice different effects at different doses? In your view, what is the best dose for sleep?",

    "body": "So, you're diving into the world of anti-aging? It's a wild ride, and there's a ton of buzz around different substances that *might* help us slow down the clock. Think of it like building a personalized longevity toolkit, not finding a single miracle cure. You've got the big names like **Rapamycin**, dialing down aging pathways, and **Metformin**, mimicking fasting for cellular benefits. Then come the **NAD+ boosters (NR/NMN)**, fueling energy and repair, and **Senolytics (Fisetin, Quercetin + Dasatinib)**, clearing out those pesky senescent cells. And don't forget **Urolithin A**, renewing our cellular power plants, the mitochondria. It's a fascinating start, right?\n\nBut the rabbit hole goes deeper! Beyond the headliners, there's a supporting cast targeting various aspects of aging. **Spermidine** and **Resveratrol** boost cellular clean-up, while **PQQ** and **CoQ10 (especially MitoQ)** pump up mitochondrial function. **Apigenin** and **Astaxanthin** act as potent antioxidants, shielding cells from damage. We're also talking about **AKG (Alpha-Ketoglutarate)** for mitochondrial support, **Berberine** as a Metformin alternative, **Melatonin** for sleep and DNA protection, and **Taurine** for overall cellular health. It's like assembling a team of specialized superheroes!\n\nAnd the list *keeps* going! We're seeing interest in inflammation fighters like **Curcumin**, brain boosters like **ALCAR (Acetyl-L-Carnitine)**, and essential building blocks like **Omega-3s (DHA/EPA)** and **Glycine**, plus the all-important **Vitamin D + K2**. Then there's the cutting-edge stuff: **FOXO4-DRI** for senescent cell clearing, **Thymosin Alpha-1 & Beta-4** for immune and tissue regeneration, and even **GDF11**, a youth-restoring protein. Plus, compounds like **C60 (Fullerene)**, **α-Klotho**, **NRPT**, **HIF Activators**, **Oxaloacetate**, **BPC-157**, **Epitalon**, and even the wild world of **Stem Cell Therapy** and **Exosomes** are being explored.\n\nWe're not done yet! There are also compounds like **GHK-Cu** for skin rejuvenation, **TRF150** for stem cell support, **Methylene Blue** for brain energy, **Hydrogen-Rich Water** for antioxidant power, **GABA** for sleep and stress, **5-Amino-1MQ** for metabolism, **RU-58841** for hair longevity, and **Glycine-Proline-Glutamate (GPE)** for brain protection. It truly feels like we're just beginning to understand the possibilities of influencing aging.",

One reason is that often the supplements go rancid and are in part toxic.  The other might be bioavailability.  \n\nFor neurological health, it is likely that Omega-3s are worth supplementing, especially if you are a carrier for the APOE-4 gene.  This gene variant greatly increases Alzheimer risk.  \n\nAPOE-4 carriers process Omega-3s differently and it is common for them to have less circulating DHA and EHA.  Forgive me, I can't provide more details, but you can do internet search on it.  \n\nIt is also useful to know that there are two main forms of Omega-3 supplements, phospholipid and triglyceride.  The phospholipid are supposedly more bioavailable.  These would include cod liver oil and krill oil as well as Omega-3s obtained from a diet rich in fatty fish.  \n\nIf you are trying to live forever, you should get a genetic test for APOE.  If you are APOE-4, you should keep reading up on the latest science to stay ahead of it.  \n\nOther things to look at:   \n\\- B vitamins   \n\\- Homocysteine \n\nAlso, there is a bunch of interesting stuff on Rapamycin and APOE-4.",

    "body": "Not sure I agree but my doc told me my testosterone was a little too high (5’9” 185 lb 36m). Here’s what I take and do:\n\nMy usual weekly diet:\n1. USDA organic pasture raised eggs hard boiled about 2 a day\n2. Steak/chicken breast/beef/turkey (usda organic if possible)\n3. Fish like wild caught salmon or wild caught sardines\n4. Veggies/fruits (usda organic if possible)\n5. Occasional breads/pizzas/ice cream etc. (I try to limit this to 1 day a week)\n6. Weigh protein and plant protein in smoothies\n\nExercise (usually 4-5 days a week):\n-Boxing \n-BJJ \n-Lift weights \n-Jogging \n\nDaily/morning supps:\n1. Multivitamin (garden of life)\n2. Vit d3/k2 (nd)\n3. Omega 3s (nordics)\n4. Ginger usda organic (vitamin shoppe or nd)\n5. Dandelion root (vitamin shoppe)\n\nMornings/few days a week:\n1. Micro zinc (nd)\n2. Tongkat Ali 2% (nd)\n3. Primavie (nd)\n4. Black maca (the maca team)\n5. CBD (cornbread usda organic)\n\nNightly supps every night:\n1. Magtein or micromag (nd)\n2. Curcumin (nd or vitamin shoppe)\n\nNighttime supps alternating:\n1. Ksm66 (nd)\n2. Bacopa 24% (nd)\n3. Garlic extract (vitamin shoppe usda organic)\n4. Apigenin (nd)\n\nI have tons of nd supps I’ve tried that weren’t for me or that I take on an as needed basis like HGW and all of the mushroom supps. \n\nI unfortunately had to give up my favorite supplement of them all… ND’s full spectrum cistanche. It makes me feel like the Hulk, but I unfortunately become a dickhead on it ONLY towards my wife. I believe it’s a sexual frustration thing cause I feel all of the “testosterone/libido”. I haven’t figured out how to get her libido to match mine. I would always pair it with primavie which enhances it 10x imo. Then I’d take a 50% hgw on  alternating days and hello best erections of my lifetime, although I’ve never had an issue there.\n\nLet me know if there’s any suggestions you guys have and hope this helps someone.",

Mid 800's is a great natural testosterone level, your free t ratio might be a tiny tiny bit too low but it's not bad either. All this says to me is you're a high performing, healthy male, in good physical shape. \n\nThere is such a thing as too high testosterone, and its well well over 1000ng/dl from 1. injecting gear or 2. having a pituitary tumour. Your level isn't remotely close to concern for this.\n\nYour concerns about behaviour or irritating libido are valid, and for you to personally decide, but your testosterone definitely isn't too high when it comes to physiological health, not even close.

        "body": "I've had numbers close too and above yours that I've discussed with three different GPs over the last 10 years. Two of them just shrugged and said \"good job, everything looks great\" and third one was slightly concerned due to there being prostate cancer on my dad's side. Doc three became less concerned given I was super healthy and had no negative health markers including prostate  and did not use any pharma strength PEDs. I think for some docs their caution is NOT that you're a male near 40 with high testosterone; but that males with undiagnosed prostate issues commonly have higher end testosterone. Personally if your blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol levels are good alongside your high testosterone and you don't have any serious chronic illness or \"man issues\" I wouldn't worry about.\n\nAnyways your numbers are unsurprisingly great given your listed food, sups, and activity level. Your supp list reminded me about my black maca stash I haven't touched in a while. I took a hiatus because it had me feeling too wired to sleep some nights - but I loved the mood, energy and desire boost.\n\nRegarding your wife's libido, maca was probably the most successful supp for her. But what made the most difference was raising her activity level and diet changes. I make her a massive bowl of fruit every day to swap out some of her less optimal food choices. And we go on walks every day. The other factor is she, like most women, needs to be buttered up over the day and across the week haha. So my strategy is to try to hit a few different \"love languages\" each day. Words of encouragement, compliment texts, physical touch, dates, gifts, acts of service, taking decision making off her plate, mixing it up/not being predictable, and of course foreplay. Leave no stone unturned!",

If that's all it is still...I'll most likely drop those (minus D) and look at TRT. (I'm 48)\n\nAt 800s, you're definitely not too high. That doc is an idiot. If they're a male doc, they need to be fired. \n\nWhat I hate about the test \"range\" is that it's such BS. You can't have a range like that and set it for everyone. The differences in a couple hundred points can be a big, big deal per individual. And you CANNOT say what is right for one person is the same that's right for another without a history of levels. \n\nWhy I think guys should start getting tested around 18 and follow up every few years. A good baseline for one guy very well may be 600...another may need to be closer to 8-900. \n\nAnother thing docs will disregard and throw statins and such at is..low test...FOR YOU...can lead to metabolic syndrome.

Or health recommendations related to this? My guess is no because the only actionable things that could come from this would be to recommend you stop having a healthy lifestyle or prescribe you anti-androgens.\n\nThe former most definitely would mean you need to find a new doctor, the latter would mean you need to need to find an endocrinologist since anti-androgens should really be handled by a specialist and only given in cases of clear disease states.\n\nIf they say this again I'd recommend asking them to elaborate on what the problem is with your levels.

I'm speaking rhetorically BTW. Make a pact with your S.O. to focus on your love life. That's what we did and now getting each other off is just a normal part of every day. Yes, supplements can improve some facets but are totally not needed by couples to achieve what they really want.  \n\nMaca Team premium black is hands down the very best I had.

Most just left me groggy the next morning.\n\nBut this one? **Dream Catcher Spray (DSIP)** from Amino hit different.  \nIt calmed my nervous system *without* killing morning energy — and I didn’t have to pin anything.\n\n# 🧠 Why DSIP?\n\n[**DSIP (Delta Sleep-Inducing Peptide)**](https://aminoasylum.shop/product/dream-catcher-spray/ref/1142/) works on the **hypothalamus** and **brain stem**, helping regulate deep sleep, nervous system reset, and cortisol rhythm.\n\n💤 It's been studied for:\n\n* Better **REM sleep**\n* Calming overactive thoughts\n* Recovery from CNS fatigue (hello, leg day)\n* Stress-induced insomnia or stimulant rebound\n\n# 🔄 How I Use It\n\n|Protocol|Dose|Timing|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Dream Catcher Spray|1-2 sprays per Nostril|15–30 min before bed|\n\nI keep it next to my bed. One spray cycle = smooth drift into sleep without that “Benadryl fog.”\n\n# ⚙️ What I Noticed\n\n✔ Knocked me out without being sedating  \n✔ Deeper, dream-rich sleep (woke up with dry mouth = deep REM)  \n✔ No morning grogginess  \n✔ Helped wind down on high-stim days or when I’m cutting\n\nAlso stacks well with **GH peptides at night** (like CJC/IPA or Tesamorelin) for full recovery mode.\n\n💬 Anyone else tried DSIP or non-injectable sleep peptides? Curious how it worked for you vs oral noots like apigenin or L-theanine.\n\n⚠️ For research and educational use only.

While all of these blends work great and have served their purpose I have found the most benefit from Autonomous & Heavy Metal Detox. \n     I have been diagnosed with ADHD since my teenage years & was never a fan of stimulant medication. Not only does it make me feel anxious but it also dampens my creativity. I work in the sound and music industry so taking my stimulant medication has a negative effect on my work. Autonomous has helped me have the initiative I need to start & finish my work while also maintaining my natural creativity. \n     I have had deep lines under my eyes & on my hands since childhood. I did more research & learned that this could be a sign of heavy metal toxicity. I decided to try the Heavy Metal Detox formula & it was definitely the answer to my problem. I feel like I have aged backwards! My hands look a lot healthier & the deep lines under my eyes have become more refined. I hope more people will try the Heavy Metal Detox formula as many Americans are exposed to heavy metals on a daily basis. \n     I would also like to shout out Rewire for helping me to reach six months of sobriety! Plush also makes my skin beautiful but I am pretty young & I don’t think this formula is necessary as I am currently on a budget. \n\n",

    "body": "I took delivery of my Pod4 Ultra with adjustable base a few days ago. The first night was a bit sketchy, but the AI figured me out and I'm sleeping better than I was before getting it with each night doing better than the last. I got my bed set up well prior to the 8 Sleep, a newish Sleep Number mattress with a Tempur-Pedic topper. I would struggle with consistency of sleep, very early wakeups, and seemingly random sleep scores according to my garmin. It got so bad I was averaging 6.5 hrs of sleep and was falling asleep earlier and earlier during the day to make up for it, exacerbating the problem of very early morning wakeups. I took Unisom for a year, but that didn't really help me sleep past 4am and I was left groggy throughout the day.\n\nI started listening to [Andrew Huberman's segments on sleep](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/master-your-sleep-and-be-more-alert-when-awake) and I started using light syncing (going outside during sunrise and sunset for 10 minutes to allow my internal clock to sync to circadian rhythm), and started taking a few supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin, and L-Theanin. These really helped with sleep quality.\n\nThe past 4 nights on the Pod4 though, I've hit 100 sleep scores, just over 8 hours of sleep every night, and it's like clockwork. It's really impressive. I normally snore and it wakes my wife up. The adjustable base senses when I snore and raises the head of the mattress mitigating the snoring. It's getting better and better every night. So far I am very impressed and I can see this being a long term tool in my better-sleep journey.\n\nBrowsing this sub however has left me a little perplexed. The problems people seem to have here seem to be related to one of three things: subscription cost, warranty / customer support, older products being left behind. I can understand the gripes if someone bought this for $1800 three years ago, it sprung a leak, and now they're being asked to pay to replace it. From the reports here though, the company isn't asking full retail to replace it, but some fraction of the cost, which seems fair to me. Things with water in it will leak over time. I've had a dishwasher leaks and flood my kitchen. It sucks, but it happens. If I get a leak in my Pod4 and I have to replace it in 4 years for $500 to $1000 out of warranty, would I? Yes, and happily, if it continues to improve my sleep.\n\nThe paywall is another interesting thing. People are griping over this, but I'm not too worried about it. I build software with AI and running models is very expensive, especially daily runs. Some people have made the comparison to ChatGPT saying that this is more expensive than the current AI leader. But I find that comparison unfair. ChatGPT has billions in cash and their API business is huge. The consumer business for $19/month doesn't allow them to come close to breakeven and is a drop in the bucket compared to their B2B and partnership businesses. 8 Sleep on the other hand raised $86m back in 2021 and they need to figure out a business model that 1) doesn't lose them money, and 2) allows them to grow. If they can solve the sleep problem using responsive AI tuned to your specific body, that is novel and no one else is doing it. They can charge whatever they want for that service. \n\nThe most important thing I see here is the cost of not having good sleep. The negative health effects of poor sleep have been so well documented they will remove years from your life. Lets say I have this for 10 years and I can sleep with perfection for 10 years. I paid $4100 for the Pod4 Ultra with adjustable base, lets assume an out of warranty replacement for $1000, and $25/month for their software. This puts the total at $8100 over 10 years. That is $2.22 per night to have perfect sleep. I pay more for coffee to wake me up from a bad night sleep. And $2.22 per night to keep the plethora of sleep deprivation diseases at bay including cancer, dementia, alzheimers, etc? You got to be kidding me. This is a screaming buy.",

I wouldn’t say it’s magic at this point, but I am willing to keep fiddling with it and consider the other sleep factors / hacks (a la Huberman!).\n\nI think there is LOTS of room for improvement with the app, but hopefully that’s in the works. Again, hoping that my subscription fee proves to be worth it and helps to fuel future improvements.\n\nIf this thing springs a leak, I will indeed be pissed, and I have all the empathy for people with older models who experienced that.

Then I read that it wasn’t a compatibility issue, it was intentionally disabled.  People that were given the pod 4 covers to demo with their pod 3 hubs were able to use this feature perfectly fine.\n\nI get it, they’re owned by investors and their business model is to squeeze every dollar out of their customers.\n\nSpeaking for only myself, I understood that an annual subscription was required for the first year and then it was optional after that.  I understood that going into the transaction.  What I did not understand, and wouldn’t possibly understand until actually purchasing the product and using it is just what that actually meant.  I never in a million years would think that having the cover turn on at a set time would not be a standard feature and would require $200 a year.  The alarm and autopilot I could care less about and from what I can tell, autopilot doesn’t do much.  The sleep analytics and so out of whack I don’t even bother looking at it anymore.\n\nYou can research as much as you want but it’s all theory until you actually use it and understand what it does and what the features represent.  \n\nSide note, it’s nice to have, it hasn’t changed my life in any noticeable way.  I can’t really justify the $3k price tag nor the annual subscription.  When I was reading up on it before I purchased it for myself I remember reading a review that said they miss it when they go on vacation and can’t wait to get home to their own bed.

The employees that monitor this sub are awesome and if you’re reading this, keep up the great work, it’s appreciated.\n\nMaybe I’m the minority on this but I suspect a lot of people feel this way regarding the annual subscription price tag not aligning with what you get.

It’s understandable that AI models are both impressive and expensive, and most people agree that companies have the right to charge for such services, but this isn’t the issue here. The problem is that Eight Sleep is charging customers to use the product itself.\n\nAll of the product's hardware components, except for temperature change, are labeled under the subscription service. There's no justification for this—it's not an additional expense for hardware to exist and be used. There are no teams or projects at Eight Sleep working on improving *your* hardware; only software. Yet, without this subscription, the hardware is soft-locked. It's akin to BMW's controversial seat-warmer decision to lock the car's heated seat technology unless you paid a monthly subscription. Unsurprisingly, people were extremely unhappy and it was eventually removed.\n\nThis type of practice leaves a bad taste in people's mouths and exacerbates opposition to their other, potentially justifiable, qualities.

I’m one of those people that has trouble staying asleep rather than falling asleep in the first place, so your mileage may vary as with all supplements. But I wanted to report that having tried every other supplement with purported sleep benefits including tart cherry, apigenin, magnesium glycinate, MicroMag, GABA, Sensoril, melatonin, taurine and even Sleep Support itself… While these have helped in different ways and to varying degrees: no other supplement has allowed me to get a solid 8 hours sleep until I tried this. \n\nIn fact, the only other thing that would reliably do this before was amitriptyline, and obviously no one wants to be taking an SSRI for life if they don’t need to. So thank you, everyone concerned at ND for making this possible for me.\n\nI say thanks because this is also the clearest example where I have subjectively felt the difference in quality between ND and other brands. It’s not that I hadn’t tried Magtein before. Right after the first Huberman Lab podcast on sleep came out when he mentions Magnesium L-Threonate, I bought Jarrow’s MagMind from Amazon.co.uk (very expensively) and it made no perceptible difference compared to other kinds of magnesium. So later reading MidterYouAreSoDumb’s reply on how ND are the only ones following the rules on purity rang true: https://www.reddit.com/r/NootropicsDepot/comments/fy353l/why_is_your_magtein_so_expensive/\n\nI’ve only got one concern about Magtein, which is that even when taking the recommended 3 capsules that still only amounts to 36% of your RDA. Moreover, my incredibly basic bitch understanding of the science is that Magtein is particularly good for allowing magnesium to enter the brain (this being what makes it so good for sleep), so would this potentially be to the detriment of where it’s needed elsewhere? \n\nI have quite a lot of magnesium glycinate, MicroMag as well as Thorne’s Magnesium CitraMate lying around so taking one of those during the day to top up taking Magtein at night would be fine. On the other hand, I don’t want to take extra supplements if doing so would be redundant, or even risk taking too much.\n\nIf it makes a difference, I’m not one of those people that gets loose stool from any sort of magnesium, or experience any other negative side effects from taking any of the above forms. However, I do live in a ‘hard water area’ with a lot of magnesium in the tap water, and eat a decentish amount of leafy greens.",

        "body": "Abstract:\n>Brain aging is associated with reduced cognitive function that increases the risk for dementia. Apigenin is a bioactive plant compound that inhibits cellular aging processes and could protect against age-related cognitive dysfunction, but its mechanisms of action in the brain have not been comprehensively studied. We characterized brain transcriptome changes in young and old mice treated with apigenin in drinking water. We observed improved learning/memory in old treated mice, and our transcriptome analyses indicated that differentially expressed genes with aging and apigenin were primarily related to immune responses, inflammation, and cytokine regulation. Moreover, we found that genes/transcripts that were increased in old vs. young mice but downregulated with apigenin treatment in old animals were associated with immune activation/inflammation, whereas transcripts that were reduced with aging but increased with apigenin were related neuronal function and signaling. We also found that these transcriptome differences with aging and apigenin treatment were driven in part by glial cells. To follow up on these in vivo transcriptome findings, we studied aged astrocytes in vitro, and we found that apigenin reduced markers of inflammation and cellular senescence in these cells. Collectively, our data suggest that apigenin may protect against age-related cognitive dysfunction by suppressing neuro-inflammatory processes.",

Myostatin inhibition(epicatechin and egcg from cocoa and green tea, sulforaphane from broccoli, working out as frequently as possible 6 days a week full body, creatine)\n\n2.ER beta activation( ecdysterone and turkesterone from spinach, possibly phytoestrogens like isoflavones)\n\n3.ursolic acid from apples, rosemary, thyme and sage\n\n4.apigenin from parsley\n\n5. Pretty much a lot of polyphenols from plants seem to have a somewhat positive effect on lean mass, so eat as much vegetables and herbs as possible.\n\nThe dosages you would need to get a decent amount of each compound would be.\n\n1. 50-100gm cocoa powder+5-15gm dry green tea\n\n2. 3-5gm creatine( possibly unsafe without dutasteride due to increasing dht)\n\n3. 200-300 gm of raw broccoli\n\n4. 300 to 600gm of spinach\n\n5. 6 to 8 apples or more realistically about 1 to 2 tsp of rosemary or a combination of the two.\n\n6. About 100 to 300 gm fresh parsley or much less if using dry\n\nI know it seems like a lot but it's doable if you replace coffee with cocoa and green tea and sautee spinach with parsley while sprinkling rosemary and thyme on top, bonus points with eating so much healthy veggies is that you get even nicer skin anyway.\n\nAfter a while on this regiment I've gotten damn good results, I'm slowly feminizing, demasculinizing while also building muscle and strength.\n\nI now have a beautiful face with soft skin and little body hair, very muscular upper body, relatively small waist and a 10/10 thicc thighs and ass that rivals instagram thots, which is a pretty hot combination honestly, like I'm turning heads at the gym and not just in a mirin kind of way😏.\n\nThe reason I upped my E is because I'm fine with having even less T as I'm building muscle and strength relatively easy and i want even more feminization, but I probably won't go higher than 4.5mg as I still want some T in my system.\n\nThis is basically my version of non binary, what're your opinions? probably would've been better with raloxifene but whatever I'm fine with my small breast buds, I think it looks kinda hot with chest muscle anyway.",

If you have damage, your remaining thyroid is working overtime, and cellular stress and/or aging will most likely cause you to go hypo eventually, even if you somehow got your antibodies to zero, which you probably haven't. \n\nI'm not trying to be a jerk, its just that what you did can be incredibly dangerous for people. Lack of thyroid hormone cascades to many systems and causes widespread chaos in your body. It certainly is possible to go into remission and remaining thyroid to keep up, but trying to do that and tapering levo is a bad idea for many, and I couldn't in good conscience recommend it to anyone. \n\nI do agree though, you definitely should try to reduce the antibodies. Correct levo dose if needed, correct vitamin d, correct selenium, supplement inositol, lower stress levels, and work out. \n\nI have never taken T3 but I think I'm going to end up needing to. I went on antibiotics (doxcycline) a while ago and it seems to have screwed up my thyroid conversion. I don't know if I'd do NDT but I am curious about getting slow release T3 compounded.",

DNA Test machen lassen. Hat zwar \\~ 150 Euro gekostet, aber es hat mir Einblicke über mögliche Genmutationen gegeben - in Verbindung mit ADHS. Beispiel: Ich habe 2 Kopien der Mutation A1298C im MTHFR-Gen, was bei ADHS typisch ist (gestörte Methylierungsfähigkeit bzw. Umwandlung des Körpers von Folat und B12  in die aktive Form); genauso Val/Val-Genotyp beim Thema COMT- Aktivität, wodurch Dopamin schneller abgebaut wird. Habe die Resultate in chatgpt reingehauen, und er hat mir eine Liste gemacht, welche Supplements er mir anhand der Dateien empfehlen würde (langfristig natürlich günstiger als die nächsten Monate die gleichen Supplements zu kaufen). Nehme seitdem auch Glycine und TMG\n\n**mMn besten Supplements (für mich):**  \n\\- L-Tyrosine oder DL-Phenylalanine (manche finden das eine besser, manche das andere; wenn du nichts spürst, dann kombiniere es mit Sport. Manche Menschen spüren erst durch Bewegung die Wirkung. Warum es wirkt: Phenylalanin wandelt sich in Tyrosin um, welches zu L Dopa und schlussendlich zu Dopamin wird)   \n\\- Rhodiola Rosea\n\n...ansonsten: morgens Kaltduschen, Keto/Low Carb und generell Darmgesundheit, regelmäßig NSDR-Meditation (10 Minuten von Huberman), Schritte zählen und mit dem Training nicht zu übertreiben (\"5x weightlifting to failure\" ist schon viel Stress für den Körper). Schlechter Ernährung, zu viel Sport, etc. ist alles Stress für den Körper, was du bspw. an einem erhöhten Ruhepuls sehen kannst. Auch mal Zone2 Training implementieren.\n\nWenn du eine Diagnose hast, kannst du auch mal beim Hausarzt nachfragen. Manche von denen verschreiben Ritalin dann, wenn du bspw. Übergangsweise die Meds brauchst und aktuell noch auf der Suche nach einem neuen Psychologen bist.  \n...sollte fürs erste reichen.",

L-theanine feels like it had the least effect of these for me. \n\nI have the most dogshit sleep routine because I work night shifts on my feet under the brightest overhead lights, drive home at 9AM with the sun out, and sleep right after, but my sleep feels noticeably better when using this stuff and I usually don't feel poorly rested. Doesn't really help the onset of sleep, but makes any sleep I do get feel more effective. \n\nHaving an eye mask/sleep mask (on top of my blackout curtains) helps a lot though. I got one of those cheap bluetooth ones on Amazon that have basic speakers in them, so I can put on some yoga nidra type stuff while still being able to rest my head on my pillow (unlike with earbuds). The yoga nidra also helps big time during the day whenever I'm tired for whatever reason... REALLY gets me feeling rejuvenated. \n\nOh and back to supplements, CBD had a noticeable effect on deeper sleep for me as well and I recall it being recommended in Matthew Walker's book. I don't buy it often though because it's kinda pricey and I don't notice any particular effects in day to day life from taking it, so for sleep alone, I stick to the cheaper aforementioned alternatives.",

    "body": "So I have been lurking on this community for a couple of weeks. Thanks to you guys, I’ve gained a lot of insight on optimizing my sleep. I almost pulled the trigger on a Whoop,but due to the supply chain issues and relatively high cost of membership, I’ve decided to use the AutoSleep  on my apple watch. \n\nI’ve been tracking my sleep for a week now, and experimenting with how different things affect my sleep. There are some great tips in this community but there are two things that I’ve found to be helpful for me that haven’t been mentioned on here, as far as i’ve seen. \n\n**Drink chamomile tea 45 mins before bedtime**\n\n*According to Sleep Foundation:*\n\n“Flowers of the chamomile plant have been used for many years to treat a variety of issues, including poor sleep. Chamomile contains multiple active chemical compounds, including one called apigenin that has a mild tranquilizing effect once it binds to benzodiazepine receptors in the brain.\n\nWhile research is limited, chamomile has been demonstrated to improve sleep quality. A study of postpartum women found that participants who drank chamomile tea reported a reduction in sleep barriers and depressive symptoms. In another study of older adults, the group who received chamomile reported better quality sleep than the group who did not.”\n\n**Listen to Weightless by Marconi Union before bed**\n\nMany websites have dubbed this as “the world’s most relaxing song”. It uses binaural beats (beats that provide different frequencies in each of your ears, resulting in a third tone called a binaural beat), to provide a calming effect. Due to the way binaural beats work, you need to listen to this song with headphones on to get the full effect. I like doing this about 10-15 mins after having a warm cup of chamomile, in a dark room with my eyes closed. \n\n*According to MindLab International (the group behind the research):*\n\n“The power of this song is outstanding compared to any other song they have ever tested. “Weightless” induces a 65% reduction in anxiety and a 35% reduction in usual physiological resting rates.\n\nDr. David Lewis-Hodgson from Mindlab International explained, “Brain imaging studies have shown that music works at a very deep level within the brain, stimulating not only those regions responsible for processing sound but also ones associated with emotions”.”\n\nPlease let me know how those work out for you if you try them. Also, let me know if there are more tips that aren’t commonly mentioned. I am thinking of compiling a list of tips on improving sleep, and your input would be greatly appreciated!",

Earlier the urge to pee would wake me and then I was notable to sleep for some time. This advice is helpful, I don’t have the urge to pee even during this cold weather.\n\nEarlier in January I tried to sleep earlier than my usual time, thinking I would be able to get 1-2 hours sleep more. On the contrary, it made be wake up during the middle of night, ended up getting less hours than before. I have set my sleep time around 11:00 - 11:30 pm.\nSo these are my suggestions \n1) Maintain circadian balance by having consistence sleep schedule \n2) avoid drinking fluids before sleep time\n3) breath work: inhale 4 seconds and exhale for 8 seconds\n4) Avoid blue light\n5) Yoga nidra if you wake up in the\nMiddle of night\n6) I also use Nu Calm to help me fall asleep or recover if don’t get good sleep.

Not a big fan of sleeping with a pet in my room, but I didn’t have large issues up to now. Suddenly, out of nowhere, my cat developed a very noisy way of grooming herself. Before she was completely quiet, but now she started licking herself in a very noisy way, with a very “wet clicking sound” that is now impossible for me to deal with. And she never came back to the normal grooming.\n\nI wake up multiple times during night, no matter what sleep supplement/aid I take. I have a complex work, and this is absolutely destroying me.\n\nMy list of options is very slim. All failed attempts:\n\n1) I love the cat, and can’t re-home. It will break my heart and most likely lead to very difficult situation with my fianceé, who loves cats and is very affectionate to her. It is basically a hard no go.\n\n2) I tried supplements such as magtein, triptophan, apigenin, melatonin, valerian, with zero results.\n\n3) i can’t put earplugs because of tinnitus. It makes my tinnitus much worse and noticeable. \n\n4) tried for weeks to move my cat to another room without success. She meows and scratches the door for hours. \n\n5) I am a side-sleeper. Earphones hurt my hears or they slide off.\n\nIs anyone in a similar situation, or have a potential solution to share?",

    "body": "Hello all. I am not getting too much feedback so far from [r/Peptides](https://www.reddit.com/r/Peptides/) and [r/longevity](https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity/) curiously auto-removed my post. Then I remembered that r/Biohackers might be a good place to post. I would like your thoughts on a fast + supplements + peptides regimen I am currently embarking on. The primary aim is to trigger autophagy, apoptosis of senescent cells, BDNF/nerve growth, etc. So the plan is to fast for 5 days (from what I have read it is believed 5-7 days is when apoptosis happens, perhaps sooner) and to use autophagy/senolytic supplements and peptides during the fast.\n\nThe fast:\n\nWill be doing 5 days, with water and green tea (here and there). Will be supplementing with potassium, sodium, and some magnesium (have got the amounts from the [r/fasting](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/) page). I have been on a low carbohydrate diet for a week or two to hopefully lower my glycogen stores so that I can reach ketosis, autophagy, and apoptosis faster. I will be doing about an hour of cardio per day, at least for the first few days, and some light weight training to minimize muscle loss. I will also be taking 10 minute cold showers each day.\n\nSupplements:\n\nI will be keeping my electrolytes up by taking potassium and sodium after a couple days of the fast, about 1g each, perhaps more potassium than sodium, will read up more on that. Also will take some magnesium. As far as autophagy/senolytics, I will be taking two megadoses of **fisetin**, I believe on back to back days, on either day 3 and 4 or 4 and 5. The Mayo Clinic did 20mg/kg, so I will roughly follow that and do about 1.5g each of the two days. Fisetin is meant to promote apoptosis, be anti-cancer, etc. I will also be taking a supplement called \"Senolytic Activator\" by Life Extensions. It includes **fisetin**, **theaflavins, quercetin, apigenin, galactomannans,** and some other things. Need to do a bit more research on the ingredients here, but was thinking of doing three days (likely days 3, 4, and 5) taking maybe double the serving size. It gets a bit complicated trying to state how much of each ingredient that would be because Life Extensions has their Quercetin in a phytosome and their Fisetin is also supposed to be some way more bio-available form (so it is much lower on a mg basis than is commonly suggested), but it looks like I would be taking about 150mg of fisetin, 200 mg of glactomannans, 550mg of theaflavins, 50 mg of quercetin, and 100 mg of apigenin each of the three days. That is on top of the two days of mega dose fisetin I am planning and the EGCG and other stuff form the green tea I will be drinking. May also take my trace multi-metals supplement.\n\nPeptides:\n\nI have been dosing **Thymosin Alpha 1** at 1.5mg every three days for about two weeks now. I will be dosing the same amount on day 2 and day 5 of my fast. I have also been dosing 1.5mg of **GHK-cu** every day for two weeks; I will continue to do so during my fast. Potentially the X Factor, I also have 30mg of **FOX04-DRI**, which I believe I will be taking all at once, per my research, on day 5 (want to be as deep in the fast as possible for senolytic activity). In animal studies, they dose this for three days in a row, but I just did not have the money.\n\nRecovery:\n\nObviously, slow refeeding while avoiding sugars/starches. But then I also plan to begin taking 100mg/100mg of **Ipamorelin/Mod-GRF** starting the night of the day I break my fast, and then dosing at night and upon waking 5 days on 2 days on for maybe 2 months or so.\n\nSo:\n\nAny thoughts are welcome, honestly very encouraged. I am on day one right now. Again, I am trying to promote autophagy and senolytic activity. And let me stress: I am NOT shy about being aggressive. Should I dose TA1 back to back days towards the end of the fast? Should I be dosing Ipa/Mod-GRF as soon as the night I break my fast? Is my fisetin dose too high? Are there dangers with high fisetin doses (did not appear so from the literature). Am I missing anything obvious?\n\nEdit: I will now be taking my fisetin dose **after** my fast, on the first meal back and then again the next day during a meal (since it is fat soluble). I don't want to take any fat/oil during my fast. Also looking into the other compounds that have been mentioned in the comments of the various subs I have posted this in.\n\nThank you all.",

By that, I mean how do you plan to measure success vs something like fasting 3 days once per month combined with healthy diet and exercise?\nSome biohacking gets so down in the weeds that it becomes an academic exercise with a lot of expense and time involved... and to what end? I think if you are going to embark on a project like this, there should be some specific metrics (short and long term) that are measurable and reproducible. Otherwise this sounds like expensive masochism.\nDon’t get me wrong, I’m motivated to find the right combination of diet and exercise coupled with supplements that will give me good, long term health metrics.  That said, I would not go so far as to become a monk written about in books who lived forever, but was miserable through his entire journey.\nLastly, if this seems beneficial at the end of two months, the next question is (of course) Is it sustainable?",

It has been used for centuries in various forms and its advantages are supported by a vast body of literature and experience. Interestingly, the whole plant can be used for medicinal purposes. Ayurveda is the complete knowledge of life. Brahmi helps to achieve the primary goal of Ayurveda which is to prevent and treat illnesses and enhance lifespan by maintaining proper balance between the body, mind and the soul. \n\nAccording to Hindu religion Brahmi derives its name from Lord “Brahma”, the god of creation. Brahman is the universal or God consciousness, and Brahmi, literally means the energy manifested in Lord Brahma.\n\nThis tiny but potent Brahmi occupies a place of pride in AYUSH systems of alternative medicine as one of the most revered and widely used herbs in Ayurveda. A revitalizing herb with significant medicinal properties, it has been extensively used as a brain tonic and is widely recommended for the treatment of anxiety, brain related disorders, various skin conditions, immune system etc.Treasured by Ayurvedic medical practitioners since Vedic times, Brahmi finds a mention in ayurvedic treatises such as Sushruta Samhita and Charaka Samhita. It can be taken as a syrup, ghrita (medicated ghee/ clarified butter), tea, churana (powder), medicated oil and decoction, or it can be eaten fresh (leaves).\n\n\n￼\n\n\nPhytochemistry of brahmi\n\n\nStudies have shown that the herb contains many active constituents, including a number of alkaloids, saponins, however, the major constituents are the steroidal saponins, Bacosides A and B.

Lower levels of cortisol in turn reduce the ill effects of anxiety and stress in the body. It is also helpful in treatment of disorders like depression, anxiety, insomnia, nervousness , etc.\n\n\nBrain Tonic\n\nMedicinally, the entire plant has been used in different formulations to treat various disorders, particularly those involving poor memory, intellect and anxiety. Used as a brain tonic, it promotes cerebrum development and rejuvenates the mind by improving concentration and memory. ‘Bacosides(chemical compound in brahmi) is responsible for improving efficiency of transmission of signals. It also stimulates the mind by improving alertness and focus while simultaneously calming it by reducing stress and improving sleep quality.\n\nAyurveda or the Indian system of Medicine viz. Sushruta Samhita, Charak Samhita, and Atharva Veda describe plants which have a prabhava (specific action) on the intellect and memory as Medhya Rasayana (Medhya – intellect or retention, Rasayana – procedure or preparation). Traditionally Mandukaparni, Yastimadhu, Guduch, ashwagandha and Shankhapushpi have been mentioned to have a memory enhancing action. Others like Brahmi, Vacha, and Jatamamsi although inadequately emphasized have been known for their efficacy. Vedic scholars of ancient India have been known to consume Medhya Rasayana that helped them memorize lengthy scriptures 3,000 years ago.\n\n\nSkin and Hair Curative\n\nBrahmi is considered to be a very good herb for the skin, hair and scalp.

There are some  compounds  such  as  Saponins  and  their  bacosides present in Brahmi, which are responsible to enhance the nerve impulse  transmission.  The  bacosides  aid  in  repair  of damaged neurons by enhancing kinase activity, neuronal  synthesis, and restoration of synaptic activity, and ultimately nerve impulse transmission. In animals, Bacopa has a relaxant effect  on  pulmonary  arteries,  aorta,  trachea,  and  ileal  and bronchial tissue, possibly mediated by inhibition of calcium-ion influx into cell membranes. There are numerous clinical trials and studies have been performed by various researchers to check the nootropic effects of Bacopa monnier\n\n\n\nNote: 1) research suggests that Brahmi may help keep blood pressure within a healthy range.\n\n\n           2) excess intake of this lead to side effects.\n\n\n           3) if you are taking allopathic medicine then don't take the Brahmi or take after some time or take a consultation of doctor.

    "body": "Before I go any further, I should point out that this in no way constitutes medical advice, or an alternative to medically administered treatments. I just read a lot and have saved info as I find it and this shouldn't be taken as a suggestion to go out and buy any particular thing.\n\nThe purpose of this is two-fold, firstly that it may trigger some new thinking in a medically qualified person to take further, and secondly it is intended to discuss theoretically how to help reduce the risk of serious outcomes in the event of infections and possibly shift the odds in favour of a non lethal resolution, and used as a prophylactic would have low risk of side-effects, be generally safe and may also be generally beneficial to the preexisting conditions identified as risk factors for mortality (so not a complete waste of time even if it doesn't work). It's important to note that current front-line antivirals can often have significant toxicity including cause organ failure, one of the nasty outcomes of COVID-19. So as a prophylactic aid treatments must be safer than the disease by a very large margin.\n\nBecause of the low likelihood these treatments might work significantly, they should at least be useful in the sense of being comparatively safe, and beneficial to health in general.\n\nBecause of the low death rate and the demographics of deaths, COVID-19 appears to be most dangerous when combined with prior poor health at the time of infection, and so that is where the greatest potential probably lies in finding a treatment.\n\nTreatments may be divided into three avenues.\n\n1 - those that are antiviral, by blocking virus entry or replication. These in turn may work best taken during or prior to infection, or both.\n\n2 - those that reduce the disease and injury associated with the infection, of excess and poorly targeted immune response and inflammation. In mice at least, inhibiting NF-kB increases survival against SARS coronavirus [https://jvi.asm.org/content/88/2/913](https://jvi.asm.org/content/88/2/913)\n\n3 - those that are aimed at enhancing immune health and preventing exhaustion and loss of key antiviral defences and this presumably would lower both viral load and the risk of other infections and sepsis, which we assume along with 2, are the primary causes of injury and death. In addition, treatments that reduce the bacterial and viral load prior to infection would reduce the risk of sepsis and infection complications, and make it potentially easier to mount an efficient, targeted immune response to the infection, which may mean it never develops. Certain cells are depleted in COVID-19 infection, such as lymphocytes. Substances such as selenium may increase these cell counts during infection in other viral diseases, and improve antibody production in diabetics, another COVID-19 risk group. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381341/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381341/), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3762230/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3762230/)\n\nWe might assume that impaired antibody responses are a factor here, especially as some people resolve the infection almost without symptoms, and for whom the infection is simply a live vaccine, and also in general many pathogens already present in the human body produce 'super-antigens', substances that cause antibody production, but cause inaccurate antibodies to be made, which causes collateral damage. As a result of prolonged collateral damage, the immune system normally goes into 'anergy' and tolerance, which are risk factors in the death rate due to measles, especially in malnourished people. A person already suffering from multiple infections of viral, fungal and bacterial super-antigen producers would be in a bad place to mount efficient humoral responses. So, because of immune stresses like this, taking compounds that are broad spectrum antimicrobials may be of help either prior to or during an infection.\n\n4 - Those that may generally improve health and protect against the preexisting conditions that seem to be large risk factors in the death rate of COVID-19, such as potentially reducing liver injury via oxidative stress, metabolic impairments in type 2 diabetes etc. These factors also can increase translation and presumably quantity of the ACE2 protein that the virus uses to gain entry, and this is theoretically a risk factor. Inflammation can increase this, and it therefore a good time to consider giving up bad habits like smoking and excessive drinking, and increase the intake of apples, nuts and berries and lower your blood glucose.\n\nViruses generally target mitochondria as part of their strategy to establish themselves in cells, because mitochondria are critical parts of the intracellular defence against viruses, conducting virtually every antiviral pathway in the cell, and just about every means of degrading intracellular material and parasites are directly controlled by mitochondria. Human coronaviruses are known to target mitochondria. In addition, this targeting may play an important role in the loss of certain immune cells in this infection, which we presume means higher viral load and worse outcome.\n\nIt is noteworthy that conditions associated with abnormal Redox status, oxidative stress, energy impairment, like diabetes, are unsurprisingly risk factors for death and injury from this virus.\n\nSome background on the early clinical aspects of the infection - [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ewxsfj/coronavirus\\_notes\\_immunal\\_deficiency\\_theoretical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ewxsfj/coronavirus_notes_immunal_deficiency_theoretical/)\n\nThe general ideas I have are not novel, and are even being trialed -\n\n[https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-virus-new-antivirus-spray-used-in-shanghai-emergency-wards](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/wuhan-virus-new-antivirus-spray-used-in-shanghai-emergency-wards)\n\nThe new spray contains two active ingredients, Prof Xu said. One restrains the duplication of the virus and the other controls the process of the virus causing illness in people. **The virus made people sick by causing inflammation**, he explained. The active ingredients can suppress the inflammation and repair the respiratory tract mucosa.\n\nHere is an interesting paper I found recently which explores natural compounds as treatments for COVID-19 [https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202001.0358/v1](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202001.0358/v1)\n\nSo, with this in mind, here is what I have found of potential interest; Many have shown broad antiviral properties. They show antiviral effects in a variety of species and across a spectrum of viruses, and a few also against coronaviruses. However an agent that works against one coronavirus does not necessarily affect another variety of coronavirus. In general I assume that a compound that has a broad antiviral effect against dissimilar viruses, but including similar viruses to coronaviruses, are of more interest, and especially if they showed effect against at least one coronovirus.\n\nSelenium\n\nSelenium has broad antiviral properties, and other health benefits (when not taken excessively), see this earlier post [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/f2hyun/selenium\\_infectious\\_viral\\_disease\\_and\\_pneumonia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/f2hyun/selenium_infectious_viral_disease_and_pneumonia/)\n\nIn addition, organic selenium compounds in fish like sardines are ACE inhibitors, although this may not include ACE2, which is the key one. It is not known if ACE inhibitors are effective against COVID-19, but it has been proposed ([https://f1000research.com/articles/9-72](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-72)). The type of inhibition we might want is probably in the translation aspect which reduces the quantity of ACE2 on cell membranes, which is how COVID gets in. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12562-019-01321-3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12562-019-01321-3) . On the other hand, ACE2, in contrast to ACE, can be anti-inflammatory and so inhibiting it may not be a good idea.\n\nPolyphenols, Terpenoids, Lignans, Lectins\n\nBetulinic Acid (mainly from birch bark) and lignin [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17663539](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17663539)\n\n*The selective index values (SI = CC50/EC50) of the most potent compounds 1, 5, 6, 8, 14, and 16 were 58, >510, 111, 193, 180, and >667, respectively. Betulinic acid (13) and savinin (16) were competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL protease with Ki values = 8.2 +/- 0.7 and 9.1 +/- 2.4 microM, respectively.

Lectins bound to the virions of both an alpha- and beta-coronavirus did inhibit infection \\[62\\], lending support to this idea.*\n\n*...While N. sativa and R. rosea extracts did not inhibit IBV, many of their phytochemicals are thought to be antiviral.

On the other hand, R. rosea root extracts consist of many kaempferol, herbacetin, dihydromyricetin, and myricetin derivatives \\[32\\]. Of these R. rosea compounds, kaempferol, gossypetin, and salidroside have shown strong antiviral effects against influenza and Coxsackie viruses \\[69,70\\].*\n\n*....Various combinations of S. nigra extract treatments also showed synergistic inhibition. For example, complete inhibition occurred when pre-treatment of virus was done in combination with post-infection treatment (Figure 4).

In mechanistic studies the influenza virus-specific hemagglutinin and neuraminidase were inhibited. In addition some extracts displayed anti-inflammatory activity in virus-infected cells, and numerous other effects on the expression of cellular genes. Multiple components, either discrete compounds or mixtures, appeared to be responsible for the various antiviral activities.*\n\nIn practice though trials in humans have been very mixed and this may have to do with differences in timing, dose, quality of extract.

But there again, there is some suggestion that once you have infection, the anti-inflammatory effect may be beneficial. \n\nAlso, when it comes to immune response, auto-immune and chronic inflammatory states lead to weak and less effective responses, because the body tells the immune system to be more tolerant. So, we want a strong but clean, specific response, not excessive. I believe if you have pre-existing chronic inflammation, things that reduce chronic inflammation, particularly via poor redox control, are a good idea and benefit a healthy immune response. \n\nEating blueberries every day, and apples, for example has measurable effects on this sort of thing.\n\nThanks for the links I'm checking them out, and will look into your suggestions.",

Firstly, viruses are nessesary functions in our toxic polluted world. SARS/coronavirus is a type of cold detoxification that utilizes a virus for cleansing the respiratory system. You do not want to try to stop this detoxification because interfering with such cleansing processes is very dangerous to the body. Furthermore, it is impossible to stop a virus in the first place because viruses are non-living proteins. We can generally nurture the body in times of detoxifications so that symptoms are less, but we cannot stop the body from acting when it decides to act. Viruses are not contagious. They are nessesary in times of systemic toxicity when our tissues are too toxic for living microbes to feed upon and eliminate. Viruses are then manufactured cellularly to dissolve these tissues and foreign debris and cellular waste. Coronavirus is not contagious. It is like any other virus, except this virus is a respiratory detoxification due to an accumulation of toxicity from China's polluted air. \n\nWhen a population breathes this in for extended periods, viruses occur to cleanse the body. Coronavirus is mostly an extended cold. Most cases are not verified, and the media is playing upon numbers to bring about fear to their own benefit. In order to verify if it is indeed coronavirus, it would cost thousands per patient to do blood work looking specifically for corona. There is no way they are doing this with all these people. They claim new numbers each day. It's too quick. China changed their nessesary symptoms to label cases of corona, which means even a common cold will most likely go on the list. They've done this numerous times before in times past with so-called pandemics.",

Certainly a strawman to say “buy cheaper” and then knock on all the cheap products that turn out to be shit. You realize it actually costs a shit ton in labor, materials, etc to make products like this yes? While AG1 is overpriced, that has nothing to do with him.

He also is definitely not short of potential sponsors waiting at his doorstep if he thought AG was compromising his integrity.

Talk about brain damage), lunesta, you name it, and nothing really worked and they all made me have crazy moods, highs and deep lows, confusion, daytime sleepiness, and I have a chronic eating disorder too and it made those behaviors deadly. I sunk hard with the Traz, which was the last one I tried. \nI’m on Prozac now, for depression and anxiety and that put me straight to sleep at almost any time for the first like 2 months, it was great! I take it at night at like 7, and I know it helps even though it doesn’t knock me out anymore. So I sleep maybe 4 or 5 hours a night and it works for me. Trying to eat better, and not eat late which I always used to do. And I walk for an hour every day outside, I know that helps-\nI hope you get some relief! The Prozac has been super helpful if you suffer from any type of depression etc. \nSo I’ll say prayers for you! Have a beautiful day!",
