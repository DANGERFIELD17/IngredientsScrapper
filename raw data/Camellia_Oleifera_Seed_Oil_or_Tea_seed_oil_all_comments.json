Skin care : lush happy skin face wash, lush argan face oil, luxe beauty vanille moisturiser, Pacifica retinol night creme. Massaging with Bian stone and tea seed oil a few times a week. I never used foundation in my life, but I consider to try that now. I prefer to just get rid of the redness somehow. Any suggestions for a vegan friendly cure? Or vegan and skin friendly cover up? I tried mineral foundation in a shop once but hated how it felt on my skin.",

        "body": "It looks like your skin is at the very least sensitive, and you may certainly have rosacea. \n\nFirst off, you should definitely add sunscreen (and probably kick the retinol or cut way back). Unfortunately, a lot of sunscreens can be triggers for rosacea - I have found the [SVR Sensifine](https://www.caretobeauty.com/nl/en/svr-sensifine-ar-cream-spf50-40ml/) to be both effective and not cause any issues. The whole [Sensifine range](https://fr.svr.com/collections/sensifine?logged_in_customer_id=&lang=en) is designed with sensitive and red skin in mind. I have only tried the sunscreen (it's a little difficult to get a hold of here in the United States, and my other face products are a good fit for me) - but it may be worth checking them out. Try doing a spot test along your jawline or part of your cheek to see how your skin reacts. \n\nAlso, happily, it looks like they are vegan and don't test on animals: (per their website \" We do not practice animal tests and thus respect the European regulations which prohibit the use of such methods.\" They are a French company and are quite affordable (drugstore prices) so you should be able to get a hold of them in the Netherlands. \n\nIn general, I would see a dermatologist to check on the rosacea - there are several \"types\" that manifest themselves in various ways. Knowing your triggers will make your life a lot more comfortable. But even if your skin is only run-of-the-mill sensitive - you should move to some \"basic\" products that are produced for sensitive skin and are without fragrances, dyes, etc. Vani-cream (which is cruelty free & vegan) is a good place to start. It is a bit sad because it is definitely not cute or fun - but good skin is worth sacrificing cute products! \n\nIf you do have rosacea, azelaic acid is a very effective treatment for a lot of people (myself included!) for flare-ups, etc. I use the one by The Ordinary (which seems to be mostly cruelty free & vegan - but there are a few conflicting reports in a quick search) - which is inexpensive and effective. \n\nI use a full regime by Biologique Recherche - it has done miracles for my skin redness, texture, etc. It is not cheap, but I find it worth the cost. I believe \\*most\\* of their products are vegan ([this site breaks it down by product](https://www.paullabrecque.com/collections/biologique-recherche-100-vegan-products), which is very helpful). If you were to be interested in this route, I would first visit a dermatologist to have a real diagnosis (or not!) about your rosacea). Then you could either have a facial at a BR salon (where the estheticians go through lots of training) or I believe you can have a free consult on [myBR.com](https://myBR.com) where you get to talk with a professional about your skin concerns and they will help you determine what you need. The products are very tailored for specific concerns, etc. and I would not recommend trying to buy products without guidance. \n\nGetting in touch with your skin in this way (even if you don't choose to try BR products) is very helpful - just because you have \"rosacea\" or \"sensitive skin\" does not fully define your issues. For example, I have rosacea (with redness, sensitivity, and flare-ups) AND very dry skin. These two are not often a combo and a lot of \"rosacea-friendly\" products have absolutely destroyed my skin. Take things slowly. Start small and listen to your skin. You'll know when it's happy!",

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

(you are \"supposed\" to patch test for two weeks to see if something irritates you, especially if acne-prone.) if anything tingles, burns, or causes bumps/clogged pores, stop using it immediately: none of these ingredients are \"actives\" (i.e., chemical exfoliants) and therefore cannot cause purging, so it's irritation. now, to the products! \n\n---------------------\n\n**the tl;dr version.** if you really just want a list of stuff to try first without all the explanations and potential variations, here are some recs that may or may not work for your specific face. \n\nAM: \ndon't wash your face; spritz with water or swipe with simple brand micellar water (if the pH of your tap water is high--more on this in the comments)\n\napply kikumasamune lotion high moist (via spray bottle or with your hands--it's a thin liquid despite the name)\n\napply cerave cream in the tub or dr. jart+ceramidin cream\n\napply canmake mermaid uv gel or another alcohol-free sunscreen\n\nPM: clean your sunscreen and/or makeup off with either banila co clean it zero cleanser, simple brand micellar water, or a cleansing milk/cream (see discussion in the comments)\n\nspritz with water (if the pH isn't too high)\n\napply kikumasamune lotion high moist\n\n[sheet mask if you want]\n\napply cerave/dr jart cream or (if everything else irritates you or you're really dry) vaseline\n\n---------------------\n\n**the long version: products to buy (decants of) first, and introduce one at a time, in this order***\n\n(1) A HYDRATING TONER (/\"LOTION,\" IF JAPANESE)\n\n* what? a thin liquid product containing humectants, ingredients that draw moisture to the skin. common humectants are glycerin, butylene glycol, propylene glycol, and hyaluronic acid. you will use this both morning and night.\n\n* why? to help hydrate your skin; many dry-skinned people have skin that doesn't produce much oil (\"dry\"), and many also have skin that doesn't contain much water (\"dehydrated\"). a hydrator can make your skin more comfortable quickly.\n\n* how do i choose which one(s) to buy? \n\n(a) have you ever had a bad reaction to skincare products in the past? check out the ingredient lists and see if there are ingredients in common--those might be problems for you. if you have a sensitivity to butylene glycol, your best bet may be a non-AB product: **heritage rosewater and glycerine toner.** (if someone has a glycerine-only AB product to rec, shout in the comments and i'll update!) \n\n(b) too much hyaluronic acid(/sodium hyaluronate) can make you drier, so it might be less risky to go with one that doesn't have hyaluronic acid too high in the ingredient list (higher = more of it). **kikumasamune lotion high moist** is extremely popular in this sub and is HA-free. so is the non-AB **mario badescu rosewater aloe herb spray**, which is cheap and easy to obtain in stores in the US (at ulta, for example).\n\n(c) is your skin damaged, peeling, or flaky? if so, it will benefit from ceramides+cholesterol (skin-repairing ingredients) in addition to a humectant. **rosette ceramide lotion and meishoku ceracolla lotion** have that ingredient combination--NOT the gels from the same lines, the \"lotions\" (liquids).\n\n(d) there are many other beloved potential options if you feel up for some research. if you are in europe and open to something non-AB, /u/Ronrinesu's got [an idea for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5koy14/4product_starter_haul_dry_skin_edition/dbqj2ok/).\n\n---------------------\n\n(2) A MOISTURIZER (\"cream,\" \"emulsion\") \n* what: a thing containing some amount of oil to \"seal in\" (occlude) the moisture (water) you are adding to your face with step 1, or else it will dry right back out again. you will use this after your toner both morning *and* night. \n\n* why: dry skin is lacking oil. oil helps seal in water and make your skin soft and able to like, move around without cracking. you need oil.\n\n* how do i decide which one to buy?\n\n(a) [this awesome post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/) lists occlusive ingredients, i.e., those that help seal in moisture. you will want to look for creams that contain ingredients like this.\n\n(b) as with toners, if your skin is flaky or peely, you will want a cream with ceramides+cholesterol. many people swear by **cerave \"in the tub.\"** you may prefer the more-expensive but really wonderful **dr. jart+ ceramidin cream.**\n\nlet me explain: CREAMS ARE A MINEFIELD. a lot of ingredients in moisturizers cause sensitivities for certain people, including:\n\n(i) fatty alcohols (benzyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, etc., etc., etc.) -- if you have a sensitivity to these, you may want to try just a plant oil, since moisturizing creams without them are hard to find. people love **rosehip, argan, and camellia/green tea seed oil**, among many other possible contenders.\n(ii) beeswax (if a cream causes breakouts, this could be a contributing factor)\n(iii) plant oils, e.g., shea butter, coconut oil, sunflower oil, argan oil, rosehip oil, etc. (but a lot of people's skin LOVES one or more plant oils, so don't assume anything about yourself without experience--just be aware that if you're getting bumps, breakouts, or irritation, a plant oil could be the culprit)\n(iv) coconut derivatives like capric/caprylic triglycerides\n\nultimately, you need to obtain small amounts of various creams and oils to test on your skin to see which of these sensitivities you have. start your research on creams with [this awesome list](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4xwoe1/best_products_for_common_skin_concerns_series_dry/) from dry-skinned folks (look under \"gels, emulsions, creams, lotions...\") \n\n(c) if creams are irritating your skin and you need *something* to hold you over until you figure out which ingredients to avoid: straight-up **vaseline** is *the* gold standard for reducing trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), and you can buy a tiny pot of it without making a big monetary commitment. yes, it is derived from petroleum; no, it is not toxic (purified for cosmetic use) or comedogenic (unlike plant oils, its molecular size is too big for it to clog pores). (only caveat is that it doesn't play well with sunscreen, so you'll need to find something else for daytime before you get to that step.) plain **mineral oil** also works pretty well (and feels less gross than vaseline); if you're in the US, snow river's wood oil is a plain, unscented mineral oil you can get for like, $4.\n\n---------------------\n\n(3) A GENTLE CLEANSER \n\n* what: a low-pH micellar water (check the original first-four post if you want a quick overview of why low pH is important), an oil-based cleanser that emulsifies (washes off) well, (ETA) or a cream or milk cleanser. (ETA:) *not* a foaming cleanser (harsh; you want to be gentle to your skin).\n\n* why? many western cleansers have a pH that is high enough to irritate skin or don't properly remove makeup and sunscreen. that basically means just washing your face stresses your skin. a cleanser that starts you off on a good footing can improve the overall situation.\n\n* how do i decide which ones to buy? if you don't mind scents and oil, i recommend you start with **banila co clean it zero** (in the US, you can buy sample/travel sizes on amazon for something like $2.50, in addition to decants available on /r/asianbeautyexchange). if mineral oil irritates your skin (rare but possible), the \"purity\" version doesn't contain it.\n\nif you want something you can buy in US drugstores, an oil-free option, or something you can swipe on with a cotton pad, **simple's micellar water** is a popular alternative (other micellar waters have high pHes--don't substitute).\n\n(ETA:) if you are ready to do some research to choose your own cleanser (highly recommended!), see the comments below for a long discussion about cream cleansers and milk cleansers (some AB, some not). as you will see, many of the more vocal dry-skinned folk seem to prefer them to oil cleansers.\n\n---------------------\n\n(4) A PROBABLY ALCOHOL-FREE SUNSCREEN \n\n* what: a sunscreen which, to be on the safe side, contains no alcohol. (as mentioned below, not all but many of us dry folks are sensitive to alcohol.) \n\n* why: it's the main way to prevent dark spots, post-blemish scarring (PIH), and signs of aging. \n\n* how do i decide which one to buy? the most oft-recommended alcohol-free one is **canmake mermaid uv gel.** here are [some other suggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/41y5s9/are_there_sunscreens_without_alcohol/). \n\n---------------------\n\n(5) BONUS ROUND because you can't be a total monk about your first haul: SHEET MASKS, if you want 'em\n\n* what? single-use fabric masks soaked in hydrating \"essence.\" \n\n* why? the fabric sheet acts as a physical occlusive to hold water onto your skin. the single serving means you can try various ingredient combinations without a big commitment. (yes, the packaging is wasteful. yes, a lot of them are expensive. yes, it's ridiculous that they're single-use. if you're not into it, ignore this part and count your saved money!)\n\n* how do i decide which ones to buy? (make sure to isolate introductions of masks as you would other products; don't do two new things at the same time.)\n\n(a) do you mind heavily scented things? that will narrow the field a lot. (searching for unscented sheet masks should get you on the right path quickly.)\n\n(b) next, narrow your search by your other skin concerns, e.g., calming, brightening, anti-acne. or check out the favorites on beloved blogs like fifty shades of snail, vanity rex, and 35th of may, whose proprietors are members of this sub (the last two have dry skin).\n\n(c) check ingredient lists to help you avoid alcohol high in the ingredient list. (for example, innisfree it's real masks are sort of notorious for alcohol content.)\n\n(d) do you want my idiosyncratic and highly personal recommendations? here you go: **illi camellia** (contains camellia/green tea seed oil); **tosowoong dr. troubex** (a nice introduction to fermented ingredients, with lots of calming things like centella and licorice); anything **lululun** (they come in multi-packs and have less essence, which i personally prefer); **elizavecca donkey steam cream masks** (these are one of a kind--coated in thick cream, not \"essence\"). all of these are available by the box in the US on amazon, mostly for $1.50/sheet or less, or you can find some singly at memebox or /r/asianbeautyexchange.\n\n---------------------\n\nPRO TIPS FOR CARING FOR DRY SKIN:\n\n(1) you may not need to actually *wash* your face in the morning. many of us just splash with water. (ETA:) the water where you live may have a too-high pH. you might want to swipe with the micellar water (the pH of which is consistent and low enough, unlike that of tap or bottled water) instead.\n\n(2) spritz your face with a spray bottle of water as the first step in the routine. (it gives humectants something to draw into your skin.)\n\n(3) you may have a sensitivity to ethanol/\"alcohol\"/denatured alcohol/\"alcohol denat\" high on ingredient lists. not all of us do, but a lot of us do. \n\n(4) abandon any preconceptions that heavy night creams will cause breakouts. irritating ingredients will; occlusion on dry skin will not. \n\n(5) a lot of people put toner on their lips and then seal it in with lip balm. this may not be FDA approved, but it can really help with the dryness.\n\nhappy hunting!",

The only thing I would suggest, is to check your water's pH level as well, especially if you are just splashing water for one of your cleansing sessions. It took me a while to figure this out. I think I was reading a review on Fiftyshadesofsnails where she mentioned being surprised how high her water's pH was, and something clicked. When I tested mine, it was in the 8-9ish range! So sometimes even just splashing water can irritate the face just as easily as those high pH cleansers. I switched to a quick swipe of Simple's micellar water in the morning instead, and the difference in my skin was astounding. So yeah, just wanted to put that out there, because your water is usually the last culprit you would expect!",

    "body": "Here are some tidbits for the new units and dragons introduced in this New Year raid event. A lot of thought and care were done with the characters in my humble opinion. Kudos again to the writers of Dragalia Lost. Okay, so here we go:\n\n- **Marishiten**: Our androgynous dragon was based of **Marici**. In Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, Marici is a deva or bodhisattva associated with light and the Sun. She is known as *Molizhitian* or *Molizhitian Pusa* in China, *Marishi-ten* in Japan and *Özer Chenma* in Tibet.\n\nSource: http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/kankiten-idaten-other-tenbu.html#marishiten\n\n- **Ieyasu**: Our newest 5* blade user for the Dark element, Ieyasu is most likely based on the famous **Tokugawa Ieyasu**. Known as one of the Three Unifiers of Japan along Hideyoshi and Nobunaga, he was the founder and the first Shogun of the Tokugawa Shogunate which then ruled during the Battle Of Sekigahara in 1600 until the Meiji Restoration in 1868.\n\nSource: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu\n\n- **Shishimai**: As it is so obvious from the design, the name of our raid boss *Shishimai* is the Japanese term for **lion dance**. It is traditional dance performed in China and other Asian countries where performers mimic a lion's movements which is said to believe to bring good luck and fortune. It's usually performed at important occasions such as when a new business establishment opens, weddings, special celebrations, or to honor special guest in Chinese communities.\n\nSource: http://thelionarts.com/history.html\n\n- **Botan**: Our annoying free character for this event (I'll get a lot of flak for this for sure), her name refers to flowering plant **peony** (it does appear in her artwork). In Japan, the root is used to treat convulsions. It is also cultivated as a garden plant, and is affectionately called the **King of Flowers** or the **Prime Minister of Flowers**. Peony is also prominent in Japanese tattoo. The popular use of the flower was inspired by illustrations of ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Kinoyoshi's rendition of *Suikoden*. His paintings of the heroes included the peony, among other symbols. The peony became a masculine motif, which associated with recklessness and disregard for consequence (guess that's the reason why Botan has a devil-may-cry attitude and would charge into danger with no hesitation).\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peony\n\n- **Sazanka**: The other female character introduced in this event, she is based of the flower called **Sazanka** (which is also the design in her kimono and her hairpin). The *Sasanqua Camellia* is a species of the camellia plant native to Japan and China, and is usually found on high altitudes. It has a long history of cultivation in Japan and mostly has a lot of practical than decorative purpose. The leaves are used to make tea, while the seeds are used as tea seed oil which is used for lighting lamps, used a lubricant, can also be used for cooking or a cosmetic ingredient.\n\nSource: https://web.archive.org/web/20120204064125/http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/welcome_to_bgt/tomah/garden_features/blooming_calendar/Camellias\n\n- **Addis**: This is a tough one, but I'm thinking it is possible he was based on the city of **Addis Ababa** in Ethiopia (he may also be from there, in a fictional sense). Since he's the canon foreigner of the group, this could be the case. It's possible as well that he was also inspired from **Yasuke**, a samurai of African origin who served under Oda Nobunaga. It is said that Yasuke came from either Mozambique, Sudan or Ethiopia. According to Japanese historians, the first Africans that arrived in Japan were slaves brought by the Portuguese. Another theory states that Yasuke was from the ethnic group *Habshi* of Ethiopia. The Portuguese would call this ethnic group *cafre* (lit. savage, beastly) due to this group being well-built and skilled soldiers. Addis does sure have these qualities (a brash, but capable warrior).\n\nSource: \nhttps://storyateverycorner.com/Addis-Ababa/\n\nSo, there you have it. Thank you for letting me indulge on this for a bit, and if you were able to read through it, a bigger thank you for that.\n\nEnjoy the game and see you during the raid, guys. 👍",

The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

    "body": "This isn't a new product (to me or the sub) but I rarely see it talked about, so I figured I would give it a review. I've been using this cleansing oil on and off for about 18 months.\n\n**Skin type:** I'm in my 30s, and my skin is generally oily (formerly dehydrated/oily), but has recently become a lot more dry due to the dry winter weather and prescription tretinoin use. My primary skin concerns run a wide gamut - I'm focused on anti-aging because of my age, but I also have acne, clogged pores, PIH, and melasma. My skin is very, very clog prone. Basically, my skin is a \"special snowflake\" that thinks the world should tremble in fear.\n\n**Location/weather:** I live in the Mid-Atlantic area of the US, so the weather is hot and humid in the summer, and cold and dry in the winter.\n\n**Other first cleansers I have tried:**\n\n* Heimish All Clean Balm\n* LJH Dr's Care Cleansing Oil\n* Whamisa Organic Flowers Cleansing Oil\n\nI have also, in the past, tried traditional OCM with mineral oil. It did not go well (lots of clogs), and in general, I now try to avoid cleansing oils with mineral oil in them, hence why I haven't tried some of the more popular cleansing oils on this sub. The LJH Dr's Care also contains mineral oil, and also didn't go over well with my skin.\n\nAnyway, onto the actual review.\n\n**Ingredients (copied from Ulta.com):** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Bis-Ethoxydiglycol Cyclohexane 1,4-Dicarboxylate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Water, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Black Sugar Extract, Sodium Pca, Betaine, Threonine, Sorbitol, Proline, Lysine, Lepidium Meyenii Root Extract, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Alanine, Butylene Glycol, Cholesterol, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Serine, Glycine, Alcohol Denat., Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Ceramide Np, Sarcodon Aspratus Extract, Sucrose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium Edta.\n\n**Price:** This oil cleanser is easily found on tons of websites. I most often buy from Amazon, and pay about $14-15 USD for a 200mL bottle.\n\n**Smell:** This oil smells *strongly* of lemon, with the faint hint of sugar. The smell is very noticeable on application, but once the cleanser is rinsed off, it dissipates completely. I happen to like the smell, but others may find it a little too reminiscent of Lemon Pledge.\n\n**Texture:** This cleansing oil seems rather thin - it seems to be slightly thinner and less viscous than vegetable oil. Sometimes this is annoying, as I have to use a little more oil than I'd like to really massage my face well without pulling my skin (3 pumps or so).\n\n**Cleansing Power:** In my opinion, this oil cleanser does a fantastic job with face makeup and sunscreen. It does not excel with waterproof eyeliner and mascara - it will remove some but not all waterproof eye makeup. I, however, do not like to use this on my eyes. I wear contact lenses and it always causes them to get milky, making it difficult to see. The cloudy residue lasts several hours. I do not know if this would impact someone who doesn't wear contacts. However, with face makeup and sunscreen, as well as with some superficial clogs, this oil cleanser does a great job. I sometimes, but not routinely, feel grits coming out of my skin. It does not help break up deeper clogs or closed-head blemishes.\n\n**Emulsification:** This stuff turns pretty darned white when mixed with water. I make sure to rinse all traces of it off my face so I don't see any of the cleanser, especially near my hairline. It emulsifies and rinses off easily, and doesn't leave any feeling of residue on my face. I always follow with a second cleanser, but I do not feel a film or greasiness with this cleanser. It also doesn't make my skin feel tight or dry - just clean.\n\n**Overall:** I really like this cleanser and have repurchased it many times. At the price point, it does what I need it to do. It breaks down the face makeup (Mac Studio Fix Fluid or Estee Lauder Double wear, topped with Innisfree powder) and my sunscreen (La Roche Posay Ultra Fluid). It rinses cleanly, and it is inexpensive and easy to find. I don't expect **any** cleanser to address aging concerns, or to meaningfully use acids. Any claims of brightening from a cleanser are probably worthless, since the product isn't on your face long enough to do any meaningful chemical exfoliation. This cleanser is best at what it does not do: it doesn't create new acne for me and it doesn't irritate my skin.\n\nIt is probably not my favorite of all oil cleansers. Right now that would be Whamisa, which is great, but expensive, and which also doesn't seem to penetrate pores as deeply as the Skinfood cleanser. Skinfood Black Sugar Perfect Cleansing Oil is a great choice that I will probably continue to buy it, especially since it's easy to get in the United States. I think it's an excellent pick for a first cleanser that isn't based on mineral oil, but only if you are not sensitive to fragrances.",

I think the fragrance in it is lighter as well :) If you're looking to try something new I would recommend!",

Mostly wanted to comment on using it for eye makeup removal and me not wearing contacts. I use waterproof mascara and this product does a really good job removing it. Part of why I stayed with this oil is because it doesn't make my eyes sting when I use it to remove tight-lined eyeliner. The only problem I've had with it is some slightly blurry vision like you'll get with any liquidy product that's in your eyes, but even that effect seems to not be as present anymore since they updated the product.",

Still probably way higher than most other brands).\n\nThough with these products in general, particularly for the ones with “real” (not pseudo/ceramide precursors), honestly I would be shocked if they were present at more than 0.1 %. Even if they come before the preservatives, the preservatives are probably present at like 0.9% so the company can list them after the fancy ingredients even though the expensive ingredients are at minuscule concentrations. Maybe I’m too cynical, but a >1% concentration of any ceramides would be such a HUGE selling point (not to mention very expensive to produce) that I can’t believe they’re not advertising it\n\nLike Regimen is coming out with one and they are trumpeting the HELL out of it (and I mean fair enough)",

I was over at r/tretinoin and saw a shared post on how sunblock inhibits blocks UV ([original thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tretinoin/comments/jf7k06/psa_this_is_how_important_spf_is/)). People were commenting on how the model in the video missed the neck, chest, and under eyes. And then I realized, \"wait a minute, I don't put sunscreen on my lips...\" Further wake-up via the thread on r/SkincareAddiction that unprotected lip can also lead to skin cancer ([thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8q4vvd/psa_remember_to_use_sunscreen_on_your_lips/)). Hence the search for AB lip product with SPF.\n\nI searched within AB for product suggestions on this topic but most of the discussion threads seemed to be from 4-5 years ago. So I went on to hunt for some Japanese AB lip care products with SPF. I'm here to share my findings!\n\n**Edit:** I've added to the product info whether if the company test on animal (cruelty-free)!! Fortunately, all five companies don't conduct the tests!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things to note:**\n\n* I can't find a conclusive study or expert suggestions on how much SPF there should be for lip products ([doc here says \"15 or higher\"](https://www.prevention.com/beauty/skin-care/g26934681/best-lip-balm-with-spf/), [another says \"30 or above\"](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lip-balms-spf-protection)). I know SPF 30 is the rule of thumb for face and body, but I only found THREE products with AB lip care products with SPF 30 or higher in my search so far. I used SPF 25 as a cut off point for my list below.\n* All products should be in production (hence listing official company pages below).\n* I haven't tried any of these products, so I can't comment outside of the product specs given.\n* I have ZERO affiliation with the brands below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Product info given below:**\n\n1.

    "body": "**Welcome to our Introduction to Camellia Oil.**\n\n\nThese threads are to introduce you to ingredients that are common (and not so common) in Asian Beauty products and their benefits, history and the science behind them. You can check out our other guides [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeautyAdvice/wiki/guides).\n\n\n**Later in the week we will be hosting an ingredient megathread for the community to share products that contain these ingredients - and their thoughts on each of them.**\n\n\n*If you would like to see an ingredient not yet covered, or would like to help research a future ingredient please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsianBeautyAdvice)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n------------\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##**History of Camellia Oil**\n\n\nCamellia oil is derived from the seeds of the camellia plant, which has several-hundred different species. The three most common types of camellia used in skincare are camellia sinensis (the green tea plant), camellia japonica, and camellia oleifera. Camellia plants grow throughout eastern Asia and are especially popular in China, Japan, and Korea. Camellia sinensis is part of traditional Chinese Medicine and Korean Hanbang. Camellia Japonica is popular in Japan for hair care both as a conditioner or treatment pack and combed through dry hair to add shine and suppleness. Camellia oleifera is most heavily produced in China, where it is used extensively as a cooking oil.\n\nIt has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-bacterial properties.\n \nLong term ingestion of camellia oleifera is believed to “prevent cardiovascular sclerosis, lower blood pressure, lower blood lipid, delay atherosclerosis (AS), increase gastrointestinal absorption function, promote hormone secretion of endocrine glands, prevent decline of neurological function, improve human immunity, and prevent cancer.”\n\n&nbsp;\n\n------------\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###**Types of Camellia Oil and Key Components**\n\n\n***Camellia Japonica:***\n\n\n- Also known as Tsubaki oil\n- Fatty acid composition: Oleic acid 82.4 to 88%; Linoleic acid 1.9 to 4.1%; palmitic acid 7.7 to 11.2%; stearic acid 1.7 to 3%\n\n\n***Camellia Oleifera:***\n\n\n- Also known as Tea Seed Oil\n- An edible oil with a fatty acid composition similar to olive oil\n- High in vitamin E (twice as much as olive oil) and contains squalene and flavonoids with anti-inflammatory functions\n- Fatty acid composition: Oleic acid 78 to 86%; Linoleic acid 9.4 to 10.2%; palmitic acid 8.8%; stearic acid 2%\n\n\n***Camellia Sinensis:***\n\n\n- The tea plant, makes both green and black tea.\n- High in antioxidants\n- Fatty acid composition: Oleic acid 52.-57.5%; Linoleic acid 22.3 to 24.2%; palmitic acid 15.3 to 17%; stearic acid 3.3 to 3.8%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n-------------\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n###**Scientific Studies**\n\n\n- A study done in Korea found that camellia japonica oil reduced trans-epidermal water loss up to two hours after treatment. It also determined that japonica oil may be effective at treating wrinkles by inducing human type I procollagen synthesis.\n\n- Another study in Korea showed that extracts from the leaf and stems of camellia japonica have antimicrobial effects against Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus, a leading cause of skin conditions including acne.\n\n- A study in China examined the efficacy of camellia oleifera as a treatment for ulcers. The study found strong protection against oxidative damage to the stomach and intestine produced by the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n- A study on camellia oleifera, camellia reticulata, and camellia sasanqua found all three to have antioxidant and antibacterial effects.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n-------------------\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###**Fun Facts:**\n\n\nThe fungus mycelia sterilia, which grows on camellia japonica plants, is used to produce emodepside, a de-worming drug for animals with parasites that are resistant to traditional antiparasitic drugs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---------------------\n\n**Sources and Additional Reading**\n \n \n[How to use Japanese Camellia (Tsubaki) Oil](https://wawaza.com/pages/How-to-Use-Japanese-Camellia-Tsubaki-Oil.html)\n\n\n[Effect of Camellia japonica oil on human type I procollagen production and skin barrier function](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874107000700)\n \n \n[Antimicrobial and Antioxidant Activity of Camellia japonica Extracts for Cosmetic Applications](http://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=KHGSBC_2013_v28n2_99)\n \n \n[Anti-inflammatory activity of Camellia japonica oil](http://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=E1MBB7_2012_v45n3_177)\n \n \n[Antioxidant Activity and Bioactive Compounds of Tea Seed (Camellia oleifera Abel.)

    "body": "What are your thoughts on brands who through the years alter their ingredients into a product that no longer resembles their original.\n\nWhen Bare Minerals came out, they touted themselves as a healthy makeup, no toxins, “so healthy you can sleep in it” and all that stuff.\nAll their products were just minerals and no fillers. Powder products only. I didn’t like them - but I respected their vision.\n\nThey sold to Shisedo and then they came out with Bare Skin. A liquid foundation that was fitting in with their theme.\n\nBare Skin Ingredients \nActive Ingredients: Titanium dioxide 11.0%. Inactive Ingredients: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Coconut Alkanes, Silica, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Lecithin, Glycerin, Maltodextrin, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Jojoba Esters, Propylene Carbonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Soil Minerals/Syringa Vulgaris (Lilac) Leaf Cell Culture Extract, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol. May Contain: Mica, Iron Oxides, Titanium Dioxide.\n\nThen they released Complexion Protection, another liquid\n\nComplexion Protection Ingredients \n\nACTIVE INGREDIENTS: Titanium dioxide 6.2%\nINACTIVE INGREDIENTS: water, coconut alkanes, propanediol, squalane,\ntrehalose, isostearic acid, glycerin, silica, agar, caprylic/capric\ntriglyceride, globularia cordifolia callus culture extract, salicornia\nherbacea extract, melilotus officinalis extract, coco-caprylate/caprate,\nbutylene glycol, lauroyl lysine, sodium hyaluronate, succinoglycan,\npolysorbate 60, cellulose gum, polyglyceryl-4 laurate/succinate,\nsorbitan sesquiisostearate, magnesium stearate, magnesium hydroxide,\nmagnesium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, potassium\nsorbate, phenoxyethanol. may contain: titanium dioxide, iron oxides.\n\nTHEN most recently they released Bare Pro -sigh-\nWater, Cyclopentasiloxane , Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Butylene Glycol, Silica, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Bis-Butyldimethicone Polyglyceryl-3, Bambusa Arundinacea Stem Extract, Sodium Glutamate, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Sorbitan Sesquiisostearate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Methicone, Papain, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Algin, Tocopherol, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Phenoxyethanol. May Contain: Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides.\n\nNot terrible, but I feel like this is totally the opposite of what Leslie intended for her brand.\n\nWhat prompted this entire thing, was they just released a new Blush called Gen Nude and it felt soooo different from Bare. I turn it over and look at the ingredients. I was shocked!  All of us in the store working were so surprised to see Bare release this.\n\nMy ingredient lists go from their original blush - 4 ingredients. To the Ready Blush which is still pretty good and then we go to Gen Nude!\n\nLoose Blush Ingredients \n\nBismuth Oxychloride (CI 77163), Mica (CI 77019), Carmine (CI 75470),\nIron Oxide (CI 77491)\n\nReady Blush Ingredients \n\nMica, Lauroyl Lysine, Boron Nitride, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate,\nCaprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Corallina Officinalis Extract,\nOctyldodecyl Stearoyl Stearate, Alaria Esculenta Extract, Tocopherol,\nCamellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Calcium\nKetogluconate, Silica, Carmine (Ci 75470). May Contain: Titanium Dioxide\n(Ci 77891), Iron Oxides (Ci 77491, 77492, 77499), Manganese Violet (Ci\n77742).\n\nGen Nude Blush Ingredients \n\nSynthetic Fluorphlogopite, Diisostearyl Malate, Dipentaerythrityl Hexahydroxystearate, Lauroyl Lysine, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Triethylhexanoin, Sorbitan Sesquiisostearate, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Tocopherol, Barium Sulfate, Silica, Alumina, Tin Oxide, Chlorphenesin. May Contain (+/-): Mica, Carmine (Ci 75470), Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Iron Oxides (Ci 77491, Ci 77492, Ci 77499), Red 7 Lake (Ci 15850).\n\n4 Dimethicones/Polymers\n\nThey started on QVC saying they would never use synthetic ingredients - and here we are.\n\nI will say the blush looks beautiful on the skin and could compete with any blush out there. So I can understand why they made these changes. However, they haven’t adjusted their marketing and image for these new changes.  They have clientele who have been using Bare since the first day and who refuse to use anything else because Bare is the only thing that won’t bother their skin/is natural/is safe....etc. \n\nThis isn’t a post about Bare, but I am using them as a example as the blush really threw me for a loop. \n\nHow do you feel about brands who not only evolve (as all brands must) but also change what appear to be their core values to remain relevant?",

Even that felt like a sell-out to me...and to see how far they've come now is a whole different level of disappointment. I loved that they had a focus and \"priorities,\" and now that they've done a 180 on those I feel like they've really sold out. Personally I refuse to buy anything other than the loose powder products from them on principle (lol...maybe that belongs on the \"petty\" thread but I don't care).\n\nHonestly I can't think of another brand that had such strong guiding principles to begin with and then tossed them all to the side in pursuit of profit. I don't have a problem with brands changing their focus somewhat (like how UD used to be more alternative makeup and now they're very mainstream), but when your focus is based on \"principle\" and you abandon it completely I really lose respect for you as a brand.",

i mean azami's stuck as a middle schooler and fujimori's gonna keep aging but...\n* wished the cg's were paced consistently \n* wished there was a better conclusion for the overall plot since rin only returned 1/5 hell escapees like she still has her work cut out for her 😭\n\noverall, i rly enjoyed kiku's route! it was a good intro to the game and he gives a whole new meaning to puppy love 🥰\n\nyona ~\n\npositives: \n* yona's more of a brash tsundere but that just made his blush sprites even more endearing 🥹\n* KING ENMA TEASING US ABOUT OUR CRUSH comedic gold i still hear him saying \"FALLEN IN LOVE DA\" \n* rin reading that smutty part of yona's book 🤣\n* him getting excited from the ocean salts was adorable \n* HIS JEALOUSY SCENES WE CHEERED\n* his backstory of being mixed and unaccepted was interesting \n* WINGMAN SHARAKU MAKES AN APPEARANCE AGAIN YASS\n* the blood pool scene w/ rin tearing yona's shirt and confessing their feelings and sharing their first kiss AHHHHHH\n* yona asking king enma permission to date us made my heart flutter \n* THE BLUE ROSE HE GAVE US FROM US GIVING HIM THE OCEAN 🥹\n* liked his vulnerability during his final battle w/ sansaburo abt feeling the need to leave his mark on the world when he was alive and learning it was all in vain but life doesn't always have to be like that 💔\n* liked his character development of being stuck in his old ways to being open to the new things in the human realm \n* yona delivering that kid's letter to king enma 🥹 i love this man\n\nnegatives: \n* wish the cg's were paced better it felt like forever til the 2nd one appeared 😭\n* rin catching feelings for yona after he inadvertently got her shot was ??? like i felt like it would've made sense if she caught feelings after having a cute scene w/ yona ya feel? \n* wish we got more couple cg's as opposed to the solo cg's yona had \n* plot of trying to capture the escapees felt more stagnant here \n* again wish the overall plotline wrapped up better \n\neven tho yona irritated me the most in the common route i rly grew to love him! underneath that hard exterior is just a soft baby 🥰\n\nsharaku ~\n\npositives: \n* i was very attracted to his vulgar, sassy, and cocky personality like i can't explain it y'all but he always managed to get a giggle out of me \n* ^ this but him also being a clean freak also makes me giggle not the gap moe 🤣\n* not to mention he's very observant, blunt, and cynical? okayyy complexity\n* rin better than me i would've pounced on sharaku the moment he asked to sleep w/ us 👀 \n* using dice to make decisions was a fun quirk of his\n* HIM SELLING THE ONSEN WATER LMAOOOOO HE'S SO UNSERIOUS\n* his banter was entertaining \n* the school uniform date was cuteee\n* the tea seed oil <3 \n* his backstory of being a prostitute and putting his customers out of misery was interesting and heartbreaking \n* \"don't stop w/ the eyelids. go for my lips too.\" AND IF I DIE??? \n* liked his character development of turning his guilt/atonement as motivation to protect others \n\nnegatives: \n* the romance development oh god where do i start\n* felt like rin gaslit herself into having feelings for sharaku since everyone kept saying her face looked like she was in love? as opposed to having a crush on sharaku from growing closer and having sweet moments w/ him\n* sharaku's kiss in the photo booth made me squeal yes but it still felt random and misplaced? the timing didn't feel right and that kiss didn't feel \"earned\" so to speak \n* ^ actually the whole scene after the kiss where rin runs off to the wisteria well and basically confirms her feelings for sharaku was underwhelming especially since kiku and yona had such sweet confession scenes :/ like wdym y'all kiss and we confess but y'all aren't an official couple yet? BLASPHEMY! \n* sharaku's feelings weren't that well foreshadowed and developed either imo like when nono sensei claimed sharaku was in love w/ rin i was like cool! ... can i see it? \n* i needed more vulnerable moments and more heart fluttering/romantic scenes from sharaku ngl especially in the beginning/middle like wrap up the horny antics already 😭✋🏽 give me love. give me affection. give me DERE. \n* speaking of vulnerability, considering i interpret sharaku's hyper sexuality as a trauma response from being a sex worker, i desperately WISHED the writers explore him having a fear of emotional intimacy and a hard time  expressing himself like that could've been saur good and make sense for his character! like imagine a scene where he opens up to rin abt how he feels like he can never have true love bc everyone in his past only saw him for his body and rin just reassures him that he's more than his body and describes his good character and they both get emotional... ugh typing this out is making me bitter SOMEONE PUT ME ON THE WRITING TEAM ALREADY SMH\n* i love teasing banter but man i wish sharaku didn't have the upper hand all the time 😭 i needed rin to get her lick back and make sharaku flustered herself :(\n* wish we got to know more abt asaemon as a villain/character. like ok yes he's crazy strong but what else? like what are his motivations? his character just felt shallow.\n* narratively, i felt like the bit in goemon's route where sharaku draws shonosuke should've been in his route instead to highlight his skills and give rin a reason to warm up to him since he helped her bestie. \n\nafter the common route, sharaku's character interested me the most and i was very much looking forward to his route, but the romance progression left me disappointed. talk about wasted potential 🫠 but regardless, i can't help but be attracted to his personality and unserious antics so he still gets a pass from me 🙇🏽‍♀️\n\njack ~ \n\npositives: \n* NOT HIS GAP MOE of carrying around nyaofuls for cats, making his own tea, and crying when goemon bought him a mug 😭🥹\n* when he said to himself that he can't wait to manipulate us in private but then HE ACCIDENTALLY REVEALED HE KNEW US AS KING ENMA'S DAUGHTER LMAOOO SO UNSERIOUS \n* the hell prisoners trying to sabotage their date 😭💀\n* him calling ichise for ryoma was sweet\n* his backstory was so interesting! i knew smth was different abt him but i wouldn't have predicted that he was a cursed immortal :o\n* jack giving us sweet mochi to make his return to us 🥹\n* ^ and the gifts he gave to the rest of the boys and tama oh i love this man\n* ichise was a compelling villain! and i love how he asked jack for a song at the end 🥹\n* found family trope slayed\n* jack dropping his contact lens in the shower was the perfect ending for me 🤣\n\nnegatives: \n* cg's were paced horribly omg bc why am i not getting jack's 3rd cg until chapter NINE?? \n* enemies to lovers trope fell flat and i think that's bc the writers didn't know how to navigate jack's villainy? like he never felt like a true threat 😭\n* wanted more heart fluttering and romantic scenes ngl i felt like the cg's we got had a sexual undertone which slays but i need more sweet scenes especially once u realize how adorably pathetic jack is 😭\n* considering jack's route was locked i anticipated the route to have a better plot line or important reveal around the escapees but that wasn't the case at all? so i don't think his route NEEDED to be locked at all 😭 which is disappointing bc if u have a locked route i EXPECT u to bring some spice to the table and well... he brought salt\n* okuni attacking jack felt random??? \n* i don't like how their official confession and first kiss was crammed into the 2nd to last cg \n* considering jack got famous for his songs i wish he spoke more abt it to us and that aspect was included more in his route like that could've been good for bonding time and we could've gotten a cute cg of him teaching rin abt his musical process like imagine him wrapping his arms around rin so that he can teach her how to play the guitar UGHHHH #wastedpotential \n\nwe only got a glimpse of jack in the common route so he was truly a wild card for me. unfortunately the writing was overall underwhelming but the good parts were enough for me to give him a pass. not life changing but still enjoyable imo\n\ngoemon ~\n\npositives: \n* oh the YEARNING \n* loved how he always looked out for rin\n* the winter daphnes 🥹\n* when it was revealed that he got the sandwiches for her 🥰\n* i did not expect kamuro to be shonosuke omg that gagged me\n* goemon's semi aggressive confession made me giggle \"do i seem like the kind of crazy that would give flowers to a girl i didn't like?\" like he ate that...\n* his relationship w/ fujimori was sweet \n* final battle was intense yet interesting \n* found family trope slayed \n* appreciated rin's character development of lying and running away to facing her past straight on and fighting for her goals\n* kamuro getting sliced got a chuckle out of me god he was annoying 🤣\n\nnegatives: \n* romance progression was staler than expired bread. it relied TOO MUCH on goemon's preexisting feelings like. ok can we develop the relationship in the present? 🙄\n* speaking of, goemon's and rin's past romance wasn't all that compelling? like ok rin was the sweet disabled girl that served some tasty dango but like. is that it? 😭 bc for goemon's strong, powerful love to last CENTURIES when they didn't even confess OR kiss... it was giving nothing \n* ^ so i wish we could've gotten more endearing interactions of how they fell in love w/ each other be it w/ some more sweet dialogue or an adorable cg to justify how goemon's love was so deep to leave him in hell for all those centuries \n* ^ and i have the same issue w/ their romance progression in the current day i wish we got more heart fluttering, romantic tension scenes in the beginning to strongly develop their love and romantic feelings on rin's side\n* cg's were (again) paced horribly and the cg poses weren't rly that memorable tbh (they also felt super short?)\n* rin falling for goemon felt inorganic. like yes he's nice but they didn't have any significant scenes or cg's to convince me that she was falling in love. if anything the game just told us in text that she was crushing rather than showing and i was just supposed to believe that? 😭\n* their interactions weren't that interesting like aside from the investigating, it was just rin swooning over goemon while being jealous of his lover and goemon just being sad underneath and yearning for rin like c'mon. give me banter. give me jokes. give me flirting. give me smth NOT related to their past 🙄 like we got him making paper stars for tama but what else?? \n* i was immersed in his route til after oshichi and kamuro met then everything felt like a drag til the final battle ngl\n* kamuro's and shiroku's betrayals both came out of NOWHERE 😭 like at least foreshadow it ugh \n* while the final battle was entertaining some stuff just felt like it was pulled out of thin air like the betrayals? jack joining in to defend us? the macabre party shit? rin and goemon upgrading their desires? \n* the game implied that rin and fujimori were related but that never went anywhere? like what was the point of rin saying that she felt like he was a younger brother to her if he wasn't tf\n* i felt like goemon's character didn't change that much? or at least his character development wasn't super significant like yay he's still nice, mature, selfless, a good leader, and loyal? but like. where are the flawsss\n* jack was shoehorned into the friend group like sure he can stay ig? 😭\n* goemon, how are u going to join in the misogyny parade and claim u hate women in that one scene in the common route when the only ppl that did u wrong in the past were Men? 🤔BYEEE 😭 dude ur hating on the wrong gender smh... (no but fr why did he say that? 😭) \n\ncongrats to tengoku struggle's goemon for being the first true route poster boy i consider to be the worst li in a game. i mean it's not a good thing but it's still an achievement like damn never thought the day would come :o like i was rushing to finish his route by the end bc i was OVER IT. \n\nbut yeah goemon was cool as a concept but man the writers did not execute him greatly. in my eyes, his route lacked both an engaging plot and a strong character like even if i consider sharaku's and jack's routes to be mid at least them as characters weren't boring! \n\nok final ranking goes: kikunosuke > yona > sharaku > jack > goemon\n\ngeneral gripes w/ the game:\n* how is rin supposed to be valedictorian of hell guardian school when she's, for the most part, insignificant in battle? 😭 she had her moments w/ her whip yeah and i don't expect her to Overpowered but when she claimed she was gonna be a new type of hell guardian and just stood still🧍🏽‍♀️whenever violence broke out i just laughed i'm sorry like girl u can't even deescalate the situation? even cxm rookie ichika was better than that 😭\n* WHEN RIN CLAIMS TO BE A MISANDRIST but warms up to the boys after they save fujimori even after that misogyny parade scene bc it proves that they were good ppl underneath... like i get where she's coming from but at the end of the day they only saved a man 😭 and they still were misogynistic atp 😭 like they explicitly said they hated women hello? i expected a WAY better relationship progression after that whole scene and was left disappointed at their development 😒 the camaraderie btwn rin and the boys from that point on just did Not feel organic or \"earned\" but ofc i had to deal w/ it for plot purposes... anyways get up rin ur just not a Tru misandrist like the rest of us sorry i would've made them grovel!\n* the cg's. were poorly paced, shortly timed, and lacked memorable poses. which irks me bc olympia soiree did not have these issues? the cg's were consistently paced and lasted a good portion of the scene, making it more memorable and the poses were saur good and complimented the romantic narrative so now i'm just laying here like... what went wrong? 😭 this is important to me bc whenever i think of a route my mind instantly goes to the cg's like that's the PUSSY part of an otoge and the representation of the characters' heart fluttering moments in their romance progression like DEFINITELY smth u don't wanna lack on and well. it lacked here...\n* for the most part, the villains had as much depth as my ultra thin pads. THEY WERE SO ONE DIMENSIONAL? which results in the plot being weak bc poorly written villains go hand in hand w/ shallow conflicts. at least in cxm we got to understand the villains' motives and they even served as foils to the love interests! but here [checks notes] azami was good but her conflict dragged too long. sansaburo and okuni just ate food and walked around town. asaemon thinks slicing ppl is a personality trait. tatsumi was good too but wasn't even from hell so it felt a bit wasted. ikari actually served his role well as a lackey. shinobikuni's backstory was tragic but her psyche and motivations needed to be explored more. and for the head of the group we interacted w/ her the least??? 😭 and don't even get me started on kamuro and shiroku...\n* the blood bonds seemed cool on paper but the writers wanted to wait til it reached a certain percentage for info to be revealed which made the plot drag on until we reached that point 😭 bc we were going nowhere w/ basic investigations. so i wish it was scrapped instead or at least the numerical value was removed. i'd rather swap the order and have the info get relayed to us first and then our blood bonds grow higher thru romantic dialogue and heart pounding cg's \n* speaking of, the investigations were boring and i think it's mainly bc we lacked interactions w/ the villains? which ofc results in little info being revealed. like in cxm that wasn't an issue at all and i remember the story progressing smoothly bc of that whereas here, it was just a bunch of interviewing a bunch of no sprite characters and vibes 💀\n* king enma says rin died from suicide after goemon was executed but shiroku claims he killed her so i'm like ? IS THIS A TRANSLATION ERROR OR...? \n* the game had an overall problem of telling but not showing, ESPECIALLY when it came to rin developing feelings for the love interests \n\nwhat i did like:\n* the little animations were cute and added more life to the convos\n* TAMA MY KING... coming for the best sidekick crown after my baby orion! \n\ndamn if u made it this far ur a real one bc i yap a lot... anyways as the game features the same team that made olympia soiree i just wanna know WHAT HAPPENED TO THE QUALITY OF WRITING? 😭 olympia was not perfect by any means but it still had a solid foundation and 5 routes that i loved! goemon and jack wishes they can achieve the double locked route slayery that was akaza and himuka...\n\nok but even tho i found myself disappointed in some of the aspects of tengoku struggle i still enjoyed it! however it's one of those games where i would advise ppl to only buy when it's on sale #JustBeingReal\n\nbest character design: jack\n\nbest confession: kiku\n\nbest first kiss: yona\n\nbest personality: sharaku\n\nthanks for reading!

Epecially Sharaku. I was excited for him and I really love his base personality and general demeanor, but the romance itself was eh. The first arcade kiss was also pretty random to me. I still like him, but maybe more as part of the group, rather than as my chosen LI for Rin.\n\nI also like Goemon, he has a lot of things I really enjoy and a lot of the tropes I like. But the execution wasn’t the best and there was so much going on at the end of the route. It was fun in its own way but I wish they reallocated that plot time to them having more moments instead. I also commented before that I felt like Goemon stole Shin from Rin, and that made me sad because past-Rin barely had positive things except her connection to Goemon, but the game had to give her supposed past connection to Shin to Goemon instead. He already has a whole gang of loyal people he’s willing to shoulder sins for, give her something too!\n\nI think the game at least stuck to being unserious which lets its characters and good points shine more, so I really did still enjoy it. As entertainment it was amazing for me, and I have fond memories of it. But when I look at Shinobikuni and think about how we could’ve had more of a Shura instead, I also feel a little sad about how some things turned out.",

    "body": "Everyone’s talking about the skincare items for May’s Glam Bag X they all look very nice and high end.  Since I have nothing better to do I thought I would do some analyzing of the skincare items, will they actually do anything for your skin? Let’s have a look.  So far I think the ones we’ve all seen are: Herbivore Prism Mask, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm, The Route Party Peel, Kopari CBD Balm.  There may be more skincare items but these are the ones that are confirmed. \n\nThe three most coveted items are easy to see, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Herbivore’s Prism Mask and Rodial Cleansing Balm so I’ll focus my analysis on these 3 items since I happen to own all of them as well. \n\n- Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream RV $100\n\nHas the highest RV and I’m guessing most people are aiming for this, the packaging is gorgeous from the way you unbox the cream to the jar itself, makes a great gift.  Now onto the ingredients:\n\nWater, Homosalate (sunscreen filter), Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ethylhexyl Salicylate (sunscreen filter), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone, the only FDA approved sunscreen filter that has sufficient UVA protection, however it’s not stable hence why sunscreens has to be reapplied), Octocrylene (sunscreen filter) Cetyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Steareth-21, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Viola Tricolor Extract, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Disodium Edta, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Michelia Alba Leaf Oil, Sodium Lactate, Coco-Glucoside, PEG-8, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Plumeria Rubra Flower Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol.\n\nI know the label doesn’t mention this but this moisturizer actually has SPF15 and other UVA filters, most of the top ingredients are all sunscreen filters/stabilizers.  The sunscreen filters that are in the moisturizer are mostly weak ones or are in low concentration like Avobenzone, so this wouldn’t be my sunscreen pick for going out in the sun.  \n\nThen there are the usual occlusive ingredients like silicones and other ingredients which will give the skin a silky smooth finish, of course having Shea Butter gives it a more thicker texture, most of the ingredients that can’t be pronounced are common preservatives/emulsifiers (ingredients that help water and oil mix properly so they don’t separate)/ingredients that help stabilize the formula, most of these ingredients are in normal moisturizers, you won’t find some of them in most “clean beauty” products, however there’s nothing unsafe/toxic about these ingredients which have been in cosmetics for a long time.  \n\nIn terms of beneficial ingredients for the skin, it’s got the common humectants like glycerin, dimethicone, butylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, that attract and hold onto moisture.  Besides the oat kernel extract and Shea butter most of the other ingredients like rose hip oil, cameilla seed oil, sunflower seed oil, etc aren’t in high enough concentrations for the skin to derive any nutrients from them but they accomplish the task of softening the skin.  The BioNymph peptide that’s talked about the description of the cream is “Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture”, fairly new ingredient it’s a natural peptide, can’t find any studies on it besides the ones coming from the manufacturer.  Obviously those studies show it’s magic protects the skin against anything oh and it also diminishes wrinkles in 2 weeks....sure.  \n\nFinal thoughts on the product: I bought it because of the hype and nice packaging, it does accomplish what a moisturizer is suppose to do, trap and prevent the loss of moisture, most people expect too much from their moisturizers IMO and that’s why companies are creating ridiculous ingredients like bioNymph peptide in order to look special.  I think this moisturizer was originally suppose to be a makeup primer with higher SPF protection but they couldn’t stabilize the Avobenzone, cos it’s a very tricky sunscreen filter and also the ingredients at the top all seem to be suggest this would be a more lightweight product in terms of texture.  The last part of the cream with all the thickening and beneficial ingredients for skin almost came as an after thought.  It’s fairly scented, the last 3 ingredients are all fragrance, but I don’t mind scented products and enjoy the way this smells.  It’s not as heavy as most of my other moisturizers since I have dry skin and like super thick creams. Most people will likely use this at night but I wonder if it’s okay to sleep with sunscreen filters....\n\n- Herbivore Prism Mask RV $58\n\nIngredients list: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Populus Tremuloides Bark Extract, Gluconolactone, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Sodium Phytate.\n\nMy analysis copied from a reply:\n\n“I have the Herbivore Prism Mask and Serum I bought both when I was still a newbie when it came to skincare ingredients/formulation.  Now that I’ve had to learn more about skincare cos of the constant crap we receive in beauty boxes, I would not recommend the Prism Mask. It uses “natural AHAs” we’ve all seen it before in other products like sugar cane extract, sugar maple extract (maple syrup, very Canadian), lemon extract etc. MANY of these “clean beauty brands” will treat these fruit extracts the same as glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, etc. However they’re completely DIFFERENT!\n\nYes most AHAs are derived from fruit extracts like glycolic acid comes from sugar cane, tartaric and malic comes from maple syrup extract etc, however these acids has to be derived in a lab first, on it’s own these extracts has no PROVEN exfoliation abilities.  Maybe there’s a tiny bit of exfoliating action but because AHAs acids needs to be at the right pH level to work anywhere from pH of 2 to just under 4, from looking at the ingredients of the Prism Mask it’s definitely passed that pH (just a guess, maybe I’ll test the pH later). The closer an AHA exfoliating product gets to the pH of 2, the more free acid value it has. As an example everyone’s favourite lactic acid treatment Sunday Riley GG has only 5% concentration of lactic acid and yet why is it so effective and be loved? It’s because the pH of GG is just around 2.5ish (I tested it with pH strips and got values between 2 and 3 so I’ll just avg it out), at that pH level it can access almost all 5% of the lactic acid in the formula. As another example a product like Saturday Skin’s 10% Glycolic Acid Toner at first looks very promising but when tested the the pH level was between 5-6, making the 10% claim useless since acids can’t do much exfoliating at those pH levels, and the toner can’t access the 10% of glycolic acid and use it properly, making the free acid value basically zero.  When it comes to exfoliating products the percentage of acids doesn’t mean much, it’s all about the pH level and free acid value, if you look at Skinceutical’s Glycolic Overnight Cream on the packaging it doesn’t say this cream contains 10% glycolic acid but rather the free acid value is 10% glycolic.  \n\nAs for the 5% BHA claim, again it uses willow bark extract cos it’s a “clean natural” ingredient, Willow Bark extract contains salicin which only becomes salicylic acid when it’s orally ingested cos of the enzymes in our stomachs, I’m assuming no one wants to eat this mask. Salicylic acid is derived from willow bark extract in labs using a complicated process, thus when applied topically willow bark extract is actually a very good ingredient for inflammation, it soothes the skin, helps with redness etc. It’s good for the skin just not for exfoliating. Lastly the law prohibits any OTC product from having more than 2% salicylic acid (BHA), so these brands get around this by putting 5% BHA on the label hoping people will think 5% willow bark extract is the same as 5% salicylic acid, obviously they’re two completely different ingredients. It’s actually a very good hydrating mask though.”\n\nAlso forget to mention this has zero preservatives not even the new ones that are supposedly so much safer and not toxic, I guess the antibacterial properties of leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate can assist in preserving the product however I’m not a big fan of mold and bacteria so if you do receive this please make sure to check the batch code and when it was manufactured \n\n- Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm RV $59\n\nIngredients list: Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-8 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Oil, Polysorbate 20, Glyceryl Dibehenate, Tribehenin, Glyceryl Behenate, Parfum (Fragrance), Tocopherol , Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Mica, Diamond Powder, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 75470 (Carmine)\n\nIt’s not really a balm texture, if you’re use to using those K beauty cleansing balms with the sherbet texture or the Farmacy one that will transform from balm/oil to milky emulsion this is different.  When it comes out of the tube it has a oil in gel texture, it removes all my makeup but I don’t wear heavy or waterproof makeup.  It’s heavily scented so maybe not the best for sensitive skin.  It washes off cleanly and comes with a muslin cloth, honestly there’s not too much to say about a cleanser.  I bought it cos I’m a sucker for pretty packaging, it’s nice that it’s in a tube so good for traveling/weekend trips, again the main draw back is the fragrance.\n\nTL:DR - they all make great gifts, as far as skincare benefits....meh.",

    "body": "I am sure many are familiar with the recent discussion of ceramide formulations being effective/ineffective so when I came across the Atopalm website that makes it very accessible to US residents , I bought several Zeroid products to see whether it's just hype or whether they really work.  I also decided on Zeroid and Ceramol over other brands because they do not contain fragrance or essential oils.\n\n* Skin type dry\n* Weather: 30 F to 50 F\n* Testing schedule: 3 weeks\n\n**Skin Concerns**: Looking for a moisturizer that can help my already dry skin handle the drying effects of daily 0.05 tretinoin unbuffered this winter. My skin used to be painfully tight right after washing and I couldn’t handle not applying a toner right away while doing the 30 minute wait for tretinoin. \n\n**Zeroid Intensive Cream**\n\nWater/Aqua, Propanediol, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Cetearyl alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 distearate, Glyceryl stearate, Stearic acid, Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Canola oil, Olea europaea (Olive) fruit oil, Cetyl palmitate, Sorbitan palmitate, Sorbitan olivate, Bisabolol, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Xanthan gum, Sodium hyaluronate, Carbomer, Arginine, Caprylyl glycol\n\n* Texture: rich moisturizer that falls somewhere between medium and heavy. \n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: Applies and spreads very smoothly. My dry skin sucks it ups and it leaves a slightly greasy feeling for a while. It eventually absorbs completely after a few minutes. Oily skin type won’t like it but dry skin type will most likely enjoy this cream. I like it enough to consider a repurchase for summer. \n\n**Zeroid Intensive Oint-Cream**\n\nWater/Aqua, Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) seed butter, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cetearyl alcohol, Cocoglycerides, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea) butter, Polyglyceryl-10 distearate, Sorbitan stearate, Panthenol, Glyceryl stearate, Squalane, Stearic acid, Camellia oleifera seed oil, Caprylyl methicone, Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Euphorbia cerifera (Candelilla) wax, Zinc gluconate, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Tetracarboxymethyl palmitoyl dipeptide-12, Xanthan gum, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Caprylyl glycol\n\n* Texture: super thick moisturizer that is definitely heavy but isn’t occlusive enough for me \n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: Take a bit to squeeze it out of the tube as it is thick. Even so, it spreads very smoothly. It takes my skin much longer to drink it up and is definitely greasier but not oily. Due to how long it takes to dry down, I use it at night.  Oily skin type should avoid this like the plague but desert dry skin type will enjoy the richness. Definitely my go to for night time winter moisturizer.  \n\n**Ceramol 311 Crema**\n\nWater, Shea butter, Petrolatum, Penethylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Batyl alcohol, Stearic Acid, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol, Arginine, Carbomer, Lecithin.\n\n* Texture: I can’t decide how to classify this cream. It squeezes out of the tube so easily, applies like a light lotion yet it is the farthest thing from light. It is firm enough that the squeezed ”cream” holds its shape. It is a translucent white, unlike the clearly white non-tranlucent Zeroid. It reminds me of a gel but it’s definitely not a gel.  \n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: The texture is incredibly deceiving as it looks and feels light upon application but it really isn’t. I think it feels that way because it dries down matte. I enjoy using this in the morning because I don’t need to wait long for it to dry down before applying sunscreen. \n\n**TLDR**\n\nI like all 3 for different reasons. I was originally underwhelmed because my skin still felt dry halfway through the day. I want to test these properly so I continued using them. Since many are curious as to the performance and effects of Zeroid, I decided to do my review write up a week early (3 weeks versus 1 full month of testing). Note that these creams are NOT fungal acne safe.  \n\nI think these creams strengthened my moisture barrier. In fact, I stopped using an occlusive at night last week except on my eyelids and at the corners of my mouth, whereas I had to slather Eucerin all over my face for months. I don’t have any flakes or patches of peeling skin anymore compared to before I started these creams. My skin also doesn’t look tight or dry the next morning. \n\nTesting after I have finished the current tubes:\n\n* Zeroid Richenic Cream Urea 5% (haven’t opened)\n* Zeroid Intensive Hydrating Ampoule (haven’t opened)\n* Ceramol 311 Lipocream (seller sent me samples, haven’t opened)\n\nI have also tried La Mer, Nivea Mexico and Nivea Germany and will do a write up comparison on SCA when I can cough up the energy.",

I was in really bad mood that day so i stayed up till 5 am and chatted to some poor asian customer service employee and was like \"WHERE IS MY SOLUTION KIT, I WANT IT NOOOOOOOOW!\" ( i'm going to rot in hell), and they agreed to send me one after my package arrives, they just told me to remind them about it.\n\na week later my big package arrived, unfortunately a portion of really expensive green tea seed oil has leaked out because someone there thought placingit upside down was good idea. They offered full refund for that product, so i was happy and thought demanding the solution kit while i got 3/4 of tge oil virtually for free would be too much, so i never asked them for the kit. Yet two days later they sent me an email they remembered about it and shipped the kit! And it was a proper green tea ine with a sheet mask in it, not the poorer version they were sending for free recently!\n\ni thought id share, because its always nice to see people doing their job right, innisfree forever ♡",

    "body": "I was on the search for the perfect fragrance free oil/balm cleanser for quite some time. I love to do double cleanse to make sure I remove all the sunscreen and makeup at the end of the day. Over the years, I have tried quite a few of first cleansers/cleansing balms so I thought I would do a quick review here for anyone who is interested. My standards when it comes to a good cleansing balm/oil: fragrance-free, effective, but gentle on the skin, doesn’t over-dry the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes. My skin is sensitive and acne-prone.\n\nAll the products I buy and review here completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no “natural” fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing, potentially irritating plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus). So here we go:\n\n**Versed Gentle Cycle Hydrating Milky Cleanser:**  **•**\n\n**Ingredients**: Water/Aqua/EauOlea Europaea (Olive) Fruit OilHelianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed OilPropanediolVitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed OilGlycerinCaprylic/Capric TriglycerideMusa Sapientum (Banana) ExtractMagnesium Aluminum SilicateLactobacillus Ferment LysateSclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed OilAvena Sativa (Oat) Kernel ExtractRubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit ExtractLeuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment FiltrateTocopherolCitric AcidSodium Lauroyl SarcosinateXanthan GumEthylhexylglycerinSodium BenzoatePotassium SorbateSodium Hydroxide\n\n**My thought:** This product has a milky texture that is easy to use, effective and also gentle on the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes, but there are a few things to note: 1/ It doesn’t spread very far on the skin so you have to use quite a lot of product to cover the entire face so the bottle doesn’t last very long. 2/Even though the product is fragrance free, there’s a light banana scent due to the banana extract in the formula. So if you’re not fond of the banana smell, you might not like it.  Overall, it’s a great , gentle formula and one that I might repurchase.\n\n**Updated review (11/10/22): I recently repurchased this product again and noticed there are little grainy particles like sand in the product. I'm not sure what they did to the product but my sensitive skin can't tolerate scrubs or any physical exfoliant so I won't be using or repurchase this product again.**\n\n**Good Molecule Instant Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Polyethylene, PEG-8 Isostearate, 1,2-hexanediol, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Citric Acid.\n\n**My thought:** This product used to be only available in the scented version (loaded with potentially irritating essential oils), but due to customer demand, they decided to make a fragrance free version (thank you very much). I’m not sure if the scented version is still out there, so make sure you check the ingredients carefully before purchasing. This product come in a tub with a small spatula that you can use to scoop up the product. I do like this cleansing balm, I think it’s very effective and a little goes a long way. You don’t need to use much to cleanse the entire face. It’s also gentle enough to use around my eyes without any irritation. One con I can think of about this product is the smell. Even though it’s fragrance free, it has a chemical smell that is quite strong which I guess comes from one of the raw ingredients in the formula (though I’m not sure which one exactly). I think some people might find it unpleasant, but it’s still better than adding fragrance or essential oils.\n\n**The Ordinary Squalene Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Squalane, Aqua (Water), Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Glycerin, Sucrose Stearate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sucrose Laurate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Isoceteth-20, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tocopherol, Hydroxymethoxyphenyl Decanone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Malic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Chlorphenesin.\n\n**My thought:** This product has a cream texture that is quite thick coming out of the tube, and once it’s on the skin, it does require a lot of massaging, then the texture changes to oil as you work it in. Even though it’s gentle on the skin, I find it a lot less effective than other products on this list. This is not a product I would recommend for someone that wears a lot of makeup or doesn’t like to take a long time removing makeup at the end of the day. Even if you don’t wear a lot of makeup, I think there are better products out there. Personally, I wouldn’t repurchase it because: 1/It requires too much rubbing and effort to make it work. 2/I find it does irritate my eyes a little. 3/you have to use a lot of product to cleanse the entire face and the tube doesn’t last very long.\n\n**The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Candelilla Cera (Cire de candelilla), Silica,Sorbitan Stearate, Tribehenin, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Aqua (Water/Eau), Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil.\n\n**My thought:** This product comes in a tube, similar to the packaging of the ordinary squalene cleanser, but the texture is different. It comes out of the tube like petrolatum jelly. Because it’s quite thick, it doesn’t spread very far, so you have to use quite a lot of product to cleanse the entire face. It’s gentle on the skin and eyes, and leave my skin very soft afterward, but I think it will not work well for someone that wear a lot of makeup. I consider myself a minimal makeup wearer and this product couldn’t remove my eyeshadow completely. I also notice that the texture of the cleanser is not completely smooth, it’s slightly grainy due to the small pieces of oat which I do not like. I will not be repurchasing this product.\n\n**Jordan Samuel Skin The After Show Treatment Cleanser for Sensitive Skin:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Glycerin, Aqua/Water, Sucrose Laurate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobiliss Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Propanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**My thought:** This has to be the worse balm cleanser I have ever tried. It has a jelly-like texture coming out of the tube, and it goes on the skin just fine, but it just doesn’t cleanse off when I rinse my face with water. It barely remove makeup and leaves my face with a layer of residue that feels oily. I feel like I have to follow up with another cleanser right away or risk breaking out. I hate wasting product but I couldn’t make myself use this one so I threw it out after trying a few times. Sadly, I cannot recommend this product to anyone.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Triethylhexanoin, Sorbeth-30 Tetraisostearate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olive Fruit Oil, Water, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate (Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), Jojoba Seed Oil, Ceresin, Dextrin Palmitate/Ethylhexanoate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, BHT\n\n**My thought:** this product is a very popular Japanese cleansing oil, and for a good reason. It’s affordable, cleanses quickly and effectively, without leaving any residue behind. 2 pumps are what needed to cleanse my entire face. If you’re someone that wear a lot of makeup and need something that can remove make up fast and effortlessly, you will love this product. Some cons about this product: 1/ it can bother my eyes sometimes if I get it too close to the eyes. I thought i just throw this out there in case anyone has super sensitive eyes. 2/ It might be hard to get in in store. You have to order it online and it might take some time to arrive.\n\n**Isnt Tree Micellar Melting Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Sap , Opuntia Ficus-Indica Seed Oil , Camellia Sinensis Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Squalane\n\n**My thought:** This is a liquidy cleansing oil that comes in a pump bottle. It’s thin in texture and gentle, but effective. It’s also non irritating to the eyes, and rinses off well. Compare to the hada labo, it’s a thinner oil, and I have to use more product than Hada Labo to cleanse my entire face. I need 3 pumps for Isnt Tree as opposed to only 2 pumps for Hada Labo. If you are deciding between the 2, I would recommend Hada Labo. It’s just as effective if not more, the bottle lasts longer, and more cost effective as well.\n\n**Purito from Green Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Glyceryl Caprylate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Vegetable Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**My thought:** This oil cleanser come in a pump bottle similar to the ones from Hada Labo and Isnt Tree, but the texture is thicker than the other 2 brands. It’s effective, but gentle and doesn’t irritate my eyes. I need about 3 pumps to cleanse my entire face. Overall, it’s a good cleanser but I still prefer the Hada Labo because it’s cheaper, works just as well, and the bottle lasts longer.\n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Ethylhexyl Palmitate (emollient solvent), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (skin-replenishing), PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate (emollient cleansing agent), Diisooctyl Succinate (emollient), Olive Oil PEG-7 Esters (emollient cleansing agent/emulsifier), Trihydroxystearin (texture enhancer), Glyceryl Stearate (emulsifier), Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Hydrogenated Rapeseed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Tocopheryl Acetate (vitamin E/antioxidant).\n\n**My thought:** This one has a balm like texture coming out of the tube and spread easily on the skin. There’s no residue left behind after cleansing. This product is gentle on my skin, doesn’t sting my eyes and is also effective. It has no discernible smell, which is nice since some fragrance-free products can still have an unpleasant smell due to the raw ingredients used in the formula.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-10 Isostearate, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Seed Water, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Coix Lacryma-Jobi Ma-yuen Seed Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Water, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**My thought:** This is the most recent product that I've tried and is my current favorite. If I have to choose only 1 balm/oil cleanser to use, this would be the one. It replaces my previous favorite cleansing balm from Paula's Choice. The texture is smooth and gentle on the skin. It spreads more easily than Paula's Choice's and has no detectable scent. \n\n**Other plain oil options I’ve tried that work well:** When I run out of my balm cleanser and haven’t purchased a replacement in time. I usually use plain oils to remove my makeup. But because plain oils do not contain emulsifier, they don’t come off with water, so I have to immediately follow up with a water based cleanser to rinse off the oil residue on my face. Here are 2 oils that I like to use:\n\n**Coconut oil**: thicker oil, best for people with normal to dry skin\n\n**Jojoba Oil:** thinner in texture than coconut oil, best for oily and combo skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Top 3:** \n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm**\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser**\n\nIf you have a favorite oil/balm cleansers that are not on this list, please share with me in the comment :)\n\n&#x200B;",

        "body": "This is so cool! I love seeing people as committed to zero fragrance/irritants as I am! I'm definitely going to keep these in mind for reccing balms in the future since I don't usually mess with those.\n\nFor context, I'm dry skin and sensitive + acne prone, plus have keratosis pilaris. A cleansing oil I would highly suggest to try out is\n\nKOSE SPEEDY cleansing oil. Here is the current ingredient list https://incidecoder.com/products/kose-speedy-cleansing-oil\n\n you'll see a lot of different listings since they reformulated a lot but this is the right one. \nIt is a very light, well emulsified oil that rinses cleanly and doesn't overstrip. Spreads very well. Doesn't leave a residue. It is even good as a solo cleanse! This is my default recc for any skin type or with any condition. I have people with rosacea, eczema, and ichthyosis using it so I'm very confident in its gentleness. In the US, there's 1pack 7.8oz for $13 or 2pack with 1 full and 1 refill for $20 on Amazon. Some have mentioned being able to find it at Daiso stores in US and other countries. \n\nSo this second one I've only used for a week but I begrudgingly have been pretty into it as I'm more on the dry side. It's the Neutrogena lightweight body oil fragrance-free https://www.neutrogena.com/products/skincare/body-oil-fragrance-free/6861830.html\n\nIt's a very low-viscosity watery-freling oil and it has good spreadability. Works really well at getting into pore for that deep but gentle clean you want from oils. It's probably the gentlest one I've tried even more so than my DIY sunflower/grapeseed + Polysorbate 80 I've made. The \"problem\" is that the Neutrogena oil does not rinse well at all. However I think it might good alternative for people who have tried other oil cleanser and found the emulsifiers just made it too much for their skin but don't want to use a pure oil. It does mostly come off with the gentle second cleanse. It will leave a bit behind in your skin, but as someone dry I quite appreciate that slight buffer for the cleanser and it hasn't caused any issues or broken me out. My skin does actually feel quite a bit more comfortable and less dry since introducing this when this was the only change. It does feel decently nourishing without being overwhelming. It definitrly lives up to its claims if used this way. Normal price is $13 for 8.5oz but can be found for $9-10 on sale sometimes. I'm still not sure how I feel about it but my skin has already decided it likes this, so... 😒\n\nAs my gentle water-based cleanser, my current favorite is the Pipette baby wash and shampoo fragrance-free https://www.target.com/p/pipette-baby-shampoo-wash-fragrance-free-11-8-fl-oz/-/A-79503241. I get a lot of funny looks when I recc this but it's genuinely the best thing I've found that is on par in gentleness with some of the better non-foaming cleansers like the Aveeno calm and restore oat cleanser and is more affordable. It has amazing spreadability and you don't need a lot. I have gone through 4 bottles and am about to repurchase because I'm too hooked and it's insanely cost effective compared to most facial cleansers. Normal price is $8 for 12oz, it's commonly on sale for $6.50ish and one time I caught it for $4 so I stocked up hard. But I'd be happy paying $8. I also use it for body and hair so 😳 I felt it was worth mentioning since it's the second cleanse I follow with.\n\nI'm definitely gonna be taking a look at more of your content now as well! Thanks :)",

Sometimes I feel like I could end my routine right after applying this (but i dont haha) it hydrates my skin so well. The amazing smell of this product is just a huge bonus.  \n• Sunday Riley Luna - I love this oil and definitely see great results when used by itself in its own one-off routine, but I just love doing my whole routine that I don't use this as much. But I love the musky smell and always apply a few drops of mizon peptide ampoule with it to help keep it viscus and spread more easily.  \n• Last, but definitely not least, Banila Co Miss Flower and Mr Honey Essence oil.

    "body": "A couple of weeks ago, I had posted (here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4gcrjj/is_it_possible_to_find_out_how_ingredients_are/) trying to figure out how squalene is sourced in cosmetic products. \n\nIf you are interested in why the use of squalene is problematic in terms of environment, see this overview from the Discovery channel (I know, not the most scholarly source, but an easily accessible intro): http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/shark-week/shark-feed/theres-shark-in-your-lipstick-everything-you-need-to-know-about-shark-liver-oil/ Essentially, the problem is that shark populations have been damaged by overfishing for cosmetic and other purposes. The problem is not restricted to AB companies. But some large Western corporations (L'Oreal and Unilever) have pledged to stop the practice: http://oceana.org/press-center/press-releases/unilever-end-use-shark-products-cosmetics. \n\n\nSince a few posters expressed an interest on the issue as well, I wanted to give a brief update. \n\n\nThis is what I found out (or failed to for the most part) in specific brands/companies that I use:\n\n- At the time of the original post, I contacted Mizon to ask about their sourcing and I never heard back from them. This means that unfortunately I will have to give up my beloved Black Snail cream. \n\n- I use plenty of Belif products and some of them contain squalene. For instance, the Classic Essence Increment uses squalene. The full ingredient list is not on their website, but it's on the box in English for the one I bought from Sephora. Their website claims no animal derived products: http://belifusa.com/product/detail.jsp?pid=B5000015&cid1=C&cid2=. So they seem ok.\n\n- Innisfree products: some of their creams (such as the ginger one) have squalene. Since Innisfree markets itself as a more environmentally friendly company, I would hope that it's from a plant source. I have emailed them, but so far I have received no answer. This was more recently than with Mizon and so they might still respond.\n\n\nThose are the brands that I have been considering. I would of course love to hear from others. \n\nEdited to add that from TK's website it seems that both the Innisfree Green Tea Seed Oil and the Innisfree Jeju Lava Seawater Essence use plant derived squalene.\n\nEdited on 5/13 to add the reply directly from Innisfree:\n\"We would like to inform you that squalene we use for products is a plant based 'Phytosqualane.' Also, all products at innisfreeworld are cruelty-free: they are not animal-tested or contain animal substances.\"",

Ive now read several studies, some of them which included thousands of men, showing how the discontinuation of testosterone always brought back sperm count eventually: most of the times within 3-4 months, some rare cases took 12-18 months but everyone ALWAYS recovered.\n\nThat is: You will be able to be a father one day even if you use testosterone.\n\nI will quote some of the results from the studies:\n\n\"The Chinese men in Gu's study took monthly injections of 500 milligrams of TU in tea seed oil for 30 months. This formula is not available in the U.S. and is indicated to treat low testosterone levels with injections typically given every three months.\n\nOver the course of the trial, nine pregnancies occurred in the partners of 1,045 study participants, or roughly one pregnancy for every 100 men.\n\nThere was no evidence of major side effects, and all the men in the study returned to normal fertility after stopping the injections. The average time it took for the men to return to normal fertility was around six and a half months.\"\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nAnother one:\n\n\"Utilizing the same data base as described above on 1549 healthy men, the same group of investigators completed an integrated analysis for 30 studies on male hormonal contraceptive trials using androgens alone or androgens plus progestins from 1990 to 2005. In men who showed suppression of spermatogenesis to very severe oligozoospermia or azoospermia, the median time for sperm concentration to recover to over 20 million/ml was 3.4 months. Higher rates of recovery were associated with older age, Asian origin, shorter treatment duration, shorter-acting testosterone delivery systems, higher baseline sperm concentration, faster rate of suppression and lower serum LH levels at baseline. The probability of recovery to over 20 million/ml was 67 % in 6 months, 90 % in 12 months and 100 % within 24 months. This study conclusively showed that hormonal male contraceptive methods are fully reversible with a predictable time course (39).\"\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\"The contraceptive effect of all MHC regimens is completely reversed within 4 to 6 months. Once treatment stops, it takes a while for a man's body to begin making hormones in pretreatment quantities. Once the pretreatment levels of hormones are restored, the first immature sperm are produced in the seminiferous tubules. It takes 2½ months for these first immature sperm to become fully functional as they travel through the epididymis.\"\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nYou can stop worry.\n\n\n",

Since atopalm.com website is based in New Jersey, United States, the order arrived quickly. Both are 80 ml and have no scent. \n\nSkin type: Combination (oily dehydrated acne prone)\n\nProblem: Restoring skin barrier and inflammation \n\n1. Intensive Oint-Cream\n\nIngredients:\n\n\nWater/Aqua, Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) seed butter, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cetearyl alcohol, Cocoglycerides, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea) butter, Polyglyceryl-10 distearate, Sorbitan stearate, Panthenol, Glyceryl stearate, Squalane, Stearic acid, Camellia oleifera seed oil, Caprylyl methicone, Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Euphorbia cerifera (Candelilla) wax, Zinc gluconate, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Tetracarboxymethyl palmitoyl dipeptide-12, Xanthan gum, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Caprylyl glycol\n\nReview: I apply this nighttime after I put on the soothing cream for more hydration. This melts into the skin right away and surprisingly doesn’t make my face look oily. I really like this moisturizer and I started using it in May (when the month started off with cool weather). It feels so light on my skin and I’m going to repurchase it after it’s finished. With this moisturizer, the hydration lasts the whole day. It doesn’t break me out either and doesn’t leave a white cast. In the winter time, I’ll probably use this during the daytime too. \n\n2. Soothing Cream\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua, Glycerin, Propanediol, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Sorbitan stearate, Cetearyl alcohol, Carthamus tinctorius (Safflower) seed oil, Glyceryl stearate, Stearic acid, Dimethicone, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Bisabolol, Xanthan gum, Sodium hyaluronate, Carbomer, Arginine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl glycol, Tropolone\n\nReview: I use this daytime and nighttime. It’s a great simple moisturizer and this also doesn’t make my face look oily. It doesn’t break out my skin. This moisturizer also goes into my skin right away and does not leave a white cast. I will also be repurchasing this moisturizer too. \n\nResult: Both of these moisturizers really have helped restore my skin barrier and my skin feels stronger. My skin also has been less inflamed.",

I want this hair to grow back ASAP so that I can forget about this and get back to normal.\n\nI realize, though, that it's going to take at least two years, maybe longer, not only because I have tightly curled hair, and added inches go to my curls first, not my hair's overall length, (I'm not sure what type it is) but also because I don't really know my hair growth rate. I know it was slow to non-existent when it was long, and I'm hoping that was just because I didn't get it trimmed regularly.\n\nI am on birth control pills and generic for Abilify, though, and I've heard that at least one of these things could cause hair loss. I wonder if I should try to accelerate my hair growth process by using something like Rogaine, tea seed oil, fermented rice water, or something else that strengthens hair and keeps it in the growth phase?\n\nIn the meantime, I guess I'm going to just wear wigs and / or extensions, but I hate that it's come to this.

I also decided on Zeroid and Ceramol over other brands because they do not contain fragrance or essential oils.\n\n* Skin type dry\n* Weather: 30 F to 50 F\n* Testing schedule: 3 weeks\n\n**Skin Concerns**: Looking for a moisturizer that can help my already dry skin handle the drying effects of daily 0.05 tretinoin unbuffered this winter. My skin used to be painfully tight right after washing and I couldn’t handle not applying a toner right away while doing the 30 minute wait for tretinoin.\n\n**Zeroid Intensive Cream**\n\nWater/Aqua, Propanediol, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Cetearyl alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 distearate, Glyceryl stearate, Stearic acid, Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Canola oil, Olea europaea (Olive) fruit oil, Cetyl palmitate, Sorbitan palmitate, Sorbitan olivate, Bisabolol, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Xanthan gum, Sodium hyaluronate, Carbomer, Arginine, Caprylyl glycol\n\n* Texture: rich moisturizer that falls somewhere between medium and heavy.\n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: Applies and spreads very smoothly. My dry skin sucks it ups and it leaves a slightly greasy feeling for a while. It eventually absorbs completely after a few minutes. Oily skin type won’t like it but dry skin type will most likely enjoy this cream. I like it enough to consider a repurchase for summer.\n\n**Zeroid Intensive Oint-Cream**\n\nWater/Aqua, Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) seed butter, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cetearyl alcohol, Cocoglycerides, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea) butter, Polyglyceryl-10 distearate, Sorbitan stearate, Panthenol, Glyceryl stearate, Squalane, Stearic acid, Camellia oleifera seed oil, Caprylyl methicone, Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Euphorbia cerifera (Candelilla) wax, Zinc gluconate, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Tetracarboxymethyl palmitoyl dipeptide-12, Xanthan gum, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Caprylyl glycol\n\n* Texture: super thick moisturizer that is definitely heavy but isn’t occlusive enough for me\n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: Take a bit to squeeze it out of the tube as it is thick. Even so, it spreads very smoothly. It takes my skin much longer to drink it up and is definitely greasier but not oily. Due to how long it takes to dry down, I use it at night. Oily skin type should avoid this like the plague but desert dry skin type will enjoy the richness. Definitely my go to for night time winter moisturizer.\n\n**Ceramol 311 Crema**\n\nWater, Shea butter, Petrolatum, Penethylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Batyl alcohol, Stearic Acid, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol, Arginine, Carbomer, Lecithin.\n\n* Texture: I can’t decide how to classify this cream. It squeezes out of the tube so easily, applies like a light lotion yet it is the farthest thing from light. It is firm enough that the squeezed ”cream” holds its shape. It is a translucent white, unlike the clearly white non-tranlucent Zeroid. It reminds me of a gel but it’s definitely not a gel.\n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: The texture is incredibly deceiving as it looks and feels light upon application but it really isn’t. I think it feels that way because it dries down matte. I enjoy using this in the morning because I don’t need to wait long for it to dry down before applying sunscreen.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nI like all 3 for different reasons. I was originally underwhelmed because my skin still felt dry halfway through the day. I want to test these properly so I continued using them. Since many are curious as to the performance and effects of Zeroid, I decided to do my review write up a week early (3 weeks versus 1 full month of testing). Note that these creams are NOT fungal acne safe.\n\nI think these creams strengthened my moisture barrier. In fact, I stopped using an occlusive at night last week except on my eyelids and at the corners of my mouth, whereas I had to slather Eucerin all over my face for months. I don’t have any flakes or patches of peeling skin anymore compared to before I started these creams. My skin also doesn’t look tight or dry the next morning.\n\nTesting after I have finished the current tubes:\n\n* Zeroid Richenic Cream Urea 5% (haven’t opened)\n* Zeroid Intensive Hydrating Ampoule (haven’t opened)\n* Ceramol 311 Lipocream (seller sent me samples, haven’t opened)",

Before I put on makeup I usually tap an oil on and do my eyes while it plumps and hydrates my skin. It also helps the primer adhere a little bit better, which makes my BB, CC or foundation last and look perfect, longer.\n\nAt night, I'd usually mix it in with my moisturizer and tap it in.\n\nAlso, I have the SkinFood Watery Berry Line and in the instructions for their ampoule, it says to use it after a toner but before the serum. Again, i'd follow the instructions (if it comes with it) and then change it to better match your skin if need be.",

    "body": "Hi guys, I'm in the midst of overhauling my routine and am looking to try some new products. My skin is quite dehydrated and sensitive due to Retin A Micro (I've currently stopped for a few days just to give my skin a break), and I've learned that my new Innisfree Orchid Enriched cream isn't enough and leaves my skin tight after an hour or two (even with a facial oil applied over top). Cerave tends to leave me oily and full of whiteheads, so that is unfortunately a no go.\n\nMy current routine is: Face Shop Seed Fermentation Oil Balm, Cerave cream cleanser, Face Shop olive oil toner (don't like this much), Innisfree Orchid Enriched cream, Innisfree Green Tea seed oil (was told this isn't good due to high oleic acid), Aveeno baby sunscreen.\n\nI'm currently thinking about picking up the Mizon hyaluronic acid 100 and/or the Pure Heals 90 propolis ampoule (currently my favourite, but I want something a bit cheaper and just to try something new).\n\nAs far as creams go, I'm debating about the Hadalabo perfect gel (I love their toner), or the Mizon Black Snail All In One Cream. I'm torn as the Hadalabo is full of humectants, but the Mizon has a high amount of niacinamide (which my skin loves), as well as peptides. Both have ceramides as well, which I was looking for. I also saw the Clio/Goodal Moisture Barrier Cream on Get It Beauty, which is described as using mistletoe and ceramides to restore the skin barrier. Unfortunately I can't find any reviews or an ingredient list for this one, so I'm hesitant to buy it (I emailed Clio asking for an ingredient list, but so far no reply).\n\nTLDR: Looking for a moisturizer and serum to repair dehydrated skin on Retin A.

        "body": "The flaking from tretinoin is primarily irritation not dehydration.\n\nYou are usually to apply tretinoin to thoroughly dry skin and then have a wait time, not to well hydrated skin - that increases penetration and thus irritation. So trying to overly hydrate skin could well be counterproductive.\n\nMizon Black Snail Cream is very gentle IMO (I have rosacea and a history of eczema/ dermatitis) and has sunflower oil which supports skin barrier repair. If you want humectants go for penetrating ones like urea and sodium PCA, regular hyaluronic acid just sits on the surface. Do understand that water attracting ingredients alone do not restore the skin barrier nor hydrate skin long term, in some circumstances they can further dry it.\n\nAvoid foaming products, fragrance, alcohol, anything alkaline, chemical sunscreens, exfoliating acids, the glycols because these are all known irritants and/ or penetration enhancers. Propolis is a common allergen, not a good idea on irritated skin IMO wait until you have acclimatised to the tretinoin.",

    "body": "So recently, I jumped onto the facial oil trend and started to try facial oils in place of my regular moisturizer. This helped a bunch in terms of my oil production throughout the day. Since my skin is combo/acne-prone, I have noticed that my spots and oily areas have looked a lot better. \nYet, I think that my facial oil might be working too well! My skin is starting to get to a point where it is getting flaky around my mouth by the end of the day. I don't want to give up my precious facial oil, but now I'm thinking that I should probably add in a light moisturizer or emulsion? Or should I perhaps look at a different type of facial oil since the one I use is targeted as \"natural astringent\"?\n\nMy Routine:\n\nAM:\nSu:m37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick,\nPaula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid,\nSK-II FTE,\nClarins Lotus Oil,\nBiore UV Perfect Face Milk Sunscreen SPF 50 (PA++++)\n\nPM:\nShu Uemura Anti/Oxi Cleansing Oil,\nSu:m37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick,\nSK-II FTE,\nEstee Lauder Adv. Night Repair (Synchronized Recovery Complex II),\nClarins Lotus Oil\n\nI was looking at a few facial oils like:\nInnisfree's Green Tea Seed Oil\nSulwhasoo's Ginseng one (So expensive though for such a small bottle... :<) \nAnd a few creams such as: \nMizon's Starfish one\nInnisfree's Green Tea Seed Cream\nor Sulwhasoo's Hydro Cream\n\nI'm open for any suggestions though and have yet to really look at emulsions since I'm not sure if that will really do much.

    "body": "Hi All, \n\nI'm pretty new to recipe duplication, and I've read as much as I can on the swiftcraftymonkey blog, but I would like a bit of guidance. I would love to start making my own cleansing oils, and was looking for a good recipe, but figured a duplication might be an easier starting place (?). I would like to go for for something more natural because I live in a country where buying various chemicals is essentially impossible without importing which is far too expensive (shipping is ~11 USD+/lb to order online in addition to added VAT and customs charges). \n\nHere are the ingredients for the [Tata Harper Cleansing Oil](https://www.tataharperskincare.com/nourishing-oil-cleanser):  \nHelianthus annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil*,  \nShea Butter Ethyl Esters,  \nPolyglyceryl-4 Oleate,  \nPrunus armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil*,  \nSimmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil*,  \nOlea Europaea (Olive) Oil*,   \nArgania spinosa (Argan) Kernel oil*,  \nPlukenetia Volubilis Seed oil*,  \nCamellia Oleifera Seed Oil*,  \nJojoba Esters,  \nArnica montana (Arnica) Extract*,  \nBorago officinalis (Borage) Leaf Extract*,  \nMedicago sativa (Alfalfa) Extract*,  \nSpiraea Ulmaria (Meadowsweet) Extract*,  \nCalendula officinalis (Calendula) Flower Extract*,  \nSambucus Nigra Fruit Extract,  \nTocopherol,  \nAroma**,  \nCitral,  \nCitronellol,  \nEugenol,  \nGeraniol,  \nLimonene,  \nLinalool  \n\nA few questions:  \n\n1. What do you think is actually doing work here? I would imagine that the vast majority of this is the sunflower oil (which is very cheap!), which I know to be a high linoleic oil good for most skin types. Beyond that, I'm not sure what's just there for the sake of buzz words.\n\n2. Shea Butter Ethyl Esters - How horrible would it be to just use normal shea butter here. In lieu of an ester, would it just be best to leave it out?\n\n3. Am I correct in assuming tocopherol is the preservative (and thus the 1% mark)? Is it also correct to assume, then, that the extracts make up 6%+ of this product? That seems odd, but I don't know much. \n\n----\nI'm also interested in understanding the make up of this [Tatcha Camellia Cleansing Oil](https://www.tatcha.com/shop/one-step-camellia-cleansing-oil), so that I  might attempt an all-natural version of it because it comes off very easily.\n\nIngredients below: \nCetyl Ethylhexanoate,  \nOryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil,  \nPolyglyceryl-10 Dioleate,  \nPolyglyceryl-2 Sesquicaprylate,  \nCamellia Japonica Seed Oil,  \nCamellia Sinensis Leaf Extract,  \nAlgae Extract,  \nAqua/Water/Eau,  \nGlyceryl Behenate/Eicosadioate,  \nGlycerin,  \nEthylhexylglycerin,  \nParfum/Fragrance, \nAlcohol,  \nPhenoxyethanol\n\nWhat's the preservative here? Not sure where to start.\n\n----\n\n**Is there a resource in which maximum quantities for different ingredients is readily available? I've been looking at google/(cir-safety.org)[cir-safety.org] but the non-searchable PDFs are a little annoying.**\n\n\n\nEDIT: amended Tatcha cleansing oil ingredients. ",

        "body": "Several things:\n\n- Do you want to make an emulsifying cleansing oil or one that you wipe off? The Tatcha emulsifies, the Tata Harper does not. Since the Tata Harper doesn’t emulsify, it’s just carrier oils plus extracts.  You could just use a straight carrier oil if you want a simple functional dupe.   If you want to make an emulsifying cleansing oil, you probably need to do a bit more reading - there are lots of posts about them on this sub, it’s a very common DIY since you can do something as simple as carrier oil + emulsifier. \n\n\n- You don’t need a preservative for anhydrous recipes, and the Tata Harper doesn’t have one. Tocopherol (vitamin E) slows rancidity of the oil, but isn’t a preservative.\n\n\n- The Tatcha does include water and thus does need a preservative.  From your link, you missed copying the last few ingredients - the preservative is phenoxyethanol.\n\n\n- The supplier you buy from should list the recommended percentage of each ingredient it sells. Lotioncrafter definitely does so you could check that out as a resource, though keep in mind that it’s possible that different supplier will have different recommendations (and their ingredients could have different strengths, esp for things like extracts).",

        "body": "I haven't tried the Tata Harper cleansing oil, but it looks like a nice product. I have used the Tatcha, and I remember liking it a lot.\n\nI have not duped the Tatcha, but here are my thoughts on the formula based on the ingredients:\n\n* I think you may have copied a partial ingredients list for the Tatcha cleanser. When I look it up, I see: Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Polyglyceryl-10 Dioleate, Polyglyceryl-2 Sesquicaprylate, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Algae Extract, Aqua/Water/Eau, Glyceryl Behenate/Eicosadioate, Glycerin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Parfum/Fragrance, Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol. Ethylhexylglycerin and Phenoxyethanol are the preservative system.\n* A rule of thumb with oil cleansers is that the emulsifiers are usually used at around 5-15%\n* Tatcha's emulsifiers are Polyglyceryl-10 Dioleate, Polyglyceryl-2 Sesquicaprylate, and Glyceryl Behenate/Eicosadioate\n* I would assume the extracts used are water-soluble extracts dissolved in glycerin, since there is a water phase and a preservative system present here\n* I’d assume rice bran oil makes up a large portion of this product\n* To dupe it, I’d probably do an oil phase at around 80% comprised of rice bran oil and camellia oil, a water phase of 5% or less with glycerin and distilled water, I’d pick a single emulsifier and use it at around 10%, and in the cool-down phase add algae extract and green tea extract and a broad-spectrum preservative suitable for o/w emulsions. I’d ignore the combination of three emulsifiers, the Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, and the fragrance (or use essential oils at 0.5-1% for fragrance). Then I’d see how that version felt and performed and make adjustments. \n\nAnd my thoughts on your questions about the Tata Harper cleansing oil:\n\n* I agree that sunflower oil is probably the vast majority of this product. The second ingredient, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate, is also the only emulsifier present, so off the bat we can guess it's used at 5-15%. Looking at Making Cosmetics, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate is recommended for use at 2-10%, so we can assume here it's used at <10%. Everything between it and Tocopherol is therefore probably used at between 1 and 10%. \n* What else is doing work here? I honestly don't know! Generally speaking, I'm not convinced that most fancy ingredients matter that much in a cleanser, since cleansers spend so little time on our skin. Theoretically, I could see an oil cleanser being an exception to that, since some of the oil does sink in and stay on the skin, but does that have any effect beyond some emollient action? Some of the ingredients listed here do have other potential skin effects (as antioxidants, etc) but I don't know if this product provides the right context and delivery system for those ingredients to work. Some of these things may just be \"story\" ingredients here, or as you say, just buzz words. \n* I'd assume the ingredients that have the most impact on this product — in terms of function and feel — are the main oils used and the emulsifier, and the ratio between them\n* I have never used Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, so I'm just guessing about substitutions. I think if you used regular shea butter here, depending on the concentration it might make the cleansing oil a little bit thicker, or in a higher concentration, more like a balm? But it couldn't hurt to experiment, especially if you already have shea butter on hand.\n* I think this is an anhydrous product, because it doesn't have a preservative. I would assume that the extracts used are oil-soluble extracts, not water-soluble. You can buy oil-soluble extracts at Brambleberry.\n* To dupe it, I'd probably start with 90% oils (including oil-soluble extracts) and 10% Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate. I'd make the oil mix mostly sunflower oil, and simplify the ingredients list. There are nine carrier oils and six oil-soluble extracts here; I'd probably cut that down to 4-5 carrier oils and 2-3 extracts. I'd probably go with Sunflower Oil, Apricot Kernel Oil, Olive Oil, Jojoba Oil, and Camellia Oil, and then choose whatever extracts. I'd keep Tocopherol and use it at 1% to help stave off rancidity. And use essential oils for fragrance at 0.5-1%.",

My only problem with it is that it is roasted with a bit more tea seed oil than I can withstand... I'm very sensitive.\n\nThis is an opened product (since I tried it) and I don't know exactly how much tea there are in the bag but...it's probably 70g? I'm not sure...\n\nI'll take trades of favorable teas (just comment on what you have to offer) or you can pay for shipping and it'll be all yours. I'll be sending it in a small cardboard box, likely priority mail. Expected shipping fee is at least $5.85? I can also throw in samples of teas from Lupicia if you like (as fillers).

    "body": "**Product Review: Pureforet Centella Multi Lotion**\n\nAhh…finally able to finalize and share this Review. I have had this Product in my Routing since January LOL! But, because I changed gears and focused on Mad Hippie for the last month…I decided to hold off on this Review until I was done with that Brand. But keep in mind, I used the Centella Multi Lotion the entire time both AM and PM (the Mad Hippie Moisturizer didn’t interest me). Okay, let’s dig in!\n\nThis is a Product that came in a Factory Subscription Box last year. One of the things that I loved (and hated LOL) about their Skincare Box was the curation of Brands I had ZERO familiarity with. I ended up with Serums from CLIV and Puregen and Soroci…never hearing of those names before. This Moisturizer from Pureforet was among them. But, after using this Product for about 6 weeks…I need more of this Brand in my life LOL!\n\nThe parent company of Pureforet (called Ecocation) describes on their site how Pureforet was developed. Of course there is a lot of marketing dollars behind all of this…but basically they claim to offer natural, safe for sensitive/acne prone skin, and economically priced Products to consumers. There is also a page about their social contributions to various organizations. \n\nOkay, let’s talk about the Lotion already! This is a lightweight/slightly watery Emulsion-like Product that applies super evenly and absorbs fairly quickly. It’s one of the lighter Moisturizers that I have used and sits beside the Etude House Soon Jung Emulsion and Cosrx Lotion With Birch Sap in texture/feel.\n\nThe Ingredients List/Formula is where I think this Product really stands out form the others though. There is 74.33% Centella Asiatica here…along with Macadamia Seed Oil, Peptides, Tea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Jojoba Seed Oil, Knotweed Root Extract, Skullcap Root Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Chameleon Plant Extract. There are also Essential Oils here…which is a bummer for some. Tea Tree, Clary, and Lavender Oils are all here. But the thing that made me (and my Skin) so happy to see in this Formula was Willow Bark Extract and direct Salicylic Acid (aka BHAs). \n\nPretty much from my first application of this Product…I know my Combination/Sebum Factory Skin was going to like it. The lightweight texture and easy application left a nice/comfortable result that didn’t feel heavy or greasy in any way. But, the addition of Jojoba and Macadamia Oil meant that this Lotion still locked hydration in…unlike other lighter Products. It’s honestly like magic how Pureforet snuck those Oils in!\n\nOver time, I noticed that my Skin was looking generally smoother, softer, and less congested. Then…enter Mad Hippie. Between their Cleansing Oil and Cream Cleanser my Skin started looking more and more congested. Neither of them seemed to be geared towards my Skin type or able to clear my Skin of excess Sebum and Oil. The Pureforet Centella Multi Lotion did its absolute best to keep things at bay…but the poor Lotion could only do so much.\n\nWhat I appreciated was this Product’s ability to keep everything relatively calm and soothed during this trying time (LOL!). This Lotion (I AM NOT KIDDING) is almost instantly soothing and cooling…with redness dissipating in minutes. It was almost like applying a calming Wash-Off Mask without the wait or rinsing. I really feel like this Product kept me away from the ledge just enough…otherwise I may have bailed on the Mad Hippie Brand Review altogether. \n\nHonestly, this Centella Multi Lotion is just a better formulated version of the Cosrx Natural BHA Skin Returning Emulsion (even down to the slightly sweet scent) and I’m okay with that. I feel like the BHA power is a bit stronger here and the calming ability is much more noticeable.\n\nIn the summer months…my Oily/Combination Skin peeps are going to be hard pressed to find a better/more versatile Lotion. Those with Dry Skin might use this as a Serum or PM Lotion under a Night Cream. My previous “Top of Top” (LOL) winners have been the Cosrx Oil-Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion With Birch Sap and the Youth To The People Adaptogen Deep Moisture Cream…I think this Pureforet Centella Multi Lotion might have them both beat. I can’t believe I almost gave this Product away because I was totally in the dark about the Brand. \n\nPureforet makes a Cleansing Water, Toner, Cream, and Balm/Oil in the same Centella Line and I intend on picking up one of each. As for the Lotion…I’ll be setting what I have left aside as a backup in case things go south with other Products in the future.

I'm obsessed with the oil, not so much with the $78 an ounce price tag :/ So I thought I would try and DIY something similar with a few of the oils that make up the major part of Nude's oil - meadowfoam, sweet almond, apricot kernel, and camelina oils. I'm wondering how I should proportion the different oils to get a good blend. \n\nI'm going to have 8 oz each of the apricot kernel and sweet almond oil, and 4 oz each of the camelina and meadowfoam, so I have some wiggle room to experiment. What do y'all suggest? Should I maybe add another \"basic\" oil to the mix like the ones in the Nude oil (jojoba, sunflower, corn)? I'm only going to be using this blend to moisturize, not to cleanse.\n\n**Ingredients of Nude's ProGenius Oil**, for comparison: Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Camelina Sativa Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Crambe Abyssinica Seed Oil, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Commiphora Mukul Resin Extract, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Tocopherol, Vanillin, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Rapeseed Glycerides, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Tocopheryl Acetate, Alcohol, Bht, Ci 75120 (Annatto)",

    "body": "I went to the hair salon because I neglected my hair after a bout of depression and I thought it would be too much work to handle it myself. The stylist was very helpful and kind and helped me sort the problem in about two hours--my curly hair was reasonably long and thick. The end result was half the length was taken off, but that was okay. \n\nThen, she talked me into getting a pixie cut. She showed me pictures of it, but it didn't occur to me how short that really was. I decided to try it to make her happy because she did work on my hair and get it back to a manageable state, but after I got home and looked at it, I realized I made a big mistake. The back of my hair is missing, and the sides are short. The only parts that can still frame my face are the sections in front. \n\nI hate this, but it might get worse. I'm not sure how to successfully re-grow my hair. When it was past my shoulders, I didn't do anything to it but brush it most times, and it still didn't grow much longer than it was for years. I don't know much about hair growth but the idea that my hair won't grow enough to grow this pixie cut out into something presentable is a little scary to me. I'm on something like Abilify, and birth control pills, and I'm worried something I'm taking is a hair growth inhibitor. \n\nDo you have any advice? Should I try Rogaine? Tea seed oil? Fermented rice water treatments?",

A lot of products are sitting by the wayside at the moment too because my routine is pretty bare bones because I've been breaking out so much.\n\nI was on PocketDerm for about 8 months (first with a .04% tret formula, then to a 4% niacinamide formula) and it actually made my skin worse then slightly better. Then I went on a two week vacation to Europe and the traveling/water/stress really did a number on my skin. Cystic and hormonal (jaw area) acne that just would not stop coming and keeps recurring in the same spots. Been controlling it kinda but finally decided to see an in-person dermatologist because I was getting really down about my skin. She prescribed me Accutane after hearing my story (suffered with mild/moderate but persistent acne for 15 years, tried a lot of prescription topicals, am on hormonal BC, and have taken antibiotics for acne in the past), and I'm currently in my 30 day waiting period before I can start my course. Probably will start May 5th or 6th.\n\nI'm looking for any experiences or advice from ABers who have been on Accutane or are currently on Accutane. Were you able to stick to your AB routine or did you have to completely change everything to the usually recommended products (Aquaphor, Cetaphil, Cerave, Vaseline, etc.)? Did your AB products (layers of moisturizers and serums and gels) help stave off the dryness? Did the fragrances of your AB products irritate your skin? If you don't mind me asking, how much do you pay for your Accutane? I'm in the US and on a high deductible health insurance plan, so I'm paying everything out of pocket until I hit my deductible, which sucks. I think my cheapest route is going to be Zenatane, through their direct success pharmacy. I think it will be about $250 a month for 30mg, which is what I am starting with. Anyone taking any supplements during their course? What are you taking? (I will consult with my doc before taking anything, of course. I'm not asking for medical advice, just experiences and suggestions.)\n\nHere's my current routine, which is pretty stripped down at the moment:\n\nAM:  \nHada Labo Gokujyun Foaming  \nHada Labo Gokujyun Lotion  \nInnisfree Green Tea Seed Serum  \nCosRX Snail Mucin Essence  \nBiore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50+ PA++++  \nCerave Moisturizing Lotion (pump bottle)  \n\n\nPM:  \nKose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil (or Banila Co Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm)  \nHada Labo Gokujyun Foaming  \nPaula's Choice 2% BHA (or CosRX BHA Returning A-Sol)\nHada Labo Gokujyun Lotion  \nInnisfree Green Tea Seed Serum  \nCosRX Snail Mucin Essence  \nPocketDerm (4% niacinamide, 1% clindamycin, 4% azelaic acid)  \nCerave Moisturizing Lotion (pump bottle)  \nInnisfree Green Tea Moisture Cream (if dry)  \nInnisfree Green Tea Seed Oil (mixed in with the cream if REALLY dry)  \n\nOther:  \nNexcare Acne Patches  \nOccasional MBD sheet mask  \nSleeping pack if I haven't fallen asleep already (Laneige Water Sleeping Pack, Innisfree Green Tea Sleeping Pack or Missha Snail)  \n\nOnce I start Accutane, I will discontinue the BHAs and the PocketDerm cream. I probably could amp up my sheet mask and sleeping mask usage to help with the dryness. I'll probably start using facial oil more too. I already use Aquaphor and Cerave so I am set there. I feel pretty prepared for it, albeit scared of the side effects. Thanks for reading all of this! If anyone else is currently on Accutane, please let me know and maybe we can go through this together!\n\n",

Prior to accutane I only cleansed and moisturized. But during treatment it felt like all I did was moisturize, moisturze, moisturize, and then moistuize some more. I also did my best to avoid the sun for 9 months. But I don't regret taking accutane. \n\nYour routine looks pretty accutane friendly. But you will probably make some changes during the course of your treatment. You will need to stop vit c/aha/bha completely during your treatment. You might become more sensitive to citrus extracts (such as kose softyo deep cleansing oil, banila clean it zero purity, sheet masks with citrus oil as the first few ingredients) and fragarances (such as the laneige water sleeping pack).  You might need to discontinue the use of foaming cleansers during the course of your treatment, the gokujyun foaming cleanser is gentle but your face will literally feel like the sahara. I would look into a cleansing milk as your second cleanser (I'm fond of la roche posay toleriane dermo cleansing milk).  Also if your eyes start to get dry, bring it up with your derm who can discuss eye drops options (medicated or OTC). Invest in a good body lotion (neutrogena's norwegian line was a godsend), lipbalm, and sunscreen for your body. \n\nMy ideal AB friendly accutane routine with your exisiting products would look something like this:\n\n**AM**\n\n* **cleansing milk** La Roche Posay toleriane dermo cleanser\n* CosRX Snail Mucin Essence\n* Hada labo gokujyun lotion\n* Innisfree Green Tea Seed Oil\n* Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum\n* Cerave Moisturizing Lotion, Innisfree Green Tea Moisture Cream, or Embryolisse lait créme concrète <-- good for   the days when your face might not tolerate anything\n* Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50+ PA++++ \n\n**PM**\n\n* **makeup remover** Bioderma crealine micellar water, Clinique take off the day (or any biphase remover)\n* **gentle cleansing oil/balm** clinique take off the day cleansing balm, DHC cleansing oil..\n* **cleansing milk** La Roche Posay toleriane dermo cleanser\n* CosRX Snail Mucin Essence\n* Hada labo gokujyun lotion\n* Innisfree Green Tea Seed Oil \n* **more snails**\n* Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum\n* Innisfree Green Tea Moisture Cream, or Embryolisse lait créme concrète or a cream with ceramides/snails/hyrulonic    acid etc  (get your heavy moisturizing done at night)\n* **occlusive** such as Aquaphor, vaseline,  etc \n\n**Weekly or misc treatments**\n\n* Hydrating sheet masks (double fisting sheet masks is a good way to quickly join the 100+ sheet mask club) \n* Duoderm extra thing GCF dressing 4x4 (these are giant hydrocolloid bandages. I cut little patches as needed to fit, and they have better staying power than the nexcare acne patches.  Buy them on amazon)\n\nTl;dr your skin will ~~probably~~ be the sahara and find any and all ways to add snails to your routine. But it will all be worth it in the end.  \n\nedit: sorry for the awful formatting, posted this on mobile last night.",

        "body": "Sorry if I'm repeating what anyone else said (I'm not able to read the other posts) but I'm on my second month of accutane right now. \n\nI'm on 20mg twice a day. My insurance is United Healthcare and I pay $30 total for a month supply of the medication. \n\nWhat I had to do was quit everything \"non-essential.\" I had to stop any topicals, no more OST C20 for me (/cry), etc. I was limited to only oil-cleansing, face wash, moisturizing, and sunscreen. It is a VERY bare-minimum routine and is definitely what you should do. Accutane makes your skin so incredibly sensitive and thin that you don't want anything harsh at all.\n\nMORNING:\n\nHada Labo Gokujyun Foaming \n\nHada Labo Hyaluronic Lotion (generous amount)\n\nShiseido Senka Sunscreen \n\n*My skin was oily enough that after accutane completely dried me out, I was able to last the day with A VERY GENEROUS layer of hyaluronic lotion without a second moisturizer. I would suggest another moisturizer if need be. Also sunscreen is nonnegotiable but I see that's not a problem for you. \n\nEVENING:\nCamellia oil+Rice bran oil Mix (to remove makeup - my own mixture) - basically any oil to remove makeup - the Kose one is perfect \n\nHada Labo Lotion (sometimes twice if need be)\n\nBenton Steam Cream \n \nI think your plan to get rid of the BHAs and PocketDerm are good. Anything that will help moisturizing is good. Anything that has even a little bit of irritation to work (ex: Vitamin C serum) needs to go. \n\nIn terms of dry lips: oh god. Carry a water bottle around with you, drink it by the hour, and apply Aquaphor after every time you drink (never wait until your lips are dry). If you go without water for even a little, it starts to peel. At night, I pack on the vaseline like nobody's business after gulping water. I've been doing ok with my lips! Start preparing before you even start accutane! Good luck!\n\nEDIT: I saw your post about the Hada Labo Foaming possibly being too much for you. I only use it once a day, in the morning, and a smaller amount, and I have no irritation. It's up to you. Maybe try for a couple days and see. I used it both before and after starting Accutane and no changes so far.",

I will repeat what everyone else already said about how dry your skin will be: I only got into AB seriously about 3 months ago, so essentially for the first couple of month I did not have a serious moisturizing routine other than slapping on some emu oil whenever I remembered or whenever my dry flakes reaaaally bothered me.\n\nThen, I discovered the amazing ~~100~~ 10-step AB routine and really upped my moisturizing game. Essentially, I treated my skin as if it were severely dehydrated (which it is while on Accutane) but it felt supremely weird at the beginning because my skin was extremely oily prior to going on this medication. Don't be afraid of thick creams, but don't forget to patch-test either. I made the every-noob mistake of patch-testing with my whole face at the beginning so it took almost 2 months for me to figure out a stable routine.\n\nThe other thing I found is that I have to really pamper my moisture barrier not only by replenishing it regularly, but also cleaning less as well. Again, this will feels weird if you're used to being squeaky clean after a trip to the bathroom sink. I found that multiple foam cleansers (including the beloved Hada Labo Gokujun foam) \"broke me out\" (or more likely irritation/contact dermatitis from a thinned moisture barrier). As a result I gave up on foam cleaning and only oil cleanse at the moment. Probably won't go back to it until a couple of months after I finish my treatment.",

I am in Australia paying $6 for a box of 60 capsules (doesn’t matter what mg dose amount) my dermatologist has very clearly stated to not use ANY product apart from a lotion cleaner usually Avene I am using QV but it’s an Australian product and moisturise after researching just like you I found that First Aid beauty was what anyone and everyone who went on isotretinoin said they used and loved, their cream in the tub was the best and I have never once had dry skin throughout my whole course and it helps calm down your skin! She said only cleanse and moisturise literally nothing else which was really hard to do as there were soo many face masks I wanted to try lol but at the end she wanted to see whether the treatment was actually working or not. You can’t tell that if you are using alot of products. \n\nAdvice on couple things I saw you comment:\n\n- Prior to starting treatment I was using a foaming cleanser my dermatologist said absolutely not as it is too drying. Lotion based only and double cleanse when you are wearing SPF with the oink garnier micellar water.\n\n- SPF 50 every time u are out if the house no less than 50\n\n- no serums no masks cut everything out! \n\n- if you are having dry skin, blackheads and white heads no scrubs or anything instead use a warm washcloth and gently rub against these areas (it will work!) then cleanse, moisturise and done.",

    "body": "Hello. My journey with skincare started at the age of 12, when I first started to break out. Just a teenager thing, I thought, and spent lots of time at the dermatologist and using the cliché things like Pr*activ. It got worse as the years went by and culminated in it being so bad that I could barely move my face without pain, and I literally wanted to die. That's when I nuked it with Accutane, which sucked (I literally cannot remember those 6 months of my life), but definitely did the trick. So the many years after that have just been me trying to treat the scars of the past, and keep new breakouts at bay. \n\nMy treatment up until a few days ago, which I have used for years, was from an obscure and somewhat sketchy brand called [Exposed Skin Care](https://www.exposedskincare.com/pages/how-it-works). The folks at the AB subreddit called it way too intense, but damn it, it kept the cystic stuff away and my breakouts were never worse than a pimple or two. I eventually switched just the cleanser to CeraVe's SA cleanser in an attempt to save money. [This is what my skin looked like as of last week](https://imgur.com/a/KtO6K1a) (with white bars for anonymity. apologies for the scruff.) Mostly clear of acne, but it's an overall rough complexion with very apparent pores. I've pretty much concluded that my skin type is a combo, since I get very oily on the nose and forehead, and tend to get tightness in other areas, as well as flakiness around the corners of my nose and eyebrows.\n\nI was trying to move away from Exposed anyway, so I decided to get input on r/AsianBeauty. I got convinced to ditch all actives in favor of trying to maintain the skin barrier, and I brought in Cetaphil's fragrance free cleanser, Cosrx Snail Mucin Essense, and a whole bunch of moisturizers I rotated between: Cosrx Propolis Light Cream (lasted a day, made my face itchy in some areas), Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Cream (I had a sample, and it lasted all day, but felt a bit greasy), and Cetaphil Deep Hydration Water Gel (I think this is new from them. Felt light, but also like it didn't last long before drying out). For the last week, twice a day I would wash, snail, and moisturize with one of those. [Now my skin looks like this!](https://imgur.com/a/Q80Xs7x) I immediately got some fat pimples (which are on their way out now, but you can see still), and overall a nice coating of red acne bumps. Probably not a purge, since this is the *absence* of actives. I don't know if it's because one or all of the moisturizers are clogging my pores, or if it's because of a lack of actives. I want to say that in the past, nearly every moisturizer I've also used has broken me out, but if my skin barrier was already damaged, it's possible that was just collateral or coincidental. \n\nLook. I know this stuff takes time, but I hope you can understand just how disheartened I am at this. This past week I've been overloaded with information about western vs eastern skincare standards, too many actives vs not actives, and the incomprehensible number of cleansers, toners, serums, essences, tonics, and moisturizers there are out there. If I tried every conceivable option in every conceivable combination, the number would probably be equal to the number of digits in pi. \n\nI feel like I was on to something with the Exposed stuff, even if it wasn't the best choice. I might opt for something like:\n\nCleanser: CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser, CeraVe SA Cleanser, CeraVe Foaming Cleanser, or Cetaphil Facial Cleanser; depending on if I want to have an active in there or do a gentle one and put an active elsewhere.\n\nToner: CeraVe Hydrating Toner, Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner, or innisfree Hydrating Toner with Green Tea Seed Oil; something hydrating and pH levelling, probably. \n\nEssence/Serum: Something active like Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid, CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum, or CeraVe Acne Control Gel, OR another hydration option like snail mucin.\n\nMoisturizer: Dunno. Cetaphil Deep Hydration Restoring Water Gel or e.l.f. Happy Hydration Cream might be able to maintain hydration without breaking me out. This is where I am the most lost and open to suggestions. \n\nOkay, that's about it. If you are my skin soulmate and have been able to find something that works, please. You have no idea how much I value your help. Suggestions are appreciated. Or just tell me I'm dumb and should keep doing one of the things I've already been doing. Regardless, thanks for reading this stranger's essay about his stupid face (that I ruined by not shaving anyway).",

The tsubaki oil is good but the ones imported from Japan is kinda expensive. The name is Japanese for \"camellia seed oil\". I'd rather search for locally made camellia seed oil because it's cheaper. Lastly, if you want to use your pocket knife to cut food you can also use food grade paraffin oil (parafin wax) which is what i use. It's even cheaper than tsubaki and more readily available.\n\nKeep in mind what your knife blade is made of. If it's made of stainless, you don't need to oil the blade, just the joint or the folding mechanism. If it's carbon steel then yes, you do need to lightly oil the blade. In this case, simply oil one or two drops to the blade then use your (clean) finger to spread it. Wipe excess oil from the blade with clean cloth or tissue. The pores in the metal will slowly absorb the oil and prevent rust to form. You can do it once a week or biweekly.",

All these names correspond to two oils that never should be confused because their origin and properties are very different. The term refers you solely and exclusively to the infusion that is obtained from the leaves of Camellia sinensis, however the qualifying “tea tree” is used to identify the species of Melaleuca alternifolia. \n\nIt is, therefore, of two very different and distant species botanically.  Camellia sinensis is native from China and is a shrub or small perennial tree (1-9 m hight). Leaves, glabrousand serrated edges, measure 4-15 cm long and 2-5 cm wide. The flowers are solitary or in groups of 3, yellowish-white color and are 2-4 cm in diameter. The seeds are brown. Its leaves and shoots, where the tea comes from, contain a high content in polyphenols and recognized benefit to human health compounds and their seeds in fatty acids omega 3, 6 and 9.  \n\nThe tea, tea oil or Camellia seed oil comes from the seeds of Camellia sinensis, but he is also made with seeds of Camellia oleifera or Camellia japonica and is used for cosmetics because of its high power moisturizing, rejuvenating and revitalizing the skin, hair and nails, also possess healing and bactericidal power. Its composition is basically based on fatty acids of the type of omega 3, 6 and 9, considered to be very beneficial for health, so in the Asian countries is very valued for human consumption as well as used for other domestic purposes and industrial (more uses of Camellia oil). ACEMELIA \n\nCamellia oil is an oil that is extracted by cold-pressed from the seeds of Camellia, without any additive or solvent and do not have any contraindication. This oil also could be removed by chemical techniques or extraction by supercritical fluid, as it is usually done in China, but it leads to a significant loss of its organoleptic and chemical properties and the addition of non-natural products.  \n\nMelaleuca alternifolia is native from Australia, where it grows mainly in wet and marshy land in the North Coast. This is a tree up to 10 m with narrow leaves between 10 – 35 mm long and 1mm wide. The flowers are white and grow in spikes of 3-5 cm long and with a fruit small, woody like Cup of 2 – 3mm in diameter.  \n\nTea tree oil, coming both from Melaleuca alternifolia, is an essential oil whose main  chemicals are a complex mixture of alcohols, used as antiseptic, antifungal and antibiotic, healing in general, is used for the cosmetic treatment of some diseases of the skin and to improve mild conditions of the throat and mouth. \n\nThis oil is used mainly in the market of aromatherapy which is very appreciated by its aroma fresh, spicy and bitter. Tea tree oil is extracted by industrial processes by distillation.  As contraindications stresses that you should not drink or be used for internal treatments or their eye contact.  \n\nWe can conclude that the Camellia oil and tea tree oil is not the same, their properties are very different and therefore its uses and utilities.",

Things i’ve tried that don’t work:\n- Pure Vaseline/Aquaphor: did nothing, just an occlusive, my lips stayed dehydrated and burny just sealed \n- Anything labello: did nothing\n- Weleda skinfood lip balm: i wake up with softer lips but they start burning again in the afternoon, hence it’s either completely useless or formulated to make you use more. \n- Connettivina bio stick: might be niche or just in my country. Everyone loves it. Every time I use it it heals cuts and wounds on the lips but then makes them BURN LIKE HELL the next day or ever hours later. And i mean, to the point i was once crying cause i couldn’t sleep and i reapplied just to sleep. NO. \n- Hyaluronic acid: not even my now very irritated skin on the rest of my face absorbs it to the point of receiving a benefit from it. on my lips it was like splashing water\n\nI am kinda terrified of fragrance, alcohol, just anything that could have that rebound effect. My lips feel better and then they burn so much they look like i have red lip liner. The only thing that ever worked on me was the Keys Soulcare comforting balm. I think it’s not discontinued but i can’t find it anywhere that ships here except their website which would be mad expensive. I’m leaving the ingredients list here so i’ll make it easier for people who don’t know the product (apparently, everyone but me cause i couldn’t find anything about it anywhere). \n\nIngredients: RICINUS COMMUNIS (CASTOR) SEED OIL, BEESWAX, CAMELLIA OLEIFERA SEED OIL, PERSEA GRATISSIMA (AVOCADO) OIL, OLEA EUROPAEA (OLIVE) FRUIT OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA BUTTER), SYNTHETIC BEESWAX, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, DAUCUS CAROTA SATIVA (CARROT) ROOT EXTRACT, DAUCUS CAROTA SATIVA (CARROT) SEED OIL, BETA-CAROTENE, ANASTATICA HIEROCHUNTICA EXTRACT, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, PEG-8, TOCOPHEROL, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, ASCORBIC ACID, WATER (AQUA), CITRIC ACID, CAMELLIA SEED OIL, ROSE OF JERICHO, AVOCADO OIL, SHEA BUTTER.\n\nIf anyone finds another balm or mask just like this one, I will owe you my life. If you know of any other balm or mask that is the least chemical possible (i’m now terrified of pharmaceutical products too) and is actually nourishing with real nourishing ingredients and not just occlusive, let me know cause i’m desperate ",

And there is some evidence that canned items leach plastics and stuff into foods (sorry, I know!) but overall healthy!\n\n-smoothies: depends what you put in it!

I mean, if it’s not processed then it’s probably alright in moderation but I don’t really see the appeal in stripping away the fibre of a fruit. \n\n-Kombucha: heck yes! I personally love kombucha!! Fermented foods are a great natural probiotic source & also a source of vitamin K2! The best kind should be packed in glass & sold refrigerated (unpasteurized). Be mindful that they contain small amounts of caffeine and alcohol though. Check the ingredient some of the cheaper ones I’ve seen add lots of weird stuff. \n\nLastly I’m interested to see what people say about the oils.",

    "body": "I seem to have ruined my skin. I've always had dryness problems, but I found a routine that seemed to keep it mostly happy. For the last 3 or so weeks, its been unbearable. \n\nI'm not sure how much of this is from the face paint I (stupidly) used on halloween, or the extra dry Colorado air, or both. But, right now my skin feels miserable. I'm re-applying moisturizer 3-4 times a day. My face is constantly itchy. The texture of my skin has changed from being tight without moisturizer to rough and flakey constantly, even on my ears, which did not have any face paint on them. However, the extreme dryness is contained to my face.\n\nMy routine: \n\n**AM - **\nRince with warm water\nMoisturize with **Ren Evercalm Global Protection Day Cream** (I switched to this recently, and it really helps with the redness I have from Exczma - Used 3 months)\nMakeup - I use **Makeup forever Ultra HD foundation.** I was told this was really good for dry skin, and If I have foundation on I can generally go 8 hours with out feeling like I need to re-moisturize. (Used 3 Months)\n\nPM - \nOil cleanse with **Burts Bees Facial Cleansing oil** (used 9 months)\nFollowed with **Simple Micellar water**, because I'm not a fan of the lingering oily feeling (used 9 months)\n**Ren Flash hydro boost instant plumping emulsion** w/ a bit of warm water per the instructions (Used 3 months)\nFollowed by **Boscia Tsubuki Deep Hydration Sleeping Mask** (used 1 year)\n\nI had been using Nip/Fab Gycolic fix, but stopped it back in August. I suspected most of my acne was caused by issues with my moisture barrier, and I was advised here to stop it.\n\nAs of now, anything with moisturizer in it, including my foundation, stings for a few seconds when I fist apply it. I even found a small travel container that I had put First Aid Beauty in, and tried that and it stung. \n\nI also tried a moisturizing and soothing sheet mask from Sephora, but it made me itchy more than anything. I run a cold humidifier at night, to prevent nosebleeds as well as dry cracked hands. \n\n\nThe \"posting guidelines\" suggest ingredients, so here it goes:\n\n**Ren Evercalm Global Protection Day Cream:** Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Myristyl Myristate, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Glucoside, Triheptanoin, Oryzanol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Bisabolol, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Seed Oil, Carbomer, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Tocopherol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Cinnamomum Camphora Linalloliferum (Ho Wood) Leaf Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Pueraria Lobata (Kudzu) Symbiosome Extract, Cassia Alata Leaf Extract, Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Fragrance, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool.\n\n**Facial Cleansing Oil with Coconut & Argan Oils:** Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Crambe Abyssinica Seed Oil, Isoamyl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-2 Sesquioleate, Fragrance*, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Tocopherol Natural Fragrance.\n\n**Simple Cleansing Micellar Water:** Water (Aqua), Hexylene Glycol,Glycerin, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) FlowerExtract, Panthenol, Niacinamide, Sodium AscorbylPhosphate, Peg-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, DmdmHydantoin, Cetrimonium Chloride, TetrasodiumEdta, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, SodiumChloride, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\n**Ren Flash Hydro-Boost Instant Plumping Emulsion:** Water, Squalane, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Oleyl Alcohol, Arginine, Cetyl Phosphate, Xylitylglucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Myristyl Myristate, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Oil, Anhydroxylitol, Oryzanol, Vaccinium Vitas-Idaea Seed Oil, Yeast Extract, Alcohol, Carbomer, Phospholipids, Xylitol, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Parfum* (Fragrance), Safflower Oil / Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters, Sodium Hyaluronate, Soy Amino Acids, Glucose, Glyceryl Laurate, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Seed Extract, Benzoic Acid, Dehydracetic Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool. *100% Natural Fragrance.\n\n**boscia Tsubaki Deep Hydration Sleeping Mask:** Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Dimethicone, Sucrose, Lactobacillus Ferment, Pentylene Glycol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polysorbate 60, Squalane, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Epilobium Angustifolium Extract, Undaria Pinnatifida Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Algae Extract, Althaea Officinalis Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Carbomer, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol.\n\nAny advice is very appreciated.

I've only recently started using a hair mask on top of my regular (shampoo + conditioner and/or diluted apple cider vinegar) routine once a week. I am currently using some L'Oreal Botanicals Safflower hair mask that I had lying around, but it's almost empty. It's a nice mask, but unfortunately it isn't being produced anymore.  So  I was in town this morning for a new hair mask looking at several Garnier Loving Blends Hairmask, but I don't really know which one would be best. \n\nCould anyone help me?

I used to cleanse and sometimes moisturize only. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am allergic to everything under the sun from plants, animals, mold, dust, foods, and chemicals. I've had pretty extensive allergy testing done at the doctor. Tested \"positive\" for 60 of 60 \"natural\" allergens (I reacted to all plants, pollen, animals, mold). I reacted to the tape done for the chemical test, so that has to be redone. I have not yet done the food allergy test. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as chemicals go, I know for sure I am allergic to Stearyl Alcohol. I have also decided to try to avoid Cetyl Alcohol and thus Cetearyl Alcohol (Cetyl and Stearyl alcohols combined). I also prefer fragrance free or very low fragrance/odor (due to other allergies and migraine triggers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have combonation skin, leaning towards dry. I get very flaky skin easily (it will peel off in patches or sheets). I also have relatively sensitive skin, turning red very quickly and also breaking out into hives, rashes, and contact dermatitis. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow is my current skin care routine with products I use with a link to the product and the ingredient list. (the links are just generic to sephora mostly because that is where i bought these products)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I am wanting help with a few things\n\n1. are all of the products i have listed safe from the above alcohols?\n2. Is this the right order?\n3. do I need to add or subtract anything from my routine?\n4. any other suggestions or advice?\n5. several product replacements i need\n   1. eye cream\n   2. exfoliate \n   3. lotion!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will update later with my makeup list, but one step at a time.

I bet you can imagine how excited i was, just to find out that they packed the green tea seed oil (THE EXPENSIVE ONE) upside down and it leaked around 1/4 of oil out... </3\n\nI'm devastated, ive sent them an email, but need to wait for reply. Is their customer service is reliable? I'm afraid they are going to tell me to f*k off, since just last week ago i was complaining that while making order they didnt give me a free solution kit, even though it was automatically given to anyone making an order just a couple of hours after i did. :[ It was first time i ever complained to a company and now i hate myself for that because now i look like a fraud.

    "body": "Hi Fancy Follicles just looking for some advice,\n\nIt's my first time at home bleaching my hair and have regularly been using Olia light blonde (last time was about 2 months ago, give or take). I have a darker Brown hair colour and about 1/2 inch of roots to colour. I have some Wella colour charm powder lightener and Wella cream developer volume 20. I plan to tone after but I'm wondering if I should be concerned, since I've been reading some articles about metallic salts in box dyes. I know metal salt dyes can't be combined with bleach (burning etc) but I'm not sure if Olia hair dye has these salts and I was wondering if one of you wonderful people with more knowledge then me could let me know. \n\nHere's the ingredient list: \n\nColorant: Paraffinum Liquidum/Mineral Oil/Huile Minerale, Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethanolamine, Steareth-20, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Polysorbate 21, Toluene-2,5-Diamine, Steareth-2, Resorcinol, Parfum/Fragrance, M-Aminophenol, 2,4-Diaminophenoxyethanol Hcl, Sodium Metabisulfite, N,N-Bis(2-Hydroxyethyl)-P-Phenylenediamine Sulfate, Ascorbic Acid, Edta, Polyquaternium-67, Hydroxybenzomorpholine, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil/Sunflower Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil/Meadowfoam Seed Oil, Passiflora Incarnata/Passiflora Incarnata Seed Oil, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Thioglycerin\n\nTLDR: is there metallic salts in Olia hair colour and should I be concerned bleaching my hair at home after using Olia for a few yrs",

        "body": "Metallic salts react badly with most professional colors and bleaches. Metallic salts are typically the culprit when you hear about someone getting a \"chemical haircut\" i.e. their hair breaks off. It can also cause your hair to smoke and melt. I would recommend performing a test strand before each new color. Take a small section of hair from the lower back of your head and apply the color/bleach and let it develop to see how the hair reacts. Does it smoke, get hot, not color well, break, or cause your hair to feel like wet noodles? If the answer to any of those is yes, obviously don't go through with doing your whole head. If the test strand goes well, you're good to go!",

        "body": "I know the impulse is to do a big order to save on shipping, but I think it's also ok to do several smaller shipments. You can't use everything at once anyway. Ideally, you should be introducing new products little-by-little. Maybe one new product a week, so you can test to see if your skin likes it. Also, you can order samples of a lot of the more popular products, so you can test that way too.\n\nSince your skin is only sensitive sometimes, I guess you'll have to decide how much you want to baby your skin. For me, I would want to choose products that are more for sensitive skin when there's a choice. But you might know better how much you need to do this.\n\nFor cleansers, I like the Banila Co. I have sensitive skin, and I am ok with the regular one. The Purity version actually has some herbal ingredients that I wasn't sure would work for me. The BioDerma water looks good, and I think it could work as your step 1 to remove makeup. Cleansing oils are nice too. You could get a few samples of these. DHC is olive oil based and should work for sensitive skin unless olive oil happens to break you out. (You might not know until you try.) The Innisfree, Skin Food and Face Shop cleansing oils are all pretty popular, but scented.\n\nFor toners, the Mizon is the one I've heard of most. It might be good for acne, but not sure if it will work for dryer skin. For masks, the Skin Food one is popular. There's a black sugar strawberry one that people like. For eye cream, I would go for the Kiehl's or Mizon because of the snails. \n\nFor treatment, I have the C20 Vitamin C but haven't used it yet. I would try to buy some samples of the Innisfree. Missha ampoule and essence are popular as well. \n\nYou might want to hold off a little on the AHA/BHA's until you get a settled routine and your skin is more moisturized. The Mizon AIO is not a real moisturizer from what I understand. It's kind of a treatment and goes on before your other steps. A little different. You can order samples of the Starfish Cream pretty easily. \n\nToo Cool for School has a pumpkin sleeping pack that people like. Also, people seem to like [Mizon Good Night Sleeping Pack.](http://www.amazon.com/Mizon-Tube-Night-White-Sleeping/dp/B00GB1E940) But Laneige is said to be nice too.\n\nYou might want to add in [Hada Labo lotion.](http://www.amazon.com/Rohto-Hadalabo-Gokujyn-Hyaluronic-Lotion/dp/B000FQUGXA) It's popular around here and works a little like a serum. Not a lotion as we think of it. You may need an extra lotion or cream at some point, but those are usually easier to find in non AB if you need. Have fun!",

We can recommend things all day long but when it comes down to it - it's your skin and YMMV. It's best to start with samples to figure out if they'll work for you before purchasing a full-size product.\n\nMy only suggestion would be to reevaluate your AHA choices. If this is your first time using acids, start with the lower percentage and apply every other day to begin with. You might also find that Glycolic Acid won't work for you (all the AHAs you've listed are GA so far). I am currently using the Alpha Hydrox and it works amazingly!\n\nSince you mention you have dry skin - avoid BHAs for now. They tend to be drying and you don't want to over-exfoliate!\n\nOil cleansing is supposed to replace makeup removers in most cases. Some people use separate wipes to remove their eye makeup (since it's a bit harder and no one wants to drag the skin around their eyes around) but mainly it's the double-cleansing method: Oil + Foam.",

I've been using the La Roche-Posay Anthelios XL ultra-light lotion in SPF 60. It says it is non-comedogenic.\n- For the past 2 weeks or so, I've been trying to double cleanse at night. I am using the Vichy Purete Thermale Cleansing Micllear Oil. I have used this in the past, though not as frequently, and didn't notice any problems. I was using a Bioderma face wash for oily skin.\n- For the past week or so, I've been using the Cerave Facial Foaming Cleanser as my second cleanser (after the oil) because I was told it has a low pH and is good for oily skin. I read this on Reddit, and thought it might be better than the Bioderma Sebium wash.\n\nAny ideas what might be breaking me out? \n\nAlternatively, what should I stop using for a while to see if it's the culprit?\n\nEdit: The oil in the Vichy cleanser is \"CAMELLIA OLEIFERA SEED OIL.\"",

    "body": " \n\nLong story short I am new to actually caring for my skin and am needing some help. I used to cleanse and sometimes moisturize only.\n\nI am allergic to everything under the sun from plants, animals, mold, dust, foods, and chemicals. I've had pretty extensive allergy testing done at the doctor. Tested \"positive\" for 60 of 60 \"natural\" allergens (I reacted to all plants, pollen, animals, mold). I reacted to the tape done for the chemical test, so that has to be redone. I have not yet done the food allergy test.\n\nAs far as chemicals go, I know for sure I am allergic to Stearyl Alcohol. I have also decided to try to avoid Cetyl Alcohol and thus Cetearyl Alcohol (Cetyl and Stearyl alcohols combined). I also prefer fragrance free or very low fragrance/odor (due to other allergies and migraine triggers)\n\nI have combonation skin in terms of both seasonal and t-zone combination, leaning towards dry. I get very flaky skin easily (it will peel off in patches or sheets). I also have relatively sensitive skin due to both general sensitivity and allergies, turning red very quickly and also breaking out into hives, rashes, and contact dermatitis.\n\nBelow is my current skin care routine with products I use with a link to the product and the ingredient list. (the links are just generic to sephora mostly because that is where i bought these products)\n\nI am wanting help with a few things\n\n1. are all of the products i have listed safe from the above alcohols?\n2. Is this the right order?\n3. do I need to add or subtract anything from my routine?\n4. any other/general suggestions or advice?\n5. several product replacements i need suggestions for\n   1. eye

Essences are super light, and often have hyaluronic acid. They go deep in the skin, and help whatever you put on top absorb and work better.",

    "body": " This Centrifugal Oil Filter is the small type of oil filtering equipment, which can also be called the centrifugal oil filter and the cooking oil filtration machine. This oil filter uses the high-speed rotation of its centrifugal head to separate the oil, water, and impurities quickly of the lubricating oil with different degrees of pollution or various edible oils and frying oil by different centrifugal forces. This oil filtering equipment is very practical for filtering and purifying all kinds of oils.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ckr4tijr5ve71.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93dc06f438d7caab77d758c1c1bf422179fef39b\n\n**Why should we use the automatic centrifugal oil filter?**  \nIn the industrial field, especially in the field of heavy industrial machinery manufacturing, there is often a large amount of waste engine oil and lubricating oil to be processed. The oil filter machine can effectively separate the impurities and excess moisture from these oils, and the filtered oil and lubricating oil can be reused. In addition, this centrifugal oil filter is more widely used in edible oil purification treatment. Most of the vegetable oil mill’s pressed oil needs to be filtered by the oil filter before it can be eaten. The cooking oil filter can separate the residue and moisture from the oil, thus ensuring the pure taste of the edible oil.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x1fhokss5ve71.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5c8e65280aa10a8d80ad42ec8b3f1bbc0b6780a\n\n**Main applications of the edible oil filtering machine**  \nCentrifugal oil filters are used more and more widely in various oil mills. The key steps of the oil press are scrambled seeds, oil extraction, and filtration in three steps. The filtration is to ensure that the oil that is squeezed out is clear and can be cooked directly on the pan. Cooking oil filters are widely used in recent years. So which oil can be filtered by the centrifugal oil filter? In fact, most vegetable oils, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower seed oil, linseed oil, and tea seed oil, can be filtered using this centrifugal oil filter.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n849hmxt5ve71.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56a7c892cddaa59cd8e60cb27b9c110c6433ecc\n\nThe oil filter that separates substances of different specific gravity in oil by the centrifugal force generated by high-speed rotation, thereby effectively separating edible oil, phospholipids and various impurities. The edible oil filtered by the centrifugal oil filter has the advantages of no foaming and no overflow when frying and frying. The filter has a fast filtering speed, does not require frequent replacement of consumables, and does not cause nutrient damage to the cooking oil itself.  \n\n\n**Working principle of the centrifugal oil filter**  \nThe oil filter is oil filtered by the centrifugal force of a rotating drum rotating at a high speed. The slag in the hydrated oil absorbs water and becomes heavier. The water quality is second only to the oil slag, and the oil is lighter. Therefore, the slag, water, and oil naturally form three layers on the inner wall of the rotating drum at a high speed. When the switch stops rotating, the oil will slide out of the drum at the surface of the micro-water molecules and flows out from the specific outlet, thereby achieving the filtering purpose. The edible oil purified by the oil filter machine is pure in oil quality.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8hmu4yu5ve71.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc737a2f6b2fa528c74c08d726d31322e0d83b67\n\n**Main features of the cooking oil purifying machine**  \nThis oil filtration machine always can match with the oil press machine when using for processing all kinds of high-quality vegetable oils. After oil filtering, these edible oils can be cooked or sold directly.  \nWith high oil filtering efficiency, this centrifugal oil filter can be widely used in various oil processing workshops with small, medium or large scale. Besides, it is energy-saving and cost-saving.  \nAll the parts of this filter machine are made of corrosion-resistant stainless steel so that it is very durable and efficient for cooking oil processing.  \nThis oil filter machine is the small and practical type of oil filtration equipment used for processing edible oil. To meet the different requirements of the customers, this machine has been designed with various models with different working capacities.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04ld7cax5ve71.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce1bfe6ed9ec2c8177e5307f22e19675f79b2091\n\n**Why adding saltwater when using the cooking oil filter?**  \nThe oil extracted from the oil crop contains a large number of phospholipids, which seriously affects the taste of the edible oil. When the oil is heated to 280 degrees, it tends to form a black precipitate, and a large amount of foam is formed, which is why some edible oils are not clean. Heating causes a cause of frothing.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dj5npnay5ve71.jpg?width=626&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5c989c3a9b7eed4675cba60d53b114c0afa4d82\n\nPhospholipids are insoluble in water but are easily absorbing water and swell into colloids when absorbed. The effect of adding brine is Na+particles in brine, which can accelerate the aggregation of phospholipids. In this way, adding saltwater to the hair oil can make the phospholipids heavier than simply adding water, and the separation is more thorough, which can increase the oil filtering effect.  \n\n\n**Centrifugal oil filter technical data**  \nModel Power(KW) Rotating speed (r/min) The diameter of the barrel(mm) Output (kg/h)  \nTZ-YTLY40 1.5 1800 360 80  \nTZ-YTLY50 1.5 1800 500 200  \nTZ-YTLY60 1.5 1800 550 260  \nTZ-YTLY80 2.0 2200 600 350",
