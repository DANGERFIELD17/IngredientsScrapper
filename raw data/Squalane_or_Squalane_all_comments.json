    "body": "Hi everyone! I posted this on another sub not too long ago and because of the positive reaction I wanted to share it with you all. Hope you like it.      \n      \nLittle bit about me/my skin: Im 25F and I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin. My skin is especially sensitive to fragrance, citrus and floral essential oils. Because of this I’ve become a bit of a skincare nerd and an obsessive ingredients list reader. I definitely still have a lot to learn about skincare but I hope this list helps some of you! Especially my fellow sensitive skin skincare addicts.          \n                \nI tried to keep the reviews very short and straight forward, but if you want me to expand on any products let me know!           \n           \n1.        **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer 30 SPF - 3/10**                    \n*Pros:* Fragrance free and very moisturizing.        \n*Cons:* Broke me out and burned my eyes\nBest for: dry skin.      \n       \n2.        **Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* literally nothing.        \n*Cons:* I don’t like the smell, it broke me out, didn’t remove my makeup well.         \n \n3.        **Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 6/10**\n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list.          \n*Cons:* Stripping/drying and expensive.         \n*For who?* Oily skin or those that like to feel squeaky clean.     \n       \n4.        **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 60 SPF (American) - 3/10**            \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.    \n*Cons:* Greasy, broke me out, stung my eyes.    \n*Bottom Line:* Stick to the European version.     \n       \n5.         **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 50+ SPF (European) - 9/10**          \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast, reasonably priced.    \n*Cons:* texture is a little too runny for my liking.    \n*Bonus:* LRP donates to skin cancer research.    \n       \n6.         **Jordan Samuel Hydrate Facial Serum - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* Couldn’t try long enough to say.    \n*Cons:* Gave me a bright red burning skin reaction.     \n*Bottom Line:* Looks like they changed their formula (for good reason obvi) so I can’t speak for the new version.     \n*For who?* Those who want an excuse to cancel dinner plans.    \n       \n7.         **Mario Badescu Rose Facial Spray - 0/10**    \n*Pros:* Cheap.   \n*Cons:* Mist comes out too strong, I don’t like the smell, contains fragrance, citronellol, geraniol and colorants.   \n*Bottom Line:* Thank goodness it was a gift, because I won’t be buying.   \n     \n8.        **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 5/10**    \n*Pros:* Unscented, affordable.    \n*Cons:* Made my skin itch and left a residue.    \n*Bottom Line:* I won’t repurchase.   \n     \n9.         **A313 Vitamin A Pommade - 10/10**   \n*Pros:* My pimples reduced, skin texture improved (after two weeks). Thick vasaline texture that locks in the vitamin A.      \n*Cons:* Slight metallic smell     \n*Bottom Line:* Worth the hype! I use 2x a week max, alternating with a salicylic acid oil.    \n    \n10.   **Youth to the People Superberry Dream Cleansing Balm - 3/10**    \n*Pros:* Great ingredient list, interesting extracts.     \n*Cons:* Smells like waxy crayons, crumbly texture that doesn’t melt well into the skin, left a waxy feeling behind.     \n*Bottom Line:* I’ve tried better.    \n       \n11.   **Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer - 2/10**  \n*Pros:* I liked her organic Vermont farm story and the light gel cream texture.   \n*Cons:* strong fragrance, contains skin irritants like Alcohol, limonene, citral, citronellol, linalool and orange peel extract.   \n*Bottom Line:* Don’t use if you have sensitive skin. There is a sunburn warning on the side of the box because it contains AHAs.    \n \n12.    **Saturday Skin Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream - 6/10**  \n*Pros:* Hydrating thick gel cream.    \n*Cons:* Smells so strong of silicone.   \n*Bottom Line:* Bought it in Europe, loved it. Bought it in the US, smelled like straight up silicone. Different formula maybe?     \n     \n13.   **Glossier Future Dew - 0/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Made me look like a greasy pizza, broke me out and don’t like the smell.   \n   \n14.   **Versed Sunday Morning Antioxidant Oil-Serum – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* inexpensive.   \n*Cons*: Does nothing. The biphase ends up looking gross and muddled after a while.    \n   \n15.   **Murmure Bisou Clarifying Dry Oil – 10/10**  \n*Pros:* Cleared my blackheads, sinks into the skin fast.    \n*Cons:* Contains hazelnut oil so be careful if you have an allergy!     \n*Bottom Line*: I use it about 2x a week at night (not on the same day as my retinol). My skin is always less red and bumpy in the AM.    \n    \n16.    **Typology Glycolic Acid 10% - 3/10**   \n*Pros:* Affordable (Typology is like the French version of the Ordinary).    \n*Cons*: Broke me out, 10% glycolic acid is too strong for my skin.    \n     \n17.   **Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Purpose Dry Oil – 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Nice dry oil that soaks in quickly, love the smell (I only use this on my body so the fragrance doesn’t bother me).   \n*Cons:* Wish it had a dropper or pump to make application less messy.   \n*Bottom Line:* I put this all over my body after my shower and my skin feels baby soft.   \n     \n18.   **Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen 36 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Good value for money.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, a little too oily.   \n*Bottom Line:* They have changed the formula since I tried it so I cant speak for the new formulation.     \n     \n19.   **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ - 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Super soothing and healing.   \n*Cons:* clogged my pores (avoid if you have acne or milia prone skin).   \n*Bottom Line:* I would buy again for my eyelid dermatitis that I get every winter\nFor who? Dry, irritated skin.         \n20.   **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum - 8/10**    \n*Pros:* Brightened and evened my skin tone.   \n*Cons:* So expensive it hurts! Oxidized at around the 4 month mark. Smells slightly unpleasant.   \n*Bottom Line:* One of the most effective formulas for vitamin c that Ive tried. Keep it away from light and to close the bottle tightly so it doesn’t oxidize as quickly.    \n      \n21.   **Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-fine Mist – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, overpowering candy fragrance, didn’t hydrate.    \n     \n22.   **Pillow Talk Derm Major Fade Flash Mask – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* I can’t speak to the effectiveness of the product because my skin couldn’t handle it.    \n*Cons:* Instantly burned my face into a red mess.    \n*Bottom Line:* 15% glycolic acid was too much for my skin. Make sure to always patch test new products.    \n      \n23.   **The Outset Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer – 7/10**  \n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list, nice light texture.    \n*Cons:* Not hydrating enough for my skin.    \n*Bottom Line:* If you have sensitive skin and like a lightweight moisturizer it might be worth a try.    \n    \n24.   **Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Heals, hydrates/seals in moisture.   \n*Cons:* Packaging is kinda ugly.   \n*Bottom Line:* Cult classic for good reason. I’m team Aquaphor over vasaline every day.   \n      \n25.   **Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Super hydrating and nourishing. Nice cream gel texture.   \n*Cons:* none.   \n*Bottom Line:* My sensitive skin loves this moisturizer. Even though I have acne prone skin I still prefer their normal triple lipid over their gel version.       \n26.   **Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask – 4/10**  \n*Pros:* slightly brightening.   \n*Cons:* Strong smell, contains citrus oils, feels quite sticky.   \n     \n27.    **Youth to the People Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream – 3/10**   \n*Pros:* nice light airy texture.   \n*Cons:* Has fragrance and limonene. Didn’t do much.   \n*Bottom Line:* Last time I was at sephora I did notice that the cream is no longer a light green color, so I think they changed the formula.   \n    \n28.    **Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* None.   \n*Cons:* Doesn’t smell great, does nothing, has alcohol, fragrance, rosemary oil, citral, linalool, citronellol…).   \n*Bottom Line:* Outdated product imo.  \n    \n29.    **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen 40 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.   \n*Cons:* Expensive and broke me out.    Feels very silicone heavy. like my skin was suffocating.    \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive acne prone skin beware.   \n     \n30.    **U beauty The Plasma Lip Compound (Rose) – 0/10**   \n*Pros:* Couldn’t keep it on my lips long enough.   \n*Cons:* Smells so bad like straight up chemicals.   \n*Bottom Line:* So disappointing because it was really expensive.   \n    \n31.    **Youth to the People Polypeptide-121 Future Cream – 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Hydrating and plumping.   \n*Cons:* Started to smell a little funny when I got halfway through the jar.   \n    \n32.   **Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm – 8/10**   \n*Pros:* Nice creamy texture that melts into the skin. Smells delicious and removes makeup well.   \n*Cons:* Leaves a greasy film on my eyes\nBottom Line: One of the few glow recipe products that I actually like.    \n  \n33.   **Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream (Night) – 1/10**\n*Pros:* lovely texture.   \n*Cons:* Smells way too strong, like straight up perfume. Has citral, limonene, lemon peel oil and fragrance.   \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive skin beware.   \n     \n34.   **Typology Niacinamide 12% - 5/10**   \n*Pros:* Inexpensive.   \n*Cons:* 12% niacinamide is too strong for my skin.   \n*Bottom Line:* studies show that your skin reacts best at a 4% concentration. I like to add a little into my moisturizer every so often to dilute it.   \n     \n35.    **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask – 3/10**  \n*Pros:* Smells delicious (but has fragrance).       \n*Cons:* Made my lips more dry. I don’t like having to scoop into a jar.        \n*Bottom Line:* I don’t understand the hype of this product.    \n      \n36.   **Clarins Lip Comfort Oil - 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Not sticky, lasts a while and very shiny.   \n*Cons:* Wish there was more color payoff and kinda pricey (not doir expensive but getting there).    \n*Bottom Line:* My fav lip product to date.

    "body": "Little bit about me/my skin: Im 25F and I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin. My skin is especially sensitive to fragrance, citrus and floral essential oils. Because of this I’ve become a bit of a skincare nerd and an obsessive ingredients list reader. I definitely still have a lot to learn about skincare but I hope this list helps some of you! Especially my fellow sensitive skin skincare addicts.          \n        \nI tried to keep the reviews very short and straight forward, but if you want me to expand on any products let me know!           \n           \n1.        **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer 30 SPF - 3/10**                    \n*Pros:* Fragrance free and very moisturizing.        \n*Cons:* Broke me out and burned my eyes\nBest for: dry skin.      \n       \n2.        **Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* literally nothing.        \n*Cons:* I don’t like the smell, it broke me out, didn’t remove my makeup well.         \n \n3.        **Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 6/10**\n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list.          \n*Cons:* Stripping/drying and expensive.         \n*For who?* Oily skin or those that like to feel squeaky clean.     \n       \n4.        **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 60 SPF (American) - 3/10**            \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.    \n*Cons:* Greasy, broke me out, stung my eyes.    \n*Bottom Line:* Stick to the European version.     \n       \n5.         **La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen 50+ SPF (European) - 9/10**          \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast, reasonably priced.    \n*Cons:* texture is a little too runny for my liking.    \n*Bonus:* LRP donates to skin cancer research.    \n       \n6.         **Jordan Samuel Hydrate Facial Serum - 0/10**       \n*Pros:* Couldn’t try long enough to say.    \n*Cons:* Gave me a bright red burning skin reaction.     \n*Bottom Line:* Looks like they changed their formula (for good reason obvi) so I can’t speak for the new version.     \n*For who?* Those who want an excuse to cancel dinner plans.    \n       \n7.         **Mario Badescu Rose Facial Spray - 0/10**    \n*Pros:* Cheap.   \n*Cons:* Mist comes out too strong, I don’t like the smell, contains fragrance, citronellol, geraniol and colorants.   \n*Bottom Line:* Thank goodness it was a gift, because I won’t be buying.   \n     \n8.        **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 5/10**    \n*Pros:* Unscented, affordable.    \n*Cons:* Made my skin itch and left a residue.    \n*Bottom Line:* I won’t repurchase.   \n     \n9.         **A313 Vitamin A Pommade - 10/10**   \n*Pros:* My acne reduced, skin texture improved (after two weeks). Thick vasaline texture that locks in the vitamin A.      \n*Cons:* Slight metallic smell     \n*Bottom Line:* Worth the hype! I use 2x a week max, alternating with a salicylic acid oil.    \n    \n10.   **Youth to the People Superberry Dream Cleansing Balm - 3/10**    \n*Pros:* Great ingredient list, interesting extracts.     \n*Cons:* Smells like waxy crayons, crumbly texture that doesn’t melt well into the skin, left a waxy feeling behind.     \n*Bottom Line:* I’ve tried better.    \n       \n11.   **Tata Harper Water-Lock Moisturizer - 2/10**  \n*Pros:* I liked her organic Vermont farm story and the light gel cream texture.   \n*Cons:* strong fragrance, contains skin irritants like Alcohol, limonene, citral, citronellol, linalool and orange peel extract.   \n*Bottom Line:* Don’t use if you have sensitive skin. There is a sunburn warning on the side of the box because it contains AHAs.    \n \n12.    **Saturday Skin Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream - 6/10**  \n*Pros:* Hydrating thick gel cream.    \n*Cons:* Smells so strong of silicone.   \n*Bottom Line:* Bought it in Europe, loved it. Bought it in the US, smelled like straight up silicone. Different formula maybe?     \n     \n13.   **Glossier Future Dew - 0/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Made me look like a greasy pizza, broke me out and don’t like the smell.   \n   \n14.   **Versed Sunday Morning Antioxidant Oil-Serum – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* inexpensive.   \n*Cons*: Does nothing. The biphase ends up looking gross and muddled after a while.    \n   \n15.   **Murmure Bisou Clarifying Dry Oil – 10/10**  \n*Pros:* Cleared my blackheads, sinks into the skin fast.    \n*Cons:* Contains hazelnut oil so be careful if you have an allergy!     \n*Bottom Line*: I use it about 2x a week at night (not on the same day as my retinol). My skin is always less red and bumpy in the AM.    \n    \n16.    **Typology Glycolic Acid 10% - 3/10**   \n*Pros:* Affordable (Typology is like the French version of the Ordinary).    \n*Cons*: Broke me out, 10% glycolic acid is too strong for my skin.    \n     \n17.   **Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Purpose Dry Oil – 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Nice dry oil that soaks in quickly, love the smell (I only use this on my body so the fragrance doesn’t bother me).   \n*Cons:* Wish it had a dropper or pump to make application less messy.   \n*Bottom Line:* I put this all over my body after my shower and my skin feels baby soft.   \n     \n18.   **Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen 36 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Good value for money.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, a little too oily.   \n*Bottom Line:* They have changed the formula since I tried it so I cant speak for the new formulation.     \n     \n19.   **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ - 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Super soothing and healing.   \n*Cons:* clogged my pores (avoid if you have acne or milia prone skin).   \n*Bottom Line:* I would buy again for my eyelid dermatitis that I get every winter\nFor who? Dry, irritated skin.         \n20.   **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Serum - 8/10**    \n*Pros:* Brightened and evened my skin tone.   \n*Cons:* So expensive it hurts! Oxidized at around the 4 month mark. Smells slightly unpleasant.   \n*Bottom Line:* One of the most effective formulas for vitamin c that Ive tried. Keep it away from light and to close the bottle tightly so it doesn’t oxidize as quickly.    \n      \n21.   **Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Ultra-fine Mist – 1/10**  \n*Pros:* Cute packaging.   \n*Cons:* Broke me out, overpowering candy fragrance, didn’t hydrate.    \n     \n22.   **Pillow Talk Derm Major Fade Flash Mask – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* I can’t speak to the effectiveness of the product because my skin couldn’t handle it.    \n*Cons:* Instantly burned my face into a red mess.    \n*Bottom Line:* 15% glycolic acid was too much for my skin. Make sure to always patch test new products.    \n      \n23.   **The Outset Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer – 7/10**  \n*Pros:* Clean ingredients list, nice light texture.    \n*Cons:* Not hydrating enough for my skin.    \n*Bottom Line:* If you have sensitive skin and like a lightweight moisturizer it might be worth a try.    \n    \n24.   **Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Heals, hydrates/seals in moisture.   \n*Cons:* Packaging is kinda ugly.   \n*Bottom Line:* Cult classic for good reason. I’m team Aquaphor over vasaline every day.   \n      \n25.   **Skinfix Triple Lipid-Peptide Cream – 10/10**   \n*Pros:* Super hydrating and nourishing. Nice cream gel texture.   \n*Cons:* none.   \n*Bottom Line:* My sensitive skin loves this moisturizer. Even though I have acne prone skin I still prefer their normal triple lipid over their gel version.       \n26.   **Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask – 4/10**  \n*Pros:* slightly brightening.   \n*Cons:* Strong smell, contains citrus oils, feels quite sticky.   \n     \n27.    **Youth to the People Superfood Air-Whip Moisture Cream – 3/10**   \n*Pros:* nice light airy texture.   \n*Cons:* Has fragrance and limonene. Didn’t do much.   \n*Bottom Line:* Last time I was at sephora I did notice that the cream is no longer a light green color, so I think they changed the formula.   \n    \n28.    **Caudalie Beauty Elixir Face Mist – 0/10**  \n*Pros:* None.   \n*Cons:* Doesn’t smell great, does nothing, has alcohol, fragrance, rosemary oil, citral, linalool, citronellol…).   \n*Bottom Line:* Outdated product imo.  \n    \n29.    **Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen 40 SPF – 5/10**  \n*Pros:* Doesn’t leave a white cast.   \n*Cons:* Expensive and broke me out.    Feels very silicone heavy. like my skin was suffocating.    \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive acne prone skin beware.   \n     \n30.    **U beauty The Plasma Lip Compound (Rose) – 0/10**   \n*Pros:* Couldn’t keep it on my lips long enough.   \n*Cons:* Smells so bad like straight up chemicals.   \n*Bottom Line:* So disappointing because it was really expensive.   \n    \n31.    **Youth to the People Polypeptide-121 Future Cream – 7/10**   \n*Pros:* Hydrating and plumping.   \n*Cons:* Started to smell a little funny when I got halfway through the jar.   \n    \n32.   **Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm – 8/10**   \n*Pros:* Nice creamy texture that melts into the skin. Smells delicious and removes makeup well.   \n*Cons:* Leaves a greasy film on my eyes\nBottom Line: One of the few glow recipe products that I actually like.    \n   \n33.   **Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream (Night) – 1/10**   \n*Pros:* lovely texture.   \n*Cons:* Smells way too strong, like straight up perfume. Has citral, limonene, lemon peel oil and fragrance.   \n*Bottom Line:* Sensitive skin beware.   \n     \n34.   **Typology Niacinamide 12% - 5/10**   \n*Pros:* Inexpensive.   \n*Cons:* 12% niacinamide is too strong for my skin.   \n*Bottom Line:* studies show that your skin reacts best at a 4% concentration. I like to add a little into my moisturizer every so often to dilute it.   \n     \n35.    **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask – 3/10**  \n*Pros:* Smells delicious (but has fragrance).       \n*Cons:* Made my lips more dry. I don’t like having to scoop into a jar.        \n*Bottom Line:* I don’t understand the hype of this product.    \n      \n36.   **Clarins Lip Comfort Oil - 9/10**  \n*Pros:* Not sticky, lasts a while and very shiny.   \n*Cons:* Wish there was more color payoff and kinda pricey (not doir expensive but getting there).    \n*Bottom Line:* My fav lip product to date.",

All my older siblings and relatives had clear skin but me despite us all following the same general routine: A rag and water. I knew something had to change. That’s when I discovered this wonderful community.\n\nFinding products to fit all my skin needs alone was dreadful, especially sunscreens. However this community’s in-depth reviews, numerous recommendations, and oddly specific questions made building a routine much easier and much much cheaper. 14 months ago, good skin was literally a dream. I still got work to do, but I’m way closer to my goals than I’ve ever been.  \n\nHonestly, I cannot thank this community enough, fr. yall the best😭❤️\n\nAny and all recommendations appreciated!\n\nAM: \nLRP Purifying Foaming Cleanser\n\nAztec Indian Healing Clay(weekly)\n\nTO’s HA 2%\n\nCerave Moisturizing Lotion(the small bottle) /w TO’s Squalane\n\nL’Oreal Revitalift Eye Cream / TO Caffeine Solution\n\nBlack Girl Sunscreen / Bioré UV watery essence\n\nAquaphor Lip Protectant + Sunscreen\n\nPM:\nLRP Purifying Foaming Cleanser\n\nTO Glycolic Acid Solution\n\nMelano CC Vit C and TO HA 2%\n\nCerave Moisturizing Lotion(the small bottle)\n\nL’Oreal Revitalift Eye Cream\n\nNeutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask(spot treatment)\n\nAquaphor Lip Protectant + Sunscreen / Cocoa Butter Vaseline",

But I didn't want my skin to stop me from having fun, so I went to go see him. I figured that if he thought I was cool then he wouldn't think my skin was a big deal. So we hung out and... he didn't look or treat me any differently. We had a lot of fun. We stayed up late and he told me he liked me... I asked him \"why?\" haha.

He has never once commented on my skin even when it gets BAD, like it is right now. I stopped wearing face make up altogether over a year ago and finally had the confidence to do life with zero foundation on, and I’m so grateful for it.\n\nFast forward to literally yesterday, a bunch of my family got together for a cookout. I saw my stepmom for the first time in about 2-3 months (there’s a point here, I promise!) My skin has been particularly bad lately, with a few white heads/small cysts on my cheeks and jawline, plus a good amount of PIE. I joined the group sitting outside, sat across from her and she looks at me and says “What happened to your skin? Why are you breaking out so bad? You look like you having an allergic reaction to something!” .. slightly shocked at the fact she said that, loudly, in front of *everyone* I tried to brush it off and say something like “oh I don’t know, it’ll clear up.” I played it cool at first, casually got up but went straight to my room and balled my eyes out for a solid hour. My poor boyfriend followed after me, kept hugging me and telling me he can’t believe she really said that in front of the whole family. Insisted that I’m the prettiest and most beautiful girl in the world, for the whole hour y’all. The worst part is.. she’s right. It looks like crap rn and makes me feel like she just said what everyone else is thinking.\n\nEdit: spelling",

I have always been struggling with blackheads, whiteheads and lots of sebum production and my cheeks are always dry and dull. No matter how much I exfoliated and moisturized, especially my forehead and nose still had dry flakes despite the insane amounts of oil. And I always had at least 1 huge inflamed pimple with pus on me. \n\nThanks to you guys I got an idea what the issue was (too many actives, too harsh, too stripping) so I went shopping immediately, and the result after one week is insane! My pimples are almost gone, no scarring, I see no blackheads, whiteheads and pores shrinked visibly, less redness around my nose and mouth, my skin has a glossier appearance. I have next to zero oil on my face even by the end of the day. I am still in disbelief. It’s been only a week and my skin texture still isn’t perfect but if it remains as is I am more than happy 😃 So much cheaper and less irritating. \n\nSome of the old products I dumped are not visible here but I also used TO Retinol in Squalane and Neutrogena moisturizers. Klair’s Freshly Juiced Vitamin C drops as well as Pyunkang Yul Nutrition Cream (for my drier cheeks) are still on its way, can’t wait to test them. \n\nIs there any good non-irritating Retinol you guys can recommend? Still gonna use up the Paula’s Coice BHA 2% exfoliation thingy, but after that I will also need a replacement for it. \n\n**MY ROUTINE:**\n\nAM: \n- low pH good morning cleanser\n- Rice toner, 2-3 layers\n- Centella Poremizer Serum\n- Red Bean Gel moisturizer / Centella poremizer\n- BoJ Aqua Fresh 50spf\n\nPM: \n- Ginseng Oil Cleanser\n- low pH Good Morning cleanser\n- optional: mask / AHA whitehead liquid / BHA\n- Rice Toner\n- serums: alternate, not mixing actives\n- Centella Poremizer moisturizer\n- Cheeks: Sleeping mask (recommended 1xweek, I use it daily)\n\nIf you have questions, comments or recommendations, I’m here 🥰\n",

    "body": "I just came back from the second dermatologist appointment I've had in the last year in which the dermatologist outright contradicted many things assumed as common knowledge in this sub. I had taken photos of my AM and PM routines so I could share them with her and get any feedback. When she saw the photos she said:\n\n* \"Cerave? In the tub? That's not for facial use, that's just for the body. It's far too dense for the face.\"\n\n* \"Vaseline? That's comedogenic; it will completely clog your pores!\" When I said I was using it as an occlusive she said \"well, it's far *too* occlusive!\"\n\n* After seeing rosehip seed oil and squalene oil in my routine: \"You need to be careful with oils; they can break you out really easily.\"\n\n* And overall: \"Your routine is way too complicated; your acne will never go away if you're using so many products.\"\n\nSo I totally get that not every derm is the same, and obviously product success varies widely. However, she's a derm I've never seen before and I specifically asked for an appointment with a new doctor because the one I saw last year similarly didn't jive at all with the general consensus of this sub. \n\nHonestly, it weirds me out a little bit because I'm terrified of being the skincare equivalent of a close-minded parent who doesn't vaccinate their kids because of some fear-mongering Facebook group, regardless of what the educated medical community says. Am I totally a sucker for potential snake oil salesmen in disguise on this sub (I love you this community and don't think that feels true, but I'm examining everything!) or is my dermatologist not seeing the whole picture?\n\n(For context, I saw the derm for persistent acne that's plagued me for 15 years now, but I have seen marginal improvement since following advice in this sub. I got the appointment in the first place because I've grown impatient with nothing working quite to the extent I would hope for, and I'm really sick of years of not wanting to take photos of myself.)\n\n\n**EDIT: Thank you so much for the responses so far; they are super helpful!** \n\nFor those asking, in case it's helpful for any more ideas/feedback, here's the current over-complicated routine I brought to my derm:\n\nAM:\n\n* CeraVe Foaming Cleanser\n\n* Trader Joe's Rose Water hydrating toner (\"stop using that, it has alcohol!\" my derm said when she saw it!)\n\n* The Ordinary HA Acid 2%\n\n* The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% and Zinc 1%\n\n* CosRx Snail Mucin Essence\n\n* HadaLabo gokujyun Premium lotion (the gold bottle)\n\n* The Ordinary Squalane oil - (only on especially dry days; not every time)\n\n* Sunscreen: either Biore Watery Essence for mostly indoor days or Neutrogena Dry Touch SPF 50 for outdoor/long commute days\n\nPM:\n\n* Garnier Micellar water with Rose and Glycerin (for makeup removal)\n\n* Miso mineral cleansing oil\n\n* Tretinoin 0.05%\n\n* The Ordinary Rosehip Seed Oil (for dryer days only; usually I end up using this 3-4 times a week)\n\n* Cerave in the tub\n\n* Vaseline\n\nAny advice on cutting this back is very welcome! \n\nAlso, she prescribed me spironolactone which is one of the few prescription medicines for acne that I haven't yet tried, so hopefully between that and the Tret which I already had, I'll see more drastic improvement. \n\n**Overall,** I think that my big takeaway from this conversation is that I can put a LOT more stock in \"YMMV\" than I have been. I'm going to trust my derm, but also follow my instincts. If I'm totally honest, there have been a few times when I've stripped my moisture barrier and sprayed my face with toner and it stung a lot, and then lathered on Cerave and it stung even more, and I just dealt with it because of some weird no-pain-no-gain complex I have. (gulp) But actually, had I listened to my instincts more maybe I'd have stopped products like that before now. There's an emotional component here about trusting myself, I think! Anyway, I'm super grateful for the wealth of knowledge and experience in this sub, so thank you for the support!!",

A simple routine is really all you need if she is already having you on a retinoid and something to help the hormonal acne (spiro).\n\nIt may be frustrating to hear but oils and occlusives WILL break you out if you are naturally acne-prone. Look, some people can put all the oils and even vaseline on their faces and not get clogged but I'm pretty sure if I even put aquaphor a little too densely on my lips I will get clogs along the perimeter on my mouth. I saw a really great aesthetician who put me on a strict skincare routine and my skin was SO DRY for the first couple weeks because I was overcompensating before with too many oils, but once my natural oils came back my skin cleared up so much. Now I religiously avoid oils and occlusives and stick to my vitamin c, retinol, oil-free moisturizer, and mineral sunscreen daily and it's been the best answer that I would've never gotten to if I tried to chase after what works for everyone else who is less acne-prone. \n\nPlease trust your dermatologist. I've been in your shoes and it paid off to stick with the prescribed routine once I passed 3+ months!",

Some kids are harmed by vaccination. What they fail to appreciate is that for every child who has an adverse reaction to a vaccine, many thousands of children would have died from Polio or Diphtheria. \n\nMy empathy goes out to you, and if you are like me, your acne is not nearly as bad to others as it feels to you.\n\nI think your thinking is very rational, and I suggest that you give your doctor a fair shake, and take her advice.\n\nIf it doesn’t work, in 6 months you can go back to your oils.",

Another thing to watch out for is often repeated things in this sub that become fact despite having no evidence to support them, like how you can’t use hyaluronic acid in dry climates or physical exfoliation causes micro tears. Always verify.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYour derm is treating a skin disorder, this isn’t the same as having a routine for more cosmetic type reasons. She doesn’t know if your products are contributing to your acne and the whole point of prescription actives is so you don’t need weaker acne medication. Petrolatum isn’t comedogenic based on your skin type but combined with oils and a heavy moisturizer could be way too much for your skin type.

That sounds like what you’re looking for. \n\nI’m going to get downvoted to hell for this but this sub is 20% helpful 80% unhelpful.  If your hobby is skincare, that’s awesome, but a hobby and a social media account does not make you a physician.",

People in here put acids and alcohols all over their skin to take away the natural oils and then put all these other oils back on and wonder why they break out. Let alone skin redness- you're putting acid on your face. Yes, it's going to be red. Unless you're blessed with great genetics, I sort of feel like it's acne or moderately dry skin, choose one.\n\nYou really should not need more than 5 skincare products. All of these lotions have basically the same damn primary ingredients in them. Would you take 12 different pills for some perceived medical problem, none of which were supported by a decent study?\n\nListen to your dermatologist, she sees people with acne problems every single day and work to solve them using products backed up by studies and not anecdotal evidence.",

That being said, my derms have also never advised me to be gentler on my skin, are quick to prescribe me pills and be done with it, have told me to stop moisturizing and using sunscreen altogether. Learning a lot on my own has helped me immensely. \n\nHowever, your experience *does* sound like what people here may advise. I see all the time (and agree with) people saying to minimize your routine as much as possible while keeping in ingredients that are best for your needs. Can’t speak on the moisturizer because I never use thick moisturizers on my face. There are sooo many oils with different purposes and consistencies so yes, be careful with which ones you choose, but don’t fear them or anything.",

    "body": "Hi everyone,  \nLike many of you, I am an avid sunscreen user. Over the summer I set out to test a variety of sunscreens to find my HGs. Below are 25 sunscreen reviews, I took pictures of 23 of them.  \n  \nI have pale skin, use tretinoin, and live in the Mojave Desert, so finding an effective sunscreen is crucial. I have sensitive skin and am eco-conscious so environmentally-friendly filters are important to me. For each sunscreen, I used it for about a week unless it was truly horrendous. I hope you find my reviews useful!  \n  \n**[Imgur Album of Sunscreen Photos](https://imgur.com/a/9hBplNX)**  \n  \n**Best Overall**: Shiseido Urban Environment  \n**Best Outdoor**: Badger Mineral Stick (runner-up Thinksport Kids SPF50+)  \n**Best Everyday**: Biossance  \n**Most Cosmetically Elegant**: Elta MD Physical (tinted) and Biossance (untinted)  \n**Best for Redness**: Dr Jart+ Color Correcting Cream  \n  \n**Worst Overall**: Neutrogena  \n**Worst Outdoor**: Neutrogena  \n**Worst Daily**: Ren Clean  \n**Least Cosmetically Elegant**: Ren Clean and Thinksport Kids  \n**Worst for Redness**: First Aid Beauty  \n  \n  \n1. **Purito Centella Unscented SPF50, PA++++**  \n**Rating**: 1/5 daily wear  \n**UV Filters**: Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate 3.0%, Ethylhexyl Triazone 2.0%  \n**Price**: $13 for 2oz/59mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** No.  \n**EWG Rating**: N/A  \n**Repurchase**: Not after the damming evidence showing this was like ~15 SPF, plus one of the filters is not reef-friendly  \n**Review**: Doesn’t matter—this company can’t be trusted. Prior to the evidence, this was a soft, creamy sunscreen that applied like a primer.  \n  \n  \n2. **Neutrogena Zinc Dry Touch SPF 50**  \n**Rating**: 1/5 for outdoor sunscreen  \n**UV Filters**: Zinc Oxide 21.6%  \n**Price**: $11 for 3 oz/88 mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**Repurchase?** No!  \n**EWG Rating**: 5  \n**Review**: Physical sunscreen. goes on nicely, very white but dries down to a lesser white cast. Greasy at first, sticky once it sets. Does not hold up against sweating, ended up getting into my eyes and burning which was very upsetting. Standard plastic tube packaging with flip top lid.  \n  \n  \n3. **Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free UV Protector, Broad Spectrum SPF42**  \n**Rating**: 5/5 for both daily and outdoor.  \n**UV Filters**: octinoxate 4.9%, Octocrylene 3%, Zinc Oxide 12.5%  \n**Price**: $35 for 1 oz/30 mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** No.  \n**Repurchase?** No. Too expensive for what you get, even though the formula is very nice.  \n**EWG Rating**: 5  \n**Review**: water resistant for 40 minutes. Runny as it comes out of bottle, but spreads nicely and dries down quickly to a matte finish. Light white cast that disappeared once it set. Not greasy at all, due to the combo this could double for daily use and outdoor activities. Once settled, my skin did feel semi-dry. I wore this both to work and for a day of strenuous hiking, it held up well to both! This would be my universal HG if I was ok with shelling out $35 for an ounce. Packaging is a Plastic tube bottle with twist off lid.  \n  \n  \n4. **Biossance Squalane+Zinc Sheer Mineral Sunscreen, SPF30, PA+++**  \n**Rating**: 5/5 daily wear sunscreen  \n**UV Filters**: 14% non-nano Zinc Oxide  \n**Price**: $30 for 1.7oz/50mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**Repurchase?** Yes, my favorite.  \n**EWG Rating**: BEST  \n**Review**: Feels like a moisturizer as it goes on. At first it’s a bit sticky, but it dries down to a light dewy consistency. No white cast which was surprising as it’s a mineral sunscreen. It also makes for a fantastic primer, definitely my new daily HG! Packaging is a plastic tube with twist off lid.  \n  \n  \n5. **Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish SPF50+, PA+++**  \n**Rating**: 5/5 for daily wear  \n**UV Filters**: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide - some sites say Nano, others do not specify  \n**Price**: $11 for 1.85oz/55mL  \n**Repurchase?** No.  \n**EWG Rating**: N/A  \n**Review**: goes on smoothly and almost immediately dries down to a satin finish. Really impressed with how softly this sits on the face. No obvious white cast, at most my face seems just a tad lighter. There is a fragrance, it smells old-lady-ish but I’m not too bothered. It looks nice enough that I’m opting to not apply my tinted moisturizer and go to work bare-faced. While websites vary as to whether this is nano or non-nano, it doesn’t appear that there’s enough research to determine if nano zinc or nano titanium can damage your skin from sun exposure or be absorbed into your bloodstream. Packaging is a plastic bottle with flip top lid.  \n  \n  \n6. **La Roche Posay Anthelios 60**  \n**Rating**: 3/5  \n**UV Filters**: Avobenzone 3%, Homosalate 10.72%, Octisalate 3.21%, Octocrylene 6%, Oxybenzone 3.86%  \n**Price**: $30 for 1.7oz/50mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** No.  \n**Repurchase?** No, I try to stick to mineral or mostly-mineral sunscreens  \n**EWG Rating**: 7  \n**Review**: this one is a runny coming out, but applies well to the face. It does have that “sunscreen smell” but it’s not strong and dissipates shortly after it sets. It dries down nicely to a soft glow. Definitely one of my favorites as far as being cosmetically elegant. Packaging is a plastic tube bottle with twist off lid.  \n  \n  \n7. **Ren Clean Screen Mineral SPF30**  \n**Rating**: 2/5 for daily/outdoor  \n**UV Filters**: Zinc Oxide 22%  \n*Price**: $38 for 1.7 oz/50mL  \n**Repurchase?** No.  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**EWG Rating**: 3  \n**Review**: goes on thick, leaves noticeable white cast. Doesn’t feel too oily once it sets but the cast didn’t go away. I ended up putting tinted moisturizer on top to blend better with my skin. I felt like I was wearing cakey foundation all day, which I didn’t like. Overall, decent sunscreen but not a daily wear one. Packaging is a plastic tube bottle with twist off lid.  \n  \n  \n8. **Coola Mineral Sun Silk Creme Sunscreen SPF30**  \n**Rating**: 3/5 for daily wear  \n**UV Filters**: Zinc Oxide 15%  \n**Price**: $42 for 1.5oz/44mL  \n**Repurchase?** No.  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**EWG Rating**: 5  \n**Review**: goes on smooth with a slight white cast that disappears as it sets. Dries down matte, with a very slight tackiness that settles into a silky feel. Depending on the moisturizer applied before it, it can pill or dry down gunky.  I used this for two months, and couldn’t get over the gunky application. Packaging is a glass bottle with plastic pump.  \n  \n  \n9. **Suntique I’m Pure Cica Suncream SPF50, PA++++**  \n**Rating**: 5/5 daily  \n**UV Filters**: Zinc oxide, titanium dioxide  \n**Price**: $24 for 1.69oz/50mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**Repurchase?** Yes.  \n**EWG Rating**: N/A  \n**Review**: This is by far one of the most cosmetically elegant physical sunscreens I’ve ever put on. I would even say it’s a dupe for Biossance. It applies like a thick moisturizer, it feels very nice and creamy. No white cast and is a bit tacky as it sets. Only drawback is I cannot find the concentrations of the UV filters. It reminds me of Purito Centella Unscented, so I’m hesitant to rebuy or recommend. Packaging is a plastic tube bottle with twist off lid.  \n  \n  \n10. **First Aid Beauty Weightless Mineral Sunscreen SPF30**  \n**Rating**: 3/5 for daily  \n**UV Filters**: zinc oxide 16%  \n**Price**: $34 for 1.5oz/44mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**Repurchase?** No.  \n**EWG Rating**: 2  \n**Review**: Initial texture is like that of a moisturizer while the color straight out of the bottle looks like a medium shade of foundation. Going on the tint is minimal, but progressively darkens as it dries. It quickly sets to a very soft, satin finish but far too dark for me. Packaging is a plastic tube bottle with twist off lid.  \n  \n  \n11. **Dr. Jart+ Tigergrass Color Correcting Treatment SPF30**  \n**Rating**: 4/5  \n**UV Filters**: Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide  \n**Price**: $52 for 1.7oz/50mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**Repurchase?** Not at this price point.  \n**EWG Rating**: 3  \n**Review**: goes on like a thick creamy lotion and spreads well. It definitely balances out the redness of my face which is impressive, it dries down into a slightly tacky feel. For slight redness, I mix it with my tinted moisturizer. Packaging is a plastic tub with twist off lid.  \n  \n  \n12. **Shiseido Ultimate Sun Protector Lotion 50+**  \n**Rating**: 4/5  \n**UV Filters**: Avobenzone 2.3%, Homosalate 10%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 5%  \n**Price**: $25 for 2oz/50mL or $49 for 5oz/150mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**Repurchase?** No.  \n**EWG Rating**: 5  \n**Review**: goes on like a moisturizer with a slight fragrance. It sets down to a soft, silky feel - really surprising for a chemical sunscreen. Overall, it’s really nice but I try to stick to mineral so won’t be purchasing. Packaging is a plastic tube bottle with twist off lid.  \n  \n  \n13. **Thinksport Kids Safe Sunscreen SPF50+**  \n**Rating**: 5/5 outdoor sunscreen  \n**UV Filters**: Zinc Oxide 20%  \n**Price**: $7 for 3oz/89mL, it varies.  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**Repurchase?** Yes.  \n**EWG Rating**: 2  \n**Review**: goes on thick, and leaves a light white cast as it sets along with a light tackiness. I accidentally put twice as much as I needed at first, so beware when squeezing it out. Withstood my sweat and the elements on a 7-mile hike, I even got sweat in my eyes and there was no burn. It sticks to the face well, this will be my go-to hiking face sunscreen. Like many sunscreens, it does attract dirt and any grime in the air so will require a double cleanse. Packaging is a plastic tube bottle with flip top lid.  \n  \n  \n14. **All Good Mineral Sunscreen Butter, SPF50+**  \n**Rating**: 2/5  \n**UV Filters**: Zinc Oxide 25%  \n**Price**: $11 for 1oz/28g  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**Repurchase?** No.  \n**EWG Rating**: N/A  \n**Review**: holy mother of white cast! This stuff is more like a balm, it’s applies thick and isn’t easily spreadable. Absolutely waterproof/sweat proof and didn’t come off when I’d rub sweat off my face, it also didn’t sting when I got it in my eyes. This is a GREAT outdoor sunscreen, I’ve used it while hiking 14 miles in the SoCal summer sun. I’ll definitely reuse as it’s made of six ingredients. However the white cast is insane - Halloween-makeup insane. The photos linked are four hours after a second application and I’d sweat quite a bit - and the photos still don’t do it justice. Packaging is a metal tin with twist off lid.   \n  \n  \n15. **Bare Republic Mineral SPF50 Sport Sunscreen Stick**  \n**Rating**: 3/5  \n**UV Filters**: Zinc Oxide 20%  \n**Price**: $10 for .5oz/14.2g  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**Repurchase?** No.  \n**EWG Rating**: 5  \n**Review**: went on with a white cast, I applied it thickly so it’s noticeable. Stood up to my sweating in the sunlight while hiking. I like this one, it’s equivalent to the all good sunscreen butter. Packaging is plastic, like a standard deodorant package with twist-up applicator.  \n  \n  \n16. **Blue Lizard Australian Sunscreen Sport SPF30+**  \n**Rating**: 5/5  \n**Sunscreen**: Octocrylene 4%, Zinc Oxide 9.7%  \n**Price**: $19 for 5oz/148mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**Repurchase?** Yes.  \n**EWG Rating**: 3  \n**Review**: this is NOT the face-specific sunscreen, but I love it on my body so thought I’d give it a try. This is definitely a winner for outdoor sunscreens. This stuff applies nicely, easily spreadable, and dries down with no white cast. In the hours I’ve hiked in it, I’ve never experienced a burn. This is a winner if you don’t want to buy separate face/body sunscreens. Packaging is a plastic bottle with flip top lid.  \n  \n  \n17. **Elta MD UV Physical Broad-Spectrum SPF 41 Sunscreen - Tinted**  \n**Rating**: 5/5  \n**UV Filters**: Zinc Oxide 9.0%, Titanium Dioxide 7.0%  \n**Price**: $33 for 3oz./88.7mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**Repurchase?** Yes - when I run out of tinted moisturizer.  \n**EWG Rating**: 3  \n**Review**: the hype is REAL. This stuff went on so smoothly, as if I was applying moisturizer. It’s soft and lightly dewy, and sets quickly into a soft matte. Once dry it’s as if I’m not wearing any sunscreen. The light tint is subtle and not noticeable, overall this is cosmetically elegant and I feel protected by the concentration of UV filters. Packaging is a plastic tube bottle with flip top lid.  \n  \n  \n18. **Nia 24 Sun Damage Prevention Broad Spectrum SPF 30**  \n**Rating**: 2/5  \n**UV Filters**: Avobenzone 3%, Homosalate 7.5%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 2.6%  \n**Price**: $39.20 for 2.56oz/75 mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes  \n**Repurchase?** No.  \n**EWG Rating**: 3  \n**Review**: this went on nice, but had a greasy feel and look. It did dry down to a nice, soft feel but still managed to have the greasy shine. It’s meh. Packaging is a plastic tube bottle with flip top lid.  \n  \n  \n19. **Kiss My Face Kids Defense Mineral SPF30 Sunscreen Lotion**  \n**Rating**: 1/5 outdoor wear  \n**UV Filters**: Titanium Dioxide 6%, Zinc Oxide 6%  \n**Price**: $15 for 4oz/118mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**Repurchase?** No.  \n**EWG Rating**: 3  \n**Review**: While it initially went on nicely with a not-too-bad white cast, it didn’t set well and showed signs of pilling early on. I hiked 3.5 miles before reapplying. My sweat had smeared a decent amount of the first application, and upon second application it pilled quite poorly (see last photo). On the bright side, it didn’t run or get into my eyes. Won’t be repurchasing due to extensive pilling. Packaging is a plastic tube bottle with flip top lid.  \n  \n  \n20. **Pacifica Sun + Skincare Mineral Face Shade Coconut Probiotic SPF 30**  \n**Rating**: 2/5  \n**UV Filter**: Titanium Dioxide 4.8%, Zinc Oxide 3.1%  \n**Price**: $15 for 1.7oz/50mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes  \n**Repurchase?** No.  \n**Review**: This had a hefty white cast, one that did not disappear after drying down or hours of wear. I won’t repurchase as there are other sunscreens equally strong but for cheaper (and for equal to lesser white cast).  \nNote: it appears they have two formulas for this. One with titanium dioxide and zinc, and one with just a high concentration of zinc. Packaging is a plastic tube bottle with flip top lid.  \n  \n  \n21. **CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 (no image)**  \n**Rating**: 1/5 daily wear  \n**UV Filters**: Homosalate (12%), Octinoxate (7.5%), Octocrylene (2%), Zinc Oxide (3.5%)  \n**Price**: $13.50 for 3oz/89mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** No.  \n**Repurchase?** No.  \n**Review**: it’s slightly greasy and requires something like Squalane underneath to be applied in small sections to ensure it doesn’t pill. This broke me out quite badly. Ended up giving it away at about 3/4 full. No pictures as I tried this long before I was building this review, and I have no intent on making myself break out. Packaging is a plastic bottle with pump.  \n  \n  \n22. **Supergoop! Sunny Screen SPF 50 Lotion for Babies + Kids**  \n**Rating**: 4/5  \n**UV Filter**: Titanium Dioxide 3.4%, Zinc Oxide 23.8%  \n**Price**: $26 for 3oz/89mL  \n**Reef-friendly**: Yes.  \n**Repurchase** Maybe  \n**Review**: this is thicker than most sunscreens, it’s somewhere between a cream and a balm. It takes a bit longer to work it in evenly, but once it’s on there’s an initial white cast that settles down to a gooey look (borderline greasy, so not for those with oily skin). It feels tacky, but overall it’s not too bad. It feels like I’ve applied an occlusive moisturizer and not a crusty or greasy sunscreen. Packaging is a plastic tube bottle with flip lid.  \n  \n  \n23. **Badger Unscented Broad Spectrum SPF35 Natural Mineral Sunscreen All Season Face Stick**  \n**Rating**: 5/5  \n**UV Filter**: Non-Nano Zinc Oxide 22.5%  \n**Price**: $9.99 for 0.65oz/18.4g  \n**Reef-friendly**: Yes.  \n**Repurchase?** Yes.  \n**Review**: White cast at first, but quickly goes away once you rub it in. I was really impressed with this formula, typically these are grossly thick with a heavy white cast but this was really nice and balm-like, and it was not greasy. I ran 4 miles (and sweat a lot) after applying and it stayed still, didn’t pill, and no white cast formed. Definitely my favorite stick sunscreen, and with six total ingredients, worth repurchasing. Packaging is a plastic tube with twist-up applicator (like lip balm).  \n  \n  \n24. **Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40**  \n**Rating**: 4.5/5  \n**UV Filter**: Avobenzone, 3%, Homosalate 8%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 4%  \n**Price**: $44 for 2.5oz/73.9mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**Repurchase?** Yes.  \n**Review**: This Comes out as a yellow-clear gel. It spreads very nicely and has the silky texture of makeup primer. It has a very subtle sunscreen smell, which doesn’t bother me. Overall this is very nice, it sets like a moisturizer leaving a slight glossy/dewy look. This is one of the more cosmetically-elegant screens, and it could very well be worn by itself or with makeup.   Packaging is a plastic tube bottle with flip top lid.  \n  \n  \n25. **Supergoop! PLAY Everyday Lotion SPF 50 with Sunflower Extract**  \n**Rating**: 2/5  \n**UV Filter**: Avobenzone (3%), Homosalate (10%), Octisalate (5%), Octocrylene (7.5%)  \n**Price**: $32 for 5.5oz/162mL  \n**Reef-friendly?** Yes.  \n**Repurchase?** No.  \n**Review**: This was a ball of grease, the greasiest sunscreen I’ve reviewed. While it did settle into being slightly less greasy and more tacky, it’s nothing to write home about. Won’t be repurchasing. Packaging is a plastic tube bottle with flip top lid.  \n  \nEdit: changed some of the sunscreen packaging as I had a few mixed up. And some formatting. Also changed the LRP rating from 2 to 3.  \nEdit #2: swapped “reef safe” notations for the two Shiseido sunscreens.",

Melanoma survivor here, so I take sunscreen very seriously and am also sensitive to chemical sunscreens. \n\nMy HG was DeVita Solar Protective Moisturizer SPF 30, but they reformulated it into the furthest thing from HG. Ugh. The new formula separates inside the bottle so you have to shake it forever, smells like broccoli, is super greasy, and gave me eczema. The best thing I can say about it is it left no white cast. I've tried several others since then.\n\n3 different Beautycounter products - the spray on one seemed like it would work, but the bottle broke after two applications. And it's a really expensive brand.  The other two were unsatisfactory for reasons I can't remember.\n\nCeraVe Hydrating Sunscreen SPF 50 Face Mineral - stung badly and gave me eczema.\n\nElta MD Sport - dermatologist sample only provided two applications, but it was really greasy. It didn't irritate my skin though. I'm considering the different Elta MD product you mentioned.\n\nThe Ordinary Mineral UV Filters SPF 30 with Antioxidants - super thick like cakey foundation, left a gray cast (it has a slight gray tint). I kept it for outdoor wear, but wouldn't use it daily on my face/neck.\n\nJuice Beauty SPF 30 Oil-Free Moisturizer - a bit greasy, and the eczema comes and goes, but no white cast and it doesn't smell bad. This is the one I am using for daily wear right now, but don't plan to repurchase. I bet if I was diligent about taking cleanser to the tits every night I wouldn't have the eczema, because I only get it on my neck and collarbones. But alas, I don't love getting my entire upper half wet at night in winter.\n\nThe Biossance looks good except that it's only 14% Zinc Oxide - I prefer 19%+ for sun safety unless there's also some titanium dioxide.

It may be overly sensitive, easily reddened, dull, susceptible to microfissuring and scarring, itchy, wrinkly and unresponsive to products that should work on \"normal\" skin.**\n\n​\n\nThe reparation of dehydrated skin seems to be rather misrepresented on this sub so I went down a deep rabbit hole of scientific journals to get to the bottom of it, having myself nuked my \"moisture barrier\" with excess use of Benzoyl Peroxide and smoking.\n\nFirst of all - dehydrated skin doesn't necessarily mean the skin actually lacks water. I know, I mentioned lack of water in the edit above, but there should be nothing wrong with the endogenous transportation of dietary water to your skin unless your body is malfunctioning in some way not relating to the functions of the lipid matrix. Your skin simply can't hold onto the water it already holds. So why do some experience dehydrated skin? Because of heightened Transepidermal Water Loss.\n\nTrans-epidermal Water Loss or TEWL, according to Wikipedia, is the following: \"the loss of [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water) that passes from inside a body ([animal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal) or [plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant)) through the epidermis (that is, either the [epidermal layer of animal skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis) or the [epidermal layer of plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(botany))) to the surrounding [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere) via [diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion) and [evaporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation) processes.\"\n\n​\n\nThis means that hydration is not the solution, which also ties in with the study below suggesting that skin's exposure to water may have similar effects to that of irritating surfactants **\\[Note that the link below studies prolonged exposure to water\\]**:\n\n​\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/12542533/?i=2&from=/10594737/related](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/12542533/?i=2&from=/10594737/related)\n\n​\n\nThe study above, titled **Hydration disrupts human stratum corneum ultrastructure:**\n\nOuttake:  **\"Our confirmation that water disrupts the structure of the SC barrier lipids helps explain the known ability of water to increase skin permeability (Scheuplein, 1978). Similarly, our results strongly support the ability of prolonged water contact to facilitate irritant contact dermatitis (Renshaw, 1947;Suskind and Ishihara, 1965;Possick, 1969;Halkier-Sørensen et al, 1995;Meding, 2000).\"**\n\n​\n\nThis means that watery serums and essences are not the solution here. By locking in hydrating serums with an occlusive, you are effectively feeding your skin water for hours on end which does nothing in aiding the reparation of a damaged skin barrier.\n\n​\n\nAnd as the article below suggests, dehydration is not due to lack of water in the skin, it occurs due to a malfunctioning lipid matrix:\n\n​\n\n[http://www.beautymagonline.com/beauty-articles/1000-epidermal-dehydration-2](http://www.beautymagonline.com/beauty-articles/1000-epidermal-dehydration-2)\n\n​\n\n**​-------------------------------------**\n\n​\n\nSo what is really the issue here and how do we fix it? By feeding the skin skin-identical lipids.\n\nAmong these are:\n\n**Ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acides, Squalane,  Urea etc with Ceramides being the major lipid constituent:**\n\n​\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/12553851/?i=6&from=/10594737/related](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/12553851/?i=6&from=/10594737/related)\n\n​\n\n**More on topical application of Ceramides and their efficacy:**  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5801391/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5801391/)\n\n## Results\n\n**Application of the formulation containing only one ceramide on regenerating SC resulted in a higher fraction of lipids adopting an orthorhombic organization. A similar fraction of lipids forming an orthorhombic organization was observed after application of a formulation containing two ceramides and a fatty acid on regenerating SC. No effects on the lamellar lipid organization were observed.**\n\n​\n\n## Conclusions\n\n**Application of a formulation containing either a single ceramide or two ceramides and a fatty acid on regenerating SC, resulted in a denser lateral lipid packing of the SC lipids in compromised skin. The strongest effect was observed after application of a formulation containing a single ceramide.**\n\n​\n\nFor more on skin-identical lipids, read this: [http://www.justaboutskin.com/lipids-in-skin-care/](http://www.justaboutskin.com/lipids-in-skin-care/)\n\n​\n\n**​-------------------------------------**\n\n​\n\nAnd a study on \"Leveraging the skin's ability to heal itself\":\n\n​\n\n[https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/repairing-a-compromised-skin-barrier-in-dermatitis-2155-6121.1000187.php?aid=29958](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/repairing-a-compromised-skin-barrier-in-dermatitis-2155-6121.1000187.php?aid=29958)\n\n​\n\n**A disrupted skin barrier has many points of vulnerability including excessive water loss, slow/deficient lipid production, an imbalance in content and ratio of skin lipids, a dry skin barrier, an elevation of pH, susceptibility to infection and inflammation, and susceptibility to contact sensitization \\[**[**16**](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/repairing-a-compromised-skin-barrier-in-dermatitis-2155-6121.1000187.php?aid=29958#16)**–**[**19**](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/repairing-a-compromised-skin-barrier-in-dermatitis-2155-6121.1000187.php?aid=29958#19)**\\]. There have been many approaches to induce and enhance skin barrier repair in chronic dermatitis. Some products have focus on skin barrier protection or physiologic skin lipid replacement or inflammation. To effectively heal the skin barrier, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) must be minimized and the skin must be protected from further contact with irritants, allergens, and infectious organisms \\[**[**20**](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/repairing-a-compromised-skin-barrier-in-dermatitis-2155-6121.1000187.php?aid=29958#20)**\\].**\n\n​\n\nThe barrier is disrupted, meaning **TEWL** is through the roof... meaning no matter how much you hydrate your skin, that water will make no difference because it will evaporate off your face anyway. The trick to fixing dehydrated skin is not adding more hydrating products, it is to topically apply skin-identical lipids to your face and sealing them in with an occlusive until the barrier's function is restored to a point where the **TEWL** is negligible.\n\n​\n\n**So to recap this:**\n\n\\- Minimize your skin's exposure to water as best you can and avoid prolonged exposure to water. The reason I'm saying to minimize skin's exposure to water is because most people don't know what kind of water they're getting from their tap. Hard tap water can disrupt normal skin and may wreak havoc on a compromised skin barrier. Unless you know the contents of your tap water, I'd advise against it and perhaps find another method of cleansing such as **dry OCM.** I.e. massage face with oil and then pat it off with a microfiber towel or some paper with good absorption.\n\n​\n\n\\- Buy products that contain skin-identical lipids, especially creams heavy on Ceramides. But ingredients like carbamide (Urea), triglyceride (fatty acid) and Squalane should also do the trick. The big problem here, however, is that many creams containing these ingredients are occlusive and I haven't had time to study the external permeability of occlusive ingredients such as Petrolatum. Meaning... if you start with an occlusive cream, the next creams may not sufficiently penetrate the film created by the first one.\n\n​\n\n\\- If the above creams are not occlusive, make sure to seal with Vaseline (and do so anyway before you go to sleep).This study suggests TEWL is decreased by 98% through the topical application of Petrolatum: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/)\n\nAnd this study shows how Petrolatum performs compared to mineral oils: [http://www.probotanic.com/pdf\\_istrazivanja/ulje\\_jojobe/Primena%20biljnih%20ulja%20u%20kozmetici.pdf](http://www.probotanic.com/pdf_istrazivanja/ulje_jojobe/Primena%20biljnih%20ulja%20u%20kozmetici.pdf)\n\n​\n\n\\- Keep applying these every morning and every night until you have restored the functions of the Corneum Stratum and then start cutting back. For some it might take weeks, for some months and for some years. It all depends on how extensive the damage is.\n\n​\n\n\\- I can't tell you which products will work for you, so you would have to go the trial-and-error-route as with anything else. But at least you now know which ingredients are needed to repair a compromised skin barrier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: Made some edits to clarify that short-term exposure to water may not be damaging depending on the mineral contents and pH of the water used. Also made edits on Vaseline and how dehydrated skin often feels or looks.**",

        "body": "I went through and read three of the papers you linked up above (which I should have done before my first comment). First off thanks for putting in the hard yards here and collating this information, this is a quality post and makes for great discussion. However, I disagree with some of the conclusions you’ve drawn here. \n\n1. TEWL is studied in ‘Hydration disrupts human stratum corneum ultrastructure’. This study specifically examines the effect on the stratum corneum that prolonged exposure to water has. The exposure times in this experiment ranged from 4 hours to 24 hours and were to pure deionised, distilled water. The conclusion of the article is that ‘this prolonged exposure disrupts the lipid lamellar architecture of the intercellular space, which may be the cause of the increased SC permeability.’ There is no basis to conclude that watery serums and essences are not the solution from this study. This study shows definitively that if you tape a pocket of water to your arm for 4 hours (the specific method used), this will significantly disrupt your skins moisture barrier. Serums and water based solutions were not studied or mentioned here. \n\n2. Feeding the skin skin-identical lips will fix skin barrier issues. The abstract referenced here (I couldn’t find the full article as it’s not available on PubMed) discusses the role ceramides play in the structure of the skin barrier, and concludes that ‘most skin disorders that have a diminished skin barrier function present a decrease in total ceramide content with some differences in the ceramide pattern. Formulations containing lipids identical to those in skin and, in particular, some ceramide supplementation could improve disturbed skin conditions’. So yes, we can conclude from this that ceramides are an important skincare ingredient and they assist in barrier repair. However, from another study I read as an offshoot ‘Roles of ceramides in barrier function of healthy and diseased skin’ it looks to me as though most researchers refer to a disrupted skin barrier in the specific context of dermatitis, psoriasis and established genetic disorders that have diminished skin function, rather than what we’d refer to here on this sub as a broken or disrupted skin barrier. The last article ‘Repairing a compromised skin barrier in dermatitis: leveraging the skins ability to heal itself’ again discusses a broken skin barrier mainly in this context, e.g. diseased skin belonging to those with dermatitis, xerosis, rosacea. While there is mention of dry, ageing and acne prone skin in the abstract, there is little discussion of such in the paper itself. The points of focus appear to be mainly on dermatitis. \n\n3. You mention on recap ‘Cut out all actives’. There is no evidence within these articles to support this. In fact, the article discussing repair of a compromised skin barrier specifically advocates use of Niacinamide. It also makes the following statements:\n\n>’Acidification and hyper-acidification of the epidermis has been shown to decrease TEWL.’ \n\n>’AHA’s are also used to modulate the pH of the skin to enhance corneum desquamation and improve skin appearance’\n\nIt goes on to discuss the negatives of AHA’s as they increase the skins susceptibility to sunburn, but only to then recommend:\n\n>’A natural polyhydroxy acid, Gluconolactone is a free radical scavenger and is a superior TEWL inhibitor when compared to several other acids...additionally GLU does not crystalline and become an irritant to the skin as easily as citric and lactic acid, making it an optimal epidermal acidifier’\n\nThis study is promoting the use of actives, not advising against the use of them.\n\nTLDR; I would therefore overall say that I agree with some of your points, based on my interpretation of the evidence.\n\nPoints I agree with:\n\n- Minimise your skins exposure to water; but don’t freak out about it too much, as the study only evidences TEWL after 4 hours.\n- Buy products that contain skin identical lips as per your list.\n\nPoints I disagree with:\n\n- I don’t think there is any basis to conclude cutting out actives will be beneficial, in fact I think it looks like the opposite is true. \n- If you are suffering from contact dermatitis, definitely deal with an occlusive such as Vaseline - there’s nothing in these articles to support use of this outside this specific setting.\n\nAs you said some things work for some people and some for others, and thanks so much for finding these papers and bringing them up for discussion. Just thought I would counter with my own interpretation, sorry that it became the novel that it is!",

I reacted badly to some and also just realized my routine was getting complicated with too many products I was testing. I stripped down to a bare bones routine of water on the face morning and night and Cerave Baby Moisturizing Cream. However, my problem is that not only have I seen no progress whatsoever, my skin still itches and hurts. Cerave is literally the only thing in my routine right now, so I’m inclined to think that it’s the Cerave that I’m not handling well.\nHowever... my face only starts to itch/hurt towards the evening or end of the day (and feels fine when I apply it). That’s why I can’t tell if I’m just experiencing sensitivity in general or if Cerave is the one making me itchy (also to note, Cerave has worked for me in the past).\n\n2.) when you’re moisture barrier is damaged, has anyone else noticed that you sweat A LOT more? Like if you’re outside on a hot day, has anyone else noticed this? I feel like I sweat a normal amount when I don’t have skin issues, but since I’ve been dealing with a damaged moisture barrier it seems like anytime I’m outside I just sweat and sweat. It makes sense though. If the skin is already having trouble retaining water then when you overheat that’s the perfect condition for more sweat (or water loss).",

        "body": "This is a great post. While I agree with the science, I don’t agree with your opening statement that dehydrated skin is oily. My skin is dehydrated. And not oily in the least. Not all dehydrated skin is oily. I don’t believe there are any conclusive studies that show all dehydrated skin is oily, you haven’t linked to any. I’ve never been able to find any. Those with a naturally dry skin type that experience dehydration don’t always experience over-production of oil or large pores. My skin is also not pore-ridden. Pore size is genetically determined. \n\nDr Diana Howard of the International Dermal Institute states that dehydrated skin can present in these ways:\n\n• Irritation, inflammation, itchiness and sensitivity\n• A feeling of tightness or tautness\n• A look or feel of roughness\n• Slight to severe flaking and scaling\n• Fine lines, severe redness and cracks that can sometimes bleed\n\nThese symptoms seem in line with everything else I’ve run across online as far as how dehydrated skin presents, as well as my personal symptoms. With the exception of course of over-producing oil. I wonder if oil over-production is a phenomenon related to inflammation as a result of dehydration which causes a cascade effect resulting in an oilier skin. Although I don’t know how this would apply to a dry skin that doesn’t produce much oil to begin with. \n\nI am under the care of two dermatologists, FWIW. \n\nMy skin is dehydrated because my barrier is compromised by my more aggressive actives; Retin a, CE Ferulic, Phloretin CF and lotion P50. The products I use as NMFs and overnight occlusives remedy the situation for me. \n\nI’ve noticed an improvment in my skin with using EFA supplements as well. Here’s an interesting article about it I found a while back: \n\nhttps://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/health-disease/skin-health/essential-fatty-acids#epidermal-lipids\n\n\nAlso, to play devil’s advocate, here’s a study that seemed to prove that dietary water has a direct effect on skin: \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4529263/",

    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

    "body": "I've been struggling with closed comedones for the past couple of years. I used to have perfect skin until I quit birth control, even though I didn't have acne before BC. I tried every chemical exfoliant, benzoyl peroxide, physical exfoliation, every cleanser, moisturizing, not moisturizing, and finally went back on birth control (Yaz) about a year ago with the CC's chronically appearing on the lower half of my face. I read about fungal acne, so I tried the ketaconazole shampoo mask the other night, which made my lower face skin turn into a very dry bumpy rash. I had not been moisturizing for months (during which, incidentally, my skin had gotten worse..I didn't make the connection LOL) bc I was afraid of it clogging my pores, but after the shampoo caused this scabby dryness, I decided to moisturize and apply vaseline over it. I woke up the next morning with the rash almost gone and most of the closed comedones I had before using the shampoo gone, as well! So I vowed to cut back on my actives (I had been using AHA and BHA, benzoyl peroxide, AND urology with .09 Tretinoin at night), just cleanse and moisturize and seal it in with vaseline at night. Over the next couple of days, the rash and my closed comedones almost entirely cleared up and my skin was finally no longer flaky and covered in red blotches. I started incorporating The Ordinary Squalane Oil below my moisturizer and vaseline at night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is [my skin now](https://imgur.com/a/a3rhoWm). I don't have any before pics because I have body dysmorphic disorder and taking pics of my skin would only trigger me. But it was extremely bumpy and red. I haven't had skin like I do now  since my initial CC break out years ago! I think that initial break out was hormonal, since it occurred 3 months after quitting BC, but that a some point my hormones must've improved and I was just irritating and dehydrating my skin with all these actives I thought I needed, causing further closed comedones (I never rly suffered from inflamed acne. The CC's would also never purge, I always had to manually extract them and they'd have  a hard clog inside). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy routine: \n\n  \nNeutrogena gentle daily cleanser (used to be avene's dermo cleansing milk, but it was discontinued)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTO Squalane oil\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAvene Skin Recovery Cream \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdd vaseline over it all in the PM. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nListen, I was so scared of cutting back on actives bc I was SO convinced that my face would only be worse. But if nothing has worked, see what happens when you cut out actives. Even if it doesn't clear your acne, your skin might be calmer and at least from there you can build a better routine and actually see what's affecting your skin instead of throwing everything on it. I definitely had to use skills from therapy (I'm in DBT therapy for BDD and BPD) to calm myself when I got anxious over potentially breaking out, but I'm so glad I saw it out. It's been over two weeks now that I'm off all actives. I tried BHA the other day just for exfoliation purposes and i woke up with bumpy skin/'closed comedones' (not sure if they were CC's at all?), which calmed down with oil/moisturizer/vaseline combo. I'm not gonna lie, it's only been a relatively short period of time so I'm very nervous if my skin is somehow still affected by the tretinoin i was using for years and that it's gonna explode at some point...but I'm trying to relearn faith in my skin, which I also feel is so important for anyone dealing with acne or recovering from it/emotional trauma caused by our skin.\n\n&#x200B;",

        "body": "I'm pretty sure I have the same problem (if not more than confident). I started working on restoring my moisture barrier about a month ago. Without using any actives, I'm surprisingly seeing a dramatic reduction in acne BUT I'm left with closed comedones/whiteheads (fairly small, though), and just red blotchy skin EVERYWHERE. \n\nI'm honestly wondering that with the winter months coming, I should think about adding vaseline as an occlusive (my older sister is wary of it though). Also, has squalene oil helped with the redness/blotchiness? \n\nI don't mind the acne tbh but the redness has definitely been a killer and Idk what I'm doing wrong. \n\nBTW YOU LOOK AMAZING LOOK AT U GIRL :) Also \n\n>but I'm trying to relearn faith in my skin, which I also feel is so important for anyone dealing with acne or recovering from it/emotional trauma caused by our skin.\n\nThis is such an important line I'm going to write it on a sticky note. I've been at this journey for 5-6 years and I refuse to give up. Thank u, and hope you continue your journey to amazing skin!\n\n&#x200B;",

I omitted anything prominently featuring an active or with a luxury price tag (over \\~$50). — I also highlighted a few common trigger ingredients for my reactive-skinned kin. Obviously there are loads more ingredients that can trigger breakouts and irritation but I figured these were some of the most common. \n\nTried to be as comprehensive as possible, but this is a massive list so there will probably be some mistakes (and edits).

    "body": "Hey everyone. So, after 4 months of pain and not knowing why my skin wasn't improving, I've finally figured it out. And I feel like a huge idiot.\n\nI'm pretty new to SCA and skin care in general. I started the beginner routine, ordered an assload of Cerave, was so excited to finally get things underway -- and then my skin BLEW. UP. Red all over, itchy as hell, closed comedones and acne all over my cheeks where it was never that bad before. \n\nCut to four months later and I have removed almost every 'trigger ingredient' that I can think of. Ditched all the Cerave, found a gentle cleanser (Cosrx low ph) and the most benign of moisturisers (Sebamed Clear Face and TO Squalane). After doing a lot of research through SCA and places like Simple Skincare Science, I decided to replace the ceramides and niacinamide that I'd be missing without Cerave and bought myself TO Niacinamide + Zinc, PC Skin Balancing Pore Reducing Toner and Cosrx Blackhead Power Liquid (all with niacinamide). Some improvement, not much, and while my skin overall felt more hydrated, my acne, itchiness and closed comedones did not go away. I was really careful too, did my best not to over-exfoliate, drank loads of water, rebuilt my moisture barrier. But something in my routine was still fucking me up. \n\nEvery single night I would actually dread my routine because I would come out the other side with a horrible red, itchy face that would take ages an hour plus to subside and had me picking at my skin. I tried to stick with it because I have eczema and it's winter here and I thought this was all normal, and how could a simple serum and a toner hurt my skin really? But then randomly came across some posts about niacinamide sensitivity and it all clicked. I ditched every product I had with niacinamide and literally within a day, my skin stopped itching and I could actually do my routine without any pain. \n\nI never actually knew what niacinamide would do for my skin besides helping with blemishes. I had just read that it was good for you and it became one of those buzzword ingredients I'd look out for. \n\nSo please, learn from my blind floundering through skincare products and really *critically* look at your routine if it isn't working. Don't just brush off pain and irritation as 'part of the process'. It's really easy on a place like SCA where ~~most~~ a lot of the advice is pretty anecdotal to get swept up in the hype. I saw so many rave reviews about niacinamide that I ignored both the negative ones, and my OWN SKIN telling me it could be a problem. So just add my tale to the big pile of cautionary tales on SCA.\n\n(As a side, positive note, this sub has really helped me find a routine that I like and boost my confidence hugely despite still being covered in acne, so thank you so much everyone, the dream of having clear skin keeps me going :') )\n\nEdit: Ok lol i didnt expect my silly rant to blow up, but it is so great (terrible?) to see how many people are saying they had the same experience 😂 Moral of the story is that YMMV is the core of OTC skincare. Like I think im gonna get it tattooed on the back of my hand now so i never forget",

I almost feel a little stupid for blaming it on the formulations or other ingredients but now it's pretty clear to me. I have started my niacinamide \"journey\" with the olay regenerist serum which did nothing to my skin but make it greasy - I blamed it on the formulation. Many products including Asian and Western creams, serums, toners and masks and I finally know that my skin is not that sensitive - but niacinamide makes it sensitive. I also blamed TO Niacinamide + Zinc for being a useless product. Yes, none of the niacinamide products (and I have used many) brightened my skin or did anything besides giving me a flushed, patchy looking face. I only realized it this week because I used Ascorbic Acid 2 times per day for two days and my skin started looking bright and wonderful but on the third day I decided to change it up by using niacinamide (used a serum and a sheet mask) and on that day all the good stuff the vitamin c did for me the days before was reversed! My skin turned brownish yellow, red... all kinds of colors. Plus, it was more sensitive and uneven looking - completely reversing my progress! That's when I started thinking and realized how useless and bad this ingredient was for me. I'd rather stick to AHA, BHA and any form of vitamin a and c. Those ingredients really work and effects can be seen quickly.",

        "body": "**Skin Info:**\n\nI have sensitive skin that is oily in places and dry in others. My number one focus is acne, then redness, hyperpigmentation, and puffy dark eyes. Been using a regular routine for about 10 months now, I still get hormonal acne but am now mostly focused on redness and hyperpigmentation. \n\n**Products:**\n\n**Biossance 100% Squalane Oil 100ML  ($32)** - I originally got this as part of their free sample deal where you pay for shipping and they’ll send you 2 samples. I tried the sample in hopes it would help with dry areas without breaking me. What really interested me is that it doesn’t have Hylauronic Acid, which I seem to be sensitive too when used frequently/in large amounts. Personally, I love it for night time use. Makes my skin too oily for day time, but I only need a few drops a couple of nights a week on top of my kikumasamune high moist and my dry skin is no more.\n\n**Biossance Squalane + Glycolic Renewal Facial 15ML ($28)** - This is where I got suckered. Originally I was going to buy the squalane + peptide eye gel (review below) but since I could only buy the full-sized option for a whopping $52 I was JUST going to buy the squalane oil. Until I was notified I could get a small version of the eye gel FOR FREE if I spent $20 more. Well, this is the only product around $20 that I could get that I was interested in. *First impression?* The texture and color are amazing. I know I love what glycolic acid does for my face, so I have high hopes. I plan to use it occasionally when I do my face mask night once a week. \n\n**Biossance Squalane + Peptide Eye Gel 4ML (Free)** - I got a free sample of this before, I think it helped reduce my dark rings, and puffy eyes. I wouldn’t call it a miracle worker, but it boosts my self-esteem so I’m gonna keep using it when I can! Also when I got the same sized free sample I used it twice a day for a month + before it ran out. I’ll probably stick to using it in the mornings this time around so I can use it for longer. \n\n**Biossance Squalane + Vitamin C Rose Oil 4ML (Free)** - I have never tried this but I’m on a quest for vitamin c that doesn’t break me out. I feel like it is an “extra” product in the first place, and being a student means I don’t have a ton of money. So I haven’t tried many products. Not sure I’d replace this if I like it because the full-size price is a $72. I do love the tiny dropper bottle the sample comes in, and am determined to find another use for it when I’m done. This one I’ll be spot testing for a while to see if it’s even worth trying on my whole face.",

    "body": "Picures of before after: [https://imgur.com/a/DfCHQUu](https://imgur.com/a/DfCHQUu)\n\nHello everyone, I've been a long time lurker of this sub & I wanted to start by saying how grateful I am for this community. I am highlighting in every paragraph important element in case you don't feel like reading the whole post.\n\nFirstly, I am incredibly sorry if you’re reading this & find yourself relating. I know how frustrating it is to know something is wrong with your skin & not knowing how to help. Having doctors prescribe the pill, acutane, retinoids, spending thousands on acids, facials, only to realize you don’t even have acne, just a stubborn fungi living rent free on your face. & then having to ditch your beloved products, that work well on others, & spend yet again to buy FA safe products. Being paranoid about touching your face, having to switch pillowcases everyday to not reinfect, i know i know. & don’t even get me started on all the looks you get from family members & people you talk with, it is honestly depressing but just know it gets better. At least you are here, at least you know the source of it all & you can start on fixing it. Thankfully, it’s not a difficult thing to treat, it just requires care, patience & consistence\n\n**My first flair up** was over a year ago. I had a bunch of redness of my face the day before a wedding, & was given the advice of wearing an overnight castor oil mask (yikes). I woke up the next day & every single on of my pores was a white head... I popped them all & applied foundation, attended the wedding & my skin eventually healing a few weeks later.\n\nA few months later, I went to a L'Oréal sale where I bought a bottle of Garnier Ombrelle sunscreen. I also got a lash lift and was scared to damage my lashes so I started applying castor oil overnight. This was **the beginning of my downfall**. During my sleep, the oil would smear on my cheeks & the sunscreen broke me out daily. At first, it was a few pimples on my face. After popping them everyday, I would try to calm my skin down with any oil I had laying around (castor, almond, avocado, grape seed, etc.)\n\nEvery time I would use the oil, the breakout would get worse, but instead of big pimples, it was dozens of tiny white heads. I eventually got really sick of it & went to my doctor. He prescribed Differin & warned me about the dryness, at the same time, I cut out every chemical skincare & resorted to natural products (including oils, lol). So i would apply a thick moisturizer every night & top it up an oil or vaseline. Since it's a retinoid, I also continued using (heavily) the Garnier suncreen... I waited over a month thinking I was just purging until I literally had a mental breakdown one night.\n\nI got really sick & tired of looking this bad, & realized my acne which i had been dealing with for years now (Not fungal at first) was tearing my confidence appart. What is the point of putting on makeup, jewelry, cute clothes & do my hair when my skin looked diseased? Doctors were no help, they put me on Differin & blamed all my pimples on the natural purging of Differin. My acne was keeping me up at night, sometimes it was itchy, the masks made it worse, I could not focus in class, was avoiding my (supportive) boyfriend, made no friends, etc. This is when I started heavily searching the subject. I found out I had Malassezia Follucilitis & Differin was doing absolutely nothing to help that.\n\n**What I wish I knew**:\n\n**fungal acne does not look the same on everyone**, which is a detail that kept me from addressing my own FA for months. The way people were describing it was not what I had exactly & picture never seemed to match. Mine manifested in:\n\n**- dozens of clusters of tiny white heads in all my pores**\n\n**- redness all over my face once the whiteheads disapeared**\n\n**- It was really bad on my chin, cheeks & the middle of my forehead. It never spread all over my cheekbones & side of the forehead.**\n\n**-It was rarely itchy or dry.**\n\n**-It was also very cyclic (which I believe is because I did not use oils everyday & did not apply sunscreen when I had online school).**\n\n**- I also had dandruff in my eyebrows, which is an obvious sign of fungi, but I thought it was the dryness of Differin.**\n\n**- it was stubborn to every product, acide, retinol, retinoid, washes, masks, facials, you name it**\n\n**- you have the feeling it is NOT acne, seriously trust your instincts, you deal with your skin everyday you know more about it than any person (who is not a dermatologist)**\n\nI then discovered **Simple Skincare Science**, my bible. I first used Nizoral & it worked pretty much instantly. I washed my face with it & the next day I woke up with a clear face for the first time in months. Although my face felt very dry, it was healthy at the moment, Nizoral will cause dryness that is normal.\n\nI later read the whole blog of simple science skincare, & realized my sunscreen, lash oil & day moisturizer were the culprit. I stopped using all three (which were garner ombrelle sunscreen, castor oil & The Ordinary moisturizer) & switched to coppertone gel sunscreen & eucerin healing ointment.\n\nFor about a week of this, my skin stayed well behaved & I finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. Through this treatment, I kept using Differin & would sometimes wash with Panoxyl to make sure normal acne wouldn’t show up.\n\nThen… **I fucked up**. Firstly, the constant use of Nizoral was killing my moisture barrier, & i could tell but I was too stubborn to stop. Then, I committed the terrible mistake of wearing foundation for 2 hours, thinking if i washed it off immediately after, there’s no way it would have time to react. WRONG. I honestly believe I had my foundation on for like 1h30 minutes but i’ll say 2 for good measure. On top of that, I was wearing a mask which basically created a luxury buffet for the fungi to feed on. Upon removing my makeup, everything seemed alright, I washed with Nizoral again just to be safe (lol) & the next day, I woke up with a breakout that reminded me of my era before learning about FA. It was terrible. All over my face again, tiny whiteheads. That same day, I bought CeraVe Baby lotion because I was sick of the thickness of Eucerin & was longing for a normal light moisturizer. I tried to not panic when I woke up & simply did another Nizoral mask (lol again). As soon as I washed it off, my face was super red & tingling. I thought the dryness was causing it, so I applied the CeraVe moisturizer & proceeded to experience what I would describe as lava on my face. The burning was SO bad. The moisturizer is obviously not at fault here, **my moisturize barrier was just officially fucked**.\n\nSo I stopped all treatments & repaired my moisture barrier. It took me a little less than a week which makes me think maybe it wasn't very damaged, thankfully. Despite, the fungal acne was still there. I booked an appointement with my doctor because no dermatologists are available in my city (little tip for you, call it a **fungal INFECTION**. Doctors who are not specialized in skin problems hear the word acne & immediately think BACTERIA. Keep the word acne out of your mouth & you'll get what you need). I was prescribed:\n\n\\- Nizoral in the form of a cream (doesn't dry like the shampoo), so basically **Ketoconazole 2% cream**\n\n\\- **50Mg of Fluconazole** to take in the span of two weeks. He kept the dosage low because it can be damaging for my liver, I need a blood test when I am done with the pills.\n\n**It took two days to completely clear my skin.**\n\n**My routine now**:\n\nAM:\n\n\\-wash face with just cold water\n\n\\-ketoconazol 2% cream\n\n\\-Cerave Baby Lotion\n\n\\-Coppertone gel sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\n\\-wash with Panoxyl\n\n\\-apply Differin\n\n\\-take 50mg of Fluconazole\n\n\\-Eucerin healing ointment\n\nI sometimes use 100% plant-derived squalane oil from The Ordinary to gua sha.\n\n**what to take from this post**:\n\n\\-if you're already in this sub, you're lucky\n\n\\-it gets better\n\n\\-you don't have acne\n\n\\-once it's clear, you are not out of the woods, keep an FA safe routine\n\n\\-if you can't access a dermatologist, you'll be fine",

Let me just say that when you are someone with super dry skin, getting rid of fungal acne is a huge bitch. Over the past 2 years I accidentally ruined my moisture barrier so many times. Now I've finally made a routine that works for me but it was quite troublesome to figure out what does and doesn't work. You really have to get used to watching your skin to notice what it looks like it can or cannot take. I had a hard time with this because despite all this time my skin just is too sensitive to take the use of any kind of actives or other acne treatments more often than every 3 days or so. So, I would keep just drying out my skin too much and making it worse all over again.\n\nMy FA was also mostly in the form of tons of tiny pustules too, though it was basically just in my t-zone, primarily on my forehead. I also had eyebrow dandruff and sometimes scalp dandruff. It's been an annoying road figuring this stuff out, but I am pretty sure that if I didn't have to wear a mask so much my face would be 100% clear.",

I feel like im going through hell, I suddenly got a horrible outbreak all over my head.. in my hair, my ears, my face. \nAfter suffering for a while, going from doc to doc (I don’t have a primary and the dermatologist were booking wayyyy too far out), I did a bit a research. It was very hard at first because as you mentioned, it doesn’t appear the same on everyone. So I had trouble really identifying or even explaining what was happening. I had so many symptoms and yet the people around me refused to see it, including the doctors. \nI was literally losing my mind, spiraling into a depression. \n\nSince I figured out what it is I stopped trying to explain it to the doctors and just simply asked for Antifungal treatment. \nI got ketocanozole 2% shampoo, and tried to purge my system in every possible way I knew how. Observing what foods I eat that feed the fungus. \n\nTrying to stop sugar is so hard. I have a really unhealthy relationship with sugar, and can overeat it and I really messes me up. \nI am not struggling with remnants of it still all over my head. Constantly treating. It seems like no matter what I do it just won’t go away. \n\nThe worst part is that mine is itchy, it itches so bad it just feels like hell. I know people go through worse, but I just can’t understand why this suddenly happened to me? \nI feel so ugly. I am so ashamed of my breakouts. And I feel them all the time. My face just itches so bad…",

    "body": "Hello all! So I was answering a question on r/AsianBeauty, but I thought maybe it will help some other people out who is dealing with dehydrated skin.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was a dumbass and used vitamin c crystals and mixed with water and used that for my \"vitamin c serum\" and completely overexfoliated my skin/got a chemical burn basically. And before and after that too, I thought exfoliating more was better (using AHA/glycolic acid/lactic acid), and did that everyday, which caused my skin barrier to get reck'd.\n\nIt took me a good year/year-and-a-half to fix my skin. This is what worked for me personally:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what I do is use a very gentle, non-foaming cleanser (I use [LRP Gentle Hydrating](https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Toleriane-Hydrating-Gentle-Cleanser/dp/B01N7T7JKJ/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538877830&sr=8-1&keywords=la%2Broche%2Bposay%2Bhydrating&th=1)) and while my face is still wet, put on all my hydrating toners and serums. Then go into lotions and creams RIGHT AWAY. Putting on occlusives right away after you wash and put on humectants is super important. Otherwise they can actually dry your skin out more.\n\nWhen my skin was SO full of pain, from extremely dry, tight skin and irritated acne-like cysts everywhere, the only thing that didn’t hurt like a mf was Vanicream. It took me hundreds of dollars and tons of trial and error and babying my skin to get it back to normal. Now I can use AHA, azelaic acid, vitamin c, and even tretinoin and hydroquinone without a problem!!!\n\nNo one or two products fixed my dehydrated skin. It took a TON of research over the years learning which ingredients were the most healing, moisturizing, how they work, etc.. And an entire routine around hydrating and moisturizing as much as possible. \n\n**I always make sure to include ingredients like:** panthenol (derivative of vitamin b5), allantoin, urea (a HUGE factor in getting my skin back to normal), hualuronic acid, glycerin, aloe, colloidal oatmeal, ceramides (important!!!), niacinamide (especially useful for brightening and healing your skin), petroleum (studies show that there is NOTHING out there that reduces transepidermal water loss like petroleum can. I tried to be all \\~natural is better\\~ for a while, but realized it wasn't doing anything to help fix my skin), etc.\n\nAnd not just adding these helped fix my skin, but **leaving things out** was a YUGE step in finally letting my skin heal. I avoid these like the plague: fragrance, natural (essential oils) or synthetic, alcohol anywhere other than sunscreen, sodium lauryl sulfate (sodium LAURETH sulfate is the gentler one, but I avoid that for my face too anyways. Surfectants can be aided to be milder by adding cocamidopropyl betaine), **LAY OFF all acids** until my skin could handle them (interestingly enough, vitamin c serum actually helped my skin hold more water instead of hurting me), and things that I know irritate my skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things that were/are biggest contributors of keeping my skin moist and hydrated, in no particular order:**\n\n[**Thayers Unscented Alcohol-Free Witch Haze**l](https://www.amazon.com/Thayers-Alcohol-free-Unscented-Witch-12-oz/dp/B0045PCAI6/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871279&sr=8-1&keywords=thayers+unscented) \\- the first thing that goes on my skin after washing. It's just water, aloe, glycerin and witch hazel. It's so simple but idk why my skin likes it so much, lol. It's HG for me.\n\n[**Hadalabo Premium Lotion**](https://www.amazon.com/Hadalabo-Skin-Institute-hyaluronic-solution/dp/B013HHJV0C/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871410&sr=8-1&keywords=hadalabo+premium) \\- HG, must have. **Hyaluronic acids**, urea, algae. This is my one non-negotiable skin care item.\n\n[**Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Eczema-Therapy-Moisturizing-Sensitive/dp/B003O7IBZC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-3&keywords=aveeno%2Beczema&th=1) \\- Super moisturizing. **Colloidal oatmeal**, glycerin, panthenol, petrolatum, a ceramide, dimethicone. (People demonize silicones, but they are not bad ingredients. They are actually really helpful in keeping in moisture, providing slip, and smooth feel for skin and hair. And no, they don't prevent other things from reaching the skin. [More on silicones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXHA7_dBRJY&t=12s).) And [Aveeno Eczema Therapy Night Time Balm](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Baby-Nighttime-Colloidal-Dimethicone/dp/B01HI7VY84/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-4&keywords=aveeno+eczema) for something heavier but has same ingredients. You can use both.\n\nAnd of course, [**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871829&sr=8-3&keywords=cerave+cream) \\- **ceramides, cholesterol, must have skin-identical lipids** that dehydrated skin lacks, hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, dimethicone. This by itself didn't help a whole lot, but with an army of all the different gentle, soothing things, it helped tremendously. There are lots of other \"golden ratio\"/fragrance-free ceramide stuff out there, CeraVe isn't the only one. Some of them are: [Stratia Liquid Gold](https://www.stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold), [Meishoku CeraColla gel](https://www.ebay.com/itm/JAPAN-MEISHOKU-CERACOLLA-MOISTURIZER-CREAM-50g-FACE-SKIN-CARE/173351832927?epid=1541103247&hash=item285c930d5f%3Ag%3AjbkAAOSweEFbFoJ-&LH_BIN=1) (they have toners as well), [Superdrug Hydrating Serum](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face-Skin-Care/Face-Serums/Superdrug-Simply-Pure-Hydrating-Serum-50ml/p/342700), [Curel Fragrance-Free lotions](https://www.amazon.com/Cur%C3%A9l-Fragrance-Comforting-Lotion-Sensitive/dp/B00171ETM6?th=1), [Ziaja Med Atopic Dermatitis Regenerating Face Cream](https://yanca.co.uk/product-eng-16098-Ziaja-Med-AD-Atopic-Dermatitis-Regenerating-CREAM-oiling-the-skin-atopic-for-infants-children-and-adults-50ml-5901887027942.html), among many others.\n\n[**CeraVe PM**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-Lightweight/dp/B079H99466/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1538872080&sr=1-1&keywords=cerave+pm)\\- same as the cream, but much, much lighter and has 4% **niacinamide** I believe. Niacinamide has been key to helping my dry-ass skin. It does SO many things. Heals and mends, fades spots,etc. etc. I DIY 6% niacinamide and 5% **n-acetyl glucosamine** to boost the niacinamide even further. (Commercial version [Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)) But you can find this ingredient in loads of Asian Beauty things and Olay products. Make sure the Olay stuff is fragrance-free if you get them. I like the [Olay Anti-Aging Face Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Olay-Anti-Aging-Moisturizer-Micro-Sculpting-Fragrance-Free/dp/B007M81B4M/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872043&sr=8-3&keywords=olay+fragrance+free) a lot. It really helps refine texture, as well. You can use the CeraVe moisturizing lotion if you for some reason can't tolerate niacinamide, but want something lighter than the cream. Really, any one of CeraVe products is good, they have loads.\n\n[**Aquaphor Healing Ointment**](https://www.amazon.com/Aquaphor-Advanced-Therapy-Ointment-Protectant/dp/B0107QPFBU/ref=sr_1_5_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872144&sr=8-5&keywords=aquaphor) \\- SLUG LIFE is a MUST if you have dehydrated skin. You can use Cerave healing ointment too, but it's redundant if you use the cream or lotion. It's not as occlusive as aquaphor. Aquaphor isn't just a more pricier Vaseline as people suggest. It does have white petrolatum that is oh-so helpful, it also has healing ingredients like panthenol and bisobolol, and also lanolin alcohol and glycerin for humectants.\n\nIf you wanna go a step further and go super saiyan, and you aren't sensitive to lanolin, you can use [**Lasinoh Lanolin**](https://www.target.com/p/lansinoh-hpa-lanolin-tube/-/A-92544) before or after Aquaphor. I can't stand the smell of lanolin, but this one is medical-grade and doesn't have a smell. Lanolin is SUPER helpful because of it's crazy humectant properties but it also acts as an occlusive.\n\nFor just uber **Panthenol** healing, you can get something that stars it as the main star ingredient, like [**DML Forte Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/DML-Forte-Panthenol-4-Ounces/dp/B000052YN6/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872923&sr=8-3&keywords=forte+cream) or [**Timeless Skin Care Vitamin B5 Serum**](https://www.timelessha.com/products/vitamin-b5-serum-1-oz)**.** I don't use the cream anymore, but I do still use the serum. It looks expensive, but if you get the refill sale, it's about $7/oz (this is the price for me in the U.S.). I HIGHLY recommend their [vitamin c, e, ferulic acid serum](https://www.timelessha.com/products/20-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-acid-serum-1-oz) as well when your skin can handle it. It works out to **about $8 an ounce** if you get it during refill sale. It stays good for a while in the fridge. I wrap it in foil to keep more light out and transfer some to a 1 oz dropper bottle for using it in my bathroom. It gives glow to your skin like ***NOTHING ELSE***, and boosts your sunscreen (the antioxidants slow the degradation of sunscreen ingredients) and has helped me with water retention. If you can't get it on refill sale, use the HotandFlashy (I also recommend her Youtube channel) code hf5off to get $5 off. It's a forever coupon code.\n\n**Urea** is **SO, SO,** **SO** helpful for healing dehydrated skin. It's an amazing humectant but also a mild exfoliator if you have a high enough %. [**Eucerin 5% Urea Face Cream**](https://us.feelunique.com/p/eucerin-dry-skin-replenishing-face-cream-night-5-urea-50ml?utm_source=googlebaseus&utm_medium=gen&gclid=eaiaiqobchmi4cftgp3z3qivc39-ch3qhgiheakyaiabegjud_d_bwe&gclsrc=aw.ds&curr=USD) is awesome for this. I don't use that anymore simply because it's more of a hassle to get (not available in the U.S.). My skin looks AMAZING with the [**TriDerma MD Eczema Fast Healing Cream**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991) used as a sleeping pack. It's full of skin-healing goodies, like urea (of course), 1.5% Colloidal Oatmeal, aloe, allantoin, arnica extract (a flower thingy that helps heal wounds), beeswax (beeswax and lecithin have great skin-identical components much like ceramides), shea butter, zinc and sodium PCA, and squalane.\n\n**Squalane** is another skin-identical ingredient that you can incorporate into your skin care. I use [this](https://www.timelessha.com/products/squalane-100-pure) one for now, but you can also get the oil at [gardenofwisdom.com](https://gardenofwisdom.com) or [lotioncrafter.com](https://lotioncrafter.com). The GoW one is a little bit more thinner more astringent-feeling to me for some reason than Timeless's.\n\nAnd while you're at it, mix in some other healing oils that help heal skin. Linoleic acid is very important in skin health and wound healing. Oils that tend to be high in these go off faster, however. So you may want to keep them in the fridge. Add in 1% mixed tocopherols (vitamin e) to extend the shelf life of your oils. I like hemp seed, wheatgerm, chamomile/calendula, rosehip oils (can aggravate acne if you're acne-prone). My choice of oils for my facial oil serum: 50% borage seed oil (the best healing), 29% squalane oil, 10% seabuck thorn BERRY oil (very different fatty acid profile to the seed oil), and 10% pomegranate (filled with antioxidants), 1% mixed tocopherols.\n\nSomething that really helps is layering a ton of humectants/watery steps in my routine. You can experiment with this, but right now I'm using the Thayers witch hazel, my vitamin c serum, timeless vitamin b5 serum, [**innisfree aloe gel**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Innisfree-Aloe-Revital-Soothing-Gel-300ml/302699871225?epid=4002960484&hash=item467a517bf9:g:gy4AAOSwsTday~0A) (unscented, aloe, centella stuff), CosRX Snail, and Hadalabo Premium. I plan to get [Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495) (way cheaper on eBay- like \\~$12).\n\nYou don't **need** a shit load of expensive things to heal dehydrated skin. In fact, a lot of the expensive stuff I see are filled with tons of unnecessary, possibly skin irritating plant extracts and essential oils, super fragranced. Many people go, oh it's fine bc it doesn't irritate my skin, but it's not just \"I'm sensitive to this\" vs \"I'm not\". It's likely that you can develop an allergy or sensitivity to a certain ingredient the longer you use it.  Like how some people develop sensitivity to latex after using eyelash glue with it in it for a while, or people developing sensitivity with lavender after prolonged exposure to the essential oil or something.\n\nAnyway, I hope that was helpful to anyone out there who struggled like I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: Also, I realized throughout my journey and research, a lot of things that look like \"break outs\", pimples, acne, aren't actually acne. Yeah, you can have acne due to bacteria or fungus or whatever else, but the stuff I'm talking about isn't really acne. Inflammation doesn't just manifest as rashes and thelike. A lot of things that look like acne are actually your skin saying \"no, this is irritating! Get it off me!\", like after you try a new thing for example. But that doesn't mean it will irritate it forever. You can use things that used to irritate your skin after your barrier heals. But some things you may be sensitive to forever..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDITED TO ADD 06/26/2019: AMINO ACIDS are also very important! They make up 40% of our stratum corneum (according to Susan from swiftcraftymoney)! If you want to fix your barrier, you want ingredients like amino acids, sodium PCA, sodium lactate, urea, and sugars like glycerin, fructose, what-have-you! For fatty acids, you want things like linoleic acids, oleic acids, and linolenic acids. Beeswax, lecithin, and lanolin are all great for rebuilding your barrier.\n\nI have not tried this, but The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA is a really good product with all of these NMFs. A pricy one is Paula's Choice Omega+ Complex (the serum, the moisturizer is okay too, but the serum has a lot more skin rebuilding goodies).",

I picked up some vegetable glycerin to mix with the honey and I'm going to try that tomorrow. But as I've been trying to research this stuff, I've read some things about how using too much glycerin can make your skin drier? Honestly, I'm so overwhelmed and confused.\n\nI'd love to incorporate more moisture layers into my new routine, because I definitely feel like my moisture barrier is damaged and I'm trying not to freak out. I'm hoping it won't take me super long to recover, since it's really just the past week that I went overboard and hurt my skin. But who knows, maybe I have made my skin upset over time with fragrances and actives over time :/\n\nhow did you go about introducing new products when your issue started? I want to start using the cetaphil moisturizer if possible, and other products with ceramides, urea, etc etc BUT i can't seem to find any that are totally free from the ingredients that seem to be irritating me now... I dont want to buy products that will just sting and irritate me further, but I also don't want to prolong healing by not giving my skin everything it needs?\n\nsorry this is so long ashdsgkhflj thank you if you read this far\n\nEdit/update: I can tolerate the cetaphil Moisturizer now and it helps me feel hydrated, but I’ve started breaking out with some whiteheads, which is atypical for me (usually I get cystic pimples and CCs)",

    "body": "I had written a post in r/skincareaddiction and I thought it could be helpful to some people in this sub as well. I had a hard time crossposting for some reason so I’m going to just make a new post, if that’s alright. (I also want to edit to say, that sub has some good info in the sidebar, but I’ve seen some TERRIBLE advice being thrown around in the comments over there so please be careful)\n\nI see a lot of people on r/skincareaddiction and various skincare groups I belong to on Facebook who are looking  to clear out clogged pores, and to get rid of those black dots all over the nose and sometimes other parts of the face. These black dots are called sebaceous filaments, although they’re sometimes mistaken for blackheads. I decided I’d make this post so that I can have something to easily link to people who needs help, instead of typing everything out each time. Maybe it can also help anyone who comes across this post! \n\n(If you don’t know what I’m talking about, do a google image search for “sebaceous filaments”. I was going to link a picture but I don’t want to steal anyone’s photo)\n\nSebaceous filaments are basically like clogged pores. Sometimes, the ends that are exposed to air have oxidized and turned dark color which is why they may look like blackheads. Our skin produces sebum, which can get gunked up in the pores and the tiny hair follicle glands along with some dirt and dead skin cells. \n\n**You can get rid of sebaceous filaments temporarily, but they always come back.** Many people use BHA chemical exfoliants, clay masks, or other methods to get rid of them, but because of the fact that they will always come back, whichever method you use will have to be done often, and it’s not very healthy for your skin to be doing clay masks several times per week. Or some people just have sensitive skin and can’t tolerate clay masks or BHA chemical exfoliants. In my case, I use tretinoin, so I can’t use chemical exfoliants. This method is safe to do multiple times per week! \n\nYou will need an oil. Some of my favorites are jojoba oil, squalane, argan oil, and rosehip seed oil. It doesn’t have to be an oil that’s marketed as being for skincare (I buy my jojoba oil at the local market), but I wouldn’t personally use like cooking oil or something lol. Take your oil and rub it all over your face. (EDIT: ALWAYS spot test any skincare product for a few days before you put something all over your face). Let it sit, leave it alone so it can sink in for like ten minutes. Then, *gently* massage your face, focusing on the areas where you have most sebaceous filaments. The oil gets into the pores and works to dissolve the stuff that is built up and clogged inside them, and the massage part is so that any of the gunk that’s become too hardened to easily dissolve can be gently brought up and out of the pores. You can even sometimes feel them on your fingers after they’ve come up; they feel like little grits of sand almost. Then you just wash your face like normal, or even just wipe it gently with a warm cloth, which is what I do. If you continue to do this 3 times a week, after about a month (most likely, much sooner than that) you should have a mostly clear face and the results will only get better after you keep doing it each week.\n\nBut like I said, they’ll always come back, so this technique only works if you keep doing it indefinitely. You might not see noticeable results right away but don’t be discouraged. After a few weeks you’ll be dissolving new ones before they even have a chance to really build up and be noticeable. I haven’t had any visible sebaceous filaments for like over a year now. This helps with blackheads too but they can be more stubborn.\n\nI know some people might be confused as to why they should use an oil, when the problem was most likely caused by excess oil in the first place! Well, you might remember from chemistry class (I don’t, because I was a hoodlum and a delinquent- but I’ve spent a lot of hours reading about skincare) that ***like dissolves like!*** Meaning, yes, an oil is going to dissolve the oil that’s stuck in your sebaceous glands. Some people are afraid of oil in skincare. I’m not going to get off topic about it unless someone asks in the comments, but long story short, a lot of people avoid using oils when their skin might actually benefit from them! (I’m *not* talking about essential oils; I don’t recommend essential oils for the skin)\n\nWith that said, please don’t stress too much over the appearance of your sebaceous filaments or pores in general. It’s very likely that nobody else notices them on your face besides you! And they are totally normal to have. I don’t like how the skincare industry has invented this fake “problem” of “large pores” so they can sell us the “cure” for it. Just a lot of BS playing off our insecurities... but that’s a whole other rant\n\nIf anyone has comments or questions, feel free to let me know! I’ll try to answer any questions I can, but please remember I’m not a professional.\n\n———————————————\n\nEdit: some people are asking, at what point in their routine should they be doing this step? There are many people who use oil as a way to remove makeup at the end of the day, and it’s their first step to cleanse the face and then they follow that with a “regular” cleanser.\n\nI prefer to do this on a bare face. So maybe I’ll wake up in the morning and splash water on my face to clean it, and then do the oil massage, and then do the rest of my routine.\n\nHonestly though, I don’t usually do this oil massage as part of my routine. On a normal day, I’d do my morning routine around 9am, and then maybe sometime during the afternoon like 3:00 for example I’ll say to myself “well I’m not doing anything right now, how about some oil on my face”. So then I’ll splash my face with water to clear it off, do the oil massage, wipe off with warm cloth and then put some moisturizer and sunscreen on. Then later at night I’ll do my night routine. (My routine is very simple because I use tretinoin, so it’s not a hassle for me to re-apply my morning products mid-day)\n\nSo this doesn’t  have to be an official step in your routine, you can do it any time. But if you are going to include it in your routine, Do it before your cleanser. \n\n#Also, just like any other product, you should spot-test the oil before you put it on your whole face. Different people react differently to different products and that includes oil!",

I had some minor acne and clogged pores but nothing major - so I haven’t had a bad purge. \n\nThe biggest piece of advice I took from this sub was to make sure my skin barrier was intact, optimized, and hydrated. \n\n\nAM\n1. Jan Marino Bioglycolic Face Wash\n2. A&D ointment around the nasolabial folds and eyes, I swear by this. \n3. CODEX skin barrier serum \n4. Ole Henriksen banana vit C eye cream\n5. LRP double repair moisturizer + SPF\n\n\nPM\n1. Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Oil Cleanser\n2. A&D ointment, nasolabial folds and the skin around my eyes\n3. Tretinoin 0.025%\n4. Vanicream \n\nI have been using the Tret mostly every night, on the occasion that I am a bit inflamed or dry at all - I back off and take a break for 24-48 hours and if I’m home? I’m sluggin’ during the day too. A real goopy mess, I love it. \n\nIn my last picture I am wearing a tinted moisturizer and touched up a few spots with my Jones Road concealer stick, but that’s it. I’m actually shocked at how quickly my melasma resolved. Other benefits I’ve noticed with the Rx Tret versus OTC retinols is reduced pore size, improved texture, and my skin isn’t dull! \n\nNon-directly skin related interventions I’ve taken include drinking an absolute shit ton of water. I’m filling up my hydro 40oz 3x daily. So. Much. Water. I cannot emphasize this enough. \n\nThere are some who would find my routine absolutely unbearable for their skin and that’s okay. It’s important to find what works for your unique skin profile. If something isn’t working - back off, go back to the basics, and start again. \n\nThankful for all of the seasoned Tret users who inadvertently helped me find the skin care routine that I plan to stick with for life.",

While many people do apply tretinoin around their eyes, this can cause permanent damage to the oil glands in the eyes, and can result in permanently dry eyes. Remember that tretinoin travels up to 2\" below the skin, so you'll still get anti-aging benefits even if you don't apply right next to your eyes. Be safe, and protect your eyes: don't apply tretinoin near your eyes or on your eyelids. [Here's what the Mayo Clinic has to say about safe tretinoin application.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/tretinoin-topical-route/proper-use/drg-20066521#:~:text=Do%20not%20use%20this%20medicine,the%20tips%20of%20your%20fingers) (To learn more, search for \"Meibomian gland dysfunction\")\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I picked up an [Omnilux Contour mask](https://omniluxled.com/products/omnilux-contour-face) during their Black Friday deal after seeing some really fantastic red LED B&As here, and I thought I'd share my own before and after and my thoughts. The \"before\" photo was taken the first day I used the mask. \n\n**Lifestyle factors**: 35F, dry and sensitive skin with rosacea, office job. I've been a skincare enthusiast since my mid-20s because I enjoy nerding out about it. I have never smoked, I stay hydrated every day, and I have an unrestricted but mostly healthy diet. I have been using tretinoin 0.025% since July, but I used retinol before that for a few years. I have never had any professional treatments, fillers, or botox, although I plan on checking out PDL/vbeam for rosacea this spring.\n\n**Skincare routine** (did not change before or during mask use):\n\n* **AM**: rinse with water, Hadalabo Gokujyun Moist lotion, Timeless 20% Vit C (every other day), pure squalane, Beauty of Joseon Dynasty cream, Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun \n* **PM**: HL Gokujyun Moist, Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 essence, tretinoin 0.025% (every other day), pure squalane, Beauty of Joseon Dynasty or Drunk Elephant Lala Retro cream (sometimes I do a thin layer of both on tret days)\n\nI sometimes skip creams in the AM because the sunscreen is pretty moisturizing. I slug with Aquaphor occasionally on days I don't use any actives. I also use Timeless peptide serums after the hydration step on non-active days, although I'm inconsistent with them (Coenzyme Q10 in the morning, Synthe'6 at night).\n\n**I already use a lot of collagen-building products, and I don't have much photoaging due to my commitment to sunblock, so I was never going to get radical results**. **If you're like me in that regard, an LED mask isn't going to blow you away.** These masks will probably have the best wow factor for folks with hyperpigmentation or who are recent converts to sunscreen and want to undo some sun damage. That said, I like the mask and will continue using it. \n\nI used the mask daily for two weeks when I started, then 3-5 days a week since. I take off my makeup with micellar water before using the mask and I do my routine after. This mask turns off after 10 minutes, so I do one session on my face and one with the mask laid sideways to cover my neck and upper chest (this is why I chose the Omnilux mask--it's flexible!). \n\n**What I like and dislike about results**: About two weeks in, I noticed improved volume in mid and lower face that is most noticeable in motion or when talking. At a three-quarters angle of my face, the apple of the cheek is less sunken. I haven't seen that kind of volume improvement with years of vit C and retinoids, so I really like that. Looking at the photos, I can see improved volume in the upper eyelid at the outer corner of my eye, and the expression lines over the orbital bone have less depth. \n\nI'm a little neutral on the impact on redness. It's the same in the photos because those are broken capillaries, but I do think the look when I'm flushed is a bit improved. I also noticed a big improvement in upper chest redness (I don't always extend skincare down to my neck and chest, so there was some sun damage there).\n\nI would have liked to see a better reduction in the crepiness of the topmost layer of skin (probably most visible here on the top of my cheekbone). But I think tretinoin could be impacting this, since I've only been using it for about six months. I'm not peeling or having irritation anymore, but it still seems drying. I have seen a noticeable reduction in redness on my chest, which is nice.\n\nThe B&A is cropped for my privacy, so I want to be candid about the similarities and differences between the photos, since redditors are (rightfully!) critical of before and afters. But please keep in mind I took these images for myself first and foremost, rather than for reddit.\n\nVariables I could not control for or that should not be attributed to the mask:\n\n* I have fluid retention under my eyes on Jan 1 that I didn't address (I didn't drink on NYE, but I did watch a movie that made me cry a ton, and I always get puffy in the lower orbit the day after crying)\n* Acne resolution: in September, I stopped taking hormonal BC and got some intense inflammatory acne around my chin and jaw. The acne was addressed with a tetracycline prescription (started mid-November), but the mask absolutely helped calm the inflammation.\n\nWhat I did control for:\n\n* Makeup: I'm wearing the same type and amount in both images (mascara and Bobbi Brown skin concealer stick applied on the undereye orbit and chin--even though I have no active acne anymore, the red marks haven't totally faded)\n* Time and location of photo, angle of my face towards the light, and angle of the camera\n* Facial expression\n* Photos were both taken with the iOS stock camera app's \"photo\" mode (not portrait mode, which retouches)",

Here is the link to the article in Google Drive since it's only available with a journal subscription ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EcSOW2sDxBduzkizShtufx9x4Rm7pbOq/view?usp=share\\_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EcSOW2sDxBduzkizShtufx9x4Rm7pbOq/view?usp=share_link)).\n\nThey have studied a total of 12 products from The Ordinary, Paula's Choice, Revolution, Afrodita, Eveline, Eucerin, Green Line, Lekarna Ljubljana and L'Oreal. The products have been anonymized and named from F1 to F12 but I was able to identify several of the products by cross-checking the provided information (ingredients, price, stabilizers...). The take-home message is simple and confirms what we knew already: retinol stability is highly dependent on formulation and price is not a guarantee of stability. The Ordinary and Paula's Choice were among the products with the quickest degradation of their retinol content.\n\nThe Ordinary: Retinol 1% in squalane is identified in the article as F1. It has the 4th quickest retinol degradation rate of the 12 products as only 30% of the original amount was left at 6 months after opening. Interestingly, the tested product started with 1.3% retinol instead of 1.0%. It could thus be very irritating in the first weeks and almost ineffective by the end of the bottle. The company is aware of the instability of their product as their Chief Scientific Officer admitted that their retinol should not be used 3 months after opening even if refrigerated. See the interview transcript here: [https://labmuffin.com/interview-with-deciem-the-ordinary-chief-scientific-officer-and-dr-davin-lim/](https://labmuffin.com/interview-with-deciem-the-ordinary-chief-scientific-officer-and-dr-davin-lim/)\n\nPaula's Choice: Clinical 1% Retinol Treatment is identified in the article as F4. Despite being the most expensive product tested, it has the 2nd quickest retinol degradation rate of the 12 products as only 25% of the starting amount was left at 6 months after opening. Worse, the product started with only 54% of the declared retinol content suggesting that retinol started degrading even before the opening of the product.\n\nA word on Granactive retinoid hydroxypinacolone retinoate (HPR): The Ordinary Granactive 2% was identified in the article as F8. It had the slowest degradation rate as 95% of the original amount was left at 6 months after opening. However, it cannot be recommended as an alternative to retinol as its efficacy is not yet backed by independent peer-reviewed studies.",

No more foundation or green colour corrector, just beautiful, glowing skin.\n\nI initially posted asking what the redness on my cheeks was all about. And I’m embarrassed to say I never, ever, considered that it was rosacea. I was recommended to look into ceramides, cica, azelaic acid, and prescription treatments like soolantra. I tried the soolantra with no success so into skincare I dove! \n\nI started with:\n1. Simple Kind to Skin cleanser \n2. Naka vitamin C serum\n3. Inkey List azelaic acid \n4. Anai Rui Squalane w/ vit C & Turmeric \n5. Inkey List Ceramide serum\n6. PYUNKANG YUL ATO Cream Blue Label moisturizer \n\nI saw fantastic results but eventually wanted to simplify my routine and focus more on fine lines …\n\n1.Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash\n2. Promise vitamin C serum (almost identical to  Naka but even better results!)\n3. Inkey List azelaic acid \n4. PYUNKANG YUL ATO Cream Blue Label moisturizer \n5. Somebymi Retinol Intense\n\nAnd this brought my results to a whole new level!\n\nSome extra tips are: I got a water softener installed in my home which was critical to helping my skin barrier and skin texture and I cut out sugar which helped with residual pimples. I also use SPF from Somebymi on sunny days.\n\nI hope this helps guide someone from what feels like everlasting rosacea to clearer, comfortable skin! This sub has been incredible for guidance and I can’t thank you all enough. ",

    "body": "***TL;DR: Breakdown of popular new skincare ingredients***\n\nHyaluronic acid, mushrooms, pre-and-probiotics and squalene might sound complicated, but there are very simple ways each of these hot new ingredients can be used as part of your skincare routine. Find out which ingredients may be helpful to you as you navigate your skincare journey. Ulta Beauty is here to inspire you to give your skin some extra love.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pjo8zvzpflf71.jpg?width=2121&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee1425f4a16865da061675ff1c309b8ea4fcf764\n\n**What is it?** Hyaluronic acid is a sugar that occurs naturally in the body to provide moisture to your skin, eyes and joints. According to Dermalogica, hyaluronic acid helps retain over 1,000 times its weight in water.  As we age, the amount of naturally occurring hyaluronic acid in our bodies decreases, leaving many looking for a way to supplement this moisture magnet.\n\n**What are the benefits?** When applied topically to the skin, hyaluronic acid benefits include skin hydration, lipid barrier protection, tighter skin tone, smoother skin texture, less visible fine lines and wrinkles, reduction of fine lines and wrinkles, skin clarity and wound healing. Benefits of eating hyaluronic acid-rich foods or taking a hyaluronic supplement include arthritis pain relief, and increased bone, joint and vision health.\n\n**How do I add it to my routine?** You can supplement your body’s production of hyaluronic acid through topical creams and serums, oral supplements or even injectables. Many opt for the topical route, as skin is very receptive to hyaluronic acid applied to its surface.\n\n“Hyaluronic acid is especially great for oily skin types because it’s lightweight and hydrates without making skin oilier,” says Dr. Howard Murad, dermatologist and creator of eponymous skincare line.\n\n**Product recommendations:** [Fourth Ray Beauty Good Mood Gel Moisturizer](https://www.ulta.com/p/good-mood-gel-moisturizer-pimprod2012749?sku=2560467&_requestid=2499596), [L’Oreal Revitalift Derm Intensives Hyaluronic Acid Face Serum](https://www.ulta.com/p/revitalift-derm-intensives-hyaluronic-acid-face-serum-pimprod2001763?sku=2534685), [Murad Clarifying Water Gel](https://www.ulta.com/p/clarifying-water-gel-pimprod2017329)\n\n**Mushrooms**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ba4efvskglf71.jpg?width=2121&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65be384288d58e1b706b55c57a63ec946bd51cb4\n\n**What are they?** Mushrooms are considered a delicacy to many, but taste isn’t the only benefit. Mushrooms are rich in vitamins and nutrients like Vitamin D, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous and zinc. When thinking about health benefits for your skin, look for “functional” or “adaptogenic” mushrooms like Cordyceps, Reishi, Chaga, Lion’s Mane and Shiitake.\n\n**What are the benefits?** When applied topically to the skin, mushroom benefits include brightening, pigmentation fading, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, skin hydration and acne treatment. Benefits of adding mushrooms to your diet or taking a supplement include reduction of fine lines and wrinkles, anti-inflammatory properties, immune system strengthening, improved mental focus and overall feeling of calmness.\n\n**How do I add them to my routine?** Mushrooms are a key ingredient in select topical creams and serums. You also can get the positive effects of mushrooms from simply adding more to your diet or taking supplements.\n\n**Product recommendations:** [Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion](https://www.ulta.com/p/dr-andrew-weil-origins-mega-mushroom-relief-resilience-soothing-treatment-lotion-xlsImpprod18191033?sku=2525621&_requestid=2506985), [Shiseido Ultimate Power Infusing Concentrate](https://www.ulta.com/p/ultimune-power-infusing-concentrate-xlsImpprod18631015?catargetid=330000200002232595&CAPCID=438981188804&CATCI=aud-297352281828:dsa-897748595236&CAAGID=98144620737&CADevice=c&gclid=CjwKCAjwmK6IBhBqEiwAocMc8hvz9rWM2M5iTeIQHg67LK1SJ3459aJcvl4yeXszJnfhTzparAXuzBoCJHsQAvD_BwE)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Prebiotics and probiotics**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/071odm4rglf71.jpg?width=2121&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c8abec5fb754dfc8e1a764f820ff8f0e2d553eb\n\n**What are they?** Probiotics are live good bacteria and/or yeasts that live naturally in your body. You have good and bad bacteria in your body constantly, and probiotics are made up of the good bacteria that keeps your body healthy.\n\nAccording to Murad, “Topically-applied prebiotics are the ‘food’ for bacteria that can help skin go from dry and cracked to rehydrated, healthy and balanced. In a sense, prebiotics help your skin do what it would do naturally in its healthiest state.”\n\nIt’s well known that pre-and-probiotics aid in digestion, but they have many additional benefits, including for your skin.\n\n**What are the benefits?** When applied topically, pre-and-probiotic benefits include reduced skin inflammation, skin barrier protection and acne treatment. Ingestible benefits include immune system regulation, reduced insulin levels, aided digestion and helping maintain gut and vaginal health.\n\n**How do I add them to my routine?** Popular ways to add probiotics to your routine include eating more fermented foods with bacteria, such as yogurt, or taking oral supplements. More and more topical skincare products are starting to use pre-and-probiotics as key nourishing ingredients to lock in moisture and soothe inflammation.\n\n**Product recommendations:** [Tula The Cult Classic Purifying Face Cleanser](https://www.ulta.com/p/cult-classic-purifying-face-cleanser-xlsImpprod18731041?sku=2532485&_requestid=2495672), [Korres Greek Yoghurt Probiotic Superdose Face Mask](https://www.ulta.com/p/greek-yoghurt-probiotic-superdose-face-mask-pimprod2020737?sku=2573089&_requestid=2497869), [Murad Prebiotic 4-In-1 MultiCleanser](https://www.ulta.com/p/prebiotic-4-in-1-multicleanser-pimprod2002651?sku=2538074&_requestid=689196)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Squalene/squalane**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d5f6o8rtglf71.jpg?width=2121&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5304db8ee61046b43c47d8e5b7c29cdda51184b0\n\n**What is it?** Squalene is a lipid produced naturally by your own skin cells, which slows down with age. Squalene is also found in olives, rice, sugarcane and shark livers. Squalene must be converted from an unsaturated oil to a saturated oil (hydrogenated) when made for skincare products, so it is then referred to as squalane.\n\n**What are the benefits?** When applied topically, squalane benefits include preventing moisture loss, softening skin, reduction of fine lines and wrinkles, oil control, and anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.\n\n**How do I add it to my routine?** Squalane is typically found in the form of a topical gel or serum. It is helpful for all skin types, mimicking natural oils to provide calmness and balance oils.\n\n**Product recommendations**: [belif The True Cream-Aqua Bomb](https://www.ulta.com/p/true-cream-aqua-bomb-pimprod2013170?sku=2557476&_requestid=2503044), [Juice Beauty STEM CELLULAR Lifting Neck Cream](https://www.ulta.com/p/stem-cellular-lifting-neck-cream-xlsImpprod11931111?sku=2284858&_requestid=2505042)\n\nAs these four ingredients are becoming increasingly popular in the skincare world, it’s important to listen to your body and select the right skincare routine and products for you.

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat.

It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use. I'm also using HA (unrelated to this post) but I think due to my dehydrated skin, it's becoming even more dehydrated. I will try TO's Mandelic and maybe alternate it with Pixi day to day.

Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time? Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6.

    "body": "About four years ago, I wrote the currently sidebar'd post, [\"Evaluating Your Current Routine\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1x1ubd/evaluating_your_current_routine_read_me_before/). In that, I recommended things to ask yourself and consider before buying new products or changing your routine entirely.\n\nI recently began blogging, but I wanted to bring these posts to Reddit as well for people who did not want to click out of the sub. \n\nLots of this is content that has been referenced over the years on this subreddit, as well as elsewhere. However, I understand the frustration for new users stumbling in, seeing product recommendations and terminology being thrown around, as well as an enormous sidebar. It's pretty anxiety-inducing. I also see a lot of people skipping from products to products, asking what to try next. \n\nMy goals with this series is to break down *what* goes into your cleansers and how it affects your skin so you are empowered to make better choices as well as understand some of the science that gets passed around.\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down your average, general cleansers as well as oil cleansers (or the oil-cleansing method aka OCM) and micellar cleansers. Let's dive right in!\n\n---\n\n**Introduction to Cleansers**\n\nCleansers work by dissolving or binding to things on the skin that aren't normally rinsed away by water, such as the waxes or oils produced by our skin.\n\nWithout getting too into the weeds, they are able to do this with surfactants  (or \"the thing that makes cleansers sudsy\"). The most common surfactants, and the ones you may have heard of are SLS and SLES (sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate). These ingredients work by binding to the lipids (oils such as jojoba oil or silicones like dimethicone) and then being whisked away by their water-loving properties. Once mixed with water, surfactant molecules cluster together into little spheres known as micelles. Some surfactants molecular size allows them to penetrate deeper into the skin (namely SLS), where they can bind to skin cells. As you can imagine, this is very irritating to skin, and is what causes the eventual drying that you may experience after using some products.\n\nSo by increasing the size of these molecules or adding additional ingredients, we get a gentler cleanser.\n\nIf you've hung out in any beauty circle, you've probably also heard chatter of pH - \"What is the pH of that cleanser? Have you tried the CosRx Low pH Cleanser?\". The pH value of a cleanser can have an impact on how harsh your cleanser is on your skin as well, and simply put, it's because the surface of your skin is naturally pretty acidic.\n\nGoing back to Chemistry class really quickly, you'll probably remember something called the \"pH Scale.\"\n\nThings on the left side of the scale (1-6) are considered acidic. Things on the right side (8-14) are considered basic or alkaline. And of course, there is what is considered neutral, or pH 7. Skin has a pH of around 5.5, but becomes more basic the further down into the dermis you go, reaching a pH of about 7. Why is this important, you may be asking? Well, if you think back to your high school Chemistry course, you may have remembered the good ol' baking soda and vinegar reaction. When this reaction -- called an acid-base reaction -- occurs, the baking soda and vinegar exchange atoms and form different compounds, namely water and carbon dioxide. This is because bases are compounds that generally want to donate atoms and acids are compounds that generally want to accept atoms.\n\nAs skin comes in contact with other ingredients, even water, the pH temporarily raises and other compounds are created. Fatty acids (read: acidic components) of the skin are removed.\n\nHealthy skin can usually re-balance itself within an hour or so. Some skin takes longer to do this, especially skin that is prone to irritation, such as skin with acne, rosacea, eczema, or psoriasis. This is why your boyfriend can cleanse his face with a Dial soap bar and have glowing skin an hour later, while you're busily slathering on layer after layer of moisturizer.\n\nUsing a cleanser that is closer to our skin's natural pH is the obvious solution to this problem, and most modern cleansers are formulated much better than those of the past.\n\nSo now you're probably asking yourself: *Well, how can I test the pH of the cleanser I would like to buy? And how do I know the surfactant isn't going to irritate my skin?*\n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate.\n\nYou should also look for moisturizers, like oils, ceramides, cholesterol, and humectants (water-binding ingredients such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, or squalane). Avoid saponified oils (please don't use Dr. Bronner's on your skin) and bar soap.\n\nNow I know you're asking: What about oil cleansers then?\n\n---\n\n**Oil Cleansers**\n\nWhat if I told you that your grandmother was ahead of the game?\n\nNearly all of us have seen a tub of Pond's Cold Cream hanging out in our grandmother's bathroom or on her vanity. You might've seen her dab some all over her skin and wipe away all of her makeup with a tissue. She may have sworn by it as the thing that kept her looking young, and she's not entirely wrong.\n\nI like to think of oil cleansers as being broken down into two types of cleansers -- wipe-off cleansers like your grandmother's Pond's, and emulsifying cleansers like the translucent oil cleansers that come in a pump or tub.\n\nThe former -- wipe-off cleansers -- are the most common mixtures in the cosmetics industry. They are usually simple mixtures of oil and water, and are high in water content, which makes them inexpensive.\n\nThey spread easily and often leave an oily or richly moisturized feeling behind. They're typically purchased by people with mature skin, but are a great alternative for people with dry skin.\n\nThe latter -- emulsifying cleansers -- are also mixtures of oil and water, but are higher in oil content, which makes them more expensive. They contain emulsifiers that bind well to water, which allows them to rinse away in water.\n\nThe benefit of these cleansers is there is no real \"sudsing\" action on the skin. Indeed many of them can actually feel \"moisturizing\" due to their ingredient makeup. They are also excellent for breaking down make-up and other waterproof things, such as mascara, due to the high oil content.\n\nWhen picking out an oil-cleanser, look for shortened ingredient lists. Don't be swayed by extracts or other frills that will wash away. The oil itself will be the biggest point of irritation (or not) for your skin, so don't be afraid of \"boring\" oils like mineral oil or petrolatum, which is one of the blandest, most non-reactive molecules around.\n\nJust one more to go...\n\n---\n\n**Micellar Cleansers**\n\nMicellar water is quite literally made up of micelles, or the molecular bunches of surfactants that group up, their water-loving butts faced outwards. These larger bunches of molecules, diluted in combinations of water and hydrating ingredients (such as glycerin), are the most mild of cleansers.\n\nThe percentage of surfactant to other ingredients is generally so low that micellar water does not need to be washed away. This allows the hydrating ingredients, such as glycerin, to stay on the skin after the debris has been removed.\n\nThis makes micellar water ideal for sensitive skin or prepping the skin for product application, when cleansing with a standard cleanser and water will be too drying.\n\n---\n\n**All Wrapped Up**\n\nSo what does this all mean? Here are some general skin cleanser guidelines to follow:\n\n* **Cleanse your skin at least once a day.** At the end of the day, your skin not only has a build-up of oils, but also debris and particulates in the air.\n* **Don't pile it on.** Your non-sudsing cleanser does not need to suds to work.\n* **Two-step cleanse for removing make-up.** Most make-up is waterproof and does not easily cleanse away. Use an oil cleanser to break down the make-up and remove it.\n* **Use cottons to remove cream cleansers like Pond's.** The friction will help to remove grime and dirt. Splash with water after to remove any leftover emulsifiers.\n* **Use cool water when cleansing.** Hot water can make surfactants penetrate deeper by reducing the size of the micelles, which is why your hot shower is more irritating and drying to your skin than the less-fun cooler shower.\n* **Moisturize.** Even water strips away the valuable fatty acids in your skin. Using a moisturizer on your skin after will help your skin to re-balance itself quicker.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Kind of Stephen](https://kindofstephen.com/)\n* [DermaScope](https://www.dermascope.com/ingredients/surfactants-and-emulsifiers)\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n",

All my little texture bumps I always had along my jawline and cheek disappeared and the red marks I had (I assumed they were acne scars) also disappeared. \n\nI started wearing makeup again this week since I was allowed to remove the tape and after 2 days I noticed the texture coming back. It’s now the end of the week and the smoothness is gone and all the texture I used to have, is back. The red marks are also back. This makes me sad because I love wearing makeup but I also kinda feel relieved because I have an answer as to why my skin looked the way it did\n\nEdit: my skincare routine is this:\n\nAM:\n1.

    "body": "It’s been a long journey, that.. honestly, has killed my self esteem, but i can safely say that i’m way happier now with my skin than ever before.\n\nDisclaimer: i have only purged a little, a few whiteheads here and there. \nAlso, the reason i’ve started tret has been an acne flare up from a destroyed barrier caused by BHA abuse.\n\nThere’s a lot to say and i’ll try to do it briefly. \nAll my life i have battled texture issues, with inflammatory acne in my teen years (which solved itself). \nI wanted to get rid of that texture and had no skincare knowledge, so i bought and used The Ordinary 2% BHA and boy, did i abuse that 😂 i was using it 2 times daily and applying more than i should have and that has led to a destroyed barrier and pimples with which i have struggled for what felt like an eternity.\n\nStarted tret and things took a great turn in a few months (acne almost subsided completely) but i kept having comedones and a pimple here and there. \nOver time i’ve discovered i was sensitive to fatty alcohols and.. while eliminating them has helped tremendously, i was still getting the occasional cystic pimple. Started azelaic acid 15% (Skinoren) and while it helped as well, it didnt eliminate acne. Plus, it was drying and irritating my already sensitive skin. I couldnt use it daily, only every-other-day.\n\nNow here is where the fun starts.\n\nAround 6 months ago i’ve started oil cleansing with a completely non-comedogenic oil (on incidecoder/skincarisma/wimj it had no comedogenic ingredients apart from squalane, but pretty far down on the list) and the acne started to flare up again. I was doing only the oil cleanse because my skin couldnt handle the double cleanse..\n\n..but then again:\n\nit should’ve been alright, it had almost no comedogenic ingredients and the cleanser emulsified very well.\n\nThis got me thinking. \n\nThe main ingredient was capric/caprylic triglycerides. It’s a coconut oil derrivative and while not supposedly comedogenic, anecdotal evidence suggests it is causing for some people at least something which can be described as an acne-like inflammatory reaction. \nI’ve then discovered it’s in my tret and also in the azelaic acid (used as a base in both). \nSo..I wanted to test the hypothesis. \nI’ve bought a serum that had 0 comedogenic ingredients - Ducray melascreen depigmenting serum - yet had capric triglycerides in the first 2 ingredients. And my acne flared up..badly..\nSo i’ve eliminated capric triglycerides and even though it’s too soon to tell, my skin has been feeling amazing. \n\nSimplified my routine by removing azelaic acid and started tretinoin 0.1% (for the past week), the single one i could find that is accessible and doesnt have capric triglycerides or other high-comedogenicity ingredients. I’m expecting the tret uglies in the following weeks, so this is like the calm before the storm 😂\n\n\nAm: \n- water cleansing\n- Cosrx AHA/BHA clarifying treatment toner (once a week)\n- Ducray melascreen spf 50 light cream\n\nPm: \n- Clinique take the day off cleansing oil\n- LRP Toleriane Dermallergo Fluide\n- Menarini A-Ret Tretinoin gel 0.1% (every 2 days - in 2 weeks will bump to every other day)\n\nI’ve tried to incorporate serums/other actives/more hydration but i found it only leads to more irritation and/or breakouts. \nI am going to use a gentle water based cleanser in the future - aveeno calm+restore nourishing oat cleanser - as a used-when-needed morning cleanse or double cleanse and also hemp seed oil after the LRP moisturiser on the days that i dont use tret, for extra hydration and oil control. \n\nP.S. the lighting was really good and my skin was really nice this day, so take it with a grain of salt! 😅 if all goes well in the future and there are no more comedones/pimples, i’ll let you know that my hypothesis was a success.",

I've truly tried it all: Amlactin, Cerave, Eucerin, skinfix, different acids, physical exfoliation, squalane, different oils, more sun, fish oil pills, diet changes, etc. And I give every new product a three-month test window to give it time to “work.” No success whatsoever. Just when I thought it was getting slightly better, it worsened the past week. I have a severe case of kp and as someone with fair skin, the blotchiness, redness, and bumpy texture are so obvious. I haven't worn a short-sleeved shirt or a tank top in public in YEARS. \n\nI'm so envious of girls with clear body skin. Every time I see them on screen or in person, I can't help but wish I had their body skin. Not only is this ruining my confidence, but it prevents me from being in relationships or being intimate with someone. I'm so so so worried that my potential partner would be put off by my skin. A comment made by a classmate when I was like 11 (I'm 19 now) about the “acne” on my arms has haunted me to this day. \n\nAs one last call for help, has anyone been successful? What is your routine? I know kp can’t be eliminated; I just want to reduce mine even if it's slightly.",

Of course, that is so much more easily said than done. \n\nIf a minor skin blemish is ruining your life, that might indicate that you base the majority of your self worth and self concept on what others think of you and how well you embody the feminine ideal of beauty.

The ugliest person alive is worth the exact same as the top supermodel. Your flesh suit has bumps. It's ok. \n\n\n\nThat being said, my KP completely clears up in the summer if I tan.

    "body": "Hey y’all,\n\nI wanted to review all the Isntree products I have tried over the past few years in one place for anyone who is looking into the brand. I find them to be basically unrivaled when it comes to ingredient lists, and have been tempted into buying essentially their entire line as a result. I get rewards through winning contests at work, and bought many of these in the 50% off sale on Stylevana, so I tried these gradually over the course of three years.\n\nI am at the halfway point between white and tan skin, I have dry skin in the winter/oily skin in the summer, and you’ll find my routine below:\n\nAM:\n\n1. Rinse with water\n2. Hydrating toner/essence\n3. Fermented essence\n4. Niacinamide serum\n5. Gel cream\n6. Sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\n1. Oil cleanse\n2. Second cleanse\n3. AM steps 2-5\n4. Heavy Cream\n\nI have a bias against serums in the way that they are less product for more money, so I will hold it against them if they're not justifying that. I also strongly dislike silicones, which is something else that other people won't necessarily share.\n\nI’m going to format it by product type, and will rate it on a scale of 1-5. You can assume I will at some point probably repurchase a product (on sale) unless otherwise noted. I have reviewed some of these before, so I will be using a bulk of what I said before on those with added updates. One final note is that I don’t fully remember some of these to give a full review, so some won’t have scores but rather descriptions and impressions. Alright, let’s dive in!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCreams:\n\nOnion Newpair Gel Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis is a great option and one of their best moisturizers - I am shallow so I won’t lie about being obsessed with the slight purple hue. I’ve seen it retail from $10 USD all the way up to $40, and I have no idea why haha. It is not a holy grail hyperpigmentation treatment, but it is fantastic at evening out skin tone and giving you a nice healthy glow. It has 71% Onion Extract as well as Niacinamide, which are the two main ingredients I would purchase this for. While it has tranexamic acid, a vitamin c derivative, and a bunch of other great ingredients; they are probably all well below .1%. This does dry down pretty quickly, so it makes a fantastic daily moisturizer under sunscreen. What I love about this gel cream is that your face could be violently wet, but this would still apply like a normal moisturizer. It absorbs moisture and locks in whatever you’ve done before better than most, which is a compliment I’d pay to a lot of their gel creams. I wish this one didn’t have dimethicone, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nC-Niacin Toning Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a very similar cream to the Onion Newpair, but instead of a light purple, it’s a vibrant orange. Trade onions for sea buckthorn, and you’d get this product. This is better to me, though, because of the fact it is their cheapest moisturizer almost at all times, the lovely yet natural smell, and it is the best glow booster I have ever used. It dries down so well, but it will leave you with a glowy, hydrated complexion while staying dry to the touch. It is glass skin in a tube, essentially. The blend of oils, addition of beta glucan, and removal of dimethicone just overall makes this their best cream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCica Relief Cream\n\n1.5/5\n\nThis is a strange addition to their catalog and it seems like they’ve phased out the entire line, perhaps to relaunch it as they do. It is one of those creams that further emulsifies on contact with water, so it becomes impossible to use if you use the wet skin method. It is legitimately impossible to blend in without white streaks. The ingredient list is impressive with basically everything you could ask for (especially the peptides whew), but its lack of utility would never make me feel comfortable recommending it. It is also piss-poor at locking in moisture because of this, which is again pretty point defeating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Moist Cream\n\nImpressions: I did rate this in a recent point somewhat poorly, but in retrospect it really is a decent cream. I find that you need to apply it to a dryer face as it will end up not very significant on a wet face. I don’t find I have this issue with the aqua, but for this one I remember just not being able to feel any kind of locked in feeling I like to feel from moisturizers. I’m going to try it again one day, maybe this summer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Aqua Cream\n\n4/5 \n\nI like this cream a lot, and have already repurchased it. I rate it lower because it is both not significant enough to be used alone most of the time, while also leaving a pretty glowy finish if used alone. I will typically use this at night before another moisturizer, and will use a more natural-finish sunscreen if used during the day. I find this to be intensely hydrating in a way most moisturizers fall short, however, and will stay loyal to this just for the punch it packs in that department. I will often combine it with squalane or hemisqualane to give it an additional oomph, but this is for sure a go-to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Water Sleeping Mask\n\n5/5\n\nThis is an all-time great. They struck gold with this formulation, and I hope they never stop making it. I have bought at least 15 of these, and considering how much I like to try new things, something becoming a staple means something haha. I would describe this as a goopy occlusive containing almost no occlusives that somehow just works. If you use it as your final step, your skin will be well protected and wake up so hydrated. If you want to use it as a serum, it absolutely smashes all other hydrating serums and you only need a little. I will alternate between both using it as a serum and an occlusive depending on the weather. One drawback is that it is so THICK that you do need to melt it down in your hands sometimes depending on how much you’re using.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChestnut PHA Clear Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nAnother fantastic product that is actually super new. They used to have a PHA sleeping mask that caught them in hot water because it had some fragrant extract (lol), but this updated version adds chestnut extract and removes any fragrance. According to their insta, they wanted this to be more of a daily moisturizer akin to the onion and c-niacin creams, and I’d say they mostly succeeded in doing this. The ingredient list is another humble brag, and I’d say overall this has helped me so much with daily usage. The benefits of getting minor exfoliation every single day kind of speak for themselves. I will say that this doesn’t dry down as well as their other daily moisturizers, but I would just use less of it if this bothers you. I also find it doesn’t “lock in” as well as some moisturizers do, but having a PHA 5% gel cream is just too useful for me to not love it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMugwort Spot Gel Cream\n\n4/5\n\nI’m gonna be honest, I find it suspicious that this doesn’t smell like mugwort even a little bit. I could add a drop of One Thing’s Mugwort toner and make this thing so fragrant, so I am just a bit confused there haha. This is very, very similar to the onion and c-niacin creams in the way that it locks in everything really well and dries down quickly. It doesn’t have Niacinamide, which is a bit of a drawback overall to me, but if you are one of the B3 haters out there, then this would be the one for you. It does a great job at reducing redness and was a great medicinal treatment of a burn I got recently. I’d recommend this cream up and down, but it is typically just a bit too expensive for what it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYam Root Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a unique product in their line as it is their only moisturizer outside of the HA sleeping mask that aims to be heavy. It has 57% yam root extract with a bunch of other great, soothing/brightening extracts like rice, soybean, and oat. It also has 5 ceramides and cholesterol, which isn’t a common feature for them. This does dry down pretty well, but not nearly as well as the others, seemingly by design. It applies like a luxury cream and was so similar to Then I Met You’s Renewing Rich Beauty Cream that I just put the rest of the cream in that packaging and mixed it with hemisqualane to provide even more moisture. This is their best moisturizer for people with dry skin IMO\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF50+ PA++++\n\n4.25/5\n\nI recently reviewed this on here and gave it a worse score and a mediocre review. I would like to publicly apologize. This is for sure not a summer sunscreen, but I find I can wear it almost all year round and look incredibly healthy without eating a single vegetable. (This is a joke please stay well nourished.) It is so oily on me if used in humid weather, and is one of the more emollient sunscreens I’ve used in Korean and Japanese beauty. In the winter I see that as a plus! It is a runny but significant emulsion type liquid, spreads really well and evenly, and is an easy sunscreen to reapply as it will never pill for me. Overall a big fan!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToners:\n\nGreen Tea Fresh Toner\n\n2.5/5\n\nI find that this toner didn’t do much of anything. I love the experience of using it as it smells amazing, but it has this slipperiness to it that I couldn’t really get behind. It is purported to have a complex that helps with oil control, but I don’t find this to be something the product does well. It has a series of botanical extracts, beta glucan, hydrolyzed HA, and allatoin. It is very no frills, and something I’d recommend if green tea works well for you. For me, this didn’t hydrate much at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Toner Plus\n\n5/5\n\nThis is essentially a top-quality hyaluronic acid serum packaged as a toner and sold at an excellent price. I will forever return to it because if used sparingly like a serum, it can last you a year. It’s gorgeously goopy, smells just a bit funky, and will at times foam when used in large quantities and allowed to lather on the skin. I have been told this is not a red flag, and will pass this vague assurance onto you. Both this and the normal HA toner are composed of 50% HA aqueous solution, but this one has 5 types of HA rather than the 3 in the standard. There are a host of typical botanical extracts like centella, birch juice, rosemary, and licorice. Sodium PCA, beta glucan, and panthenol round out a beautiful ingredient list and a super hydrating product I have already repurchased. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHyaluronic Acid Toner\n\n4/5\n\nThis is a basic hydrating toner, and doesn’t try to be anything more. No active ingredients, no frills, just a solution of 50% hyaluronic acid composed of three different kinds, other humectants like glycerin and beta glucan; and some barrier supporting ingredients like panthenol and sodium PCA. It’s slightly more viscous than water, so it is far more dispensable than the plus version. As far as the effect of it goes, it is expectedly super hydrating, and softens the skin upon application. All of the other toners they have are like upgraded versions of this, so I won’t repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnion Newpair Essence Toner\n\n5/5\n\nThis is the perfect toner in my opinion. I often look for and extract based as opposed to water, 2-4% niacinamide, watery texture, and a decent amount of humectants; and this delivers on all in spades. I enjoy the purple color, and do find that the onion extract supports the product in a way that yields brightness and evens out skin tone. It has a skin-softening effect once applied, and feels like a burst of hydration. It is overall somewhat basic, but it succeeds. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYam Root Vegan Milk Toner\n\nImpressions: I dropped this product in the sink while it was full of water, so I threw it away after only a few uses. It is 80% yam root extract, and is otherwise what I would describe as a Cream Skin Refiner with a much more complete ingredient list. As far as ingredients, it has a well-selected series of oils like meadowfoam seed, argan, sunflower, and macadamia; a milk replacement themed list (lol) of extracts like oat, almond, and rice; and some barrier supporting ingredients like panthenol, ceramide NP, and cholesterol. This is a top tier milky toner, and I enjoyed it while I had it haha\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnion Newpair Clear Pad\n\n5/5\n\nI very much enjoyed using these in the morning instead of rinsing my face with water. The pads are soft, somewhat easy to separate, and are adequately soaked in product. The ingredient list is a bit simpler, and in my opinion better than the toner as it mostly gets rid of the botanical extracts to focus on the barrier-supporting ingredients like Panthenol, hyaluronic acids, allantoin and adenosine. The tranexamic acid and vitamin c derivative are also higher up on this ingredient list, but that doesn’t mean anything necessarily. Once done using this, my skin is super glowy and healthy looking to the point where I don’t know if I need to do anything else. These are often super expensive, like the rest of this line; but you will be able to find everything here for cheap on Stylevana at some point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSerums:\n\n(their new serum packaging is super ugly, will try not to mention this again)\n\nC-Niacin Toning Ampoule\n\n3.5/5\n\nThis would get a perfect 5 out of 5 from me if it were less watery. From my perspective, serums have a certain responsibility to have a certain viscosity to them so that they feel a bit more significant and spreadable on the skin. This felt like a toner packaged in 50ml serum packaging, if that makes sense. Apart from that, this is a top tier product. It focuses on superfoods like sea buckthorn, pumpkin, and turmeric; while having a great ingredient list featuring niacinamide at the top. It is a bit too basic for a serum, for me, as I typically will only buy serums for a buffet type product. This would get a 5/5 as a toner\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreen Tea Fresh Serum\n\n1.5/5\n\nI found this serum to be super oily, and it broke me out. I really couldn’t tell you why when looking at the ingredient list, but I ended up using it on my body because I just really didn’t like it. This has a great ingredient list, but again I just hold serums to higher standards (as we should) and this is fairly basic for them. Again, if a green tea-based oily serum appeals to you, however, I would definitely recommend this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpot Saver Mugwort Ampoule:\n\nImpressions: I ended up just combining this somewhat early on with a One Thing toner and using it on my body, so I don’t deserve to rate this. I find this to be mid as far as mugwort products go, and that is overall the extract my skin fucks with the most. It has a perfectly serviceable ingredient list with beta glucan, panthenol, and ceramides all combining to create what is in the end an effective serum. I would recommend One Thing’s Artemisa Toner over this, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCleansers:\n\nGreen Tea Fresh Cleanser:\n\n5/5\n\nI love this cleanser so much. It smells insanely good, has this amazing goopy texture, and it has tea leaves in it. I find that they don’t do much exfoliation, and I honestly never see them again after cleansing it off. It is surprisingly gentle for being so thorough. This feels like a luxury cleanser, and is better than almost every luxury cleanser I’ve tried for cheap. Count me as a big fan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnion Newpair Cleansing Foam:\n\n4.25/5\n\nThis was my HG cleanser for a while, and while I wouldn’t buy it again, I will describe it to identify why that is and why it might work for you. I have water that rinses cleansers off well, but when I go to other people’s places I find that film-leaving cleansers will be difficult to completely remove, which bothers me. This has your typical whipped creamy cleanser texture, with a slight purple tint. I am not a fan of this type of cleanser as it is everywhere in Asian Beauty, it a bit stripping, and is somewhat difficult to completely remove. If you are looking for a thorough creamy cleanser with added brightening benefits, then this is it. Final note: it smells like caramel corn. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nChestnut LHA Jelly Cleansing Oil\n\n1/5\n\nI would consider this something of a formulation failure in the way that it is almost impossible to get an oil texture out of this. Naturium also has a first step cleanser like this: it just spreads like a gel. You have to really rub it in, and I need to have some slip to my cleanser as I have skin that is sensitive to rubbing, so this wasn’t something I could really use. I also can’t imagine it is super adept at removing makeup as a result.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYam Root Vegan Milk Cleanser:\n\n4/5\n\nThis is a great cleanser for people who have sensitive skin, but only on wet skin. I used this as a second step cleanser when I wanted a non-foaming option, and it always left my skin so soft and well-cleansed. I don’t have too much purpose for it as I would prefer other non-foaming options purchased locally, but this is the best non-foaming AB cleanser I’ve used by far. It does, however, fail at being a makeup remover/first step as it is truly like a cream. It just sinks in. You can’t get any slip on it because your skin is drinking it up. Apart from this, I do recommend it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverything Else:\n\nChestnut BHA 2% Clear Liquid:\n\n4.5/5\n\nThere are so many BHA liquids on the market, but this is a really solid one if you are looking. It is a simple ingredient list with 3 types of hyaluronic acid, allantoin, and glycerin. I have really not much to add - it is watery and thin, sinks in quickly, and is super friendly to sensitive skin. Peach Slice’s has the best version of this, though, IMO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChestnut AHA 8% Clear Essence\n\n4.5/5\n\nLike the BHA, this is one of the best options for the type of exfoliant it is. It is a massive upgrade from the previous version as it removes the fragrance and adds the chestnut extract, which I do enjoy. I find that when I use this, my pores look so clean and healthy. It has 4% both glycolic and lactic acids, which I enjoy as most multi-AHA exfoliants are mostly composed of glycolic acid with a low concentration of any others present. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMugwort Calming Clay Mask\n\n4/5\n\nI find clay masks almost all the same, so this doesn’t get altogether too much praise from me in the way that it’s very similar to other products. However, it is the best clay mask I’ve used as far as experience goes as it smells really nice (IMO), has large enough granules to not feel like a scrub, can be easily combined with serums or spot treatments (it will usually get really creamy like mint ice cream), and dries down quickly. I love the tugging/tightening sensation of clay masks, and I will say this one does deliver.\n\nSo that’s it! I clearly love this brand. I want to acknowledge that people aren’t always big fans because they use preservatives that have not historically yielded the desired results. I have never had a product go bad on me, and I haven’t experience a product becoming less effective quickly. That doesn’t mean this hasn’t happened, though; as I have seen a lot of people on this sub mention it. I don’t know where Isntree is at with this, but it hasn’t impacted my experience in any capacity.\n\nIn looking at my reviews, I definitely prefer their toners and creams over everything else. If you have any questions for me, I am here! Thank you for reading.",

    "body": "Hi again, AB!! So I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/) talking about how most companies that claim to have ceramides actually use 2 ceramide \"soups\" basically, of the purpoted \"ideal\" ratio of ceramides/fatty acids, of which contain actually very, very little ceramides. Basically, it's for marketing and such a low % won't really do much. But the research for actually using an efficient amount of ceramides is apparently ***very*** good for barrier repair.\n\nSO I was severely disappoinT in my beloved CeraVe and other things. HOWEVER, I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/celc5y/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu3j2mw/?context=3) conversation between the OP of that post and someone else:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Yes, the technology behind Atopalm is the same behind Zerafite, which Dr. Baumann believes in and sells through her practice. The research and invention originally came out of Korea, so I am not surprised Korean brands are using it.**  \n>  \n>\\-  [u/nocloudstoday](https://www.reddit.com/user/nocloudstoday/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhaaat???? Ceramides for skincare was **invented in Korea**?? Idk, should I be surprised ?\n\nAnd:\n\n>**Neopharm & Amorepacific have their own patented, lab-made ceramides that have been heavily researched.**  \n>  \n>\\- u/[royalsincognito](https://www.reddit.com/user/royalsincognito/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting! I'm able to read some Korean so I looked into this on Korean sites + Korean reviews.\n\nSo it looks like [**Neopharm**](http://www.neopharm.co.kr/en/brand/brand_atopalm.do) owns these brands: **Atopalm, RealBarrier, Zeroid, Derma:B.** And [**Amore Pacific** owns many brands](https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands.html), but I have only seen \"ceramide\" products so far in these brands: **Illiyoon, Aestura & Mamonde.**\n\nI was like, why does this sound familiar? Then I realized that I've seen them ranked very high on Hwahae (Korean beauty review & ranking app) many times before!\n\nNeopharm's ceramide technology is called **\"MLE\"** and Amore Pacific's is **Ceramide PC-102 and PC-104.**\n\nPersonally, I like the look of ZEROID & AESTURA, because their products don't seem to contain fragrance. *(Fragrance can be a trigger for very, very sensitive skin types, but it seems the majority of people tolerate it pretty well in their skincare? However, I have seen derms say it can become problematic the longer you use it. YMMV. For what it's worth, I read many reviews from sensitive-skinned folks saying the fragranced ones never bothered their skin & they love it. Many posted pictures of putting the creams on their babies.)* But they're super hard to find online as of now!\n\nFrom all the reviews I'm reading, these brands and Illiyoon ato products are what is recommended by Korean dermatologists and skin care clinics.

So, good choice for those of us whose budgets may not allow the more pricier options.\n\nOilier/combo skin types did not like to use it on their face, while the dry & sensitive-skinned folks loved them. No mention of the lotion not working under makeup. I came across 1 review though saying that they experienced pilling when they used the cream under makeup.\n\nMany people emphasized that they like how light and non-greasy these feel, yet very moisturizing. Some oily types said it felt too heavy. Some said during the summer, they felt it doesn't absorb as well (keep in mind that Korea is EXTREMELY humid during the summer though. Like, you would be drenched in sweat as soon as you stepped out of the shower -\\_- and you'd just be all sweaty and nasty alllllllllllllllll summer it was dISCUSTING) but they still agreed with other reviewers saying it absorbed well during colder months (it gets really cold & snowy in Korea during winter).\n\nRave reviews up & down from dry skinned folks. Some drier skinned folks said it's not enough for winter, however. Illiyoon often goes on sale in Korea and people like that they get can it for like, half off. 1 or 2 reviews saying they had some sort of an allergic reaction. As always, YMMV.\n\nI hope this helps some of you!\n\nYou don't have to read the below info, but I thought it may be helpful for those of you with damaged skin barriers. My skin used to be severely damaged too so I feel your struggle.

There’s a lot in the dermatological literature on fragrance, but that’s because people who go to the trouble of seeing a dermatologist are those who have serious skin issues. It’s estimated that less than 5% of the population will have allergic reactions to fragrance on their skin. It’s great that there are more fragrance-free products available for people with sensitive skin, but for the rest of us, fragrance isn’t an issue (damage from [“invisible inflammation” from fragrance](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/sensitive-skin/_/why-fragrance-free-products-are-best-for-everyone) isn’t supported by any convincing evidence).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BARRIER REPAIR SUPERSTAR? UREA:**\n\nI'm particularly impressed by Zeroid's new [5% urea cream](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284). It also has panthenol, centella, madecassoside, allantoin, bisabolol and physosterols.\n\nNow, there's SO much mumbo jumbo about efficient skincare, but so much of it is marketing bullshit and there are actually **very few** ingredients (compared to everything else out there) that are scientifically proven to REALLY WORK on our skin. As OP mentions in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu354ub/?context=3) thread, urea is a severely underrated ingredient:\n\n>The one thing that comes to mind, actually, is **urea**. **Of all of the ingredients researched for barrier repair, urea probably has the most consistent and longest track record for repairing the barrier.** You see it a lot in pharmacies in Europe. It's not sexy, but it's often very effective - for very impaired skin suffering from everything from eczema and psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. I'd recommend trying a 5% cream and seeing how that works for you. The bad news is that there are not a lot of options on the US market (which is not bad news if you happen to be somewhere else!).\n\nUrea is a natural moisturizing factor (NMF) that exist naturally on our skin, it's a mild exfoliator in high concentrations, and it's also a penetration enhancer, meaning that it's also used to deliver actives into the skin better. Now, there are a lot of other penetration enhancers, used both in medicine and the beauty industry, such as dimethyl isosorbide (DMI),  isopropyl myristate, propylene glycols/ethoxydiglycol, emu oil/MCTs (fractionated coconut oil or caprylic/capric triglyceride)/other oils, oleic acid (a component in many oils), etc.\n\nBut AFAIK, the reason a lot of them work is because they disrupt the skin barrier long enough to deliver the actives (except perhaps, some oils? Oleic acid has been shown to be disruptive tho. Apparently there are studies that show [emu oil](https://gardenofwisdom.com/products/emu-oil) is able to penetrate very deeply into the skin bc of the tiny-ness of the molecules or some shit. Which is why it's used with herbs/medicine a lot). I'm not a derm or a chemist, but from what I've been reading from the [chemistscorner.com](https://chemistscorner.com) forum, **this isn't always a good thing**. But I have not come across anything that says urea may be damaging. Quite the opposite.\n\n(Mineral oil is also another penetration enhancer, and a wonderful, stable moisturizer that will not go rancid like plant oils do **-** [**squalene on your skin oxidizing leads to acne**](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/)**,** also [confirmed by Lab Muffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjKDj9plaI) \\- coming in close to petrolatum for reducing Trans Epidermal Water Loss. And petrolatum is pretty much irrefutably, scientifically proven to be the #1ingredient in reducing TEWL. Mineral oil feels quite heavy, but it's used a lot as it doesn't have too many other chemicals in it to cause skin reactions.)\n\nFor people with eczema who use colloidal oatmeal creams to soothe skin, make sure the active concentration is 1% or higher, not just claimed \"so and so lotion with natural oatmeal to reduce itching!\", because\n\n>[in order to be listed as an active ingredient, it must be included in a formula at a minimum 0.007 percent concentration, or 0.003 percent minimum concentration if combined with mineral oil.](https://www.mydadthechemist.com/reviews/best-oatmeal-eczema-lotions/)\n\n\\^I'm not 100% sure what this means, but I just know that this is probably bc mineral oil's ability to help things penetrate.\n\n**Don't confuse** urea with diazolidinyl urea and imidazolidinyl urea btw, which are preservatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some moisturizers with urea:**\n\n(I will list 10% ones here, but I personally don't go above 5% because of the exfoliating effects of urea for my face. It may be mild at 10% & below, but I still don't want to risk it as I use a lot of other actives and have problematic skin. But for those who WANT exfoliation and don't get along with AHAs, it may be another option.)\n\nI know Hadalabo Premium lotion is mentioned a lot, but 3% urea is not going to perform as well as concentrations above that (chemistscorner forums). I'm not entirely sure the difference between [Hydroxyethyl Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea) and regular urea is, but some say it's the same thing just different name and some say it functions more as a humectant rather than being skin-identical. Idk. But if you count it, then there are more options, like [Gold Bond Men's Essentials](https://www.target.com/p/gold-bond-men-s-essentials-hand-face-and-body-lotions-14-5oz/-/A-14507966), or the [Strength & Resilience Lotion](https://www.target.com/p/gold-bond-strength-and-resilienc-hand-and-body-lotions-13oz/-/A-16453690) and [Unscented Diabetic Lotion](https://www.target.com/p/unscented-gold-bond-diabetic-hand-and-body-lotions-13oz/-/A-15025375) (EDIT: AND [Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion for face](https://www.target.com/p/cetaphil-moisturizing-lotion-unscented-16oz/-/A-10300852)) for fragrance-free options.\n\n[Triderma Eczema Fast Healing Face % Body Cream](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991)\\- not sure %, but it looks pretty high.

The ingredients for the lotion are (or at least were last time I checked) identical to their UreaRepair PLUS 10% Urea Lotion. I asked Eucerin if they could confirm the percentage of the RRL, but they declined, saying they only disclose what they legally have to. **Udderly Smooth** also makes products with urea, including at 10% and 20%. At the moment I use the Eucerin Advanced Repair on my face daily, but use the Udderly Smooth Extra Care Cream (with 10%) in the cooler months. I use the Roughness Relief on my body (I have KP on my arms and legs, and urea's been *immensely* helpful for it), but found it *way* too greasy for my face. (Again, though, that's a personal review, so YMMV.)\n\n(Edit 2: Realized I need more coffee, got Eucerin's Intensive Repair, Advanced Repair, and Roughness Relief mixed up in my head. Fixed now.)",

Basically, it's for marketing and such a low % won't really do much\n\nSo do these products by Neopharm and AmorePacific actually have enough of the patented ceramides to do anything significant?  I'm a bit skeptical given the almost industry-wide practice of not putting enough ceramides in OTC skincare products.  Also, without seeing the studies we really don't know what they're claiming the patented ceramide complexes do as far as barrier repair or how they actually performed (or if the testing was even valid/non-biased).",

    "body": "Hey y’all,\n\nThis is gonna be a really long one, so I’ll try to keep introductions brief. I love trying new things for the purpose of data, and sometimes I actually sit down and share it lol. I am going to go through what I look for in a moisturizer, my routine, and my skin type before getting to the reviews. The longer ones come first because when I wrote out this list, I decided to do it by brand, so the brands I had the most experience with ended up coming first.\n\nFor a moisturizer, it’s often difficult to nail down what works best. I have normal skin that leans combo or dry depending on the weather, so when I use a moisturizer I want something that will be significant, but not too emollient. For a daily moisturizer, I prefer something that dries down quickly, so that the time between that and my sunscreen can be minimized. There needs to be a certain thickness to it, though. If it applies like a serum, it’s a no for me. In addition, while I love when it dries down quickly, a lot of creams designed with this in mind end up taking away more than they add in terms of moisture. Ingredients like dimethicone, silicone, and hydrogenated lecithin leave me oily yet dry - I can tolerate them depending on the cream, but if it is a drawback I’ll mention it.\n\nMy routine is as follows:\n\nAM:\n\n1. Light cleanse (nothing, water, toning pads, or Sanskrit Saponins by NIOD)\n2. Toner\n3. Serum\n4. Daily moisturizer\n5. Sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\n1. Double cleanse\n2. Toner\n3. Serum\n4. Daily Moisturizer\n5. Treatment\n6. Occlusive\n\nI try to stay fragrance free, use as much Niacinamide as I can, and cover Ceramides, Peptides, Beta Glucan, and Panthenol through the routine I choose. I will be using a 5 point system based on my preferences, so stuff like fragrance being a negative for me is obviously not a negative for everyone.\n\nIsntree’s Onion Newpair Gel Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis is a great option and one of their best moisturizers - I am shallow so I won’t lie about being obsessed with the slight purple hue. I’ve seen it retail from $10 USD all the way up to $40, and I have no idea why haha. It is not a holy grail hyperpigmentation treatment, but it is fantastic at evening out skin tone and giving you a nice healthy glow. It has 71% Onion Extract as well as Niacinamide, which are the two main ingredients I would purchase this for. While it has tranexamic acid, a vitamin c derivative, and a bunch of other great ingredients; they are probably all well below .1%. This does dry down pretty quickly, so it makes a fantastic daily moisturizer under sunscreen. What I love about this gel cream is that your face could be violently wet, but this would still apply like a normal moisturizer. It absorbs moisture and locks in whatever you’ve done before better than most, which is a compliment I’d pay to a lot of their gel creams. I wish this one didn’t have dimethicone, though.\n\nIsntree’s C-Niacin Toning Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a very similar cream to the Onion Newpair, but instead of a light purple, it’s a vibrant orange. Trade onions for sea buckthorn, and you’d get this product. This is better to me, though, because of the fact it is their cheapest moisturizer almost at all times, the lovely yet natural smell, and it is the best glow booster I have ever used. It dries down so well, but it will leave you with a glowy, hydrated complexion while staying dry to the touch. It is glass skin in a tube, essentially. The blend of oils, addition of beta glucan, and removal of dimethicone just overall makes this their best cream.\n\nIsntree’s Cica Relief Cream\n\n1.5/5\n\nThis is a strange addition to their catalog and it seems like they’ve phased out the entire line, perhaps to relaunch it as they do. It is one of those creams that further emulsifies on contact with water, so it becomes impossible to use if you use the wet skin method. It is legitimately impossible to blend in without white streaks. The ingredient list is impressive with basically everything you could ask for (especially the peptides whew), but its lack of utility would never make me feel comfortable recommending it. It is also piss-poor at locking in moisture because of this, which is again pretty point defeating.\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Moist Cream\n\n3.5/5\n\nThis is a serum, essentially. I can’t imagine what the Aqua is like, because the Moist version doesn’t lock anything in on a wet face at all. As always, the ingredient list is fire, but this doesn’t succeed as a moisturizer for me. It’s a pretty cost-effective serum, though!\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Water Sleeping Mask\n\n5/5\n\nThis is an all-time great. They struck gold with this formulation, and I hope they never stop making it. I have bought at least 15 of these, and considering how much I like to try new things, something becoming a staple means something haha. I would describe this as a goopy occlusive containing almost no occlusives that somehow just works. If you use it as your final step, your skin will be well protected and wake up so hydrated. If you want to use it as a serum, it absolutely smashes all other hydrating serums and you only need a little. I will alternate between both using it as a serum and an occlusive depending on the weather. One drawback is that it is so THICK that you do need to melt it down in your hands sometimes depending on how much you’re using. \n\nIsntree’s Chestnut PHA Clear Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nAnother fantastic product that is actually super new. They used to have a PHA sleeping mask that caught them in hot water because it had some fragrant extract (lol), but this updated version adds chestnut extract and removes any fragrance. According to their insta, they wanted this to be more of a daily moisturizer akin to the onion and c-niacin creams, and I’d say they mostly succeeded in doing this. The ingredient list is another humble brag, and I’d say overall this has helped me so much with daily usage. The benefits of getting minor exfoliation every single day kind of speak for themselves. I will say that this doesn’t dry down as well as their other daily moisturizers, but I would just use less of it if this bothers you. I also find it doesn’t “lock in” as well as some moisturizers do, but having a PHA 5% gel cream is just too useful for me to not love it.\n\nIsntree’s Mugwort Spot Gel Cream\n\n4/5\n\nI’m gonna be honest, I find it suspicious that this doesn’t smell like mugwort even a little bit. I could add a drop of One Thing’s Mugwort toner and make this thing so fragrant, so I am just a bit confused there haha. This is very, very similar to the onion and c-niacin creams in the way that it locks in everything really well and dries down quickly. It doesn’t have Niacinamide, which is a bit of a drawback overall to me, but if you are one of the B3 haters out there, then this would be the one for you. It does a great job at reducing redness and was a great medicinal treatment of a burn I got recently. I’d recommend this cream up and down, but it is typically just a bit too expensive for what it is.\n\nIsntree’s Yam Root Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a unique product in their line as it is their only moisturizer outside of the HA sleeping mask that aims to be heavy. It has 57% yam root extract with a bunch of other great, soothing/brightening extracts like rice, soybean, and oat. It also has 5 ceramides and cholesterol, which isn’t a common feature for them. This does dry down pretty well, but not nearly as well as the others, seemingly by design. It applies like a luxury cream and was so similar to Then I Met You’s Renewing Rich Beauty Cream that I just put the rest of the cream in that packaging and mixed it with hemi-squalane to provide even more moisture. This is their best moisturizer for people with dry skin IMO\n\niUNIK’s Propolis Vitamin Sleeping Mask\n\n4.5/5\n\nI love the concept of this cream - both propolis and sea buckthorn joined together. It’s like a trip through the superfoods section of your local supplement shop. This does have niacinamide, but at a probably lower concentration than the other ones above (though who really knows? lol). This one is significant to me because it very firmly locks in everything before it and dries down pretty quickly to a dewy finish. I don’t think it’s the best sleeping mask in the world, but it’s a great daily moisturizer. \n\niUNIK’s Beta Glucan Daily Moisture Cream\n\n3.5/5\n\nY’all already know I love beta glucan, but this cream is the exact same consistency as the HA Moist Cream from Isntree. It is more of a serum for me than a moisturizer. I still loved it in this capacity, but I find their beta glucan serum to be a much better option and just a bit more expensive.\n\niUNIK’s Centella Calming Gel Cream\n\n1/5\n\nThis isn’t even a cream at all, which makes me laugh a little bit. It would make a really watery serum, too. It is a bit fragrant and is essentially an overpriced cica gel. I’d just get Isntree’s Aloe options if you’re looking into this one. I don’t really understand how this is sold as a facial cream.\n\nIlliyoon’s Ceramide ATO Concentrate Cream\n\n3.75/5\n\nThis is of course an HG, but it is a bit drying for winter temps because of the dimethicone/hydrogenated lecithin. Since this dries down while just sitting on your face, it makes your face somehow dry to the touch AND super waxy. The benefits speak for themselves, and it has helped me through some difficult skin eras, but my time of using it has passed. I also think the ceramide beads are a neat trick that does help deliver those ingredients freshly to your skin, they make the product into a bit of a scrub. My skin is sensitive to rubbing/friction over really anything else, so applying this to compromised skin always made me worried even though it helped in the end haha. \n\nIlliyoon’s Ceramide ATO Soothing Gel Cream\n\n4.75/5\n\nImagine if you took what I liked about the Isntree daily moisturizers and reduced it down to the most basic possible ingredient list. This gets docked for only having .05% ceramides, but I don’t really care to be honest. In the world where I stop feeling like trying something new every day, this is what I would choose as my everyday moisturizer and my nightly gel cream as I prefer basic formulations. This is never my final step, but if it is, it will leave your skin looking a bit wet/glassy for a while. It’s somehow dry to the touch during this stage, but a lot of people wouldn’t really love that.\n\nCOSRx’s Hyaluronic Acid Intensive Cream\n\n4/5\n\nIf this came in a tube, I would be giving it a perfect rating, and would actually purchase and use it regularly. The smell is *heavenly*, the consistency is so delightfully goopy, and it goes on like a luxury gel cream. COSRx is legit WILD for making a bunch of creams and somehow ONLY putting their goopy creams in tubs - it’s genuinely illogical. It’s why I’ve never purchased the snail cream - like why would I? lol This also leaves a pretty oily film on your skin after, but I don’t even care. I just love the texture - if I’m ever rich I am going to buy this in bulk and bathe in it.\n\nCOSRx’s Balancium D-panthenol Cream\n\n4/5\n\nThis has silicone and dimethicone, so it does dry down super quickly. It is the only cream of theirs that I’d feel comfortable using as my final step, though, and I find it to be more than enough at night. The drying down aspect makes it a fantastic daily moisturizer, as well. Purito’s 10% is a bit better, but this one would function better as a daily moisturizer. I do like this as it helps firm and even out redness, but I wouldn’t repurchase it unless it was on a good sale.\n\nCOSRx’s Rice Spa Overnight Mask\n\n2.5/5\n\nThis isn’t a sleeping mask, and yes I am docking it for this. This is the same consistency as the Isntree HA Moist Cream/iUNIK Beta Glucan Cream and this one is just egregious because it’s a sleeping mask. It is somehow, at the same time, quite oily looking after. I would compare it to Illiyoon’s ATO Lotion (not reviewed here) in the way that it’s not nearly enough to be a moisturizer while somehow never sinking in and clogging pores lol. I know a lot of people love this one, but it wasn’t for me. I ended up using it on my body.\n\nCOSRx’s Balancium Comfort Ceramide Cream\n\n1.5/5\n\nI really didn’t like this one - it was this gross waxy texture because they went for a “matte balm” texture. This is achieved by making a SUPER emollient cream and adding dimethicone, trimethicone, and hydrogenated lecithin. I am assuming they are trying to duplicate the Ceramidin smell with the bergamot, but this is somehow way more fragrant than anything I’ve used from Dr. Jart (SOMEHOW). It is to me a bit of a formulational failure, so I wouldn’t recommend it; but I am sure this is many people’s holy grail. YMMV\n\nCOSRx’s Propolis Overnight Mask\n\n4.5/5\n\nAnother serum! This one does work as a sleeping mask, but it is a very liquidy texture for such an impressive gel cream. This is one of my favorite CosRx products because it’s basically just propolis goop. If you want to use it as a sleeping mask, your face has to be completely dried down or else it will apply like a serum. I ended up not using it very often, so I added it to my One Thing Mugwort Toner and made a super viscous and frothy toner. I call it Iced Tea.\n\nCOSRx’s Cica Pure Fit Cream\n\n2/5\n\nI experienced no lift on my redness with this, and it dries down to the point where it takes away more than it adds. It has a beautifully thick and creamy texture that goes nowhere once applied. I ended up using this on my body because of the dryness it caused on my face, but this would be a decent daily cream for people as long as it goes under a sunscreen. I used this as a sleeping mask once and my skin was so dry the next day - wouldn’t recommend it at all for that.\n\nRound Lab’s Pine Cream\n\n3.75/5\n\nAyyyyyyyy another serum I actually like. This doesn’t do anything as far as locking in moisture goes, but it’s an awesome antioxidant-based hydrating serum. It has LHA, which is meant to help with evening out your skin tone. I found this was an excellent hydration and glow booster, but it really did help even out my tone. I am a big fan of this one, but considering it isn’t a great moisturizer, I’ll just spring for the serum next time.\n\n9Wishes Pine Cream\n\n1/5\n\nThis, just like Round Lab’s cream, was more of a serum than anything else. It lightly burned on contact (like CeraVe or Paula’s Choice moisturizers) and has terrible pump packaging that makes it super difficult to get the product out. I love the sunscreen and the toner from this line (both perfect 5/5’s), so this was a huge disappointment for me.\n\nApieu’s Madecassoside Gel Cream\n\n5/5\n\nI am surprised I haven’t repurchased this as I was a massive fan. It was scentless to me, which is an experience I haven’t had with any other A'pieu product. It does dry down really well while sealing in everything very well - this is a cream that perfectly strikes the balance for me. It is not so drying that it takes away moisture like some of the creams above, but it’s a great priming moisturizer before sunscreen or makeup. \n\nApieu’s Madecassoside Moisture Gel Cream\n\n3.5/5\n\nIn terms of texture, this is a cream that is directly comparable to Isntree’s Onion Newpair cream for me. Hydrating, moisturizing, and dries down quickly - it’s just blue instead of purple. It does have dimethicone, but I only hold certain ingredients against the product if it seems to do the thing I hate LOL - this isn’t drying and it doesn’t just sit there. It is also quite fragrant, which I wasn’t a fan of. \n\nThen I Met You’s Renewing Rich Beauty Cream:\n\n5/5\n\nThis is the best cream I have ever used, and it makes me so sad because it’s $54. I compared the Yam Root Moisturizer to this, but in reality this has a much more luxurious texture. Imagine if you took an expensive Asian ginseng-based anti-aging cream, removed all the bad ingredients, and put it in beautiful periwinkle packaging. You’d have this. It doesn’t dry down quickly at all, but it’s not heavy - just very emollient. It is an amazing night cream, and I would love it so much more if it came in a tube.",

That took care of deep cystic acne, but I still suffered from surface level bumps. Last summer I tried a Salicylic Acid lotion from CeraVe but it really screwed things up even further and I ended up with itchy bumps everywhere that would just not go away.\n\nAfter struggling for 6 months to get it under control, I did a lot of research and reading on here and decided to treat it like fungal acne/ folliculitis and focus on my moisture barrier, and it has disappeared. My AM and PM routine is wash face with Happy Cappy baby shampoo (anti fungal), then wash again with CeraVe Renewing SA cleanser. I immediately coat my face with CeraVe moisturizing lotion in the tub, wait 20-30 minutes and moisturize again. Every other night I use diffrin between the moisturizing steps. I also just got the BePlain Clean Ocean Sunscreen today and plan to start it tomorrow morning as my last step.\n\nIt took about a month to repair my moisture barrier. I tried using La Roche Posay Cicaplast baum and The Ordinary Squalane oil for maintaining hydration, but both just felt extremely heavy caused additional itchy bumps. But despite some bumps in the road, I am so happy to finally love my skin and this sub had so much to do with it. Thank you all!",

    "body": "First three pics show how bad my skin looked on a regular basis for over a year, the third shows what a “good” skin day for me looked like. The last three show my skin’s progress since December 25th with the last one being taken today, yes it cleared that quickly. I am on birth control and I have dermatillomania, so I was in denial about this being caused by my cera ve foaming facial cleanser and daily moisturizing lotion for quite a long time. \n\nBut recently, when my skin would clear up for a day or two, I realized I rarely picked if I didn’t already have white heads. I also noticed that if I used more than a tiny pump of the CV moisturizer, my face would erupt with white heads by the next day. Because I couldn’t use more than a tiny amount, my skin developed horribly bad dry patches with tons of flaking dead skin. I think my skin barrier was broken and I didn’t ever cover it with makeup, but I was still horribly insecure about my skin looking like this all the time. \n\nFast forward to Christmas, my wonderful boyfriend got me some products I had done a little research on and asked for. I was interested in double cleansing so I asked for Dermatica’s caring squalane cream cleanser, Dr. Sam’s flawless cleanser, and La Roche Posay’s Touleraine double repair moisturizer and cicaplast balm. I threw the Cera ve products under the sink and immediately used the Dr Sam’s cleanser, the double repair moisturizer, and the cicaplast balm(as a spot treatment for the dry patches). I expected a breakout from so many new products but I didn’t really care, I knew I needed to stop using the cera ve immediately. I truly was not expecting my skin to look AMAZING the next morning. \n\nFor the first time in over a year, my dull, red, irritated skin had a healthy glow. The dry patches were better, my blemishes looked so much less irritated. It looked like my skin had literally healed overnight. I was truly shocked, I really expected a transition breakout but I still don’t recommend for anyone to try so many products at once. Just because it worked out for me doesn’t mean it will for someone else. I plan on integrating the cream wash soon.  Does anyone have any advice for double cleansing? Should it only be used for days I wear makeup and need to remove it, or is it suitable for the daily routine? \n\nRight now I am due for my period and I have had two hormonal pimples, and I know hormonal acne cannot be treated topically but they only stuck around for two days and are going away, as opposed to being there for a week hurting and swollen, and leaving dark blemishes after healing. \n\nTo me, these events confirmed that the Cera Ve was very bad for my skin. I just wish I had realized sooner than this, I thought my acne was just really bad because of my picking getting worse after my beloved cat died suddenly last year. I am truly so happy now though, my confidence has soared the past few days because my skin seriously hasnt been this clear in OVER A YEAR. Not only do I have significantly less pimples, but my skin tone is more even, I have a lot less texture, and it actually glows now. Oh and it’s probably worth mentioning that I started using Cera Ve last Christmas. I hope this post gives anyone struggling with similar issues some hope, I know just how much skin problems can affect self confidence. Woof sorry this got so long, Im just so freaking ecstatic about this. ",

I'll be keeping my review of each item fairly short. I also want to mention that some of these products are either discontinued or have been reformulated, which I will note. If I can find the ingredient list for these products I will also be linking them as well.\n\nTo give some context about me and my skin type, I'm mid to late 20 year old male, my skin type is combination (oily T-Zone, dry to normal U-Zone) and I suffer from cystic acne ever since I was a teenager. I live in a climate where it's fairly dry all year round with harsh winters; gets down to around -20C which is -4F, and in the summer it sometimes can get fairly hot around 30C which is 86F.\n\nMy main concerns for my skin is acne and the hyperpigmentation it leaves behind.\n\n**Cleansers:**\n\n* [*Pyunkang Yul ACNE Facial Cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-pyunkang-yul-acne-facial-cleanser) \\- this was just an ok cleanser, nothing to rave about but nothing to boo at. I don't think it'll necessary clear much acne, even if you have common acne. It does create a slight lather. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance free. \n* [*Etude House Real Art Moisture Cleansing Oil*](https://incidecoder.com/products/etude-house-real-art-cleansing-oil) \\- was not really a fan of this cleansing oil, I don't really wear makeup so I can't really say how well it cleansed, but the fact that it has fragrance kinda peeves me off. Alcohol free, has been renewed once. \n* [*Papa Recipe Eggplant Clearing 5.5 Cleansing Foam*](https://incidecoder.com/products/papa-recipe-eggplant-clearing-5-5-cleansing-foam) \\- this is a basic foam cleanser, I don't really think it really helps with acne. Lathers pretty well, and with these foam cleansers, you only need a small amount to cleanse your face so it lasts a long time. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*2ndesign First Cleansing Oil Pure & Fresh*](https://incidecoder.com/products/2ndesign-first-cleansing-oil-pure-fresh) \\- didn't mind this oil cleanser, minimal ingredients, has a tolerable scent for a wash off product and it's quite affordable. Emulsifies well, and doesn't leave a weird film on the skin. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*Cosrx Low pH good Morning Gel Cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-low-ph-good-morning-gel-cleanser) \\- i probably have emptied more than one tube of this, but obviously, who can say they've delved into AB without trying a Cosrx product before. I think this is fine because I have somewhat oily skin, but from what I've read general consensus is that it's not great for dry skin. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-hydrating-cleanser-2) \\- for me this cleanser is probably one of the best cleansers on the market. The fact that it's a milky, non-foaming cleanser is somewhat comforting, especially during the colder winter months. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-hydrating-micellar-water) \\- this shit will sting your eyes if you're not careful, it's probably because of the high niacinamide content. Other than that, I think it's fine. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Bioderma Sensibio H2O*](https://incidecoder.com/products/bioderma-sensibio-h2o) \\- i mean, this is fine. I don't think it's really worth how much it cost compared to all the options we have now, but this was the first micellar water if I'm not wrong so, pop off I guess. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Garnier Skinactive Micellar Water All-In-1*](https://incidecoder.com/products/garnier-skinactive-micellar-cleansing-water-all-in-1) \\- i've probably emptied at least five bottles of this by now. If you're looking for a micellar water that's fuss-free, I recommend this one. It's cheap and easy, what's not to like. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Clinique City Block Purifying Charcoal Cleansing Gel*](https://incidecoder.com/products/clinique-city-block-purifying-charcoal-cleansing-gel) \\- i don't like this. Regardless this has been discontinued it seems. \n* [*su:m37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick*](https://incidecoder.com/products/su-m37-miracle-rose-cleansing-stick) \\- remember when cleansing sticks were so hyped up? yeah I didn't even finish this. Anyways it's been discontinued but this is not great. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n\n**Toners**:\n\n* [*Pyunkang Yul Mist Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner) \\- simple basic mist, it only has five ingredients. I didn't really expect much from it and it didn't really do much for me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-toner-essence) \\- there's not much viscosity to this toner, it's pretty much water-like. If you're into minimal ingredients and eastern herbal medicine kinda vibe then you'll like this. It's not terrible, not great. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Pyunkang Yul ACNE Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-toner) \\- if there had to be one toner I'd recommend from the Pyunkang Yul line it'd be this one. At least it has some botanical extracts that will help your skin along with niacinamide. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [Missha Time Revolution Clear Toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/missha-time-revolution-clear-toner) \\- this has been discontinued, but I liked it has a morning cleansing toner. \n* [*klairs Fundamental Ampoule Mist*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-fundamental-ampoule-mist) \\- i enjoyed this mist, it sits in a base of green tea and contains a bunch of skin soothing ingredients. The actual mister itself was alright, it didn't produce the best misting experience. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-supple-preparation-facial-toner) \\- another cult favourite. This is probably the most viscous toners I've ever tried. I probably would prefer the essential oil free version of this much more, but regardless, I still think it's a good hydrating toner to slap on. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*By Wishtrend Mandelic Acid 5% Skin Prep Water*](https://incidecoder.com/products/by-wishtrend-mandelic-acid-5-skin-prep-water) \\- this was a pretty good exfoliating toner, mandelic acid is one of the gentler AHAs to begin with and having it at 5% makes it super gentle I feel. If you're wanting to dip your toes into AHA and exfoliating, this is probably a good place to start. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. This looks like it's been reformulated once, to remove the hydrolyzed collagen to make this product vegan. \n* [*Son & Park Beauty Water*](https://incidecoder.com/products/son-park-beauty-water) \\- i do not like this product. I know it's a cult favourite but even then it's kinda just meh in my eyes. Fragrance free. \n* [*I'm From Rice Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/im-from-rice-toner) \\- this is basically the Laneige Cream Skin, but the rice version, if that makes sense. They're both more moisturizing than hydrating. The only con with this toner is that it requires you to shake it before each use to make sure everything is emulsified together. Overall a good choice if you're someone who is lazy with skincare, since this and the Laneige Cream Skin is a multi-step product. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Innisfree Artichoke Layering Light Skin*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-artichoke-layering-light-skin) \\- this product has been discontinued. Didn't hate this product, just a simple watery toner to layer.\n* [*Papa Recipe Eggplant Clearing Skin*](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_248d341348.html) \\- i just don't like anything from this line. I feel like it didn't really do anything for my skin, I'm probably more harsh on products that claim to help with acne as a person who suffers from acne myself. Fragrance and essential oil free. \n* [*Etude House Soonjung pH 5.5 Relief Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/etude-house-soonjung-ph5-5-relief-toner) \\- if you're looking for some basic products, for some basic skin or introductory products into skincare, I fully believe the Soonjung line is perfect for that. I also believe this now comes in a jumbo size (350ml?). Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/round-lab-1025-dokdo-toner-2) \\- this is what I use on a daily basis now as a morning wiping toner. It's gentle enough to wipe away the dirt without stripping the skin. Alternatively I also think it's hydrating enough to be used as a toner that you pat into the skin. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing Skin*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-blueberry-rebalancing-skin) \\- i probably would like this toner a lot more if it didn't contain essential oils. It's a milky looking toner, but it's not moisturizing as the Laneige or I'm From toner. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*Cosrx Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-centella-water-alcohol-free-toner) \\- i mean, this was whatever. It's a very basic mist toner, and to be honest, probably didn't do much for my skin. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Natural Pacific (Nacific) Real Floral Toner Calendula*](https://incidecoder.com/products/nacific-real-floral-toner-calendula) \\- i wasn't really expecting much with this toner, but it kinda proved me wrong. While I think the calendula petals in the actual bottle is kinda of a gimmick it did soothe my skin and feel rather nice on my face. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*TonyMoly The Black Tea London Classic Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/tony-moly-the-black-tea-london-classic-toner) \\- this was oddly viscous somehow, it's probably due to the cyclomethicone being in there. That being said, I didn't really enjoy this toner either. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*Cosrx One Step Moisture Up Pad*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-one-step-moisture-up-pad) \\- i've also tried the original pads from cosrx and I gotta say, I just don't like pads. I think they're overpriced for what they are. The only pro is that they're good for travel. Other than that I'm just not on the pad hype train. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n\n**First Essences:**\n\n* [*Secret Key Starting Treatment Essence (Rose Edition)*](https://incidecoder.com/products/secret-key-starting-treatment-essence-rose-edition) \\- simple ingredient list, no fuss, and somewhat affordable. Now does the rose ingredients in here really make a difference, probably not, but this has a cleaner ingredient list than the standard one. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Scinic First Treatment Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/scinic-first-treatment-essence) \\- if you're looking to delve into this whole fermented first essence experience. Scinic is probably the best one to start off with, simple ingredient list and affordable. \n* *the Saem The Essential Glactomyces First Essence* \\- it looks like they renewed the packaging for this and it now comes in a reddish purple bottle. The ingredients look the same though it's just 100% galactomyces ferment filtrate. Regardless, this felt oddly greasy? Maybe it's because it's just that one ingredient but it felt greasy and weird to me. Hard pass. Alcohol, fragrance, essential oil free. \n* *Missha Time Revolution The First Treatment Essence (Intensive Moist & Intensive)* \\- not really a reason for me to go into this as they renew the formula every two years or so. The Intensive Moist and Intensive versions have been discontinued. And yes, I did buy the Line Friends edition simply because it looked so cute. \n* [*Benton Fermentation Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/benton-fermentation-essence) \\- so, why is this only 100ml? Feels kinda overpriced for what it is. Regardless, I wouldn't really suggest this unless you really want to try it or you're a Benton diehard fan. Looks like it's been reformulated. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Missha Time Revolution The First Treatment Essence Homme*](https://incidecoder.com/products/missha-time-revolution-homme-the-first-treatment-essence-200ml) \\- gasp, a male marketed product? The only reason I wanted to try this instead of the regular current version was that it contains more volume, it didn't come in a glass bottle because I drop shit all the time, and it looked like it was formulated for more oily skin. In the end, this was just whatever for me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Missha Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/missha-time-revolution-artemisia-treatment-essence) \\- ok this product is a hit. I really like this product and if you're someone who can't stand traditional eastern medicinal scent, I don't really think you'll like this. But I love how this smells and to be honest, it's probably why I like it so much. Alcohol, fragrance, essential oil free.\n* [*I'm From Mugwort Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/im-from-mugwort-essence) \\- basically the same thing as the Missha one, but I prefer the Missha one because it's cheaper and the scent in the Missha one is stronger for some reason most likely because Missha ferments the extract? Who knows. Alcohol, fragrance, essential oil free.\n* [*su:m37 Secret Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/su-m37-su-m37-secret-programming-essence) \\- i don't think this is worth it, it's so expensive and ingredient list is like 50+. Plus there's a shit ton of EO in this product. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n\n**Serums:**\n\n* [*Hado Labo Gokujyun Premium*](https://incidecoder.com/products/hada-labo-gokujyun-premium) \\- so i'm sure everyone and their mom has tried something from Hado Labo at this point. If you're looking for something that is hydrating and affordable and that will help with inner dryness, this is the product for you. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence) \\- if you want to try something with snail in it just get this. Probably the most affordable one out of the bunch, probably the best one on the market still. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Mizon Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule*](https://incidecoder.com/products/mizon-snail-repair-intensive-ampoule) \\- i feel like this is another OG AB cult favourite. I mean compared to the COSRX one this one is whatever. It does contain peptides but for the price and the size it comes in, I rather just purchase the COSRX one. Fragrance and essential oil free.\n* *Missha Time Revolution Night Repair Science Activator Borabit Ampoule* \\- some of these product names are so goddamn long. Anyways this is discontinued, I believe the new ampoule is much more thicker and has prebiotics in the formula now. I also think they added EO to the new ampoule. \n* [*Skin1004 Madagascar Centella-Asiatica 100*](https://incidecoder.com/products/skin1004-madagascar-centella-asiatica-100-ampoule) \\- this product has been repackaged but the ingredients are the same, just 100% centella extract. To be honest I did enjoy this product and it's quite affordable. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Purito Centella Green Level Buffet Serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-buffet-serum-3) \\- for what it is, it's fine. Probably go get the unscented version since the scent is quite strong. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*Niod Multi-Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Complex*](https://incidecoder.com/products/niod-multi-molecular-hyaluronic-complex-2-mmhc2) \\- this is expensive. I rather much prefer the Marine Hyaluronics from The Ordinary. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*klairs Midnight blue Youth Activating Drop*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-midnight-blue-youth-activating-drop-3) \\- this is tiny and expensive. I like how it's a pretty blue colour, but to be honest, the size of it doesn't warrant the price. Also I had a terrible experience getting this item from Wishtrend when they had a whole batch of it go bad because it was stored at the wrong temperature. \n* [*Niod Survival 0*](https://incidecoder.com/products/niod-survival-0-2018) \\- i actually like this product! I think the orange tint that it comes in is a pit off-putting but it doesn't leave any stains or transfer or have any tint whatsoever. I think it pairs pretty well with any vitamin c product. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free\n* [*The Ordinary Marine Hyaluronics*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-marine-hyaluronics) \\- is it weird that I like the smell of this? Regardless, I do prefer this much more than the traditional HA that The Ordinary also offers. I really don't see much difference with this and the MMHC2 from Niod. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free\n* [*The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-alpha-arbutin-2-ha) \\- i rather much prefer the vitamin c + alpha arbutin. This by itself is quite redundant IMO. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free\n* [*The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-niacinamide-10-zinc-1) \\- ok so this isn't the most cosmetically elegant and the formula is rather basic, but I'm not going to spend basically $60 CAD for the Paula's Choice one. I will admit the PC one is much more easier to apply, but I'm cheap. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Buffet*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-buffet) \\- this didn't really wow me, I think it's a good basic anti-aging serum.  Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3%*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-resveratrol-3-ferulic-acid-3) \\- i just mixed this in with my vitamin c to give it an additional boost, because it's sitting in a base of propanediol it doesn't give it an oily feeling, but most of TO products come sitting in a base of that. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Vitamin-C:**\n\n* [*Drunk Elephant C-Firma Day Serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/drunk-elephant-c-firma-day-serum) \\- i kinda don't get the hype over DE? I mean this was nice, but I don't think it warrants the price, plus because this uses l-ascorbic acid and it's water based it oxidizes pretty quickly, regardless of the packaging. I think there are better options out there for the fraction of the price. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-100-l-ascorbic-acid-powder) \\- i mean this was ok, but you can purchase bulk vitamin c powder online and do the exact same thing but cheaper? I guess this is for people who rather just mix their vitamin c into a toner or serum and call it day. I will say that this did sting the most out of all the vitamin c I've used, probably because you know, it's straight up vitamin c powder and the measuring spoon isn't the best. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Ascorbyl Glucoside 12%*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-ascorbyl-glucoside-solution-12) \\- i believe this is the only vitamin c TO offers that sits in a base of water. Regardless, this is a derivative of vitamin c so it doesn't offer the powerful punch that traditional vitamin c offers. But I did like it texturally compared to the others, since this doesn't sit in a base of propanediol. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Ole Henriksen Truth Serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/olehenriksen-truth-serum) \\- i got ths as a gift so... yeah. I really don't like this. Alcohol free.\n* [*It's Skin Power 10 Formula VC Effector*](https://incidecoder.com/products/its-skin-power-10-formula-vc-effector) \\- this was also meh, pass. Alcohol and essential oil free. \n* [*Rohto Mentholatum Melano CC*](https://incidecoder.com/products/rohto-mentholatum-melano-cc-vitamin-c-essence) \\- so this is another cult favourite, while I did enjoy this, I kinda hate the packaging? I understand it's to keep the vitamin c from oxidizing, but I got a big face so I need a lot of this for my face so having to wait for each single drop to come out is a bit annoying. The amount is also quite small sitting at 20ml. Alcohol and essential oil free.\n* [*goodal green tangerine vita C dark spot serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/goodal-green-tangerine-vita-c-dark-spot-serum) \\-  i think korea is just getting into vitamin c since I do see new products with actual l-ascorbic acid instead of citrus fruit punch with some derivatives sprinkled in there. This is citrus fruit punch and it's full of EO, so I wouldn't really recommend this. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin Drop](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-freshly-juiced-vitamin-drop) \\- so this would be a fine beginner vitamin c serum but it does also contain EO. Also the packaging isn't UV resistant so you need to keep this somewhere dark and away from sunlight. Probably better options out there if you're wanting to try vitamin C. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n\n**Retinols**:\n\n* [*Differin Gel*](https://incidecoder.com/products/differin-differin-gel) \\-  so as someone who has been on accutane three times (and a bunch of other drugs), Differin is a godsend. I know La Roche Posay now offers their version which is cheaper than Diffferin, and you can get a higher concentration of adapalene if you get a prescription. While this doesn't clear my acne 100% it's removed probably around 90% of it. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Life-flo Retinol A 1% Advanced Revitalization Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/life-flo-retinol-a-1-advanced-revitalization-cream) \\- so I bought this to see if it would help with my KP on my arms, didn't do jack shit. Unfortunately I've come to realize that severe KP is untreatable. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-granactive-retinoid-2-emulsion) \\- i prefer this the most when it comes to TO and their retinoid line. Since granactive retinoid is so new I'm not really sure if it doesn't much like tretinion and other vitamin a derivatives, but it is a moisturizing emulsion if anything. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 5% in Squalane*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-granactive-retinoid-5-in-squalane) \\- yeah the emulsion is better. I also cannot stand squalane oil for some reason. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Other Actives(?)**:\n\n* [*cosrx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-aha-7-whitehead-power-liquid) \\- so I'm not sure what it is, but my skin does not agree with any of the cosrx chemical exfoliants. This and the BHA one made me breakout, and I've used other AHA/BHA products before. Regardless, I resorted to using this on my arms (for my KP), didn't really do much for the KP. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) \\- read above. Also this doesn't even contain any saliycylic acid so... yeah no. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution - it looks like this product is going through reformulation currently. I'm using the Paula's Choice BHA Liquid right now and I prefer the PC one more, even if it's more expensive. \n* Benzoyl Peroxide - i mean this is just 5% benzoyl peroxide I get from my drug store. I am a strong believer of pairing benzoyl peroxide with other acne medication to make sure you're doubling down on the acne. \n\n**Oils**:\n\n* [*The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-100-plant-derived-squalane) \\- look i'm not the best person to review oils, since I still have generally quite oily skin. If anything oils usually get mixed into my body moisturizer to give more occlusivity. Also I hate the feeling of squalane for some reason. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary 100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-100-organic-cold-pressed-rose-hip-seed-oil) \\- so I bought this because people kept saying rose hip oil is good for hyperpigmentation, but yeah, my face couldn't handle the oily feeling so it went straight on my body! Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Drunk Elephant Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil*](https://incidecoder.com/products/drunk-elephant-virgin-marula-luxury-facial-oil) \\- ok why does this cost so much? I've heard this feels much more lighter than other marula oils but still, this costs an arm and a leg. Probably not really worth it. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Moisturizers**:\n\n* [*cosrx Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-oil-free-ultra-moisturizing-lotion-with-birch-sap) \\- i don't really like this. It was fine? But now that I found another birch juice/sap moisturizer that one is 100% better than this one. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-natural-moisturizing-factors-ha) \\- look, you cannot fault this product as it is extremely cheap ($5 for 100ml during this year's Black Friday sale), and the ingredients are decent. If you're looking for a basic moisturizer, just get this one. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Papa Recipe Eggplant Clearing Emulsion*](https://incidecoder.com/products/papa-recipe-eggplant-clearing-emulsion) \\- yeah no I really don't like this line. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*cosrx Aloe Vera Oil-Free Moisture Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-aloe-vera-oil-free-moisture-cream) \\- probably better to just get an aloe vera gel if you're eyeing at this product. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-rich-moist-soothing-cream) \\- i found this too heavy for my skin, plus it's filled with EO. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-midnight-blue-calming-cream-8) \\- now this cream was much better for me. While I believe it's supposed to be used a spot treatment to calm down irritated skin, I just used this all over. I also believe there is a tube format of this now if you hate jar packaging. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Mizon Black Snail All In One Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/mizon-black-snail-aio-cream) \\- not much to say about this cream, didn't really stand out to me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/round-lab-birch-juice-moisturizing-cream) \\- k this is really good. If you have oily skin, I really recommend this. It kinda feels like you're applying water because the cream just melts and sinks in immediately. It's extremely hydrating and perfect for oily skin as it doesn't feel too occlusive or leave any stickiness. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel*](https://incidecoder.com/products/benton-aloe-propolis-soothing-gel) \\- i mean this is a decent aloe gel, I just don't think I'm a fan of aloe gels in general as it leaves a sticky feeling behind. This would probably be best if you are sunburnt as it as a nice cooling effect on the skin. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Inkey List Multi-Biotic*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-inkey-list-multi-biotic) \\- this stinks, so if you do not like your moisturizer smelling like basically yogurt, then pass this one. I found it quite cool and tolerable. The scent doesn't 100% disappear but it doesn't linger if that makes sense. You really have to smell hard to actually smell it after applying it. This was just ok for me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Dr. G RED Blemish Clear Soothing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/dr-g-red-blemish-clear-soothing-cream) \\- this is really highly ranked of Hwahae so I decided to try it. I found it alright as it was occlusive but not pore clogging feeling, while it's not the most hydrating this is probably better for dryer skin types as it provides that nice seal. As for decreasing redness, I didn't really see much of a difference. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Pyunkang Yul ACNE Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-cream) \\- didn't really do much for my acne but it is a nice gel moisturizer, not something really rave about though. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [cosrx Centella Blemish Cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-centella-blemish-cream) \\- i've recommended this to so many people. I feel like this is really soothes my acne or makes them completely disappear if they're non-cystic ones. I've emptied countless jars of this and I always have one of these on me at all times. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*Ole Henriksen Sheer Transformation Perfecting Moisturizer*](https://incidecoder.com/products/olehenriksen-sheer-transformation-r-perfecting-moisturizer) \\- i don't hate this surprisingly? What really shocked me was that this was EO and fragrance free unlike their truth serum. I think this is a good morning moisturizer to pair with your vitamin c as it does contain a handful of antioxidants. A little also goes a long way as it spreads pretty well. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Drunk Elephant Lala Retro Whipped Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/drunk-elephant-lala-retro-whipped-cream) \\- i am probably the worst person to ask about DE. But once again I didn't like this product. It probably was too rich for my oily skin, I just really can't stomach the prices of their products. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Benton Fermentation Eye Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/benton-fermentation-eye-cream-2) \\- i'm not really a believer in eye cream so I'm probably the worst person to review this, but yeah, this didn't really change my thoughts on eye creams. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Sunscreens**:\n\n* *CeraVe Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50 Body Lotion* \\- i think this has been discontinued as I can't find it anywhere, but this was not it. It states to have invisible zinc technology but it was still so pasty and white. I'm only tossing this because I'm pretty sure it's passed the use by date. \n* [*Murad City Skin Age Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 50 PA++++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/murad-city-skin-age-defense-broad-spectrum-spf-50-pa) \\- so this uses zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as it's filter. It's a pretty elegant physical sunscreen if you can look past the price. I think the tint helps it so that it doesn't have a white cast, at least on my skin tone. You gotta shake this before using this. One downside to this sunscreen is that it does feel greasy for me, and it's not water/sweat resistant so it will rub off with the tint. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Troiareuke Acsen U.V Protector Essence SPF 50+ PA+++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/ascen-uv-protector-essence) \\- combinational sunscreen that uses octinoxate, homosalate, octisalate, tinosorb s, titanium dioxide, Univul T 150 as it's filters. The only gripe I have with this is that it does contain fragrance. It's pretty expensive as well. Alcohol and essential oil free.\n* [*klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50+ PA ++++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-soft-airy-uv-essence-spf50-pa) \\- so this is awkward. With the whole Purito thing has shaked things up and a lot of Korean sunscreens are now under investigation for having lower than advertised SPF ratings. Univul A Plus and Univul T 150 are the filters for this sunscreen and to be honest since they've stopped the sale of this sunscreen and I'm not sure what will happen to it. We'll see how things end up with this whole debacle but I did enjoy using this if that matters at all.\n* *innisfree perfect UV protection cream triple care SPF 50+ PA+++* \\-  this has been discontinued, but god roadshop brands have the worst fragrances. I'm pretty sure I gave up using this because I could not handle the fragrance. \n* *Mamonde Everyday Aqua Sun Cream SPF 50+ PA++++* \\- again, the fragrance, why. This also has been discontinued. \n* *innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing Watery Sun Cream SPF37 PA+++* \\- so this has been reformulated and repackaged, I believe it's now SPF 45 PA+++. I don't the SPF increase really changed much in the formula, it uses titanium dioxide only. But it does have EO. Also shake the product before using it. \n* [*innisfree The minimum sun cream SPF 25 PA++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-the-minimum-sun-cream-spf25-pa) \\- so, idk why I got this sunscreen. Because I think this is either meant for babies or people with extremely sensitive skin. Either way, if you're either of those, probably one to pick up. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* *Missha all-around Safe Block Mild Sun SPF 30 PA++* \\- this has been discontinued as well, once again, not sure why I got this. As it's pretty low protection and is probably meant for babies or people with extremely sensitive skin. \n* [*Etude House UV Double Cut Fresh Sun Gel SPF 50+ PA ++++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/etude-house-uv-double-cut-fresh-sun-gel-spf50-pa) \\- this one has a more tolerable fragrance but it's still not great. If you're ok with EO, alcohol and fragrance in your sunscreen then go ahead. It's inexpensive and does provide good coverage as it uses octinoxate, homosalate, octisalate, Unival A Plus, and Univul T 150. But I really just wish brands would stop putting fragrance in their sunscreens, I'm fine with mine smelling like chemicals. \n* *Hyggee Chu Chu Sun Pact SPF43 PA+++* \\- discontinued and yes I did buy it because Pucca was on it. \n\n**Body Care**:\n\n* [*CeraVe Moisuturizing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-moisturizing-cream) \\- i'm pretty sure everyone has tried this before. To me, I think any old body moisturizer performs just as well as this one. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*CeraVe Renewing SA Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-renewing-sa-cream) \\- so apparently this is supposedly too high of a pH for the salicylic acid to do much, according to Beautypedia. I bought this in hopes to combat my KP, but it didn't really do much. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*illiyoon ceramide ato 6.0 top to toe wash*](https://incidecoder.com/products/illiyoon-ceramide-ato-6-0-top-to-toe-wash) \\- i do like this body wash, it's quite gentle but it doesn't produce any lather, so if you want that bubbly foam fantasy this isn't the product for you. It leaves a film behind, which apparently is what low pH cleansers feel like? But regardless, the film isn't con as I really don't notice it after awhile. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*illiyoon ultra repair moisture cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/illiyoon-ultra-repair-moisture-cleanser) \\- i prefer their ato cleanser more, this has fragrance and I don't think the added oils in this formula moisturize my skin anymore than the ato one. Alcohol free.\n\n**Powders**:\n\n* [*innisfree no-sebum Mineral Powder*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-no-sebum-mineral-powder-2) \\- cult favourite, but their newer powder has won over my heart. Still this is not bad as a mattifying powder. Alcohol and essential oil free.\n* [*innisfree Pore Blur Powder*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-pore-blur-powder) \\- so this is like a better version of the no-sebum powder. It also doesn't include fragrance! Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Masks**:\n\n* [*I'm From Mugwort Mask*](https://incidecoder.com/products/im-from-mugwort-mask) \\- this mask is great for cooling the skin down, also I'm addicted to the smell of mugwort so this was a dream come true. It's just a hassle to wash off as there are pieces of mugwort in this mask. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.",

    "body": "Just need to vent. I just turned 32 and seem to be aging rapidly. When I was 30, people guessed I was 26. Now, people are guessing that I am 36-38. When I go out with my older sister who is 40, people guess that \\*I\\* am the older one (but maybe that's because I'm 5'7\" and she is 5'2\"). I am pretty physically fit and lean (which I feel makes me look older?). I like my physique, and I have fun with the clothes I wear. I don't have kids, but my life is a little bit more stressful now than two years ago because I changed jobs and started grad school. I hydrate, wear sunscreen, use a gua sha tool a few nights a week, sleep enough, rarely wear makeup, wear reading glasses to reduce eye strain, wear sunglasses and hats outdoors... but my pores are huge, my wrinkles and dimples are deep, and my bright eyes are now becoming more deep-set and puffy. My mom had a blepharoplasty at 60, which creeps me the fuck out and I want to avoid it. I am not interested in Botox or fillers, but understand that these are highly effective methods that people love.\n\nI am old enough to know that vanity and outward beauty don't define me... but I just want to look my age- not older. Is it me or is it everyone else's distorted perception of age that is driving this? I feel insane.\n\n  \nETA: Thank you all for your replies! I can't respond to each one individually, but for those of you commiserating with me- THANK YOU! And for all who have offered specific products you recommend, I will look into them! Some mentioned thyroid issues- I have thyroid antibodies, but TSH has been normal and I don't have any other symptoms of hypothyroidism but maybe it's worth getting checked again. Also, this stress better be worth it- I agree that it must be wreaking havoc on my skin. I just want to look as healthy and young as I feel, I suppose. \n\nI... was hesitant to add a photo, but decided to add the photo that triggered my recent spiral. My friend took this photo of me while holding her baby on a beautiful day last weekend.\n\nI had horrible acne as a teenager and was always in the sun without sunscreen. Now I wear it daily (60 SPF), but I haven't found a good one that I like. My concerns are uneven skin tone, blotchiness, my pores, deep dimples, deep crow's feet, and my eyelids (mom had upper and lower blephs- the stuff of nightmares, no thank you). I used to have blonde hair- it naturally turned really dark brown around my early-mid 20s.\n\nProducts I use at night (though sometimes I forget): Cerave cleanser, Cosrx AHA/BHA Vitamin C daily toner, Cosrx The Vitamin C23/super vitamin E + hyaluronic acid serum, The Ordinary Retinol 0.5% in squalane, and Pacifica vegan collagen (my friend gave it to me- I don't really like it but feel bad throwing things out). 1-3 nights a week I use a gua sha tool with jojoba oil instead of using the vegan collagen. My morning routine is cold water + Cosrx snail mucin + Neutrogena Invisible defense face serum 60+ SPF (but I don't really like this SPF). Once a month I use this microdermabrasion thing I bought from Amazon before my night routine. I'm open to suggestions here!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itiibdg9r5sc1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0939cc7494c7565349b148b7c8cc94ea08234df5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f0bmv9g9r5sc1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f64c24df0c040ea56ad44f86b73986514a9ffc1d\n\n",

        "body": "You've hit your first \"aging cliff.\" I hit mine at the same age. As others say, hard to really judge without pics, but I made some massive leaps in terms of my skincare when I hit my first cliff, and also completely changed my makeup routine. That was my personal preference, not so much to stop or reverse aging, but just to feel comfortable with aging. So I'm not saying you need to wear more makeup... but I'll tell you doing so helped my confidence with aging a lot. It helped me feel like I had my \"old face\" (back when I didn't have super red skin and hyperpigmentation!)... I use the illusion makeup brings to even out my skin tone and add brightness and color to my features. ymmv.\n\nConsider adding toner, chemical exfoliator, and select serums to your routine. There's a whole world of products and options out there, but I personally started with toner and BHA/AHA, and played around until I found my favorite serums (niancinamide and azelaic acid for me personally--brightness/combating redness are big things for me), and I swapped out most of my moisturizers to those featuring hyaluronic acid & other super moisturizers b/c my skin is dry AF now. I treat skin care like a treat for making my skin feel good, and go from there. \n\nActually: do you wear moisturizer? I know you say SPF, but you may have been missing consistent moisturizing and that's an essential step to add. I have some wonderful, beautiful friends but the HUGE difference in how we've aged where they've ended up \"looking older\" faster than me is they've always had perfect, normal skin. So they never established solid face washing or moisturizing routines, whereas as an acne-prone person with oily skin, I did as a teen. I've SUPER MOISTURIZED my skin every day for 30+ years. It's made a difference. So if you're not using a cream cleanser (I use an anti-aging cream cleanser, personally) and good moisturizer--day and night--in addition to SPF during the day, that might be a place to start. (my skin is now dry type, so moisturizer is my #1!)\n\nWith makeup, you by no means have to wear it, but I flung myself fully into seeing what was out there in terms of liquid foundation and fuller coverage, eventually landing on dewy formulas that feel good but give me an even skin tone/bright appearance so I can be more confident. I can recommend some brands I personally like that don't feel to heavy but look nice. (one off the top of my head to look into is Hourglass Veil. Recently started using it and love it.)\n\nBut also: it will ebb and flow. I've aged a LOT during stress bursts (my mom dying is what finally made me look like my mid-30s instead of late 20s), but then its always evened out or even backtracked a bit and always ended up ok. It's just shocking when it first happens. Experiment with skincare/makeup to whatever degree you're comfortable and go from there!",

Botox and filler is very common and helps further push that down the road. There’s also not a hard style shift as you age like in previous generations. \n\nThere’s an additional breakdown between skin tone and race in terms of aging and collagen distribution. If you’re fair skinned, you may see those earlier than someone else. \n\nI would take a look at your hair / hair style and see if maybe an update would help there. Sometimes we get stuck and don’t realize that being out of date can make us look older than we are. Otherwise, chemical peels (or at minimum, using a chemical exfoliant like good molecules glycolic) will help will turnover, reduced look of pores, and skin texture. And just making peace with the fact that age will happen to us all. 🤷🏻‍♀️",

Also two years ago we were all still in Covid-related lockdowns, and by now it seems all that stress from three years of pandemic are catching up with us. I think stress is a big contributor to aging for myself personally.\n\nAlso -- I've been on this sub for a few months now and spend more time here than r/SkincareAddiction. But I wonder if there's a similar thing going on in that sub, with people experiencing \"normal\" skin changes as they enter teenage years and adulthood similarly to people entering their 30s and getting their first wrinkles and other signs of aging. Those first few pimples can be a big shock when you're a teenager; the posts I've seen on this sub are similar but for wrinkles, pigmentation, dehydration etc.\n\nI'm not disregarding the skincare issues that people bring up on this sub (clearly I'm here too to learn). But also:\n\nI'd tell my early teens self: you're going to get pimples. And I'd tell my late-20s self: you're going to get wrinkles.\n\nEdit: to end more positively, OP sounds like you do have a good attitude driving things!

(Btw- I don't personally find anything wrong with any of these things, but they are not \"in\" right now and can make us look older). \n\n  \nFor skincare- are you using retinol or tret? Those boost collagen production which can really help. You could also incorporate red light therapy for more collagen production. I suggest these because from what you are saying, it sounds like you are just less supple and \"full\" than you used to be, which is usually collagen related. \n\nFinally- I think we all have an age where we start noticing aging more.

I tried to follow some basic tips to help lower cortisol levels and noticed a bit of a difference! You can google these but the main ones I followed were not drinking coffee right when I got up/on an empty stomach, making sure to eat enough protein, and getting enough sleep. But the biggest thing that helped was just ... not being burnt out and depressed anymore lol.

Used to just wash my face with black soap and moisturised with jojoba oil. Introduced a toner and liked how my skin felt and looked. Got intrigued with Korean skincare so did some research. Heard about the multi-step routine. Loved it. Until I started developing acne. Did more research. Bought more products to fix my ‘acne’. More and more acne followed. Spiralled. Had a box full of skincare that I didn’t even want to think about using. Still wanted to buy more products though. \n\nWent to US for a trip. Only brought Laneige Cream Skin Refiner + Aloe gel + TO Squalane + Sunscreen. Got curious with Differin. It helped with acne. What also really helped was giving my skin a break from all those ‘necessary products’. Acne now gone. It was never acne. I used too much too quickly and my skin was telling me to stop but knowledge dictates that this product is good for this problem so it should work and so I kept going. Learned my lesson the hard way. Hundreds spent. Lots of PIH. But now I know. \n\nTLDR: Your skin is smart. Cleanse, hydrate, moisturise, protect. \n\nCurrent Skincare: \n\nBanila Co Cleansing Balm (PM) \n\nHada Labo Hyaluronic Cleanser (PM) \n\nDermatory Hypoallergenic Toner (AM/PM) \n\nCos de Baha Azelaic Acid (AM/PM) \n\nDIY Vit C Serum (AM) \n\nThe Inkey List Niacinamide (PM) \n\nTretinoin 0.025% (PM) \n\nHydroquinone 4% (PM spot treat) \n\nCerave Cream (AM/PM) \n\nAquaphor (PM) \n\nRohto Skin Aqua (AM) \n\nPS yeah it doesn’t look minimal at all, but I listen to my skin. If I feel like I could do without a product then I skip it. Most days I just tone, moisturise and SPF. \n\n**Cleansers (1st and 2nd cleansers)** \n\n•\tPyunkang Yul Cleanser (500ml) – BIG bottle.

The consistency and finish reminds me of the the biore watery essence but it's less stinging, more hydrating and even lighter in texture! I bought it on a whim and to this day I don't really see many reviews of it out there, except for [this one from Jolse](http://m.jolse.com/article/official-review/8/53635/) which I feel is pretty on point!

    "body": "Good day AusSkincare lurkers,\n\nOn my usual chemist warehouse trip yesterday, I was walking past the sunscreen aisle (my favourite aisle mind you), and I noticed something sitting within the Cancer Council sunscreens. To my surprise, a new sunscreen! The hydration boost spf50+. \n\nThis sunscreen is nothing like their other offerings in my opinion. The box for one, calling it a primer, as well as being marketed as skincare. Also, the price tag is very unlike cancer council, being $36.95 RRP ($25.69 here on sale). Now, I get my cancer council products for “free” through AHM private health, so you bet I picked it up immediately. \n\nWhen getting home and opening the box, I was a little shocked. The packaging is… Amazing? It is a lovely blue colour, and it is an airless pump! That’s a win in my books. It looks nothing like any other cancer council product. \n\nNow, I would categorise this product as an “upgraded” version of their iconic face day wear moisturiser (the pink tube one). The sunscreen ingredients in this are similar, however I love the inclusion of Bemotrizinol at 2%, arguably the best sunscreen ingredient the world has to offer. Looking at the ingredients list on the TGA website, this includes squalane, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin E as the skincare ingredient. I have no idea what “PolyFructol Plus” could mean looking at the ingredients, but someone please feel free to enlighten me. This sunscreen does feel moisturising enough for my balanced skin type. \n\nThe feel of this sunscreen is somewhere between the matte fluid and the pink tube. It’s lovely. And the finish is stated as “satin”, which I absolutely agree with. The “matte” fluid is not matte at all, so my trust with cancer council has been down, but this sunscreen looks absolutely beautiful on the skin. \n\nAll in all, this may become my new favourite sunscreen. It feels beautiful on the skin, has superb ingredients, and the packing is delightful. The pink tube may have been dethroned!\n\nIf you get a chance to try this sunscreen out let me know your thoughts!\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDuePerfomance ",

    "body": "I’ve been doing some trials for my wedding and the last thing I’m *really* struggling with is the fine lines under my eyes. I’m 34 and my skin errs on the dryer side; the second I set *anything* with a powder I feel like the lines become so much more obvious and everything looks dry and cakey! Do I *have* to use a setting powder? Does anyone have any tips or alternative techniques (maybe using setting sprays?) that can help lock under eye concealers in place and prevent fine lines or a crepey look?\n\nQuick Info:\n- Using the **Armani Luminous Silk Concealer** (Tarte Creamy Shape Tape used to be my HG, but it’s now too dry for me and they stopped making my shade :( I’ve also tried the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer, which was too dry and creased a lot on me.) Is the shade okay? I’ve really struggled to find something that’s the right color and performs well…\n- Skin prep is Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid Liquid Exfoliant and The Ordinary’s Squalene Oil in the undereye area the night before followed by slugging with Aquaphor. Morning routine is cleanser, face mask for hydration, BIOSSANCE\nSqualane + Copper Peptide Rapid Plumping Serum, and Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Cream for moisturizing. \n- Primer I did half **Smashbox** (right) and half the new **Estée Lauder Double Wear Primer** (left) so I welcome comments on if one looks better over the other!\n- Foundation is **Estée Lauder Double Wear.** I’ve also tried MUFE HD Skin (regular and hydra glow), NARS Light Reflecting, Haus Labs, Dior Backstage, L’Oréal True Match (regular and skin tint), and the Armani Luminous Silk foundations and felt the DW had the best shade match and performance.\n- Using **Charlotte Tillbury Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray**\n- Setting powder is **Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder**",

If you don't eat make up usually and just want something simple, your make up is nice.  You don't need to use a setting powder.  I like to use a setting spray instead to prevent transfer. For me,  your make up would be too everyday to the office make up. That's typically my everyday look.  Maybe add some lashes and accentuate the eyes with some shimmer?

Another technique I’ve used is applying powder, then gently and slowly pressing it in with a clean damp sponge, with a rolling motion. Before going without powder completely, I’d wear the face for a day and take pictures before and after, and test if it will transfer to darker fabrics (aka suits). \n\nAlso I had the exact same issues with my under eyes for my wedding make-up, and I ended up using the tiniest amount of foundation only exactly where I needed it under my eyes, no concealer, and none in that crinkly part near the inner corner. I tried so many brands, formulas, finishes, and techniques and nothing really looked how I wanted it. Using eye shadow primer on my under eyes and using powder were the most successful techniques though. I’d test over a full day though.",

Loose powder with a fluffy brush is harder to control and can easily fill those fine lines that everyone has in that area. Using a pressed powder and a beauty blender can help set the area without  adding too much texture. Setting spray is a great option as well, but I often found that it makes the skin quite shiny-which isn’t the nicest for photos. Enjoy your wedding day!!! You’ll be stunning",

I highly suggest you try the NARS light reflecting setting powder, or the Givenchy prisme libre powder! Both are fantastic on dry skin and they don’t give a super matte powdery look. The nars one is the most natural and lightweight, while the Givenchy gives you more brightening. Also, definitely use final seal from\nben nye - it will keep your makeup on all day!! Keep in mind that you need to set realistic expectations. Makeup will always look like makeup and if you have any fine lines it will eventually crease and settle. Some products are less prone to this and will last longer than others of course. If you find an artist whose work you really love and it’s the style you’re going for, TRUST THEM! They do this all the time and know how to make you look your best in person and for pictures 😊 hope this helps and sorry it was so long!",

That's just me tho :) The Cosrx is definitely weaker, but suitable for those with very sensitive skin who needs very slow exfoliation.   \n\n\n**QUESTION TIME!** \n\nDoes anyone know anything about JainaFace? How legit is this brand?   \nI have their 10% Glycolic Acid that doesn't even tingle on my face and seems to do nothing at all. Meanwhile, Cosrx AHA liquid, that has a lower percentage of free acid even, tingles. I suspect this brand to be a hoax but I'm not sure. Their 2% salicylic acid doesnt' really do anything for me either *(and I have spent 12 months testing out salicylic acids)*.  Same with a friend, she says she tried some products *(HA and some vitamin C stuff)* but that it didn't do anything for her face at all.   \nI contacted JainaFace a couple of months back to ask **1**. why they are allowed to use 2% salicylic acid in their products when the limit is 0.5% in Korea, and **2**. why there is next to zero information about this brand.  \nThe person who answered was nice enough but I find it shady that they don't want to market themselves... They claimed they would have to think about it, if it was true that people were starting to think they repackage and sell an American product, or that their products are generally fake/Chinese.  \nNothing's really happened except I saw they made a reddit account and posted a statement in  a reddit thread that they're not fake :P",

    "body": "This might sound weird, but hear me out. Absolutely every moisturizer I tried broke me out. Maybe it was the fatty acids, or the silicones, or some other unknown ingredient, but for the life of me I couldn't clear my skin up, and moisturizers were to blame.\n\nFinally, I had the idea to stop buying and trying new products, and kind of, \"DIY,\" my own.\n\nWhat I do is buy pure glycerin and petroleum jelly from the health/first aid section of the store, and 100% squalane from The Ordinary. (I don't think brand matters, just ingredients.)\n\n1. I wet my face and neck, then apply 2-3 drops of glycerin on my hands and spread it all over in a thin layer. Your face should be wet, not damp.\n2. Then, while my face is still damp, I apply four drops of squalane to my face and neck.\n3. On days I'm using tretinoin, I only apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly on my lips, neck, and around my eyes. On rest days, I apply it on the rest of my face as well.\n\nI also do short contact therapy (4-5 minutes) with a benzyol peroxide treatment.\n\nWith glycerin as the humectant, squalane as the emollient, and petroleum jelly as the occlusive, I've pretty much deconstructed an effective moisturizer, and for the first time in years, my skin is clear.\n\nI've been on accutane, antibiotics, spironolactone, sulfur soap, and practically every other treatment under the sun. The only thing that has made a permanent difference has been this deconstructed moisturizer routine. I now only get a pimple if I've been eating poorly.\n\nIf your skin is stupidly acne-prone or moisturizer sensitive like mine is, maybe try this out.",

The missing ingredient for me was the emollient step, and I found grapeseed oil to work best for me for now! Squalane doesn't work for me (my skin doesn't really love it the way it loves grapeseed or preferred argan oil - plus it caused quite a few obvious CCs) and I tried both Timeless and The Ordinary versions.  I didn't really like Rosehip oil either (also The Ordinary). Facial oils are a YMMV situation, but once I learned the difference between linoleic acid vs oleic acid, I was  able to pick the right oil for my skin condition. \n\nBut a drop or two of glycerin diluted in distilled water (my preference to tap) is what is genius and SHOULD work for everyone, and vaseline in a thin layer as a final simple occlusive is simple and perfect and what helps me on dry days.  \n  \nEven if my skin stops being so reactive I still may never go back to conventional moisturizers. \n\nCan I also recommend hypochlorous acid as a good post-cleansing, toner step?! Another simple ingredient that follows the philosophy while being skin pH balancing and antimicrobial, to boot.",

        "body": "glycerin is amazing. it is the main ingredient in cetaphil skin cleanser. It is also very moisturizing. I buy my own glycerin and use it to wash my face and lightly rinse. You don't need additional moisturizer. I also use Retin A every other night and use Vaseline around the eyes and under the nose as well. My skin is combination and what works is this routine plus sunblock. My dermatologist uses Vaseline and Retin A herself. Steaming at the gym and then swimming will really clear up your skin. I find steam rooms nicer to your skin than saunas. One other thing that will really do the trick: Get some French green clay from the coop or online, pull back hair, lightly massage olive oil or pat it on after steaming (you can do that over a pot), then apply the green clay- not too thick, but not too thin either. Lay down for 15 minutes. It works better if you are relaxed and not moving your facial muscles. Rinse with lukewarm-not hot water. Voila! It will pull shit out of your pores, trust me. Other oils to use: Safflower, Almond. I have even used salicylic acid face wash under the clay on really oily areas. Works like a charm. I am going to try glycerin under the clay. I used to work at a small company that sold health and beauty products and herbs to local coops. I was the tester. Most face products just don't really do the trick and the price point is often high. I started deconstructing products that DID work. Did you know that the most expensive face cream on the planet has a mineral oil base much like Vaseline? Vaseline does not clog my pores. I use it only at night around eyes. Finely ground oatmeal (coffee grinder or food mill) mixed with milk to form a paste is nice. Pat it on, rinse it off after a minute. Raw eggwhite is also excellent. Leave it on for 15, then shower it off. :) Hope this helps. If you can't afford retinA, get adapalene over the counter or online. You will not get acne scarring. I highly suggest this. Adapalene is what I had my acne prone students buy. Life changer.",

    "body": "***Preface:***  **I am** ***not*** **advocating for a maximalist routine in this post. I just want to share my experience! I also mix some products to make custom single-step products. I am also not advocating this, nor is this meant to be a how-to or any kind of DIY post.** \n\n***My skin profile:*** Dry to normal skin, dehydration prone, rosacea, mild acne (often hormonal), blackheads/open comedones on nose and chin with very rare CCs. Huge picker. Prone to both PIE + PIH which can be very stubborn! Fair skin. Lots of sun damage.\n\n***Climate + weather:*** \"Humid continental climate,\" but we aren't actually that humid! We just have a rainy season! Temps are well below freezing during winter, snow can be on the ground for more than half of the year, and \"rainy season\" with high humidity is maybe 1-2 months in between winter and fire season with moderate temps. I started my maximalist routine at the start of winter, which is still going strong here.\n\n>***Why did I decide to go maximalist?***\n\nIn brief, I was feeling burnt out with my current routine. At the time u/Commercial_Poem_4623 was enjoying some longer routines. I loved hearing her talk about it- and I was intrigued by some specific products. I was coming into winter, and I knew my typically drier, dehydrated skin would benefit from extra hydration. I got products to fill up my skin care-ousel and started going full maximalist at the start of November.\n\n>***How many steps + products does my routine have, and how long does it take?***\n\nMy AM routine usually consists of **9-18 steps with a max of \\~17 products,** growing over time. I usually will brush my teeth either after the cleansing steps *or* before sunscreen. I recently timed this routine at 15 steps, no masking (as I mask in the AM maybe once a week or so). With my teeth brushing (2 min 27 second), this routine took **11:50**. So, it is **little under 10 min without factoring in oral care.**\n\nMy PM routine is usually a bit longer with anywhere from **20-29 steps with a max of \\~26 different products**. I do all my oral care (brush teeth + floss + mouthwash) usually after exfoliants or toners. On the day I timed my routine, the overall time was **1 hr, 9 min, 30 seconds**. This includes the 5:19 for oral care, 19:44 for wash-off mask, and 30:11 for sheet masking, totaling 55:14 for these \"extras\". All other steps together took **14:16, so a little under 15 min without the masks or oral care.**\n\n**General Routine Info + Time Per Step:** (timing is only based on one trial)\n\nAM Routine:\n\n* Cleansing water + toner (2 steps, took 1:17)\n* Other toners (1-5 steps; took 2:20 for 4 steps, rinsed hands once)\n* Serums (3-6 steps; took 3:43 for 6 steps, note that I rinse my hands a few times during this)\n* Occasional sheet mask or eye+lip patches (0-1 steps; did not do this; usually will take \\~15-30 min)\n* Occlusive + moisturizing layers (2-4 steps; 2 steps when timing took 1:07)\n* Sunscreen (1 step, took 0:54).\n\nPM Routine:\n\n* Oil Cleanser (1 step, 2:20 , really rubbed it in)\n* Gel cleanser (1 step, 1:14)\n* Wash-off mask (1 step; this one I had to mix myself. It took 19:44 total: 4:23 to mix, 10:29 on my face, 4:52 to wash off)\n* Exfoliants (1-2 step, 1 step took 0:36) (note, it was a retinol night without dermaplaning)\n* Toners (4-8 steps, took 1:34 for 5 steps, did not rinse hands)\n* Rx Treatment + Serums (7-9 steps; took 5:19 for 8 steps, rinsed hands occasionally)\n* Sheet mask (1 step, 30:11)\n* Moisturizers + occlusive layers, including treatment oils (4-7 steps, depending on if you consider mixing two products at time of use as 1 or 2 steps. Took 4:03 for what I consider 6 steps).\n\n>***With so many products and steps, how much does this routine cost?***\n\nThe range is pretty substantial depending on what I'm counting  (base routine, masks, prescriptions, tools, sunscreen), what routine I'm counting (current has more steps than initial), + how much product loss I am considering. The comments have more detail + a link to a spreadsheet. My estimations come from *actual price I paid,* not the current MSRP or selling price on any particular website.\n\nWhen I first estimated, back in November I think, I estimated $1.42 counting sunscreen but no masks, prescriptions, or tools. For my current routine, estimates for a daily price range from **$1.67 on the very low end (base routine only, assuming I get every bit of product out) to $7.68 on the highest (including the extras, rx, most expensive products, and product loss).**\n\n* On the low end, the routine without masks, sunscreens, prescription, or tools I need to replace is about $1.67. This assumes no product loss. If I add in the cheapest masks, my Rx, average daily cost of consumable tools, and imperfect use of the most inexpensive sunscreen that I enjoy enough to use regularly, this is about $2.63/day\n* On the high end, assuming \\~10% product loss, the \"base routine\" is $1.86/day. Adding in the most expensive products (assuming loss + ideal use of the most expensive sunscreen that I own + have used), cost for a day can get up to $7.68! ($7.35 if we factor in only sunscreens currently in my rotation).\n\nA good chunk of that outrageous $7.68 comes from masks- my most expensive wash-off is $2.91/use (Zombie Beauty Zombie Pack, do not recommend btw), and my most expensive sheet mask is $1.47 (Celderma Crystal Skin Mask). However, when using my cheapest masks, daily masking is less expensive than either my AM or my PM routine alone. Sunscreen is my most expensive daily use product; considering only sunscreens in my current rotation, on an ideal regular day, cost can range from \\~$0.29/day to $0.65! The next most expensive is my prescription azelaic acid ($0.20/day) followed by my AM fullerene serum, coming in at $0.15/day w/ product loss. My cheapest product is my Purito Plainet Squalane Oil, which costs only about 1 cent per day.\n\n>***How did my skin react? Did my overall skin condition improve, stay the same, or get worse? How did each \"problem\" change?***\n\nOverall, I would say my skin got better during this time, but there are some areas where it's stayed the same. I don't think anything has really worsened. \n\n* **Hydration + dryness:** much improved. Due to the massive # of hydrating and occlusive steps, this shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody. My skin feels more regulated, hydrated, and supple with no dry or rough patches. I used to say my skin was dry, and just prior to starting this routine I called it dry to normal. With this routine, my skin feels far more normal.\n* **Acne:** maybe a little better in terms of comedones (nose and chin) + my spots seem to heal faster, but overall not a lot of change in frequency of breakouts, and purging + other factors complicate this. I still extract my blackheads once a week or so, but I don't have to do it as often, and when I do, there is overall less there. I still breakout from time to time- around my period, after acid masks or changes to actives (ie, purging), or when I stop taking my oral B5. I also still have some random breakouts on my face when several areas on my body also break out (sometimes I will have \"whole body breakouts\" with scalp, face, and arm/shoulder involvement in particular, sometimes even on my legs). Sadly, I have also started to suspect some products are contributing to facial breakouts, and that is a general downside to going full-in maximalist. When you don't add every single product in slowly, it's harder to find which specific products cause problems.\n* **Purging:** yeah it happened with adding actives, and still does a bit as I'm still working stuff in- November I was still adding in my Isntree AHA, then in December I started with retinol and increased concentration in Jan, and this month I added a 10% BHA. It's getting better overall, but I always expect some purging when adding a new active, going up strength, or using more frequently.\n* **Rosacea:** redness + reactivity has improved a bit, but still flares with environmental triggers. Telangiectasias seem unchanged.  Since I was already wearing sunscreen regularly, I believe this is mostly from improved consistency with my Rx azelaic acid, with a little bit of help from the Cos de Baha.\n* **PIE and PIH:** mild improvement. Less with what is already there and more with reducing new spots. I have one very stubborn sport of PIE from an acne spot from October- it was picked raw, and has been slowly healing, but I can't say this is any faster than normal for me.\n* **Sun damage:** no noticed improvement, unsurprisingly, but the positive is I haven't noticed any worse general freckling.\n* **General skin texture:** some improvement in forehead + chin, but not perfect (and that is okay; skin is skin, not plastic). Improvement in my cheeks comes down to a rosacea thing, I think. I haven't noticed a change in texture during flares- just reduced flares. Since I don't pay attention to any wrinkles, I can't talk about that.\n\n>***Did I encounter any problems with the products absorbing into my skin?***\n\nMy skin never had a problem sucking in all that water/hydration. Obviously, it's skin and is not going to dry instantly. However, at most, it would only take me a couple min for a product to dry. My house is usually about 35% relative humidity in the winter, so it's easy for my skin to dry. I also don't use a ton of product in terms of mL. Some people will use 0.5-1mL of product directly on their face *or more* for a single step/layer. My hydrating layers are usually 0.15-0.2 mL, and moisturizing layers maybe up to 0.25mL. Overall, I only use \\~3.5mL of leave-on layers (not counting whatever sticks from a sheet mask), and with how divided they are, they do dry quite a bit.\n\n>***What was the hardest part of establishing a routine this size?***\n\nMy ability to remember my routine / not forget certain steps. Since forming habits is difficult for me, I assumed I would have to consciously remember every step, every day. This was true for the first couple of weeks. Keeping my products visible + lining them up in order of use help tremendously. Ironically, it's been easier to remember my full routine now than it ever was to remember a minimalist routine. \n\nThe two problems I still have here: 1) remembering eye cream (they are less visible, and I'm not an eye cream person in general) and, 2) using multiple layers of the same product (I will forget how many layers I've done already, which is why I don't do more than 2 layers).\n\n>***How did I manage travel? Did my routine change at all?***\n\nBecause my products are decanted into smaller bottles (10mL for serums, 50mL for essences, 30mL for cleansers + creams and such, and small pots for masks), travel isn't that hard with them. I can put all my typical AM stuff into one cosmetic bag + all my PM stuff into another. Things that are used during \"both\" would usually first go into a PM bag after I used them in the morning.\n\nThe hardest part of skincare during travel was staying consistent without my typical \"cues.\" As I said before, keeping products visible and lining them up before I start a routine are two crucial aspects to remembering my whole routine. During travel, I don't always have those options. When I couldn't \"line them up\" and had to keep them in my bags or in a medicine cabinet, I often would forget. I didn't intentionally change my routine, or specifically leave out any certain product, but my routine naturally changed depending on what I forgot/could remember.\n\n>***Did I experience burn-out? How did I manage this?***\n\nI absolutely experienced some burn-out, but I burn out from short routines too! While masking + tracking (the most time intensive parts) contributed to the burn-out during this time, most of my burn-out is from boredom, actually.\n\nWhen it came to tracking my usage, I burnt out a lot until I established a good tracking method. I tried daily tracking with images + charting problem areas, and while that was fun at first, it was too much work and I quickly dropped that. Now, I use a habit tracker in a digital journal using fun colorful dots, a bit like a sticker chart, but I also will write in how many drops/pumps I used. I have a pretty standard amount I use for each product, so I don't have to fill in the tracker every day anymore. Usually, I fill in my tracker maybe once or twice a week *or* when I have a deviation from my norm.\n\nFor boredom, as I've mentioned a ton, I don't do routine well. Spontaneous variability or newness is more exciting. Towards the end of each month, novelty from changes I made at the start of the month faded, and I would get bored with the routine. I also would plan masks each day, which contributed to that boredom. The time it took (especially to mask) was rarely the issue. I just didn't find the same joy. In this cases, I often would just stop all together for a little bit. Usually after a week or so, when my skin started to get more dehydrated and textured, I'd get more blackheads on my nose, and my rosacea would flare, skin would look dull, that is when I would want to start my routine again.\n\n>***Overall, was it worth it?***\n\nOn the whole, I'm glad I did this. Ironically, this has helped me stay far more consistent with skincare in general. It was a fun 'experiment,' and the typical enjoyment I took out of it all- even the masking- made the time investment worthwhile. The massive improvement in hydration levels alone was absolutely worth the work and cost overall. However, some products (like the \\~$3 single use wash off masks) absolutely were *not* worth it. I'm not sure if *daily* masking (especially both wash-off *and* sheet masks) are totally worth the cost in general. And, I also am not sure *so many sheet masks* are worth the potential environmental impact- but I'm not as educated on that, so idk.\n\n>***What changes am I making going forward? Do I plan to keep up maximalism? What am I giving up?***\n\nI plan to stay maximalist as long as I can, though I feel like I'm at my \"peak\" for # of layers (especially serums). I should have enough product to keep this routine or similar for a little while, up to a few months, and then I'll be forced to consider bigger changes. I start school this summer, and it's expensive, so I can't keep up the cost of the base routine. I will inevitably have to give up some products. This saddens me because my skin genuinely loves all of this hydration+moisture!\n\nI am considering setting up a \"burn out\" (more minimalist) routine- something that I can do maybe in 5-10 min that I can use when I just can't bring myself to do the full thing for whatever reason. This will likely serve as the \"base routine\" when I start school, but I still need to talk to my husband about budgeting for skincare.  I'm still sorting it all out.\n\nAlso, starting in March, I am dropping *planned* daily masking. I may still end up doing both wash-off and sheet masks regularly!  However, in general, *option* instead of *obligation* improves my satisfaction, so I think it will improve my satisfaction with masking. Also, by not planning masks in advance as well,  I'm hoping masks will feel more like intentional self-care.",

Thank you for this you give me motivation to track my own routine more comprehensively!\n\nI also wanted to ask what do you use for your digital habit tracker? :) I've been wanting to use something like that for skincare too",

    "body": "I've struggled with acne throughout most of my twenties (now closing in on 30) but within the past couple of years it had gotten much worse. A new cyst would pop up on my forehead every couple of weeks and then take weeks to heal, leaving behind scars (some indented) and hyperpigmentation. \n\nIn the past, I had tried benzoyl peroxide 2.5% as a leave-on treatment overnight. It did work, but resulted in horrible irritation and chemical burns. So I ruled out the use of benzoyl peroxide when my acne started to flair up these last couple of years. Instead, I approached it with a \"throw everything at it and see what sticks\" approach. Azaelic acid, salicylic acid, different moisturizers, suncreens, and oils; you name it, I tried it. \n\nI was becoming desperate, so I started using Retin-A last year. Even with Retin-A, my forehead was still breaking out in cystic acne. A few months ago I came across an article on Simple Skincare Science that recommended using benzoyl peroxide as a contact treatment for those who are unable to tolerate it due to irritation. This basically means leaving the benzoyl peroxide on for a few minutes and then rinsing it off.\n\nSince using the benzoyl peroxide as a contact therapy, I've been 95% breakout free for 3 months. I still get the occasional white head on my cheeks, but I've zero cystic pimples (!!!). \n\nI'm still kicking myself for not finding that article and trying this sooner. I could have saved myself from a lifetime of scars (I'm not sure if the indented areas will ever fade :(   .....)\n\nI just wanted to post this for those of you who are unable to tolerate benzoyl peroxide as a leave-on treatment. I hope you find this method as effective as I have. \n\nHere's my full routine:\n\nAM: \n\n-Cleanse with Vanicream cleanser\n\n-Apply benzoyl peroxide to entire face (currently using Acne.org benzoyl peroxide, but any will do), leave on for 3-5 minutes, and rinse.\n\n-If not going out into the sun, apply Vanicream Lite lotion. \n\n-If going out, only apply Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk sunscreen.\n\nPM:\n\n-If wore sunscreen, wipe with micellar water\n\n-Cleanse with Vanicream cleanser\n\n-Retin-A 0.5% approximately 5x per week\n\n-Vanicream Lite lotion\n\n-Squalane oil if used Retin-A",

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST.

If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ☺️\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out 🙃)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench – 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure.

These products may contain other ingredients that irritate your particular skin type, such as squalane, aloe, or silicones. Please remember to *always patch test* when starting new products, and begin things one at a time!\n\nI'd like to add that most of these alcohols are found in conjunction with cetearth-20, which is what makes many common creams a problem for people. Some people may find they cannot use any fatty alcohols, while others may find they do fine with them *as long as they are not found in conjunction to cetearth-20.*\n\n---\n\n**Sunscreens**\n\n* [Elta

Whne looking for cleansers without these ingredients, do I *just* have to look for them, or any others too? \n\nIf you wouldn't mind double checking for me, I'm pretty sure the Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Milk is ok based on the [ingredients listed here](http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=82122/Take-the-Day-Off-Cleansing-Milk/Clinique/Cleansers). Do you agree?\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n**Edit**: One more :P The ingredients of the Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Oil are as follows:\n\n> Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Triethylhexanoin, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Polybutene, PEG-8 Diisostearate, PEG-12 Diisostearate, PPG-15 Stearyl Ether, Water/Aqua/Eau, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycerin, Anthemis Nobius (Chamomile), Caprylyl Glycol, Glyceryl Laurate, BHT\n[MFG DATE: 06/2008]\n\nIs that first ingredient bad (I only mean bad as in the context of this post, for people who have issues with these ingredients)?",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "**FIRST AND FOREMOST, I AM NOT A SCIENTIST OR A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL.**\n\n**I work in the consulting industry and I am hired to lead research efforts for the corporate side of consumer packaged goods companies (food, snacks, personal care, etc.)**\n\n**When I am working for a beauty client, my job mostly includes interviewing dermatologists, scientists, chemists, plastic surgeons, and estheticians around the world. Interviews can be as simple as a click-through survey I have to integrate into a report, or as intense as clinic/lab shadowing with a lot of recording, writing, and questioning.**\n\n**Please note that your mileage will always vary with skincare, and that my advice below is meant to be generic. Everyone's skin is different and everyone will have a different journey with the \\*Tre voice\\* ingredientses I'm about to discuss. I am not trying to offer medical advice or start a debate. I don't even follow some of the advice below because I know my skin very well.**\n\n**I am also not getting paid by anyone to post this. I'm just here to let you know what I think my clients would have to say about Gina's new line.**\n\n**Also, I hope you're hearing Tre mispronounce \"cumin\" right now.**\n\n—\n\nTo make this as simple as possible, I've listed Gina's products below, with the active ingredients (referred to as \"actives\" below) that she has highlighted on her website.\n\n**Blemish Set:**\n\n1. **Blemish Cleanser:**\n   1. **Salicylic acid:** arguably the most common acne treatment in the world, this is typically the Western consumer's first intro to skincare via Neutrogena, Clean and Clear, Biore, etc. I find it strange that Gina doesn't list the percentage amount (1%? 30%? that's a big difference) because that is the smartest way for the consumer to control how many irritants go on their skin at once.\n   2. **Glycolic acid:** a really common exfoliant, but *that does not make it gentle*. I don't recommend starting with glycolic acid as your first AHA.\n   3. **Lactic acid:** *another* AHA exfoliant that is usually much gentler than glycolic acid, but they are *strong* when combined. This combination of AHAs isn't uncommon but it is not for sensitive skin. Again, there is no percentage available to let you know the balance of these ingredients in the wash.\n2. **Hyaluronic Acid Serum:**\n   1. **Hyaluronic acid:** this is purported to be a miracle ingredient for retaining moisture in your skin by every major skincare brand and publication right now. What Gina's website doesn't tell you: HA works by pulling moisture from the air and absorbing it into your skin. If you live in a dry climate, *it may actually dry your skin out further.* The addition of HA makes this even less of a one-size-fits-all routine than the AHA combination and I'm curious if Gina herself would even use this during a trip to the desert.\n3. **Reservatrol Hydra Surge Serum:**\n   1. **Reservatrol:** okay, admittedly, the only thing I know about this is that Brooks Ayers claimed it cured cancer. It was a fad ingredient that has largely fallen out of the headlines, skincare commercials, and client work that I oversee. Regardless, I think we can look at Terry Dubrow's face and see that he is *not* relying on reservatrol for miracle anti-aging benefits.\n   2. **Peptides:** another trendy ingredient that claims to return collagen and elastin to aging skin, but the research is still fresh. I am not anti-peptides, but I simply haven't seen enough data from my research to believe that a super presence of peptides would make such a strong acne treatment more bearable on the skin.\n4. **Blemish Peel Pads:**\n   1. **Salicylic acid** (above)\n   2. **Lactic acid** (above)\n   3. **Mandelic acid:** *another* AHA in the Blemish routine? Yup...and Gina even goes so far as to write on her website that we are prone to forgetting to exfoliate. About that: her cleanser is already exfoliating the fuck out of your face! You don't need more layers of acids. You need a MOISTURIZER and a SUNSCREEN. Guess what this set doesn't have?!?\n   4. **Willow bark:** Gina claims it fights photodamage, but willow bark is exactly what salicylic acid (and aspirin!) are derived from, so it shouldn't be surprising that it can calm down inflamed and painful skin. As for fighting sun damage, I've seen very little evidence to believe that it has any effect on that.\n   5. **Chamomile:** a common soothing ingredient used in skincare, essential oils, and teas.\n   6. **Witch hazel:** another common skincare ingredient used to reduce redness and irritation. Also a very common irritant that may dry out or inflame your skin.\n\n* **Verdict for the Blemish set: overpriced, over-exfoliating, and incomplete. Gina isn't entirely honest about hyaluronic acid and outright lies to you about the level of exfoliation you're enduring in her own web copy.**\n* **You can find a dermatologist-recommended salicylic acid cleanser, hyaluronic serum, peptide serum, and AHA peel (without the waste of pads!) for under $20 each. If you buy a moisturizer and a sunscreen for under $20 each, you are still saving $40 and getting way more product.**\n\n**Combination Set:**\n\n1. **Rosehip Wash:** I just want to flag that Gina immediately advertises this as a foaming cleanser, which is not always appropriate for combination skin. It may relieve oily spots, but it could also further strip dry patches. I find it strange that she gave the Blemish wash a \"lotion\" texture, but made the combo wash foam. It seems like it's backwards, since blemish-prone skin tends to be oily all over. As a businesswoman with lots of experience in beauty, I am curious if subverting this common-around-the-world model was meant to be a marketing gimmick that they didn't flesh out in the web copy.\n   1. **Rosehip oil:** this is a very popular ingredient for skin that is experiencing dryness and dullness. Rosehip oil is naturally full of Vitamin A, which is a very powerful exfoliant, and Vitamin C, which is a golden ingredient for mild acne and dark spots. At face value, this combo sounds great, but Gina doesn't tell you that you *have* to use sunscreen when using Vitamins A and C. Again, guess what isn't included in this set. I also want to flag that rosehip ingredients are *very* common irritants, especially to sensitive skin and skin with many known allergies. My last flag here is that most rosehip skincare products have artificial fragrance, which is one of the most common irritants in cosmetics around the world.\n   2. **Seaweed extract:** this is a \"superfood\" that is frequently included in \"green\" and \"vegan\" skincare products since people associate seaweed with healthy diets. I have had scientists tell me everything from \"it's a mega moisturizer\" to \"it's a gentle way to deliver nutrients to the skin\" to \"it's a Kbeauty scam,\" so there isn't a strong consensus on what it's supposed to do for you or how well it does it. Gina claims it's full of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and antioxidants for your skin, and I won't argue with her. I've definitely heard that before! But I should flag that seaweed moisturizes like hyaluronic acid does, which means it may not be appropriate or effective in dry climates.\n   3. **Rosewater:** frequently sold as a moisturizing ingredient, rosewater *is* effective but still carries the allergy/fragrance risk I mentioned under rosehip oil. Also flagging that Gina herself mentions the fragrance on her website, so she's not even trying to hide the most common irritant in this product.\n2. **Vita Brightening Serum:** this is the first product I've seen of Gina's that actually makes sense to me in terms of formulation and chemistry, so I truly can't shit on the entire regimen.\n   1. **Vitamin C:** (covered above under rosehip oil)\n   2. **Vitamin B5:** a vitamin that works similarly to hyaluronic acid by absorbing environmental moisture, but also has the benefit of being an emollient, meaning that it directly provides moisture, too. This is a more universal moisturizing ingredient, so that's a plus.\n   3. **Vitamin E:** another great moisturizing ingredient that enables Vitamin C's glow, so this combination of ingredients actually makes sense to me.\n   4. **Ferulic Acid:** an antioxidant that boosts the effects of Vitamin C and Vitamin E. Again, this serum makes a lot of sense to me and is named appropriately as a brightening agent.\n3. **Reservatrol Hydra Surge Serum:** (above)\n4. **Blemish Peel Pads** (above)\n\n* **Verdict for the Combination set: overpriced, incomplete, and full of common irritants and allergens.**\n* **Again, you can find better products with these ingredients for under $20 each, and if you add the moisturizer and sunscreen that you need, you are still saving $40 and getting way more product.**\n\n**Dry Skin Set:**\n\n1. **Beyond Calm Milk Cleanser:**\n   1. **Coconut oil:** NO! NO! NO! Coconut oil is widely recognized as one of the most irritating, comedogenic (pore-clogging), greasiest ingredients out there. It is practically a Western beauty rite of passage to use coconut oil as a makeup remover or moisturizer and to deal with the resulting breakouts afterward. It is also very likely that this product will be fragranced. JUST SAY NO TO COCONUT OIL. DO NOT TAKE YOUR SKINCARE ADVICE FROM DIY PINTEREST BOARDS. (Jonathan Van Ness is on my shitlist for recommending this on Queer Eye, too.)\n   2. **Chamomile:** (above)\n   3. **Safflower oil**: a much gentler and more neutral oil that is rich in Vitamin E. I wouldn't recommend safflower oil as my go-to facial cleansing oil, but I think literally anything is better than coconut oil for the masses.\n2. **Essential Peptides Serum:**\n   1. **Peptides** (above)\n   2. **Hyaluronic acid** (above)\n   3. **Seaweed** (above)\n3. **Intensive Hyaluronic Cream:** an actual moisturizer, not a serum!\n   1. **Xylitol, Xylitylgulucoside, Anhydroxylitol:** these are pulled from sugar and, according to Gina's website, \"allows for moisture circulation throughout all layers of skin and strengthens skin's barrier function to limit transepidermal water loss.\" What a word salad. To be perfectly transparent, I had to look up all of these to realize that I know these compounds as \"Aquaxyl.\" This is a common moisturizing ingredient that I don't have a true problem with, but I have noticed that it is mostly advertised by pricy brands that have enormous marketing platforms, like Tatcha, Paula's Choice, Glossier, and Murad. Because Gina is pricing herself even higher than these products, and because she used so many twenty-five cent words to explain what it does, I encourage all consumers to exercise caution and trust your gut about what these brands are actually trying to do for you.\n   2. **Hyaluronic Acid:** (above)\n   3. **Squalane:** rapidly becoming a very popular product, squalane is derived from fat in plants. It produces a rich oil that many people experience great benefits from: moisture, clarity, smoothness, and brightness. That said, anything oil-based can be irritating on your skin, so there is potential here for it to take a hard left turn on sensitive skin and hormonal acne-stricken skin.\n4. **Radiant Peel Pads** (above)\n\n* **Verdict for the Dry Skin set: overpriced, incomplete (where is the sunscreen?), and full of even more common irritants and allergens than the Combo set.**\n* **Again AGAIN, you can find better products with these ingredients for under $20 each, and if you add the sunscreen that you need, you are still saving $60 and getting way more product!**\n\n**Overall verdict? Skip CaraGala** and look for **salicylic acid**, **vitamin C**, **vitamin E**, and **emollient moisturizers** from dermatologist-recommended lines like CeraVe, Olay, Neutrogena, Aveeno, The Ordinary, and La Roche Posay.\n\n**If you want to try the other ingredients here,** purchase products from the above brands and patch test them behind your ear or on your wrist.\n\n**THIS SKINCARE IS NOT WORTH $160, AND THE LARGEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD WOULD NOT CHARGE $160 FOR THIS.**\n\n**ONE MORE IMPORTANT THING: GINA OFFERS TO LET YOU SIGN UP FOR A DISCOUNT BY SUBSCRIBING AND PAYING A MONTHLY FEE. LOOK UP CRITICISM OF RODAN AND FIELDS SKINCARE AND CRITICISM OF SAVAGE X FENTY LINGERIE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS PREDATORY.**\n\n**Also adding the return policy because this shit is important: 30 days, application to return, buyer is responsible for all shipping fees. Regimen sets must be unopened and complete. Free gifts given by CaraGala must be returned. Items marked as promos and final sales cannot be returned. Refunds may be given as store credit. CaraGala recommends purchasing shipping insurance.**",

The way I understand exfoliating is removing dead skin cells so that they don’t clog pores. I was always told by my derm that exfoliating after the chemical peel action of glycolic becomes more important because the glycol is causing more dead skin cells in action. So you would use either a mildly abrasive pad to wash/exfoliate the dead skin cells, or perhaps a scrub would do same. \n\nJust pointing out the glycol doesn’t so much exfoliate, but does cause added need for exfoliation, actually accomplished with either a scrub or a cleansing pad to slough/exfoliate dead skin cells",

That being said, y’all don’t need to continue leaving comments about how I needed to make sure the castor oil was cold-pressed, organic, hexane free, and in a dark glass bottle. I did all of that and purchased it from a well-reviewed seller, it just didn’t work for ME.  \n\nAlso, I cleared up the malassezia overgrowth and my skin looks the best it’s ever looked!

        "body": "Something everybody’s missing with the castor oil “it ruined my skin” or “I break out like crazy” is that it kills the Demodex face mite. Everyone has them and they live particularly in the eyebrow so when you notice you’re breaking out around your eyebrow after castor oil in a perfect arch, that’s why. As they die, they release 13+ different strains of bacteria, one of them is staph. That’s what causes the excessive whiteheads. If you kill a lot at one time, you can literally trigger an inflammatory response, which will trigger all kinds of problems afterwards like eczema and I guess in this case, the lady got fungal acne. Is castor oil bad? No! However, you should dilute it and go slow because you can have a rapid die off of the mite and all the problems that follow afterwards. Of course you could have an allergy too, but that would be more symptoms of redness and itching or burning immediately after you put it on or within 24 hours. Hope that clears everything up for everyone. I put it on my eyebrows on purpose to kill those little suckers, but I had to pull back when many of them were dying at once. Gross but real. However, since I’ve been working on killing the mite, my acne, which I have had my whole life is finally going away. So for me, I’m guessing the mite and it’s bacteria (which also includes the bacteria that causes acne) was a big culprit all along. Oddly enough, I also was getting nerve pain above one of my eyebrows, and that went away too. As we get older, we get small infestations if we don’t keep them under control which can lead to other inflammatory conditions, like rosacea ….psoriasis. There’s an entire list of them and again they are the main suspect in individual and unique (everybody’s different) inflammatory skin immune responses to those little stupid mites! I suspect dandruff and severe scalp problems are also triggered by them if that’s how YOUR body’s immune system chooses to react to their presence. They also live on the scalp.",

So it's crucial to support your detox when you use castor oil (drink warm water, use sauna, use binders, drink milk thistle tea). \n\nIn my opinion if you have history of acne I wouldn't use castor oil on the face. Use it as a pack on the liver instead, to cleanse it. \n\nHope it helps somebody :)",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

I add my $7 oil to my cart and start hunting for a few more things to add so I can get to $35 for free shipping. Because who in their right mind pays for shipping?!?!? Well I paid for shipping today my friends. After over 30 minutes of tinkering with my cart and adding and deleting things I really don’t need or want, I decided to stop the madness and pay $5 for shipping. My total order with tax was $13 opposed to $38. Its a win-win-win, I got what I actually needed, I got what I really wanted, and I spent less money. ",

    "body": "So I've finally had a lot of success with my skin recently, as far as significantly reducing any breakouts, keeping my skin hydrated and reducing acne marks. I've been a skincare junkie for a long time, but I feel like the world of skincare can be so overwhelming with so much information that my routine is frequently being modified.\n\nI am a 23 year old female with dry/dehydrated skin, living in a dry, hot desert climate. My skin is not sensitive at all. I have minor breakouts, but my skin is light (Fenty beauty foundation 150) so long after pimples have gone sometimes they leave red marks that last for a long time. 4 years ago I went on 1 round of accutane for mild cystic acne and it successfully reduced my cystic acne and breakouts, but didn't completely clear my skin. Now if I do get a breakout, it's on my cheeks (closer to my hairline) and around my jaw and chin. I usually have one pimple at a time, nothing cystic but annoying enough. I've really reduced the amount of picking that I do with my skin and it's helped with the marks on my skin. I also tend to breakout when I travel.\n\nRecently, I have created a routine where I haven't broken out for a couple of weeks (even with travel), and thought I'd review some of the products I've used frequently throughout these years on my quest for hydrated, healthy skin.\n\nCurrent routine:\n\n* AM\n   * rinse with water\n   * First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner\n   * COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence\n   * Drunk Elephant C-Firma Day Serum (Vitamin C)\n   * First Aid Beauty Hello FAB Coconut Skin Smoothie Priming Moisturizer\n   * Papa Recipe Honey Moist Sun Essence SPF 50+PA+++\n* PM\n   * Banila Co Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Original\n   * Then I Met You Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel\n   * COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence\n   * Rotate Nightly: \n      * Farmacy HONEYMOON GLOW AHA Resurfacing Night Serum with Hydrating Honey + Gentle Flower Acids\n      * The Inkey List Retinol Serum\n   * Etude House SoonJung Cica Balm-Panthensoside 5\n* Use as needed, either AM or PM\n   * The Ordinary 100% Virgin Cold Pressed Marula Oil\n   * The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%\n   * Stratia Rewind\n   * The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5\n\nREVIEWS OF PAST PRODUCTS, AND WHY I'VE CHANGED THEM + CURRENT PRODUCTS :\n\n**Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner ($45)**: This was the toner I used every morning once I decided I wasn't going to cleanse my face in the AM. It didn't have alcohol and was pretty looking! I used this for about 1.5-2 years before I realized that this was pointless on my skin, and the fragrance was just doing more harm than good. It's so expensive and it's basically fragranced water, which would end up sensitizing my skin over time. **Overall rating: 1/5** because aside from looking pretty and smelling good, is this actual skincare? \n\nSo in my quest to find an actual useful toner with no alcohol, fragrance, and actually did something.... \n\n**First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner ($22):** For half the price of the Fresh Toner, and actual great ingredients. This has almost a milky look and feel to it and it actually hydrates my skin significantly well. The hydration is lightweight, so perfect after rinsing my face with water. It has squalene, a great ingredient for me, plus actual effective ingredients, no fragrance, and no problematic ingredients such as alcohol or witch hazel which can be harsh in a toner. **Overall rating: 5/5**\n\n**COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ($21)**: I've always wanted to try an essence after hearing about them recently, although not all essence is the same. Some are made to be a glorified serum while others are made purposefully to help products on top absorb deeper into the skin. I was intrigued by the snail mucin. I really love the product. It adds instant hydration with no fragrance (which would probably skeev me out a bit with the snail mucin). It says to apply under any serums, and right after cleansing, so that's what I do. I've wanted to try the Tatcha Essence, as it looks pretty good, however it is really quite pricey. Still, the two essences seem to do different things: The COSRX one is good for hydration and repairing, and the Tatcha one seems to be something to help products used on top of it absorb much better. Maybe I'll have to check out the Tatcha one eventually. **Overall rating: 4/5** \n\n**Drunk Elephant C-Firma Day Serum ($80)**: This is a holy grail product that I've been using for years. It's such a great formula, the only downside is the price. Still, I have yet to find a product that has such powerhouse ingredients. I know some people love TO Vitamin C, but it's so one-noted. The packaging keeps it stable, plus there are other great antioxidants and ingredients (Vitamin D, Pumpkin Ferment, Pomegranate Extract and hydrates). This keeps my skin bright and even. **Overall rating: 5/5**\n\n**Drunk Elephant Lala Retro Whipped Moisturizer with Ceramides ($60)**: I do really like this product, and I haven't had an issue with any DE products- I can count on their formulations. I've repurchased this 2 or 3 times, but I just felt that I went through it so quickly and I could find other great moisturizers on the market for the price. Just using it alone, it doesn't hydrate enough for me, but with TO hyaluronic acid, marula oil and my other hydrating products (of which there are a lot) it worked fine. Good, but I wanted something more hydrating and preferably cheaper. **Overall rating: 4/5**\n\nSo I found...\n\n**First Aid Beauty Hello FAB Coconut Skin Smoothie Priming Moisturizer ($28)**: Such a great daytime moisturizer. I was always scared of the word \"lightweight\" because that always translated to me as semi-hydrating when I could put straight shea butter on my face and my skin would eventually absorb that. But this is amazing. It's so so moisturizing but not in that heavy, thick way. So it's light weight, but as moisturizing as some of my other more thicker products. This paired with other hydrating ingredients keeps your skin glowy all day. It's also a clean product. I use it under my sunscreen- so more of a moisturizer and less of a primer. (I don't really use makeup primers because I don't need pore-filling ones- I usually just prime with a good moisturizer anyway). Also the price is right! **Overall rating: 5/5**\n\n**Papa Recipe Honey Moist Sun Essence SPF 50+PA+++ ($19):** I'm sort of obsessed with sunscreen and I've done a ton of research on physical vs. chemical and the different ingredients (curtesy of the sidebar). Although I'm definitely still not an expert, I'm loving this formula. I've officially converted to sunscreen from Asian brands. It leaves no white cast, with no crazy smells. Plus it's moisturizing, with SPF 50 and PA+++! Love it. **Overall rating: 5/5**\n\nI used to use...\n\n**ROHTO Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk (SPF50 PA ++++) 40mL ($13.86 on Amazon)**: I also really liked this sunscreen, and I found it via the subreddit. It had a thinner, milk-like look and consistency. It was also quite nice. I really mainly switched to the Papa Recipe one because the packaging and marketing looked nicer (and what can I say... I still like my nice packaging). There was no white cast to this one either. It's kind of hard for me to review sunscreen because I don't have a UV thing to test really scientifically, I just go based on feel, absorption, white cast, and effectiveness as far as I can tell. **Overall rating: 5/5** \n\n**Australian Gold Botanical Sunscreen Tinted Face Mineral Lotion, Broad Spectrum, Water Resistant, SPF 50 ($9 on Amazon)**: This is a known favorite by some. I did really like it. Of the three sunscreens I'm reviewing, this had the thickest texture. It was tinted so there was no white cast. I felt that I could get more sophisticated formulas with the other sunscreens so I upgraded. Still, it's a worthy choice. I also prefer sunscreens with both mineral and chemical sunscreens, and this one only had mineral (physical) sunscreen ingredients. **Overall rating: 3.5/5**. Good, but there are better formulas out there.\n\nAt night I double cleanse now- as I think it adds hydration to my skin while cleansing, and is much more effective than using a normal cleanser.\n\n**Korres Greek Yoghurt Foaming Cream Cleanser ($26)**: I do like this cleanser, however recently it's started to sting my eyes. It's fairly effective, but it wouldn't completely remove all my face makeup. There's some fragrance in here, which isn't the best, but fragrance in cleansers isn't a huge deal because you rinse it off. I still use this occasionally if I didn't wear makeup that day but I probably wouldn't repurchase. **Overall rating: 3/5**\n\n**Then I Met You Living Cleansing Balm ($38)**: My first cleansing balm! It was much more effective at cleansing my skin, however it's really pricey and you can only get it on their website. It's nice but for oils that you need to just break down makeup and then rinse off, it's pricey. **Overall rating: 4/5**\n\n**Banila Co Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Original ($19**): I've been loving this! It's effective at removing all makeup. Also, it is SO nice that it has a little insert to store the scooper thing in so it doesn't get all over the product. It's inexpensive as well! **Overall rating: 4.5/5**\n\n**Then I Met You Then I Met You Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel ($36)**: I really love this cleanser. Again, it's pricey, but it doesn't irritate my eyes and works really great as part 2 in my 2 part cleanse. It has a thick gel consistency. With cleansers, as long as they don't irritate, don't strip my skin and are effective, I'm happy. I don't know if I'll repurchase just because I can't buy it from Sephora and I have to pay shipping on the already pricey product. I may start looking over on Soko Glam for a cheaper alternative after I run out, but this one is pretty nice. **Overall rating: 4.5/5**\n\nExfoliating is a huge part of my routine, and a few years ago, I completely ditched physical exfoliating and went for chemical exfoliating, and I'm glad I did. \n\n**Drunk Elephant T.L.C. Framboos Glycolic Resurfacing Night Serum ($90)**: This used to be a holy grail product for me, but now my skin has stopped improving because of it. I could totally tell a difference when I didn't use it for a week, but I felt like my skin still had a ways to go. Plus, it's super expensive. Still, it has a high percentage of AHAs and BHAs. I love how it includes both AHAs and BHAs. My skin has just plateaued on it. I would recommend you to try it if you are new to AHAs and BHAs, I've just used it for a couple of years and need a change. I also bought my brother this as his first exfoliant and I can tell a difference with his skin. **Overall rating: 4/5**\n\nSo I tried...\n\n**Farmacy HONEYMOON GLOW AHA Resurfacing Night Serum with Hydrating Honey + Gentle Flower Acids ($58)**: I LOVE THIS. It has a slightly stronger formulation than the DE serum but since starting this mixed with my retinol, I haven't broken out once. Since my skin is not sensitive, I think that this is the kick my skin needed. I use it every other night, switching with my Retinol. I also love the plant extracts in this, and the fact that it's more than $30 cheaper than the DE alternative. **Overall rating: 5/5**\n\n**The Inkey List Retinol Serum ($9.99)**: What a bang for your buck. A 1% retinol serum with \"RetiStar stabilised Retinol 1% and Granactive Retinoid .5%\" along with squalane. This along with the aforementioned product I think are the two products that have prevented my breakouts and have made my skin look so healthy. Retinol is such a powerhouse product and I think that this is a great cheap starter. **Overall rating: 5/5**\n\n**Paula's Choice SKIN RECOVERY Super Antioxidant Concentrate Serum ($36)**: I used this before I discovered The Inkey List. This is a great feeling, hydrating blend of antioxidants and some retinol. It was nice, but I wanted a stronger retinol product, and already had a lot of antioxidants in my skincare routine (seriously... so many antioxidants). I think it's a nice product if you don't have a lot of products with good antioxidants and want a hydrating serum with a bit of retinol. Still, the retinol is not potent so you're less likely to see a visual difference. It really is great for dry skin but I was mainly using it not for the hydrating + antioxidant benefits but for the retinol. **For what it is, 4/5 Good product, just not what I needed.**\n\n**Etude House SoonJung Cica Balm-Panthensoside 5 ($20)**: To wrap up my Soko Glam purchases, I needed a great nighttime moisturizer. In comes this baby. This is a great moisturizer that keeps my skin feeling smooth all night. The balm texture is amazing, easy to use yet effective. It's also at a great price point. Rating: 5/5\n\nI used to use...\n\n**Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Moisturizer ($68)**: Again, DE is amazing, it's just so expensive. Now that I'm going to be living on my own soon, I wanted to find options that were a bit more budget-friendly but still effective with large amounts of beneficial ingredients. I did really like this moisturizer, the formula is great, but I wanted something a bit more moisturizing for the night with my dry skin. Still, I think this would be fine layered with Marula oil, the Cosrx snail mucin etc. so it really depends on how you use it. My main reason for changing to the Etude House was the price. I'm probably not getting as many beneficial ingredients/polypeptides as I would if I kept using Protini instead of Etude House, but I like the moisturizing qualities of Etude House better. Hopefully other products in my routine make up for less expensive formulas. **Rating: 4/5**\n\n**The Ordinary 100% Virgin Cold Pressed Virgin Marula Oil ($9.90)**: Love this oil for a bit of extra hydration. It's a great price point and I think TO is great for single ingredients such as oils. Hydrating, absorbs quickly, and useful to add to any part of your routine if you feel like you need extra hydration. Marula is a great oil with antioxidants and all that good stuff, but if you are wanting to use an oil as your main moisturizer, an oil blend may be better because you'd get more benefits from more ingredients. **Overall rating: 5/5** \n\n**The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% ($7.90):** LOVE THIS. I think that using this frequently (at least every day, hopefully 2x per day) has greatly helped heal the red marks on my face caused by acne. If you haven't tried azelaic acid, this is a great place to start. Overall my philosophy with many TO products is that it's good if you want to try or need to add a specific ingredient to your routine. They are great to add onto your routine, but not to replace, because TO products are very basic and one-note. That's fine if that's all you're looking for, which in my case it is. **Rating: 5/5 for what it is**\n\n**Stratia Rewind ($16)**: It's a little bottle but lasts a while. This is my niacinmide product (I basically rushed to add niacinamide, azelaic acid and hyaluronic acid to my routine after stalking this sub). I do like it, but I may switch to a different niacinamide product, such as The Inkey List's niacinamide serum. Although it's a more one-note product, it's a bit cheaper and I feel like with all of my products, it's okay if some of them aren't the most sophisticated in terms of ingredients. I just haven't really noticed any crazy differences with this product so I may try another one, and then if that doesn't work, niacinamide may just not be that effective on me. **Anyway, Rewind gets a 3.5/5**\n\n**The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 ($6.80)**: Again, I use this because everyone seems to be obsessed with HA, and I use it as sort of an \"add-on\" to my routine. It's certainly hydrating, with a slightly tacky texture (it doesn't really bother me). I love this as an extra hydrator as well. **For what it is, 4/5**\n\nMASKS:\n\n**Drunk Elephant T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial™ 25% AHA + 2% BHA Mask ($80)**: A great, intense mask for a huge amount of AHAs to the skin. Can be really irritating so don't leave it on too long and only use 1x per week. A great mask- I just forget to use it!! I think this is one of those masks that is actually effective for a significant amount of time. It doesn't just make your skin feel soft for like an hour. **5/5**\n\n**Youth to the People Superberry Hydrate + Glow Dream Mask ($48)**: SUPER hydrating if you slather it on your face at night. Still, clear jar packaging isn't great. Nice for hydration but not sure I'm getting my moneys worth out of the \"superberries\" because of the packaging. **Rating: 3/5 for packaging :(**\n\n**Root Science Reborn Mask ($60):** A pricey clay mask that comes in powder form. Ingredients are clean and natural, and packaging is great. You add either water or honey to the powder and then apply it to the face. I think it's great for your skin- it's not like a miracle product like retinol or other acids, but it's good for the skin, and I've always wanted to add a clay mask to my routine. Also it has a great ingredient deck. I basically just use this when I'm in the mood for a mask. **Rating: 4/5**\n\nStuff I've learned:\n\n* I drink tons more water, and I think that's because I purchased a reusable water bottle and take that everywhere, so that probably also helps the dehydration of my skin. If I go out drinking one night, I make sure I drink lots of water between drinks, and drink a bottle before I go to bed\n* Just because it's a good product that is nice on the skin, has great ingredients, doesn't irritate you etc. doesn't mean it's the right product for you and your needs.\n* You really want to try and use the most potent amount of things such as retinols and AHAs that your skin can handle, even if you have to use it less often.\n* As a small tip in not picking, don't look at your skin closely in the mirror\n* There was a time where almost my entire skincare line was Drunk Elephant. I still love and swear by the brand, but that doesn't mean that there aren't other comparable formulas for cheaper\n* Skincare is a lot of give and take. You can't just put every possible beneficial acid/antioxidant/vitamin on your skin because there's just too many. You have to focus on the most effective ones at solving your problems\n* Cheaper, one-note products are good for what they are, but they are not substitutes for more expensive, well-rounded formulas with a variety of beneficial ingredients. They are great as add-on products.\n* Each and every skincare item should be directly benefitting your skin in some way.\n* Fragrance and nice-sounding plant oils can be very problematic, even if your skin doesn't react to them negatively. Over time they can sensitize your skin.\n* Skincare is not the same as makeup. It's treatment for your skin and it smelling good means nothing/having good marketing means nothing if the product isn't effective and safe. It was easy for me to fall for trendy overpriced products such as GlamGlow and the initial \"it feels good on the skin\" but not really consider the deeper problems in the product.\n* Packaging matters in 90% of skincare products, and using a great formula with bad packaging can be pointless.\n* Wash pillowcases at least once a week- more often if you don't shower before going to bed\n* Try to use a sunscreen that is both chemical and physical (mineral) if you can",

        "body": "My routine and yours have nothing in common, but we have many experiences and principles in common. I've also found that effective ingredients in efficient concentrations are worth the money (and the headache, in the case of retinoids). Also, I agree on one-note products such as the TO - they're great for testing your compatibility with an ingredient, and they can be a great addiction to one's routine, if said routine is a complex one. Otherwise, it's unrealistic to expect some great effect from a one-note product, and you'd probably be better off with a complex, well-formulated one, even if it's a bit more expensive. If you know your actives, what they do, and what you need, and how to compensate for what a one-note product lacks, then yeah, they can be a wonderful addition to a routine.  \n\n\n I also resonate with your principle that many of one brand's products can be wonderful, but that doesn't mean all of them are the absolute best you can get for that money on the market, and you shouldn't experiment a bit with finding cheaper alternatives that do the same thing (otherwise, it's a trade-down). Paula's Choice was for me what Drunk Elephant was for you. Their products have always agreed wonderfully with my skin, and made a visible difference. But I'm still experimenting with alternatives for some of them, because if I can find ones that do the same, for less money, why the hell wouldn't I want that? I've found excellent replacements for their cleansers, serums, and nighttime moisturizers, and now I'm experimenting with some things for a toner. The only thing of theirs I've never bumped from my routine are the sunscreen moisturizers. Not that I haven' tried, I just keep coming back to them.",

My routine had been pretty set in stone for almost a year and I was MOSTLY happy with it, already was a huge improvement from when I started my skincare in my 30s journey. But even with hyaluronic acid, moisturizer for dry skin and a hydrating toner and cleanser, and drinking tons of water I still didn’t feel plump and dewy and hydrated. \n \nSo for $10 from The Ordinary I gave it a go. Did a test patch with no reaction so 2 days later I tried it in the morning figuring I might get that like greasy/dry result. But by midday I noticed my skin looked better than ever!!! The redness had calmed down, the flaking I had in one spot had subsided, and texture from lack of hydration was gone. I was amazed. It’s been a week now, using morning and night and I literally cannot stop looking at my skin. \n\nI am so happy.",

    "body": "When I heard about this new product line the other day, I decided to look at all the products and their formulations via SkinCarisma to see whether anything looked worth trying. A few products seemed promising, while others seemed... not so much. I thought since I'd already done all the work, I'd share my findings here!\n\nIn order approximately from most to least promising:\n\nBlemish Control Spot Treatment, 5.5% Benzoyl Peroxide\n\n- **fungal acne safe!**\n- 5.5% is a higher concentration that necessary but shouldn't be too irritating\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both near end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (at end of ingred. list)\n- some nice **moisturizing** ingredients, including a good amount of squalane\n\nVitamin C Moisturizer\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 8th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (14th ingred.)\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane, lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- small amounts of cassia and green tea\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- advertises inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is last ingredient\n\nDark Spot Solution Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: polysorbate 20 (8th ingred.)\n- **niacinimide** is 2nd ingredient! brightening and anti-aging properties\n- advertises its inclusion of plankton extract but is 24th ingredient (also not much evidence that plankton extract does anything for skin besides moisturizing)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract  (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (last ingred.), citric acid (15th ingred.)\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- possible **allergen**: benzoyl alcohol\n- contains a lot of **silicones**\n\nRetinol Vitamin A Refining Moisturizer\n\n- amount of retinol isn't specified, but is placed 25th on ingredient list (you only need small amounts, 0.01% or more, to be effective, but need 0.5% or more for dramatic effects)\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.), polysorbate 20 (24th), cetyl palmitate (26th) \n- **retinol** has anti-acne, brightening, and anti-aging properties\n- other **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.), ceramide 3 (27th ingred.)\n- tons of aloe juice, good amount of squalane\n- small amounts of green tea and cassia\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- specifically advertises its inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is 26th (second last) on ingred. list\n\nOil-Free SPF 50 Moisturizing Sunscreen\n\n- broad spectrum\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl stearate (2nd ingredient), isopropyl palmitate (7th), PEG-100 stearate (8th)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.)\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: isopropyl palmitate (7th ingred.)\n- pretty small tube, only 50 mL\n\nFerulic Acid + Vitamins C and E Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for its vit C so is not a dupe for SkinCeuticals, but should still be effective\n- amounts of main ingredients not specified, however, vit C is the 5th ingredient, ferulic is 10th, vit E is 18th (second to last)\n- **brightening** ingredients: SAP\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E, citric acid, ferulic acid\n- citric acid (8th ingredient) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingredient)\n\nBio-Complex Moisturizer for Dry Skin\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- claim to have a \"high level\" of hyaluronic acid, and contains 2 kinds, but they're only 21st and 22nd on ingredient list\n- also super unclear on what their \"bio-moist complex\" is but if it comprises 20% of the product it must just be like, aloe and water and glycerin\n- but yeah, tons of aloe and glycerin, good amount of squalane, some other **moisturizing** ingredients, moderate amount of green tea extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (14th ingred.), vitamin E (23rd)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n\nVitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 5th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (13th ingred.), citric acid (10th)\n- contains **denatured alcohol** (3rd ingred.)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingred.)\n- HA is in the name and yet it's the last ingredient\n\nCharcoal Balancing Mask\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: PEG-100 stearate (9th ingred.), stearic acid (10th), glyceryl stearate (12th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- not sure how much charcoal is needed to be effective, but there may be a deceptively small amount in this, as it's the 16th ingredient and the product contains as much or more iron oxide as a colouring agent. also it lists \"charcoal powder\" and NOT \"activated charcoal powder\" so it may just be all-around useless.\n- advertises its use of hyaluronic acid yet it's the last ingredient \n- main mask component is **kaolin** clay (3rd ingred.)\n- 2 kinds of vitamin E (17th and 24th ingredients)\n- lots of aloe and some glycerin but not many other soothing or moisturizing ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: stearic acid (10th ingred.)\n\nHydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: contains polysorbate 80\n- claims to have 5 types of HA but I only counted 3: sodium hyaluronate, hydrolized HA, sodium acetylated hyaluronate (and they're all 18th or later in the ingredient list)\n- contains a TON of **silicone**, which seems like a poor choice to me, as HA should generally be applied earlier on in your routine and all that silicone will interfere with absorption of subsequent layers\n- no other notable or helpful ingredients, just a few **moisturizing** things like glycerin\n- more of a gel texture than a serum\n\nTriple-Peptide Eye Cream\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: stearic acid (3rd ingred.), glycol distearate (4th), shea butter (5th), ethylhexyl palmitate (8th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- peptides are last ingredient\n- contains ascorbic acid (vitamin C) but is 18th ingredient and what little benefit that amount gives will deteriorate due to air exposure from jar packaging\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane and caffeine\n- small amounts of green tea and green algae extract\n- 5 potential **comedogens** but this likely won't matter for the eye region\n- if you look up this product on Amazon to examine yourself, note that the copyable list of ingredients in the Important Information section is actually the ingredient list for the Retinol Moisturizer, so use the ingredients listed in the product images\n\nHydrating Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.), pomegranate seed oil (14th), coconut oil (15th), olive fruit oil (16th), argan oil (17th), jojoba oil (18th), babassu seed oil (20th), moringa seed oil (21st), crambe seed oil (23rd)\n- 2 potential **comedogens**: coconut oil (15th ingred.), avocado oil (19th)\n- in addition to above listed plant oils, also contains chia seed oil, the only non-problematic one lol\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin E (12th)\n- citric acid and benzoic acid (6th ingred.) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- **surfectants** used: decyl glucoside and glyceryl oleate\n\nOil-Free Micellar Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.)\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin E (12th)\n- citric acid and benzoic acid (6th ingred.) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- micellar agents (**surfectants**) are decyl glucoside and glycerl oleate\n\nBlemish Control Oil-Free Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- advertises 2% **salicylic acid**, but unsure of the pH\n- **denatured alcohol** is the first ingredient!\n- contains grapefruit extract (3rd ingred.) - some sources say this is a great ingredient for skin, others say it's bad - I personally avoid it like I do all citrus-derived ingredients\n- contains **fragrance** (5th ingred.)\n- contains **sulfate**: sodium xylenesulfonate (13th ingred.)\n \nHope this is helpful! Let me know if I missed or got anything wrong!\n\nEdit: formatting\nEdit 2: butchered the spelling of \"comedogen\" all ten times I used it",

In the US, ingredients in concentrations of 1% or lower can be listed in whatever order the manufacturer wants to use. You can sometimes tell where that <1% begins if the product contains phenoxyethanol, because that's approved for use in concentrations of up to 1% -- meaning things *after* that are either at 1% or under.\n\n(Also, 1% HA isn't unusual, nor is it necessarily ineffective; it's normally used at/in concentrations of 0.2-2%. TO often uses 2% because of their unofficial \"more is **always** better\" philosophy [looking at you, 10% niacinamide serum], but <2% can be beneficial, too!)\n\nThat said, you'd think there'd be little reason for Amazon to list a \"banner\" ingredient at the very end when/if they have the option to list it earlier/higher.",

This picture was taken in full blown natural light right beside my window just about 60 seconds after applying the oil. \n\nTHE RAVE: It absorbs like lightning and doesn't leave behind any greasy smearing, as you can see. My combination winter skin feels hydrated without being weighed down — this stuff is light as a feather. \n\nBONUS SHOUTOUT: I've barely seen a peep about the new TO 10% mandelic acid but it's a total dream. For an acid, dare I call it hydrating? It goes on as a smooth serum and isn't tacky or tightening in the slightest, at least for me. Since I started using it, my skins been super smooth and I have nary a pimple. That's a win to me!\n\nTil next time 💕",

    "body": "**TRETINOIN ADVICE**\n\nSome tips from my personal experience with Tretinoin Microsphere. \n\n1. Introduce Tretinoin during winter. (Tretinoin takes the top layer off, which protects us from the sun)\n1. Climatise your skin with retinol before you start on Tretinoin.\n1. Use a mild cleanser, wash your face gently. \n1. Avoid wash cloth, facial scrubs, astringents or any product that will irritate the skin eg actives like LAA, AHA, BHA.\n1. Do not apply immediately after washing your face. Wait 20minutes \n1. The face must be cleansed and completely dry in order for Tretinoin to work properly.  Having water on the surface of your face will prevent it from settling properly.\n1. You may mix Tretinoin with other skin serums if you are experiencing sensitivity.\n1. Start low (eg 0.025) to ensure your skin can adapt to its effects. Building your tolerance will create better results. Before you go to the next level, make sure you use up at least 1 whole tube and have no more redness/peeling before you get a stronger dosage.\n1. Try to use the Tretinoin every night even if you need to dilute it. Using it daily helps you to acclimate better and faster to it. If i stop for a week, it takes me a couple of weeks to get acclimatised to Tretinoin again.\n1. Apply a pea size of Tretinoin to your forehead , cheeks, nose & chin. You may want to avoid applying to sensitive areas like the corners of your mouth, eyes and nose. \n1. No need to use more than pea sized, Dr Frances Prenna Jones teaches how to use a \"chickpea\" size on this [video](https://youtu.be/RMHG3K5x_WE), fast forward to 16:23. She says \"MORE is not MORE\" lol\n1. Begin by applying every other night. After 2 weeks, if there is no redness or irritation, increase application to every night. If you develop redness or irritation, continue at every other night or decrease to twice weekly.\n1. After applying tretinoin, practise wait time of 20min-1 hour before applying your other serums/moisturisers for maximum benefits from Tretinoin.  \n1. When reintroducing Tretinoin into your routine after a long break or perhaps for the Tretinoin virgins, use your AHA/BHA in the day and Tretinoin at night. If you use both together, it may be too irritating for the skin.\n1. Gel is more potent than cream version. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pigmentation/comments/5acyqx/tretinoin_retinol_retina_differin_adapalene/d9o4wyy/)\n1. Tretinoin / Retinol  could give you a red, rosy hue to the skin as Retinoic acid increases capillary aborisation in the dermis. You may want to get a colour correcting primer to use before you apply your foundation. It could either be green/yellow based.\n1. Apply Tretinoin in the night only. No exceptions. Do not use in the day. Tretinoin is light sensitive.\n1. Tretinoin / Retinol will increase your photosensitivity, sunscreen is mandatory. Do not start Tretinoin if you do not intend to use sunscreen.\n1. Please use a mineral based sunscreen and wear a broad rim hat. Mineral based sunscreen will better block the sun harmful rays and are less likely to irritate the skin unlike sunscreen chemicals. Lack of sun protection can lead to easily burned skin.\n1. Less is more with Tretinoin.\n1. Continued use is key, as it takes some time to take effect.\n1. Ensure you hydrate hydrate hydrate.\n - Basically you just pile it on your moisturiser. I was using multiple serums and multiple creams and finished off with an occlusive every night... while your skin is adjusting to Tretinoin, the acid mantle may be broken and you'll suffer from TEWL big time...\n - In the day... get a mist.. and topup... good over makeup/sunscreen. Perhaps you can use a silcone primer as a kind of occlusive to prevent TEWL. Make sure you topup your sunscreen as Tretinoin makes you uber sun sensitive!\n1. Finish the routine with an occlusive if necessary.\n\n\n* DO NOT USE if pregnant or if you are planning for a baby (applies to females only).\n\n***\n\n[Transepidermal Water Loss \\(TEWL\\)](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32109-2_32) \n\n\n***\n\n**MOISTURE UP - best advice for tretinoin users**\n\nWith moisturisers.. make sure you use all 3 types. This youtube video can explain a lil http://youtu.be/QdNPiW4ZULk \n\n* Occlusives - you want only 1 layer, this is used LAST\n* Emollients -  creams, ointments, lotions and gels. \n* Humectants - as many layers as possible, water based.\n\nYMMV of course.\n\n***\n\nBasically i divide it into 3 categories since the above 3 categories can sometimes overlap\n\n* Water based\n* Non Water based including oils and butters\n* Occlusive\n\n**Tips**\n\n* You want lots and lots of water based moisturisers that are skin identical, water-binding, humectants.\n* Limit the oil based ingredients to 1 not too oily.\n* Unlimited from the water based category. \n* Use the Occlusive last and a thin layer will suffice.\n \n***\n\n#**Ingredients to look out for include:**\n\n**Water based**\n\nMy personal fave are Sodium Hyaluronate and Sodium PCA (similar to Hyaluronic Acid)\nWater binding agents / NMF Natural moisturising factors\n\n* Hyaluronic Acid (HA)\n* Centella asiatica (Gotu Kola)\n* Ceramides\n* DMAE Dimethylaminoethanol / DMAE Bitartrate\n* Genistein\n* Beta Glucan\n* Glycerin\n* Ceramides\n* Lecithin\n* Polysaccharides\n* Hyaluronic Acid\n* Sodim Hyaluronate\n* Sodium PCA\n* Collagen\n* Elastin\n* Proteins\n* Amino Acid\n* Cholesterol\n* Glucose\n* Sucrose\n* Fructose\n* Glycogen\n* Phospholipids\n* Glycosphingolipids\n* Glycosaminoglycan\n* Allantoin helps to improve the water content of the epidermis\n* Panthenol Vitamin B5\n\n***\n\n**Oil based:**\n\nAdd a facial oil but no more than 1 as you don't want to get too oily\n\n* i noticed a lot of people using rosehip oil. I don't think it is a good option as rosehip contains betacarotene and perhaps trace amounts of trans-retinoic acid. If you are using Tretinoin, you don't need any more vitamin A. * Perhaps choose a different facial oil that is more suitable for your skin type. \n * Plenty of Oleic acid for dry skin types and \n * Lots of Linoleic Acid for oily/acne prone skin as the skin is deficient in that Omega 6 fatty acid.\n* Check out [Gothamista's guide to facial oils](https://youtu.be/R1TZwTDlzw4)\n\n\n\n***\n\n**Occlusives**\n\nVaseline has the highest occlusive factor but i prefer the more natural versions instead of petroleum based alternatives.\n\n* Natural versions\n * Squalane / Squalene\n * Lecithin\n * Cocoa butter, Mango and Shea butter: Careful only Shea butter is non comedogenic\n * Coconut oil - comedogenic rating 4\n * Beeswax is a wonderful occlusive ingredient, especially for dry, chapped lip\n * Lanolin -It is a wax not fat secreted by sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. Used for its protective and barrier properties.\n\n* Petroleum by products\n * Mineral Oil\n * Isoparaffin\n * Polybutene\n * Synthetic petrol chemical derived ingredients (they give a long term occlusion of the skin,  prevents the skin from recognising the need to repair itself)\n * Silicone\n * Methicone \n * Dimethicone\n * Cyclohexasiloxane\n * many other silicone derivatives (most ending with \"cone\")\n\n\n***\n\n**Skin Soothing ingredients**\n\nWhen you start peeling, this will help the skin reduce inflammation and heal.\n\n* Manuka Honey\n* Gotu Kola / Centella asiatica/ Madecassoside/ Madecassic acid\n* Allantoin\n* Calendula\n* Bisabolol / Camomile\n* Cucumber\n* Aloe Vera\n* Licorice Root\n* Oatmeal\n* Beta-Glucan\n* Zinc oxide (used in baby diaper rash creams too)\n* Snail \n\n***\n\n**Healing ingredients to include**\n\nUse this to accelerate healing from the \"Tret face\"\n\n* Copper peptides\n* EGF/ DNA repair\n\n*** \n\nRetinoids research\n\n* [Retinoids in the treatment of skin aging: an overview of clinical efficacy and safety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699641/) by Siddharth Mukherjee et al.

        "body": "Just my two cents but,\nApplying tretinoin in the day is a waste of tretinoin and will just make your skin unnecessarily dry and flaky. Because it degrades in the presence of sunlight, if you leave the house at all it will be rendered ineffective (your sunscreen can only protect you so much).  If you want to use tretinoin more aggressively you should probably try to get a larger dose. \n(Speaking as someone whose GP prescribed tretinoin twice daily, all it will do is cause your skin to peel off as if you got a sunburn. Makes it impossible for products to absorb and looks terrible.)",

The first couple of days, my face was red (looks like a mild sunburn), so I took 1 night off of both Retin A and BHA/AHA, then continued the next day. Since then, I haven't experienced anymore irritation except for a bit of flaking around the nose area. \n\nI also seem to do things completely different from everyone else. I put it on pretty much right after I wash my face because I WANT it to get absorbed and not just wash off somehow on the pillow as I sleep or whatever. I also put it right under my eyes/nose area too, because wrinkles in that area. I also don't put anything on my face before or after I apply my Retin A, since I saw somewhere that recommends tret be right next to the skin to be more effective. \n\nI think Retin-A is so effective that I could get away with using it less frequently and being persistent about using it. But on the other hand, I get it on eBay so it's so cheap that I wouldn't care about using it nightly.",

    "body": "I got tired of the endless search for hair products, so for the last few years I've been making them myself. It reduces plastic waste, I can package all my products in glass pump bottles or jars, and it has most definitely been cheaper long-term than buying new items regularly. I can change up my formulas with the seasons and everything is tailored to my needs.\n\nI'll put proper recipes in the comments below if you wish to make either product yourself! Just be careful in making sure all tools are sterile, educate yourself on microbe growth and preservatives, etc.\n\nBut it's really not as difficult as one might anticipate. The hardest part, I've found, is effectively cleaning all items before & after. Preventing contamination is a high priority when making cosmetics in a home environment.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of my routine.\n\nFor my only store-bought product, I shampoo with the Dove Sensitive Skin Beauty Bar. Just as good as some 'actual' shampoo bars I've tried, at a fraction of the cost.   \nIt has a lower ph level compared to many soaps which are highly alkaline, and it prevents the acid mantle from getting stripped, keeping your hair + skin happy :)  \nI am quite prone to buildup and this is a lovely thorough cleanser that doesn't irritate my scalp. I'd like to try formulating something similar soon.\n\nI use a leave-in conditioner with rice water, squalane, BTMS-25, and Germall Plus Preservative.\n\nThen, I use a gel cream made from flaxseeds, squalane, mango butter, BTMS-50, and Germall Plus Preservative.\n\nThe preservative is NOT optional, as these products contain water, and would very quickly spoil without them.\n\nI really enjoy utilizing squalane in my products, as it is already present in our natural sebum (technically squalEne is, but squalAne is the stabilized version) and meshes really well with skin and hair. I appreciate that it is clear, odorless, and tasteless, especially since I also use it as a lip oil.\n\nThat's all! For this image I finger coiled and air dried, though sometimes I'll scrunch and go with similar results. I am SO happy to be free from the cycle of searching for curl products just to be disappointed over and over again, or finding something that works but costs $20/month for the rest of your life, and contributes to even more plastic waste.\n\nIt's just so refreshing you realize that you probably don't need 6+ hair products in your daily routine to have healthy, bouncy, minimally frizzy curls. I do not use any other hair masks, special treatments, oral supplements etc... I wash with lukewarm water every other day and that's it. And I am so so happy.\n\nI still have a little bit of functional frizz, but this isn't a failing, I've come to love and accept it.  \nMost of us can spend hundreds on curl products and still wind up with frizz from a gust of wind or a touch of humidity outside.   \nIt took me years to accept that many of the totally frizz-free pictures I was seeing were people JUST after a routine, carefully edited images, or even wigs. It wasn't indicative of how most curls look in daily life.  \n  \nI could probably minimize it further with some tweaks to my products, but I haven't been bothered enough to care. I still get compliments on my hair all the time.\n\nAnyway, a good resource for learning how to make cosmetics is Humblebee & Me. Most of my recipes are based off things she's written, she has some lovely beginner-friendly guides.\n\nI hope this post has inspired some of you to try your hand at homemade hair care.  \nThere's a deeply emotionally fulfilling aspect to it. Looking at your hair on a good day and knowing you did ALL of that is such a wonderful feeling!  \nI love when people ask what products I use and I explain that I make them myself.  \nI love showing folks that they can create whatever they desire if they just do some research.\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "[Conditioner Recipe (I use Version 2)](https://www.humblebeeandme.com/super-simple-creamy-hair-conditioner-3-ways/#Version_2)  \nMy only alteration is using rice water in place of regular.\n\nMy gel cream is quite similar to the conditioner recipe. However instead of 87% water, I use 87% flaxseed gel. I use about 2 tablespoons of flaxseeds boiled in half a cup of distilled water for 6-7 minutes, strain & weigh.\n\nSince the gel base is thicker, I swap BTMS-25 for BTMS-50. This is optional depending on the texture you want, I prefer it slightly runnier. I've used BTMS-25 before and it creates a thicker, pomade-like consistency, if you desire that.\n\nRather than 8% oil, I use 5% oil and 3% mango butter. I'm still experimenting to see what is ideal, but this has worked fabulously for me so far.\n\nNOTE: Once again, the preservative is not optional, and neither is having a scale to accurately weigh the ingredients.",

    "body": "Edit: Hi you guys!! i did not realize this post is the #1 result on google SEO when you search sulwhasoo reviews!! I have an updated post out now if you wanna check it, and my instagram is also @lonelyblep if you wanna ask questions there because Reddit i so bad at notifying me about your messages lul\n\nHello you guys I am back with another total brand guide, this time for Sulwhasoo. Many of you have requested one for Sulwhasoo ever since I did the one for Whoo. And I am happy to tell you that I know Sulwhasoo VERY WELL. As a skincare curator I always try to seek out new and innovative products for my clients to try, and Sulwhasoo is good old and reliable every time, yet they still embrace innovation. So the basics about every line, you have 5 phases of skincare: cleansing, awakening (First Care Activating Serum EX), balancing (water and emulsion for water-oil balance before any serum or special product is applied, treatment (these are where your serums and creams go, and finish (Luminature Essential Finisher, sunscreen or a sleeping mask) Their system is different, emulsion goes right after toner instead of after all serums / ampoules like other brands. The system is the same for all skincare from AmorePacific apparently. \r\n Anyways let's cut the crap and get to the guide, also l am going to do a mini review of each product\r\n\n\r\n-Essential: Introduction series to Sulwhasoo, meant for skin that is slightly aging but not too much, and for those who have water – oil balance issues. It is also meant to have a glowing effect and is good for dry, combination and normal skin.\r\n\r\n+First Care Activating Serum EX: Their bestseller. You can easily see why it is. 5 Korean herbs that make up Jaumdan, the main ingredient in this serum help to improve skin on all aspects and help to just upgrade your skin. To me it is a life changing product. Use before toners but after actives. (A special Plum Blossom version of FCAS was launched in April and has real plum blossom extract and fragrance) \r\n\n+First Care Activating Serum Mist: A mist with the active ingredients of FCAS and a layer of olive oil on top for emollience. I like this on top of makeup because it makes my skin look glowing. \n\r\n+First Care Activating Mask: When the people love something so much, it's logical that you'll have a spin off of it. This mask is soaked up to one third of a bottle of FCAS with all the good stuff and no alcohol so you use this after FCAS since FCAS has alcohol and it's an absorption boosting agent. Also if you want the goodness of FCAS in times of skin compromise (compromised skin stings from the alcohol in FCAS) this should be perfect. Gives my skin a radiant glow, softness, smoothness and clarity in one application, something your Dermal or Mediheal masks can't do in one use #whenwillyourfave\r\n\r\n+Essential Balancing Water EX: Their bestselling toner for it's cheap price and effectiveness. This toner is thicker than most toners you'll see in Western beauty. It has a light herbal scent, signature to the Essential line. It hydrates to no end, if Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion is a 10, this is a 20 \r\n\r\n+Essential Balancing Emulsion EX: Their bestselling emulsion. I feel like oily skin would love this. I don't really. Because I feel like it's only as goood as the toner at moisurizing. But oily people swear by this, lightweight moisture that does not fuck around, plus some nice antioxidants. I heard Liah Yoo raving about AmorePacific’s The Essential Crème Fluid but I actually think iff you pack on 2-3 layers of this stuff you can get the same moisture as you with the Crème Fluid, not to mention it's almost twice as cheaper.\r\n\r\n+Essential Revitalizing Serum EX: I always recommend this serum for people who are starting to see the signs of aging or do not see it yet but want to prevent it. It is a fresh, light gel texture that packs a heavy moisture punch. Oily people love it, but it would definitely be enough for dry people like me as well (of course with moisturizer on top, I am not a savage). Definitely an investment type of product if you're just stepping into the world of luxury Korean skincare. I do not believe in drugstore brands but some people just have to make do with what they have, but having this serum would definitely help their routine more efficient. \r\n\r\n+Essential Revitalizing Eye Cream EX: The smell of this product is definitely different from the other products from the Essential line. It smells faintly of white ginseng, and not the signature earthy-sweet Sulwhasoo base scent. It is more of an emulsion really and it's good for people who are starting with eye cream because this thing can't create milia due to it's extremely thin texture.\r\n\r\n+Essential Firming Cream EX: A lovely texture shifting cream that melts from a thick and smooth cream to a light emulsion, wrapping your skin in Hanbang goodness. Oily people might want to avoid this but combo skin should be fine.  It does firm up really. \r\n\r\n-Ginseng: Their signature line that started in 2000. Their Ginseng cream is so popular it practically became legendary. The line had a total revamp in 2017 (revamp was completed in 2018 with addition of the new Ginseng serum) including packaging and formulation improvements. Essential does not work on wrinkles while Ginseng works on almost every facet of aging care: Wrinkles, Elasticity, Tone, Texture, and Density. To remove any confusion and further enhance the line, Sulwhasoo launched Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Water and Emulsion.\r\n\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Water: An oil like toner that provides intensive conditioning moisyure to the skin, resulting in increased elasticity and overall health. The toner is highly moisturizng, smoothing and oily people can use this as an essence step.\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Emulsion: It smells strongly  of ginseng (a characteristic of the line) and the texture is similar to the Timetreasure emulsion (which we will get to later). It is intensely moisturizing and some say it might be a dupe to the lightweight version of the Ginseng cream. I confirm this.\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Serum: A serum with Ginsenisphere ( a patented encapsulation technology in capsules that lies within the base for maximum protection of the antioxidants and immediate release upon the skin). The updated version I heard removed Macro Ginsenisphere, the visible beads in the serum. This serum feels just like it's predecessor, a stretchy gel that does not feel oily or tacky but still leaves a smooth film on your skin. A lot of my clients reported better elasticity and smoothness. There are mixed reviews from people who have tried it's predecessor. \n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Facial Oil: A facial oil containing real ginseng seed oil blended in a mix of highly stable skin friendly oils such as Squalane, Sunflower, Jojoba, Korean Pine, Sesame and Apricot to lock in the effects of the serum and acts as a powerful moisturizing product on it's own with anti oxidative properties. This oil is used after serum before cream. The old version has meadowfoam seed oil which I LOVE but it's gone  but anyways the new one is the same so AmorePacific got lucky that I didn't try to burn their HQ. Oh and this is my HG facial oil. Ps: The oil blends sound like they have way tooo much oleic acid so as much as I am an advocate for oily skin using facial oils, oily skin should stay away.\r\n\r\n+100% Ginseng Facial Oil: An ultra rare limited edition product that consisted of pure Ginseng seed oil grown by AmorePacific themselves. I could never get it tho \r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Eye Cream EX: The renewed version has a stronger ginseng scent with a creamier consistency. This eye cream spreads like a dream and diffuses wrinkles in a month. \r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX: The star product of the brand. Smells strongly of ginseng, so you might wanna be careful with this baby. It is richly moisturizing yet being too thin in texture for my liking. It also contains mostly Ginseng extract which is a powerful antioxidant. My clients who do other beauty procedures like laser resurfacing or dermarolling swear by this. I personally think the texture is too thin but maybe that's just me, you can't even make a soft peak with this cream. I love how it actually makes my skin stronger and help calm it down whenever I use actives (which I stopped long ago)\r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX Light: A lighter version of the OG ginseng cream for those with combination to oily skin or those who dislike the scent of ginseng. Some dedicated people have went as far as using this as a day cream with the original Ginseng cream at night. This smells like fresh ginseng flowers and has a lighter, fresher texture. I would not say it's a gel cream, it does still have a tackiness to it, but it moisturizes efficiently for me and does not cause breakouts for oily people. You technically get less ginseng extract per jar for the same price but technically you still get the same one-night-after miracle. It still calms skin down and have anti oxidative properties.\r\n\r\n+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Creamy Mask: A mask contains 8 times the power of the ginseng cream, the sheet mask is doused inside the miraculously repairing ginseng cream and double wrapped with another occlusive layer on top . The mask CAN transform your skin completely if you have dry lackluster skin, just give it 20 minutes and then you’ll be amazed. Oily skin stay a mile away from this stuff.\r\n\r\n-Hydro Aid: For younger and oiler skin, meant to be used in conjunction with the Essential line. I think they made this line since they noticed their sales plummeted during summer :v\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid Moisturizing Soothing Water: A Korea exclusive product I think. I can't say much about this.\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid Moisturizing Soothing Cream: A lightweight gel cream, it smells super nice and provides abundant hydration. But I suppose you can get something cheaper for just hydration purposes alone. But it does smell amazing though.\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid UV Protection Cream: A good physical sunscreen that provides a nice amount of moisture with minimal white cast. But overall kind of boring?\r\n\r\n+Hydro Aid Moisturizing Soothing Mist: It smells amazing and hydrates like a dream. HG mist. \r\n\r\n-Snowise: Brightening line with anti aging effects that help increase collagen synthesis and brighten skin through the use of sexy ingredients like licorice and white ginseng saponins. It has a unique take on brightening, called Volume Brightening. It increases the volume / plumpness of your skin so it can reflect light better, something not any brightening product can do. The range smells like ginseng + herbs + pine forest.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Cleansing Foam: Every beauty blogger's hanbang bae. It's actually a lot of people's first love from Sulwhasoo. I mean pH 5.5, luxurious creamy foam, and a scent that is to die for. Plus it's one of Sulwhasoo's cheapest products. Of course it's an instant hit!\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Exfoliating Gel (New version: Snowise Brightening Exfoliationg Mask) : I thought I heard it wrong. An exfoliating product? From Sulwhasoo? And a physical exfoliant? “A scrub. “ I thought. I cringed at that word ever since two disasters named Lancome and St. Ives happened on my face in my pre AB years. But oh well, it is Sulwhasoo after all. The gel is stretchy and contains BETA GLUCAN *FANBOY SCREEECH* and the scrub particles are made from ground WHITE GINSENG *DOUBLE SCREECH* and walnut shell (this is the same shit is in that Equate scrub but whatever it's much more gentle in this scrub) The smell is vastly different from the rest of the line, it's a straight up white ginseng smell. The particles are so small I can't even feel like it's doing anything on my skin, but actually my skin became TRANSLUCENT every time I use this. I swear that this is the only physical scrub I will ever put on my skin. [This review is for the old product,  I have yet to try the new one] \n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Water: A fresh and light toner with brightening extracts. This is WAY too light for me, I do not feel like it is giving me moisture that actually lasts. But other other hand it actually really helped with my pores. I consider this like the holy water for large pores.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Serum: The bestseller of the line and the entire brand. This serum skips all that proven actives and just goes for the extracts, in true Sulwhasoo spirit. I was a bit skeptical at first but I FINALLY SAW THE LIGHT. It gave me a bright complexion that is so plump, moisturized and transparent no other brightening serum can give me. \r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Mask: I use this mask twice weekly on top of the serum to seal it in and fuse with my skin. My skin is noticeably brighter after just one box. And mind you, the effect is NOT temporary. I can tell because my friends ask me what BB Cream / Cushion I'm using but I said it's just my bare skin. THEY WERE SHOOOK. \n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Spot Treatment: This concentrated gel to water correcting spot treatment penetrates deeply and suppresses melanin. Although the claims weren't supported by any study whatsoever, I can see that my dark spots around my cheeks have disappeared, and my bigger spot faded slightly so I can see there's a definite change. I admit that I love bright, fair skin (not related to Asian standards at all, just preference) but I hate the spots and imperfections that go with it tbh I’d rather have darker skin with less imperfections than spending MY YOUTH to treat these little shits.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Emulsion: A hydrating emulsion infused with brightening extracts that make for a lovely day moisturizer if you have oily skin. It smells amazing and for some, it really helps with water – oil imbalance. What I have noticed about emulsions is that they give your skin an instant surge of moisture and sink into your skin instantly but your skin's moisture levels plummet down to zero in about an hour. And you need a thicker cream to lock it in and hold that down for a timed release through out the day. And for dry skinned people, a cream alone is not enough since the emulsion 6orms a slippery layer on the skin, making the cream apply better and you can use less while still having a nice layer of it on your face. You might think that's counter intuitive but emulsion are far cheaper and you get much more for the price you pay. And the cream itself is thicker and with higher oil content while the emulsion is higher in water so you'll get a nicer balance of both elements.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Eye Serum: A lightweight eye serum meant to correct dark circles and puffiness with the included Zamak applicator. My clients love this because it really helps with their dark circles and it's the perfect choice for those who gave up on eye creams altogether because it the milia it causes.\r\n\r\n+Snowise Brightening Cream: A beautifully textured cream that is thick yet melts down into a milky texture and sinking into your skin, anchoring down everything you've put on your skin before. It gives your skin instant hydration but also provides some lipids as well.  I might say it's not enough for a night cream but for a day cream it is amazing. I can definitely see some plumpness even when used alone (with products from other brands, come on I can't use this product ONLY and expect a miracle, skincare is supposed to be a system)\r\n+Snowise Brightening UV Protector: A color correcting hybrid sunscreen with two shades (#1 Soft Glow for darker skin tones, #2 Soft Peach for skin that is pale but not bright or radiant) This sunscreen's texture is soft and creamy, smells like a dream and applies like a dream. They have turned the weakness of any physical filter into a strength. This sunscreen gives a subtle tone up effect that does not alsst long but should last long enough until you reapply again (2 hours)\r\n\r\n-Bloomstay: Launched in April to replace Innerise,  the line consists of a water,  serum and cream to provide a healthy dose of essential nutrients and antioxidants for skin to transition from late 20s to early 30s. \n\n+Bloomstay Vitalizing Water: *Cardi B voice* OKURRRR ZAMN they got the scent right!!!!  Ugh to die for!  This water is made from 5 types of germinated fruits and seed extracts, hardy orange, plum blossom extracts and the Jaumdan complex. It hydrates my skin very well. Reminds me of the Huxley Essence: Grab Water but much more fragrant. \n\n+Bloomstay Vitalizing Serum: Super smooth and soft, it has the same extracts as the water albeit more condensed + Niacinamide for brightening and soothing benefits. My skin feels amazingly calm and translucent after using this. Ugh.  Ugggghhhhh. \n\n+Bloomstay Vitalizing Cream: A thick smooth cream that makes people with dry skin HOWL. I am gagged by how much I love it. Spreads like butter and moisturizes deeply through the night. I can't comment on it's effects on fine lines because I don't have any.  (I use Sulwhasoo for as long as I can remember so duh) \r\n\r\n-Everefine: Previously the Goa line (until Sulwhasoo decided black was too goth for their brand). Meant for women in menopause experience hormonal shifts. The Goa line used to consist of an ampoule, an eye cream, a facial cream and a neck cream. The new Everefine line only has 2 products which are the ampoule and the cream. The neck cream has moved to the basic line, a line of optional add on products which can be used along with every line. You are expected to use the eye cream of the Ginseng line to accompany Everefine products from now on. \r\n.+Everefine Lifting Ampoule Serum: Quite a confusing name there. Basically the power of a serum on steroids (ampoules) with the absorption speed of a regular gel serum. It does not sound too much of a gel to me with Murumuru butter being the 4th ingredient. That and a lot of silicones and jojoba esters (yes in love with that shit), so I feel like this will be a very thick and richly moisturizing serum. It also contains coumestrol (a proven an Maseondan complex which is made of replenishing ingredients such as Gingko Biloba, Soy leaf extract, Shiitake mushroom extract, Adenosine (Proven anti aging ingredient) and of course, their signature Jaumdan mixture decocted in Honey. There is Jaumdan at the heart of every Sulwhasoo product. Maybe that’s why these products and the FCAS work together so well since they work in synergy. \r\n\r\n+Everefine Lifting Cream: This is a cream that is EVEN MORE emollient than the serum (ok I am a whore for emollient things so hmu please), it has the same Maseondan and Jaumdan complexes but now with cocoa extract + two super nourishing oils, Squalane and Meadowfoam seed oil. I'm seriously gonna try this because why the heck not.\r\n\r\n-Men: Range for men. Smells like pine. Manly.\r\n\r\n+Refreshing Cleansing Foam: A thick cleansing foam that can be used two ways. One you lather it up into a poof and wash your face. Two rub directly on a wet face as a scrub. Nothing impressive about the ingredients, it contains ginseng powder as the last ingredient and walnut shell powder as an exfoliant. I use this in the shower or on trips. It does remove makeup nicely when my oil cleanser isn’t around.\r\n\r\n+Inner Charging Serum: Ok you can't put a toner in a fancy bottle and call it a serum. That's cheating! Used this, smells nice and is basically Essential Balancing Water EX with a nice manly scent. It's not way too manly like cheap aftershave. It's very subtle and sophisticated. Speaking of aftershaves, this could be used as one.\r\n\r\n+Skin Reinforcing Emulsion: My favorite product of the range. Quick, no frills moisture on the go, a must have in my bag. Really good makeup primer. HG.\r\n\r\n+Age Defying Cream: Good for men who don't know what they want and want a bit of everything. This is for age prevention.\r\n\r\n+Relaxing UV Protector: A sunscreen FOR MEN and IN BLACK. Smells MANLY like MAN STUFF. Nice sunscreen, no frills, physical so u can apply and go and not wait 30 mins because MEN DON'T WAIT, WE ARE IMPATIENT.\r\n\r\n-Timetreasure: Their priciest complete anti aging line, might I even say, age reversal. Previously called Extra Refining, the line revolves around the power of the Red Pine, a type of pine so rare it is one of the most endangered species. AmorePacific cultivates it their own since harvesting wild red pine would be illegal. It would cost you $80 for just a bottle of red pine oil, but wait, don't Timetreasure products cost way more than that? You're right, but that’s because Timetreasure uses red pine extract, not oil, therefore it contains more of the actual essence of the tree bark. And you're paying for the fact that they know how to mix certain ingredients together so that it would work even better. Also did I mention red pine bark extract is the 1st ingredient in every Timetreasure product? (Not including the cleansing foam) I can not stress enough as a person with super dry skin even instagram  humid weather that this line is my HG (especially when used with Harmonizen) and with concerns for aging skin (people say I'm better off with Innerise but no hoe I know what I'm doing). Also to clear any misunderstanding, Timetreasure is more expensive than Ginseng (with both being anti aging lines) because Timetreasure also works on brightness more and prevents sagging, age spots, and smoothes out wrinkles in the long run (unlike some cheap collagen cream that seem to work instantly), something Ginseng couldn't do. I tested this on my self + my mom + my grandma and yes we all love it. \r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Extra Creamy Cleansing Foam: A newly launched product, and let me set the record straight, this is my mother of all HG cleansing foams. A thick cream that lathers up into clouds of extra creamy foam that cleanses even foundation effectively with no oil cleanser (just not eye makeup), it smells dreamy (different from the other products in the range, which are still dreamy btw) and my skin feels more MOISTURIZED than before using it, sometimes I leave the foam on my face as a mask. Since most cleansers only go as far as not stripping my skin, but this one actually ADDED MOISTURE to my skin while removing all of the nasties. One pea sized drop makes enough foam for 4, sleepover tested. This thing feels like I am washing my face with a moisturizer. If you want a taste of the Timetreasure line without paying the price, try this.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Water EX: This toner is probably the best toner from Sulwhasoo, it's a liquid toner with a slightly tacky finish that gives your skin an amazing glow and intense moisture and when used with the emulsion provides an amazing complexion not even a Siberian winter could ruin.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Emulsion EX: The unskippable product responsible for most of the moisture of this line. I use two pumps every day and night and the deep, warm scent of red pine just embraces my skin and lulls me to sleep, something I do not appreciate in the morning lol. This emulsion is super fast-spreading and is the same texture as the Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX. When used with the water my skin is super soft, glowy and smooth and ready for the next treatment step. Tbh if I ever go home at 3AM and feel not even human, I just double cleanse, use the water and this. And I wake up to dewy skin, albeit at 11AM.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Serum EX: Containing the highest amount of red pine extract in the entire Timetreasure range, this serum is thick and creamy and smells lovely, one pump is enough for your face and neck. I am too young to see any wrinkle improvement but I can say that it gives my skin that extra 5 hours of sleep and I don't wake up with pillow marks on my face any more. It's amazing and it's such a rescue for dry skin. My mom actually saw some brightening and wrinkle reduction, her smile lines have softened, her forehead lines are gone (mine can never be because I tend to move my forehead a lot, she doesn't), and she has glowy skin even though she sleeps 4 hours a day. After a month, I'd say she looks at least 5 years younger. As for my grandma, her skin improved as well. She has super dry skin and the Timetreasure range is exactly what she needed. Her skin became firmer, her sagging was minimized and the skin looked brighter.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Eye Serum: This was launched along with the Timetreasure cleansing foam, a new eye product for better anti aging effect around the eye contour, the serum is meant for dark circles and loss of elasticity, it also provides some lifting as well and gives a “wide awake” effect, while the eye cream is meant for moisture, wrinkle correction and to increase the effectiveness of the eye serum. This comes with a golden eye care massager and with an instruction video to use both the eye serum and cream. The serum is thinner in texture compared to the Timetreasure facial serum. It sinks in quickly and when used with the accompanying massager and following all the steps, my eyes do look lifted and awake. My mom refused to use this as she thinks it's too much work though, my grandma enjoyed it though.\r\n\r\n+Timetreasure Renovating Eye Cream: I have noticed that this eye cream might come off as thick, but it's actually some sort of patented manufacturing process that makes this cream fluffy, not thick. Thick is like O Hui The First's eye cream, this one is actually just really fluffy, that’s why it melts down into an oil around your eyes which feels reallllly good. This when used alone provides firmness to my eyes. But when used with the serum, it's a life changing experience. My eyes have never looked this good. I could hold a baby next to my face and actually see no difference between our eyes. I truly love this product and the eye serums. My HG.\r\n\r\n+Sulwhasoo Timetreasure Renovating Cream: This cream has the most intense red pine scent of all the Timetreasure products. This is a thick rich cream that has a slightly brownish-red tint and actually DOES NOT go on smooth. It is tacky as hell. Do not even dream of using this without an emulsion. But when you use it, oh boy, it just locks everything in and gives such long lasting moisture without clogging pores (But common sense is required, this range is not for oily people!) It works even better with the serum, it made my skin so plump and radiant. And everytime my S.O kisses my cheek he always say that I smell like herbs, which is a good thing (I hope lol). The entire range as whole has changed my skin, I can't say the same for any skincare range (the two exceptions are Whoo's Hwanyu and Guerlain's Orchidee Guerlain, they are exceptional in their own way, and probably the skin I have today is the result of rotating between really expensive skincare and not sticking to just one brand.)\r\n\r\n-Harmonizen: If you think Timetreasure is pretty intense, this is not the end of it. Harmonizen is the mother of all Sulwhasoo intense-ness. And when I say my skin has an obnoxiously expensive taste for skincare, boy do I mean it. This line has one product and one product only, the holy Harmonizen Regenerating Cream EX. The cream is loaded with beneficial ingredients that I challenge you to read without gasping for air, and is meant to be used with the Timetreasure line in place of the Timetreasure Renovating Cream EX for ultimate anti aging. Some use it as a night cream due to the price (650,000 won, broooo, bro. Bro.) and texture. Also if it makes you feel any better paying an extortionate price for a 60ml jar of facial cream, some also use it in place of eye cream and serum \r\n\r\n+Harmonizen Regenerating Cream EX: Sulwhasoo's most expensive item out of all of their offerings. Formulated with Dermosul™ technology, and loaded with powerful extracts such as salvia miltiorrhiza (danshen) which is actually clinically proven to have an anti wrinkle effect, ginseng extract, red and white ginseng saponin, murumuru and shea butter, angelica actiloba, mugwort, cnidium officinale, two types of licorice extract (glycyrrhiza uralensis and glycyrrhiza glabra for brightening), broussonetia kazinoki and oldenlandia diffusa for extra brightening (please see http://www.google.com/patents/US8647683 for a patent of a whitening ingredient composed of these ingredients), powerful humectants such as Sodium PCA, natural moisturizing factors (NMFs): ( Squalane , Beta Glucan, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Glucosamine, Cholesterol),  green tea leaf extract, meadowfoam oil, quinoa seed extract, vitamin E (tocopherol, tocopheryl linoleate), red pine extract (hello there Timetreasure), allantoin (for soothing benefits), fatty acids (arachidic acid, behenic acid), amino acids  (serine, alanine, glutamic acid), vitamin CG (ascorbyl glucoside), arginine, and finally the legendary Jaumdan decocted in honey. Wow. That was a mouthful. Anyways, the cream smells like herbs and stuff, very Sulwhasoo-y, but it is very faint and will disappear the moment you put it on your skin. But according to the website, the scent is composed of “Mugwort, pine, clove, Frankincense, white sandal wood, Agastache rugosa” or whatever the hell that is. It is SUPER SUPER SUPER thick, about the thickest cream I have ever witnessed in my life and goes on super smooth, it melts into your skin and then you'll have this sort of waxy finish for the first 5 minutes then it shifts into a smooth, silky finish. You are meant to use the accompanying obsidian spatula as an applicator / massage tool.  After two jars, I can conclude that this is indeed my HG cream out of all creams. My mom and grandma loved it as well. My skin was glowing and radiant, I think it actually made my skin one tone whiter, not brighter and my biggest dark spots shrank into tiny ones that you can't see without closing up on my face like a maniac, and it kind of makes my skin feel like when I was using the Whoo Hwanyu Ampoule (which is way more expensive than this tho) so maybe I can save some moolah after all :> My mom said her skin was so much brighter and her wrinkles have faded (not all of course). And she loves the fact that she can skip serum and eye cream with this product because she is a lazy bean :v My grandma said she thinks that it makes her face more vibrant and more rosy, which none of the products she tried done for her. I think this is definitely worth the money )) if it’s good, it’s worth it, it's not expensive, just high priced :v If you pay a shit ton for something with poor ingredients and does not work, then you can call it expensive.\r\n\r\n-Essentrue: Signature body care line from Sulwhasoo. It has a anti aging and moisturizing effect with honey and schizophyllum commune, pine nut oil, lotus fruit oil, prunus mume oil, apricot kernel oil and camellia oil\r\n\r\n+Essentrue Silky Body Serum: This lives true to it's name, it goes on so fresh and silky smooth and leves my body glowing as if I used a body oil, but this is not half as heavy. \r\n\r\n+Essentrue Deep Nourishing Body Cream EX: A lovely product to layer on top of the body serum in colder months. This feels so nice and luxurious and I can feel it wrapping my body in pure goodness. My mom said it also helps with her flabby arms.\r\n\r\n+Essentrue Hand Cream: It exists but almost nobody knows about it. And I can't get my hands on it no matter where I inquire. Must be discontinued.\r\n\r\n-Basic and Special: A line of miscellaneous products to accompany your regimen\r\n\r\n+Gentle Cleansing Oil EX: God damn do I love this oil, it deletes 9 layers of makeup in one go and moisturizes to no end. I recommend this to people who have blackheads as well and they find that it makes extractions easier and it helps minimize pores. I sometimes do musical plays so I tend to wear a lot of makeup, face painting and what not. And this removes everything :o I love it! And it smells amazing!\r\n\r\n+Gentle Cleansing Foam EX: A gentle cleansing foam that does not strip skin while effectively cleansing. I use this in the shower, mostly to get rid of the excess conditioner lying around on my skin. It smells good. pH 6.5-7\r\n\n+Gentle Cleansing Water: Gentle,  smells good. I wouldn't pay this much though?\n\r\n+Herbal Soap: My HG during breakouts. This smells strongly of ginseng (me likey) and foams like a dream. My breakouts cleared overnight. Bigger breakouts? 3 days. Remember to moisturize though as this is really drying, like really, but is it worth it? Hell yes. \r\n\r\n+Benecircle Massage Cream EX: This upgraded twice a week massage cream has a cream to oil formula plus the scent of plum blossom instead of the old signature Sulwhasoo base scent. I like the older one tho as it gives more control, while this is too slippery and makes massaging a bit harder. I also prefer the old scent. But I have to admit it moisturizes better than the old massage cream. Both give me a rosy glow due to increased circulation. I actually use this everyday. The oil emulsifies beautifully so if the pump bottle of the oil is too hard for travelling for you then try this since it's in a convenient tube and it removes makeup nicely, not as well as the oil but it wasn't designed for that anyway. If you have dry skin then use after FCAS and wipe excess off with tissue. If you have any other skin type other than dry, rinse after using and then apply FCAS.\r\n\r\n+Clarifying Mask EX: A twice a week peel off mask used after the emulsion step to help it absorb better and brightening + exfoliating. This smells so good and texture is honey like yess. My skin is so smooth and soft after using this. The only peel off mask I like. But the only con is that it takes 9 lives to dry a.k.a 30 minutes. \r\n\r\n+Overnight Vitalizing Mask EX: A thick, rich creamy sleeping mask that compliments your Sulwhasoo moisturizer perfectly without suffocating skin, it can be used as a night cream for oiler skin types. I love the smell and it feels like my skin is reborn every time I use it. \r\n\r\n+Radiance Energy Mask: Containing real white jade, this sleeping mask purifies skin for a brighter tone. AND BOY, SHE THICK. SHE THICK. Wow. Like this is so nice for dry skin and I feel like I am so blessed with this baby :o\r\n\r\n+Herblinic Intensive Infusion Ampoules: This baby is so good at calming down breakouts. A surefire anti acne combo is Herblinic + Herbal Soap + FCAS.. Use this after water and before emulsion. An anti aging ampoule that helps with acne? WOW. I AM SHOCKED. The miraculous anti acne effect isn't even advertised so I guess it's a beneficial side effect lol. My skin is way softer and smoother btw.\r\n\r\n+Microdeep Intensive Filling Cream and Patch: My mom uses this and I could visibly see her smile lines soften and it lasts! Just do your regular skincare after you do this treatment and the lines shouldn't come back. Sure it's not Botox but I mean it's something lol\r\n\r\n+Luminature Essential Finisher EX: This is created with Locsamhyo, a complex of ginseng and green tea for superior anti oxidative properties and is meant to be a long term preventive measure to prevent free radicals in an urban environment. This goes on as the last step of skincare (before sunscreen in the AM and before sleeping mask in the PM) to lock in the effects of your skincare and give your skin an antioxidant boost. I feel like my skin is fresher and brighter vs. just using skincare alone, and it helps my cushion / BB cream stay brighter for longer. Over years of using this product, I’d say that the benefit it give me (smaller pores, smoother skin, rosy glow) are far beyond what I paid for.\r\n\r\n+Firming Neck Cream: Originally from the Goa line, this neck cream promises to firm up neck skin and increase elasticity. My mom is using this but she is not getting much results  what a bummer. It smells nice though.\r\n\r\n+Renodigm Dual Care Cream EX: Pronounced “ren-no- dime”, it's a sunscreen / day cream if you're lazy. It not only contains SPF but also TPF to protect your skin from UV rays and heat, the causes for hyperpigmentation. It smells lovely and it's my HG sunscreen because it is so nice and so rich in moisture. It is a ridiculous price to pay for sunscreen though. Fun fact I used to call this “ren-no-dig-um”. Also did yall know AmorePacific own the patent to the TPF measurement? Shook.\r\n\r\n+Trufresh Soothing Mask: Meant to be used with Renodigm Dual Care Cream EX at night as part of thei heat protection solutions. You can use this as a rinse off mask (before FCAS) or a sleeping mask / night cream if u got oily skin. I smell Laneige Water Sleeping Mask vibes.\r\n\r\n+Essential Balm: Multi purpose moisturizing balm for eyes, lips and cuticles. Smells nice and keeps my lips soft. Some people put it on insect bites and split ends apparently. \r\n\r\n+Camellia hair oil: Smells lovely and tames frizz. Would not pay this much for a hair product if it ain't Goldwell though.\r\n\r\n-Hollistic Care: A series of products that embodies the Sulwhasoo spirit of tranquility. \r\n\r\n+First Peace: This home fragrance collection is inspired from the First Peace Essential Oil used in Sulwhasoo SPA. It has a candle, a potpourri, a fragrance sachet in the lineup and can only be bought in the Flagship store of Sulwhasoo. Therefore I will not mention this in the Flagship store section again. The candle can be bought outside the Flagship Store with another design though. \r\n\r\n+Plum Blossom: Just like the First Peace collection, but it also features a perfume oil for use on the body. None of the products from this collection can be bought outside of the Flagship Store. There is also a hand cream duo set that has the Plum Blossom and First Peace hand cream attached so you can't buy them separately. They make my hand so soft but I like First Peace more tbh.\r\n\r\n+Invigorating Ginseng  Extract Ampoule: A 4-week supply of supplement ampoules with ginseng extract. I haven't tried this as I feel like they might benefit old people more. I'm going to get my dad a box of this for Lunar New Year.\r\n\r\n+Lantern Collection: A golden-glazed version of their bestsellers: Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX, Essential Balancing Water EX, Essential Balancing Emulsion EX, First Care Activating Serum, Perfecting Cushion Intense. Perfect for any die hard Sulwhasoo fan and collectors as well. Having this full lantern collection is just about as much of a feat as owning every Shineclassic compact from every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Lunar Zodiac Sign Collection: First Care Activating Serum EX in 12 designs featuring the lunar zodiac sign of your choice. All 12 zodiac signs can be bought at the Flagship Store at any time of day and any year , however the representative zodiac sign for the current year will be sold everywhere worldwide, not limited to the flagship store. (For example Sulwhasoo's FCAS has a dog on it this year and sold worldwide, but the other 11 zodiac signs are only sold in the Flagship Store)\r\n\r\n+Herbal Tea: Teaming up with Osulloc (Korea's #1 premium tea brand also from AmorePacific), Sulwhasoo releases 4 kinds of herbal teas to complete the holistic beauty experience. The range has Red Ginseng Blended Tea, Samdayeon Jeju Tangerine Tea (my fave), Sejak Green Tea, Plum Blossom Herb Tea. These tea actually taste really good and I asked my friend to get me like 5 boxes of Samdayeon Jeju Tangerine Tea lol I am addicted. Good for sipping when drama and conflicts happen. Sip sip bitch.\r\n\r\n+Herbal Soap: They also launched a new Herbal Soap collection with 4 facial soaps: Pine (for stressed, acne prone skin), oldenlandia diffusa (for brightening), licorice (for abundant moisture), red ginseng (original formula for skin lacking vitality and polluted with toxic substances)\r\n\r\n+Balm Series: Contains the Essential Balm with redesigned packaging and two other balms. Deep Relax Balm (Haven't tried this yet, supposed to be the Essential Balm but with a more relaxing scent), and Lip Tint Balm (lovely color that adds a rosy touch while not being too obvious about it)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is it for my post, 40k char max",

And when I read some online reviews, I realized, the actual mask is super thin and lodged between two pieces! Lol, ok I am not good with hydrogel-ish masks.

    "body": "📣 **1. Vice x Jelly Eugenio** collection has finally launched, and the palettes & palette bundles are reportedly already sold out on Tiktok Shop. The palettes and the travel brush set haven't launched on Shopee or Lazada yet though.\n\n\n📣 **2. Colourette** First Base Everyday Skin Tint has 8 new shades, as reported in the previous beauty news bulletin*, and they're now released and available for purchase online.\n\n\n📣 **3. Issy** celebrates 3 years of their Active Skin Tint with a new ad & influencer campaign highlighting the evolution of the product, its inclusive shade range, and its position as the brand's #1 best-selling product and as #1 top-selling product in its category on e-commerce sites.\n\n\n📣 **4. Happy Skin** has unveiled a new dewy gel tint called Lip Jelly with 6 shades and claims to be glossy, budge-proof, lightweight, true-to-shade, and infused with hyaluronic acid & squalane. The brand also previously rolled out their Roller Blotting Paper that looks similar to the Fenty Beauty Invisimatte Blotting Paper.\n\n\n📣 **5. Sunnies Face** introduces their new Lash Seeker mascara, which claims to be longwearing & waterproof compared to their previous mascara that came in a custom mold mascara tube in their signature color but wasn't waterproof. The brand also released an eyelash curler w/ their new mascara. Other unreleased SF products previously reported*:\n\n• SF BLUSH ON a long lasting cheek pigment\n• SF LIFEBROW a flexible sculpting grooming gel\n• SF LIP GLAZE a nourishing peptide lip treatment\n• SF DREAM SERUM\n\n\n📣 **6. Detail** has restocked their Jelly Lips Lip Plumper gloss with 2 new shades called Drip, a medium purple mauve, and Ms. President, a sheer magenta pink. Other unreleased new products from the brand are:\n\n• Detail Lip Leisure in Baby, Naked, Sandbar, Teddy, Cinnamon, Afternoon Tea, Rose Latte, Bask, Affection, Pleasure, Cashmere, & Maraschino\n• Detail Supersharp Liner in Point Black & Apex Brown\n\n\n\n📣 **7. BLK**'s Happy Hour summer collection is now available in all e-commerce platforms. They have fixed the typo on \"COMPEXION Booster\" by removing the phrase entirely from the bottles via photoshop on their campaign photos and scratched off from the actual bottles irl. The brand also has upcoming new products in the pipeline:\n\n• BLK Soft Blur Powder Foundation\n• BLK Soft Blur Primer with Color Adapt Technology SPF35 PA++\n• BLK Tinted Sunscreen Primer Stick SPF 50 UVA/UVB PA++\n• new shades for their Color Sticks, Airy Matte Tints, eyeshadow quad, and a possible relaunch (or just a restock?) of their Skin Tint Sun Shield SPF 30\n\n\n📣 **8. Teviant** has launched a new product called \"The Ultimate Skin Master Skin Perfecting Starter,\" which seems like a moisturizer + primer in one.\n\n\n📣 **9. Strokes'** new brow collection, consisting of Brow Definer Palettes & Brow Shaper Brow Defining Pomades, is now available on Lazada, Shopee, & Tiktok Shop.\n\n\n📣 **10. CuCo** or Curated Colors, a sub-brand of Vice Cosmetics which initially launched with nail polishes, has a new upcoming unreleased product called \"Cuco Pure Bliss Melting Lip Balm.\"\n\n\n📣 **11. EB** has released new matte lip products. The newest one is a liquid lipstick called Lip Ink, which comes in 6 warm shades. The other one is a matte lip crayon called Colorlock Lippie, which launched a few weeks ago with 12 mostly warm & a few neutral shades.\n\n\n📣 **12. Seoul White Korea** has already unveiled their new sun stick, which was the pink sun stick teased by influencers as reported in the previous beauty news bulletin*.\n\n\n📣 **13. Fresh Skinlab** has launched new sunscreens under their Jeju Aloe Ice and Tomato Glass Skin lines in time for the summer and has Marco Gumabao on board as their new celebrity endorser.\n\n\n📣 **14. Luxe Organix** has a new high SPF sweat & water-resistant sunscreen called the \"6 in 1 MaxShield Face & Body Sunscreen.\" \n\nThey also have a new \"Tinted Lip Essence\" that's similar to the Dr. Sensitive Tinted Lippie Oil that became viral a few weeks ago. Interestingly, Luxe's product was registered on the FDA portal way back in Oct 2023 while Dr Sensitive's tinted lip oil was registered in Jan 2024.\n\nTheir fragrance line Luxe Fragrances has also added 3 new scents for women called Secret Desire, Dreamy Bliss, & Sweet Serenity. Their women's fragrance line now has a total of 7 EDT scents.\n\nSome influencers are teasing an unreleased SPF loose powder, which might be the Luxe Organix 24H Zero Sebum Instant Pore Blurring Weightless Matte Powder SPF 50 PA++++ (Natural & Translucent) according to the FDA portal and they also have a new unreleased lip sunscreen called \"Luxe Organix Panthenol Therapy 24H Lipscreen Sun Lip Essence SPF 50 PA++++ (Clear Glaze)\".\n\n\n💖 That's all for now and as always try not to get overwhelmed, only buy what you need, and purchase responsibly.

But I got the Jelly Eugenio x Vice brushes and I love them so far. Since I got into Korean makeup techniques, been loving smaller brushes and light layers so these are perfect. \n\nThey are priced so well too! Presyo of a few FilliMilli or the cheapest JungSaemMool brush lang. These are a better buy than travel-sized Marj brushes for me because may bruses na magamit for eyes and brows as well. \n\nThe palettes look good value too IF wala ka pang masyadong products because they look thoughtfully selected. Daming textures and consistencies to play with. But for someone with a full kit, maybe no. Unless you want to experiment w different looks cos there’s enough there for that.",

    "body": "Dehydrated skin is not a skin type as much as it is a condition of the skin. It doesn't discriminate between dry, oily, or combination skin and can be aggravated by topical skin care as much as lifestyle (binge drinking or smoking, for instance). \n\nIt's hard to describe dehydrated skin, since I feel it can present itself differently in many people. However, in my experience, it's generally skin that appears lackluster and dull, sallow or \"tired,\" and when pulled taut, it almost seems to wrinkle a bit. Dehydrated skin doesn't \"bounce back\" easily and is more prone to congestion (bumps, blackheads) and acne. It generally soaks up moisturizer yet looks oily in spots and feels dry as a bone in others.\n\nThe first thing to consider, and the most obvious, is moisture content. Do you drink adequate amounts of water a day? This doesn't mean chugging water until you feel like a portable kiddie pool, but you should be drinking 4-6 glasses a day. \n\nAnother facet of moisture is how much moisture is around your skin and what is on your skin to drink that moisture up (and hold it to the skin itself). For people in drier environments or simply those of us prone to dry or dehydrated skin, I highly recommend investing in a warm mist humidifier (cold mist must be cleaned more frequently and makes a room feel clammy). I run mine virtually every night, and it makes a noticeable difference in how plump my skin remains throughout the day and night.\n\nYou also want to be paying attention to what kind of ingredients are holding moisture to your skin and how you are using them. I'm talking humectants here, such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and squalene.\n\n[Glycerin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol) is easily the most recognizable and common humectant. It should never be applied straight, though a couple drops can be added to your favourite moisturizer if you feel in need of a boost. It *is* fairly sticky though, so I wouldn't recommend adding more than two drops. On that note, I recommend against doing this during the day, since it can make skin more \"shiny\" and sticky. \n\nGlycerin is found in most skincare products and is widely available. It is also an acne trigger in a small number of people.\n\n[Hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) is a naturally derived ingredient that can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water. It is very light, thin, and usually is not sticky. It is most commonly found in serums, but is also becoming more widely used in creams and lotions. It is best applied to damp skin (not sopping wet, but not completely patted dry either) during your water-soluable phase. If you're using it as a serum, follow it with a rich moisturizer.\n\nSome people find hyaluronic acid drying. Your mileage may vary.\n\nSome examples of products containing hyaluronic acid:\n\n* SERUM. [Garden of Wisdom Hyaluronic Acid Serums](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/hyaluronic.html) are fabulously light-weight and effective. They are also very reasonably priced. You can purchase a sampler pack to try, which has enough product to last you 1-2 months, depending on usage. I suggest trying the cosmocil CQ blend of preservatives if your skin is sensitive.\n\n* CREAMS AND LOTIONS. [CeraVe](http://www.lovelyskin.com/products.asp?MID=119) products are fabulous if they work well for your skin. I'm sure readers of this subreddit get tired of hearing us talk about CeraVe, but they are reasonably priced, widely available, and contain great skincare ingredients, such as niacinimide, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides ([which may be beneficial for eczema in some people](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18306855)). It is recommended that you spot test CeraVe products if you are acne-prone.\n\n* UK OPTION. [Hydraluron Moisture Booster](http://www.boots.com/en/Hydraluron-Moisture-Booster-From-Indeed-Labs-the-people-who-brought-you-Nanoblur_1262210/) is available from Boots and may be a great choice for people who are not sensitive to algae ingredients and just want a basic, no-frills HA product they can buy from a brick-and-mortar store. I've never used it personally, but it does seem to get rave reviews from people who use it.\n\n[Squalene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squalene) is a natural, organic compound that is usually derived from olives. It's close sister, squalane, is a hydrogenated derivative that has longer shelf life, but she has a lower cost and is therefore more profitable in cosmetic applications. People who have a sensitivity to olives or break out from topical use of olive oil should spot test products with squalene before using. \n\nSome examples of products containing squalene/squalane:\n\n* US OPTION 1. [Solvere](http://www.lovelyskin.com/details.asp?PID=115991&amp;MID=545&amp;PG=1) is a regularly recommended, no-frills moisturizer for those who do well with squalane. \n\n* US OPTION 2/UK OPTION 1. [La Roche-Posay Toleraine Fluid](http://www.dermstore.com/product_Toleriane+Facial+Fluid_677.htm) is a cosmetically elegant, light moisturizer. It applies very light and thin, yet moisturizes beautifully if you have oily or combination skin.\n\n* UK OPTION 2. [Oilatum Natural Repair Face Cream](http://www.boots.com/en/Oilatum-Natural-Repair-Face-Cream_9627/) is a fabulous option for UK residents on a tight budget. It is a great little moisturizer that packs quite a punch for roughly £8.\n\nYour success with the various humectants are very individual. Some people prefer hyaluronic acid for their extra moisture while others prefer glycerin. Whatever you choose, keeping extra moisture around will allow your humectants to work to the best of their ability.\n\nThe next thing to consider when aiding dehydrated skin is your product usage. Are you using several topicals that dry or irritate skin? Some examples of irritating ingredients are:\n\n* Salicylic acid\n* Benzoyl peroxide\n* Tea tree oil\n* Topical acne medications (Rx treatments, such as Aczone, Retin-a, Retin-a Micro, Differin, and Tazorac)\n* Sulfur topicals (such as Murad's spot treatment [3%], De la Cruz Sulfur Ointment [10%], and Queen Helene Mint Julep Mask)\n\nIf you're not using any of these ingredients but feel your skin is dehydrated, make sure you're not using a cleanser that strips the skin and makes it feel dry and tight after cleansing (prior to applying moisturizer). *Your skin should never feel this way after cleansing, it is a sign of a damaged skin barrier.* It should feel pleasantly fresh, not squeaky clean. Some common cleansing ingredients and products that cause dry skin in many (but not all) people:\n\n* African black soap\n* Plain ol' bar soap\n* Dr Bronner's soap\n* Acne cleansers, such as Neutrogena's Deep Clean Facial Cleanser or orange bar\n* Cleansers with SLS or SLES, such as Purpose\n* Drying clay masks used too frequently (such as Aztec Secret Indian Clay Mask)\n\nIf you're using an irritating non-RX product, it is advised that you use only one at a time and only once skin is healed and can tolerate it. Even anti-acne products can cause acne if they are irritating the skin and disrupting the skin barrier. Please allow at least one week for your skin to heal if you feel you've overdone it (bland moisturizer, bland cleanser, sunscreen).\n\nIf it's an RX product you're using, please contact your doctor for advice.\n\nFor those of you using a harsh cleanser (*glare*) or one that makes you feel dry and tight after use, I highly recommend you shelve it and try a gentle, non-sudsing cleanser, such as CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser or Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. This will cleanse the skin without stripping it of its much-needed moisture.\n\nThe most important thing with skincare is listening to your skin and working with it rather than fighting against it's nature. When skin is dehydrated and breaking out, you must treat the disease, not just the symptom. Once you have established a high-moisture, gentle regimen, and your skin has had time to heal (1-2 weeks), you may gradually begin to re-introduce potential irritants such as benzoyl peroxide or tea tree oil.\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful and answers questions I see many of you posing every day. Please feel free to ask questions and I will do my best to answer them!\n",

There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

    "body": "Hi all! This is my mega review of lotion, skincare, makeup, shower, hair, nail, and miscellaneous beauty items from Dollar Tree. \n\nFor context, I’m 26F with oily, sensitive skin. My skin tone is fair olive leaning neutral-yellow. My hair is light, coarse, and very oily. I also live in a southern, rainy city, so these products have to stand up to not only my oily skin, but humidity and heat as well.  \n\nMy goal in making this review is to give honest opinions while reducing overconsumption. Hopefully, showing you what is worth your $1.25 at the DT will encourage smarter buying and stop you from having to purchase products you won’t love just to test them out. If you have any further questions about items, please don’t be afraid to ask.\n\nI’ve purchased these products over the past months and given them extensive time to be tested. In fact, I’ve already repurchased a few of my favorites.\n\nAs always, please keep in mind that what works for me may not work for you and vice versa. We can agree to disagree on different beauty items since we’re all unique and have different beauty needs. \n\nLotion Products:\n\nDermasil Hand Cuticle Cream\n\n-Basic moisturizing hand cream. I use this exclusively for manicures and on my feet at night. It dries down pretty quickly but still leaves behind a nice feeling of moisture. The bottle is huge so you definitely get bang for your buck. The smell is a little odd, it reminds me slightly of plants? But it’s very subtle and not obnoxious. Overall, solid choice and I’m not mad at it. 4.5/5\n\nDermasil Cocoa Butter Body Lotion\n\n-Again, this also vaguely smells of plants for some reason? Not in a cocoa way, there’s something else there. But I don’t particularly mind it. I usually HATE body lotions but I enjoy how quickly this dries down while still leaving me feeling hydrated and smooth. I just wish it smelled a little differently. 4.5/5\n\nVaseline All Purpose Cream Cocoa Glow\n\n-I love this stuff. I actually glow when I put it on. The biggest downside is that the lotion is THICCCCKKKK. It will be on your skin for years to come. I actually don’t mind it that much because it makes my skin so incredibly soft, but I know that it’s not everyone’s favorite feeling. I’m at the end of the bottle and have been using it to slug my super dry feet, and man, do I see the difference! 5/5\n\nDove Body Love Beauty Cream \n\n-This is advertised for face and body, but I use it exclusively on my hands. It is the perfect travel hand cream that sits in the front of my tote. Does it smell like old ladies? Yes. Does it bother some people? Yes. Do I care? No. This makes my hands so soft and has ultra convenient packaging that makes this my most reached for cream. I will buy this until the end of time. 1000/5\n\nUdderly Smooth Hand and Body Cream\n\n-A solid contender! I don’t find myself reaching for it often as it’s newer, but when I do, I’m satisfied with the results. In my opinion I don’t see much difference between this texture and the texture of the dermasil lotion, but there’s something about it that leaves me feeling just a tad softer. 5/5\n\nSkincare Products:\n\nDermasil Oil Free Daily Face Cream\n\n-A decent, fragrance free moisturizer. I experienced no problems with this, though it didn’t wow me. 3.5/5\n\nb-pure Eye Serum (Olay Dupe)\n\n-My favorite eye cream that I’ve ever used. I have extremely sensitive eyes that typically turn red and water when eye cream gets anywhere near them. Not with this! I also notice my dark circles appearing brighter and smoother. 5/5\n\nSnail Mask\n\n-Hellooooooooo, sailor! This leaves my face plump, smooth, and supple. I will snatch these up any time I see them in store. 10/5\n\nCareus Hydrocolloid Bandages\n\n-These are far superior to any face acne patches that I’ve tried. For years, I’ve been purchasing these to use on my breakouts, and they’ve never steered me wrong. They’re very thick and large, so some people may not enjoy that. I just find that their staying power holds up to my oily skin and sticky, humid climate. 10/5\n\nSkin Nutrition Botanicals Tea Trea Oil + Salicylic Acid Balancing Face Wash\n\n-Hello, holy grail! You can pry this out of cold, dead hands. My skin has never been smoother. I have very oily and congested skin, and this softens and clears it immediately. I have 4 bottles on standby because I will never stop using this. 1000/5\n\nDermasil AHA Glycolic Acid Toning Solution \n\n-A wonderful toner that does the job! I’ve actually begun to use this exclusively on my armpits and feet to help make them softer and a less smelly. Beforehand, I used it on my face and saw that it made me quite glowy, I just no longer need it with my other products! 5/5\n\nb-pure Makeup Remover Cleansing Oil\n\n-I’ve been using this for a while, and WOW. I use bulletproof makeup and this will take it off my face while leaving my skin soft and hydrated. I find it to be quite comparable to other cleansing oils from higher end skincare. 5/5\n\nSkin Nutrition Botanicals Multi-Peptide Anti-Aging Serum\n\n-A cult favorite, and for good reason. My face feels soft and bouncy when using this serum. But, don’t take my 26 year old word for it- my 64 year old mother LOVES this stuff. LOVES. IT. She’s always asking me to pick her up another bottle. I can tell her skin is especially bright and supple as of late, and it’s all because of this. 5/5 \n\nSkin Nutrition Botanicals Niacinamide 5% + Squalane Serum\n\n-Another cult favorite! My skin has been especially bright and clear lately, and I believe that this is the foundation of that. I actually like this more than the multi peptide serum due to not really needing anti-aging products. It absorbs into my face quite quickly instead of sitting on my skin, and it feels amazing to be put on in my hot climate. This is one of my holy grails. 1000/5\n\nb-pure Hydrating Night Cream (Olay Dupe)\n\n-Another holy grail. First of all, the glass packaging? Classy. I feel like a fancy lady. Second of all, this doesn’t bother my skin while making it very soft and supple. I don’t really have lines at my age- I bought this mainly because I can’t find a moisturizer that hydrates deeply without clogging my pores. Well, I found it! And I appear super smooth! It’s fragrance free too. 1000/5\n\nb-pure Hydrating Moisturizer (Day Cream, Olay Dupe)\n\n-b-pure, baby, WHY DID YOU PUT FRAGRANCE IN THIS?! We could’ve had it all if you had just left it out! I’m pretty sure this is the culprit that broke me out the other week as much as it also softened my face. If you’re not bothered by fragrance, I’d pick it up. Otherwise, stay away. 2/5\n\nOrchid Cherry Acne Patches\n\n-These are more cute than practical. I find that they stick on my skin fairly well, but they just don’t suck out gunk like the Careus does. I would recommend throwing these on acne spots if you want to leave the house while concealing breakouts. Otherwise, I don’t find them overly effective. 2/5\n\nMakeup Products:\n\nBeauty Collection Makeup Blending Sponge\n\n-I am, admittedly, a snob when it comes to makeup sponges. I’ve been using beauty blenders and real techniques blending sponges for years without trying anything else. I picked this up on a whim thanks to the rainbow packaging and boy am I glad I did. This is almost 1:1 to my real techniques sponge. I’ve actually been reaching for it over my old sponge as of late. I bought another one just to have since I don’t see myself spending money on a name brand sponge ever again as long as this is around. 5/5\n\nIoni Ultra-Hold Brow Glue \n\n-As someone with thick, unruly brows, this is all I need and more in a brow glue. Your hair will NOT MOVE. Those with thinner eyebrows may not love this thanks to how thick the product is. I LOOOOVE it though. 5/5\n\nLe Mercerie Matte Makeup Setting Spray \n\n-Full disclosure: setting sprays have never done much for me because of the swamp I live in and the oil on my face. But, despite setting spray never lasting, this actually compares to the high end ones that I’ve tried. Even Urban Decay All-Nighter can’t survive on my skin. I won’t buy expensive setting spray ever again when I have this guy that I can reach for. 4/5\n\nIoni Fake lashes Wispy Cluster Lite \n\n-These are my new favorite lashes! The clear band gives you wiggle room on placement, and these are so soft and natural! I wore them for a photo shoot outside in the 90 degree heat last month, and they did not move and looked amazing on camera. 5/5 \n\nb-pure Essentially Ageless Blur Face Primer\n\n-A basic primer that does the job. It smooths my pores, but I wouldn’t say it makes my makeup last any longer since I have such oily skin. I’m going to use it up, but probably not rebuy since I’m not someone who benefits much from this type of smoothing primer. 4/5\n\nb-pure Essentially Ageless Blurring Pressed Powder (Transluscent)\n\n-This. This. This. I get shiny within an hour of applying makeup, even with heavy powder. I bust this bad boy out and powder my face down without zero cake. It blends into my skin smoothly and doesn’t make me look crunchy or gross. 5/5\n\nPowder Applicators \n\n-Simple applicators, the ones that come in travel cases. They work well and allow me to powder all over my face or in choice areas. 5/5\n\nb-pure Glow Up Contour (Fair/Medium) \n\n-One of the holy glow up trinity. I don’t contour. I don’t like bronzer. It usually looks too warm and muddy on my greenish skin tone. HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT! This blends into such a beautiful, light finish that gives a hint of warmth on your skin. I’m not a fan of heavy makeup since it slides off my face, and this fits the bill. You can build it up if need be too. 1000/5\n\nb-pure Glow Up Blush (Ballerina)\n\n-Another part of the glow up trinity. At first glance, this comes off as clown pink. And yet, on the skin, it blends into such a dreamy, soft pink. I feel adorable and flushed without appearing too rosy with this on. It also stays on completely throughout the day. 1000/5\n\nb-pure Glow Up Highlight (Shimmering Pearl)\n\n-The final part of the holy three. This one makes me a little sad since I tried to powder over it to set it, and it completely faded away. I use it over powder now and it stays for quite a while! It doesn’t seem to have the same staying power on me as the blush and contour, though. Still, I use this every day, and I will use it until I can no longer find it. 1000/5\n\nIoni Liquid Blush (Soft Pink)\n\n-I thought that this would be slightly lighter, but I don’t mind the shade it turns into. It’s very muted which works well on me since I don’t prefer very bright colors. It starts off a little sheer but it’s buildable and long-lasting. 5/5\n\nLA Colors Shea Butter Lip Balm (Black Cherry)\n\n-Alright y’all, I was told that this is a dupe for Clinique’s Black Honey. Honestly? I do not find this to be a dupe as someone who owns both. This pulls much more purple than the muted nude of black honey imo. The zodiac lip oil in purple gold is much more comparable, shade-wise (swatched in pictures above, last slide: black honey, then L.A Colors, then Ioni bottom to top). BUT! That does not mean that I don’t love this lip balm! I find myself reaching for it as this is so comfortable and hydrating on my lips. 3/5 Black Honey dupe, 5/5 lip balm\n\nBeauty Intuition Coconut Cream Lip Balm \n\n-I use this as somewhat of an occlusive lip mask because it’s so THICK. Like ooo, thiccc. I wouldn’t wear this under a lip color since it would probably slide off. But, as a night lip mask, it’s not bad. I don’t really like the smell, though. 3.5/5\n\nIoni Lunar Zodiac Lip Oil (Purple Gold) \n\n-If you’re looking for a DT shade dupe of Black Honey, this is it. The two pull extremely similar on me. Also, as an oil and not a shade dupe, I really enjoy this formula! It’s less thick than the classic tinted lip oil, which I appreciate, personally. I reach for this often and find that it stays well, for a lip oil. 4.5/5\n\nIoni Tined Lip Oil (Plumberry and Pink Doll)\n\n-I see why these are holy grails, but I must deduct points for one thing…the packaging. UGH. I’ve had 2 of these break on me far before they’re finished. The giant applicators leak the oil, so it gets onto my vanity and purse. I’ve had bags stained because of this product. And yet, AND YET. I cannot stop using them. I fear the formula is that good. Plumberry is best on my skin tone so that’s my favorite so far! 4.5/5\n\nShower Products:\n\nSix Blade Razor\n\n-A basic razor that gets the job done. I much prefer this to the Bic 2 Blade razors. 4.5/5\n\nPower Stick Brazilian Mist Non-Foaming Shave Gel\n\n-I really enjoy the ways this smells, but it’s just…missing something? Something about it isn’t quite right. It may be that it’s so thick that sometimes I think it stops my razor from getting a clean shave. Yet, it’s quite moisturizing and good smelling that I can excuse the consistency. Just use a little since a lot goes a long way. 4.5/5\n\nSpa Luxury Super Smooth Shave Cream Coconut Cream\n\n-This smells much more like vanilla than coconut to me, which I actually prefer. This is a basic shave cream. I like it, no notes. 5/5\n\nSpa Luxury Vanilla Sugar Scent Body Scrub\n\n-Easily my least favorite item out of everything I’m reviewing today. The scent smells like fake, powdery vanilla, and it has no actual scrubbing powder. This is more like a cream with beads in it. Save your money and don’t buy. 1/5 \n\nPumice stone \n\n-A good, basic pumice stone. I use it to smooth out my foot callouses in the shower and it does the job well. 5/5\n\nHeart Head Massager\n\n-I am not one for head massagers but I LOVE this. I adore hearts and baby pink, but beyond its appearance, this item feels so nice to run across your scalp while in the shower. It feels like I’m a wet cat getting my head scratched by my loving pet parent. 5/5\n\nHair Products:\n\nb-pure Night Time Hair Serum\n\n- I typically am wary of leave in hair products since they can leave my light-colored hair looking oily and weighed-down. But this stuff? It never leaves me looking crusty or greasy! It smells nice and makes my coarse hair nice and soft. 5/5\n\nb-pure Multipurpose Hair Oil\n\n-I bought this thinking it would be much more lightweight than it actually is. It makes me look greasy pretty easily. What I’ve been doing is applying it to damp hair in conjunction with the serum, and it seems to balance out pretty well that way. I wouldn’t purchase this unless you really need deeply hydrating hair products or you enjoy hair oil in general. 2/5\n\nAnomaly Bonding Treatment Mask\n\n-I think I wanted to be more “wowed” by this. Instead, I found it’s a pretty basic hair mask, but for $1.25, I think that’s pretty nice! It does make my hair stronger and has a very nice scent to it. I think I’m just not the target audience for this one. Still, I appreciate it, and I’d repurchase. 4.5/5\n\nNails Products:\n\nb-pure Cuticle Remover\n\n-Pretty decent the few times I used it to get stubborn cuticles off my toenails. I don’t find myself reaching for it very much since my cuticles aren’t in bad shape, but it worked well when used. Solid 4/5\n\nColor Vibe Gel Like Nail Polish\n\n-Surprisingly opaque and sturdy! I own this line in a few different colors and all of them are vibrant and shiny. 5/5, I’d choose one of these before a drugstore nail polish.\n\nCandy Moyo Nail Polish\n\n-Another solid nail brand. I would say it wasn’t quite as impressive as Color Vibe and I needed more coats in the colors that I own, but again, I find this very comparable to drugstore nail polish. 4.5/5\n\nL.A. Colors Glow in the Dark Nail Polish\n\n-I wanted to like this more, but it was so sheer! You can build it up if you feel like trying, I just couldn’t handle the feeling of so much polish on my nails. Sadly, 3/5\n\nKozmic Colors Iridescent polish\n\n-I use this as a nail topper because it’s very sheer. Still, I find it prettier than the glow in the dark polish thanks to the added sparkle and shine. 4/5\n\nBelieve Jetsetter Mani (When in Rome)\n\n-My grandmother actually purchased this and I was shocked by the quality! It’s opaque and lasted an entire week on my nails without chipping. Solid 5/5\n\nOpi Mini polishes \n\n-Adorable little colors that I enjoy using for details. 5/5\n\nL.A. Colors Art Deco Nail Art Lacquer\n\n-I wanted to like this, I really did. It’s just so…goopy. Eugh. 1/5\n\nNail Soak Off Caps\n\n-I like using these when I’m soaking off my nail polish to keep the cotton balls in place. They work exactly as advertised. 5/5\n\nb-pure Cuticle Oil Balm\n\n-This. This is the STUFF. It makes my nails and cuticles so smooth, wow, I LOVE it. It’s not as messy as an oil while being just as moisturizing. 10/5\n\nb-pure Nail Drying Drops\n\n-I was pretty skeptical when it comes to these, but oddly, they work? They don’t dry the polish completely, in my experience, but they get it dry enough for me to add another coat without having to wait too long. For what they’re worth, I think they’re nice. 4/5 \n\nb-pure Cuticle Oil Pen (Mango)\n\n-I love this stuff! I am always oiling my nails and this comes in hand, especially on the go. Also, I usually hate the smell of mango, but this does not offend me. 5/5\n\nb-pure Nail Polish Corrector Pen\n\n-A pretty decent tool that I use to clean up the sides of my nails. It doesn’t get thicker pieces of polish and dries out pretty quickly, but for $1.25, I’m not mad at it. I keep about 2 at a time on me. 3.5/5\n\nCuticle Cutter\n\n-I usually use this little tool to get rid of my cuticles more than anything else. It’s easy to store and simple to use. 5/5\n\nCuticle Pusher\n\n-Not my favorite tool, though I think that’s more because of personal preference rather than product quality. It works when I need it to. 5/5\n\nNail Art Tools\n\n-I refuse to buy nail art tools from any other place because these are so solid. They’re great little dotting and painting tools. I find myself using them a lot when I need to paint my nails and want to do something fancy. 5/5\n\nIoni UV Nail Art Glue\n\n-I like this for what it is, though I’m lowkey a little concerned we’re selling UV glue without more warnings out here. I like it, it keeps my nail charms in place, but I’d recommend using regular nail glue instead of trying to cure this. 4/5\n\nIoni Nail Art Tweezers\n\n-These are great at picking up tiny little charms and moving them around! I would think you could use them to place lashes precisely too. 5/5\n\nDiamond Nail Files\n\n-My favorite nail files! I haven’t been able to find the glass ones (whomp whomp) so these are all I know. I will not repurchase another brand. Love em. And they’re super cute. 5/5\n\nNail Stamping Plates\n\n-Perhaps I’m stupid, but I couldn’t get these to work AT ALL. I tried so many times too. For me, 1/5. For smarter, more handy people, you may like them much more. \n\nNail Stamper\n\n-Considering I used this with the nail plates and could not get it to work, I’m afraid it’s getting caught in the crossfire. I couldn’t get it to work. But, I think it works fine, and this is all the fault of the nail plates. 4/5\n\nNail Art Gems\n\n-I love these things. They’re very unique and easy to apply. Sturdy, cute, and fashionable. 5/5\n\nMiscellaneous items (most of these live in my purse):\n\nAssured Cotton balls \n\n-Decent enough cotton balls. They fall apart a bit more than I’m used to, but I mean, it’s cotton balls for $1.25. 4/5\n\nAssured Cotton rounds\n\n-Same as the cotton balls, these fall apart a bit much for my liking, but they get the job done. 4/5\n\nArm & Hammer Deodorant Towelettes (Simply Fresh)\n\n-These have been my best friend this summer! I sweat pretty extensively in the southern heat so I enjoy pulling these out and wiping my body down before I start to reek. They leave me smelling fresh and moisturized. 10/5\n\nb-pure Watermelon Scented Hand Wipes\n\n-I find these to be incredibly convenient to pull out of my bag when my hands are sticky or a little gross. They smell nice and leave my skin feeling nice and soft. 5/5\n\nb-pure Watermelon Scented Hand Sanitizer Spray\n\n-I LOVE this stuff. There’s so much product in here and it smells amazing. I wish that they sold holders for these, because then they’d surpass the Touchland dupes for me. I keep one of these in my car and my office and they’re ultra useful. 5/5\n\nOral B Floss Picks\n\n-A small, portable bag that does the job. I use one after lunch out and about or at work. 5/5\n\nCurad First Aid Portable Pack\n\n-Way more useful than I thought it would be, but as a warning, this is only bandaids and alcohol wipes, not a full fledged first-aid kit. Still, I’m pretty clumsy and cut myself often and these bandaids stop me from bleeding everywhere. I also love that I can keep it in my bag and it takes up barely any room. 5/5\n\nTravel Brushes\n\n-Nice and thick little makeup brushes that I use to touch up my powder and eyeshadow throughout the day. The giant mirror in the case is a bonus. 5/5\n\nb-pure Antibacterial Hand Wipes\n\n-I adore the individual packaging on these! I can just pull one out and hand them to others or use them myself without touching a whole case of wipes. 10/5\n\nb-pure Moisturizing Hand Sanitizer + Case\n\n-Are these revolutionary? No. Are they the best smelling thing I’ve ever heard encountered? No. Do I like it? Yes. Yes I do. I keep this on my purse strap as a keychain and I can’t tell you how easy it is to just spray some sanitizer without having to rifle through my bag. The formula itself isn’t groundbreaking, but I will repurchase if I encounter them naturally in the wild purely for the convenience factor. 5/5\n\nMini Facial Razors\n\n-I found that these are best on the go. I prefer other facial razors for home while I keep this in my bag for any peach fuzz I missed with my other razors. The packaging is very smart since it keeps the blade hidden and clean. 5/5\n\nTravel Nail File\n\n-Ultra easy to carry in my bag to take care of hang nails on the go! Plus, look how cute it is. 5/5\n\nWaterbrush Pens\n\n -I bought a pack and filled them with jojoba oil thanks to the advice of some in this sub. And I love it! They do the job. 5/5\n\nSassy and Chic Brush Holder\n\n-I bought this to store brushes in my bag, but even with my giant bag, I found it bulky and yet somehow not large enough to store what I wanted. Maybe this just didn’t work for me, but I found that this was more of a wasteful purchase at the end of the day. 2/5\n\nHand Fan\n\n-I found this in the crafting aisle just the other day! This is so perfect to use just to fan my makeup dry or to provide some cooling relief in my hot room. It’s surprisingly study too! 5/5\n\n\n",

        "body": "So many of my faves on here! I LOVE the Ballerina blush! Being very fair and very cool toned, it’s rare I find a pink blush that actually shows pink on me (any warmth in it at all and it’s peachy or orange, depending on how much warmth it has. And it seems majority of pink blushes, even if they look cool toned, have some warmth 😒). So when I first saw it, I just got 1 thinking it wouldn’t actually show as pink on me. I got home and tried it and IMMEDIATELY went back and got 3 more lol. Now whenever I see them, I grab 1. But just 1 because I’m not greedy (even though I’m tempted to grab them all and run every time I see them 🤣 But, I HATE when I see something on here or social media I want to try but can’t find it because of people grabbing up all of them *cough, cough* resellers, *cough* - who is buying DT items from these resellers at their hiked up prices is beyond me. I’d NEVER pay more than retail for something. But, people are buying them up from them. It’s crazy!).\n\nI didn’t like the contour though. Way too warm toned on my very cool toned skin. But, works okay as a bronzer shade so I can use it up. Great formula though like the blush if the shade works for someone. \n\nThe soft pink blush is one that turns more peach on me. But, it’s not too bad where it looks off on my cool toned skin, and it’s a great formula. SUPER pigmented. Only need a TINY bit! \n\nLOVE the peptide serum! So hydrating and soft on my skin! Even when my skin is SUPER dry in the winter, it’s been AMAZING! And I LOVE that brand puts their stuff in opaque bottles! The global beauty brand, I wanted to try a bunch of theirs but, no way am I buying a serum with actives like retinol or vitamin C that come in a clear bottle. Those ingredients degrade in light, so they need opaque bottles. So I really appreciate they put theirs in dark, opaque bottles! \n\nI got the Ioni Brow Glue and don’t have really thick brows, but they grow down and it’s so hard to find a good brow gel that holds them in place, and this stuff really HOLDS!! Does feel crunchy in my brows, which I don’t love. But, it’s worth it for the hold and it doesn’t put a white residue in my brows! I just got the ioni brow wax, so I’m excited to try that one! \n\nI got the Ioni Tinted Lip Oil in Plumberry and love that! I gotta try the Zodiac Purple Gold one if I can find it!! \n\nI always get those pumice stones! They work great! Though last time I got a pink rectangular one, and I’m really liking it because with the pointed corners I can get around my toes easier 🤣",

    "body": "**24, F**\n\n**Skin type**: Dry, sensitive\n\n**Climate**: Hot, humid SG\n\nI was first introduced to the world of AB earlier this year around Feb-Mar, and Innisfree's Green Tea Seed Serum was my gateway drug though I've since scrapped that out of my routine. I've always known that my skin was dry and sensitive but I did not realise that beyond just being dry, I was also awfully dehydrated, which contributed to my skin sensitivity. At its worst, I had plenty of closed comedones on my forehead along my hairline, dry and flaky skin between my brows and under my eyes (with already bad hereditary dark circles + eye bags), and I would also randomly break into itchy hive-like patches on my face every now and then. \n\nMy first priority was to fix my damaged moisture barrier and the improvements were exponential once I got the hang of things. I haven't seen my skin flake once since I introduced a proper skincare routine, and in fact, my skin seems to have normalised to the extent of getting a little oily at the end of a long day. The hives I get on my face now are also few and far between, and are actual reactions to products that my skin doesn't agree with instead of just ... the air? \n\nMoving on, I've recently started introducing actives like Vit C, AHA and BHAs into my routine to address skin tone and textural issues. My skin is definitely far from perfect yet and I'm still struggling with some CCs and hormonal acne on my forehead and cheeks. Apart from attaining that healthy, 'glass skin' glowy look, my goal is to eventually rid my skin of these unsightly bumps, and also lighten the PIEs and PIHs I have from acne that have since healed. \n\nThe following are reviews of products I've tried over the past half year or so!\n\n**Legend:**\n\nHG - Holy Grail, products that I cannot do without and will repurchase to death\n\nRP - Repurchase(d), items that I enjoy but can live without\n\nMRP - May repurchase, products that I'm still in the midst of using and undecided if I like or dislike them\n\nWNRP - Will not repurchase, items that were a waste of my money\n\n~~Strikethroughs~~ \\- Products that I've emptied or sold off\n\n# Oil Cleansers:\n\n**~~Innisfree Olive Cleansing Oil~~** **(PM, WNRP)** \\-   This and the olive cleansing foam has a very similar citrusy scent that I found quite refreshing.  It has a pretty thick texture and isn't quite as slippy as I'd like in an oil cleanser. This was something I never realised, being my first oil cleanser, till I moved on to the Hada Labo one and realised how much softer and more comfortable that was in comparison. Unfortunately, this contains a couple of essential oils, which may be the culprit behind why I was left with red, sensitive spots numerous times after rubbing this into my face a tad longer than I usually do, or when I use this for Fiddy's grit method, hence WNRP.\n\n**Hada Labo Super Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Cleansing Oil‎ (PM, MRP)** \\-   I really enjoy how 'soft' and slippy this feels on my skin, which makes application really pleasant. It has no detectable scent. It removes my makeup/ sunscreen sufficiently well and leaves minimal oily residue behind, which makes this a pretty decent oil cleanser which I will repurchase unless I find something I like better. \n\n# 2nd Cleansers:\n\n**~~Innisfree Olive Cleansing Foam~~** **(AM/PM, WNRP)**  \\-   For a foaming cleanser, this was relatively gentle for my dry and sensitive skin, in comparison with the sample of Innisfree's Green Tea Cleansing Foam I tried which left me really tight and stripped. Nonetheless, this still leaves a bit of a squeaky clean feeling after washing, and I will not repurchase as the pH turned out to be on the high side.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujyun Foaming Face Wash (RP)**  \\-   This is a very gentle cleanser which leaves behind a slightly slippery film that took some getting used to, especially after my experience with the Innisfree Olive Cleansing Foam. On the flip side, I never realised how stripping the latter was until I tried this. I love how the bottle dispenses the product in such a soft, luxurious foam, and its low pH is also a plus. I already have a refill of this on standby, and will most likely RP till I find something better.\n\n# Clay Masks:\n\n**Innisfree Volcanic Clay Mousse Mask (Occasional use in the PM, MRP)**  \\-   I like how gentle this is, as long as I don't leave this on beyond the recommended application timing (15-20min). Although I don't notice any significant gunk-clearing effects with this, there have been multiple occasions where my face was originally red and blotchy, but calmed down after application of this. I also quite enjoy the walnut shell powder bits in this which means some physical exfoliation when I wash this off. However, I would usually need to rush and slap on a toner/FTE immediately after this or my dry face would start feeling too tight for comfort. MRP unless I find a better clay mask alternative. \n\n**Mamonde Petal Purifying Bubble Mask (Occasional use in the PM, WNRP)**  \\-   Confession: This was an impulse buy which I regretted. I guess I'm still keeping this around for the skintertainment factor, as this was my first bubble mask experience which can be a fun treat every once in a while. However this leaves too much of a squeaky clean feeling despite only one minute of application, and I will not RP especially given its price, and the fact that it does less than the Innisfree Clay Mask which I reviewed above.  \n\n# Actives :\n\n**Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin Drop (AM, MRP)** \\-   This was an interesting product - it's as thin as a serum with texture like a dry oil, and feels warm upon application. I use this in the AM after my FTE and toner, before my essences. I like that this gives me a nice healthy glow under my makeup, although I've noticed that it does make me slightly oilier at the end of the day. I haven't been using this long enough to tell if it's lightening my hyperpigmentation and I probably need to use this in the long term to judge, but it certainly does have an immediate brightening effect and evens out my skintone ever so subtly. Like many others, my main issue with this is the clear bottle it comes in, which makes it a lot more prone to yellowing. I'm undecided if I will repurchase this once I'm through, or moving on to a stronger Vit C product, depending on how effective I find this to be. \n\n**Cosrx AHA Whitehead Power Liquid (PM, WNRP)** \\-  After reading many rave reviews, I had high hopes for this product to resolve my textural issues, but I was left disappointed. Being my introductory product into actives, this initially stung my face and left me flushed, but it eventually wore off and I got used to it. When it stings these days, its more of an indication that my skin is sensitised or my moisture barrier is broken. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to do anything for my CCs and patchy forehead so I WNRP after finishing this bottle. I'm also using this on my arms for my KP but progress is slow. Perhaps glycolic acid just isn't for me! \n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA (PM, MRP)**  \\-   This feels more gentle than the Cosrx AHA yet more effective in smoothing my skin out. It absorbs really quickly into my skin with almost zero tingling, so I end up layering this a couple of times whenever it drys, which means I use this up pretty quickly. This has a unique, candy scent to it which I don't really mind. I may either repurchase this or even try the 10% version next. \n\n**Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid (PM, MRP)**  \\-   This has a slightly thicker consistency than water, and I used to think that it did absolutely nothing for me, if not even irritating my skin when I used this all over my face in the first step of my routine. However, this is slowly winning me over after I attempted using this as a spot treatment in the last step of my routine, where I use a dry qtip to wipe off product residue on my targeted spots, then go in with the other end of the qtip soaked in the BHA. I find that using it this way either helps draw CCs to a head for extraction or flattens them, and even noticeably diminished a milia spot that's been under my eye for months. I'm currently using a decant from my sister's bottle, and am still undecided if I will be purchasing the full size or switching over to try something stronger like TO's Salicylic Acid 2% or Paula's Choice 2% BHA after I've used this up. \n\n# First essences:\n\n**~~Mamonde First Energy Essence~~** **(AM/PM, WNRP)** \\-   I tried a 30ml miniature sample of this and quite enjoyed this. This has a thin, liquidy consistency which is absorbed really quickly once patted in, and has a faint floral smell. I can't quite put a finger on what FTEs do for me, but I definitely notice a difference in the resilience of my skin when I have FTEs in my routine, and without. However, I did not repurchase this after using this up as I was trying to cut alcohol and fragrance out of my routine in case they were compromising my dry, sensitive skin, and this product has both ingredients.\n\n**Secret Key Starting Treatment Essence Rose (AM/PM, HG)**  \\-   This has a pleasant, yeasty smell to it and is absorbed fairly quickly by my skin. I've noticed my skin looking slightly more refined ever since this was introduced to my routine, but the game-changer for me was applying multiple, thin layers of this before my hada labo premium. This product gave me the first glimpse of what 'the glow' looks like, which also made me realise that:\n\n1. I've been mistaking oiliness for glowiness.\n2. My skin *loves* ferments!\n\nThe moment of realisation came after I washed my face one morning and noticed my bare skin looking bright, clear and just almost translucent-ish, something I've never perceived before. The packaging too - solid, frosted glass body with a rose gold cap - is also another factor to earn this a permanent spot in my skincare wardrobe! At the rate I'm going through this, I'm really glad that its priced so affordably. I might want to try the regular version of this next out of curiosity, which has a slightly longer ingredient list and also includes arbutin which is currently lacking in my  routine. Fingers crossed it works just as good, if not better! \n\n# Toners:\n\n**Mamonde Floral Hydro Ampoule Toner (AM/PM, WNRP)**  \\-   This has an interesting texture - when first dispensed from the pump bottle, it comes out in a clear, aqueous, almost gel-like blob but subsequently turns more watery and disappears as its patted into the skin. It's pleasant enough to use, but I will not repurchase after finishing this bottle (which seems to last forever) after realising that this has both alcohol(third in the ingredient list) and fragrance as well. I'm looking out for a gentle and hydrating toner I can use multiple skins of, so I won't be repurchasing after I use up this bottle. \n\n**Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion (PM, MRP)**  \\-   Being so highly raved about on this sub, I had pretty high expectations for this product and I'll admit that I was left slightly underwhelmed. It does leave my my skin plumper and more hydrated, but it's also a little too heavy for my liking and it takes a while to be absorbed fully, hence I only use this in the PM. Nevertheless, I still find this to be a nice carrier to mix with other products like TO's Niacinamide, or when I need an extra boost underneath a sheet mask. I'm still undecided if I will repurchase this or try out the original Gokujyun Lotion once I've run out, but I'm really liking this no-frills brand so far.\n\n# Sheet Masks:\n\n**Calming:**\n\n* [Innisfree Skin Clinic Mask: Madecassoside](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8rkyx4/review_entire_range_of_innisfree_skin_clinic_masks/) (HG)\n* Benton Snail Bee Masks - These would've been HG for me as well if not for the fact that it's a little hard to get hold of where I am, plus it's on the pricier side.\n* Leaders' Insolution AC Dressing -   These are great for soothing and healing as well, but I haven't had the chance to test it out proper during a full-blown reaction(not that I want to) so I can't bestow the title of HG on it just yet. \n\n**Brightening**\n\n* Papa Recipe Honey Bombee Masks: [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8z9e8m/review_papa_recipe_honey_bombee_mask/), Rose Gold (both HG) -   Performance wise I see almost no difference in these two, so I'd just get whichever's cheaper and more available to me. \n* [My Beauty Diary: Black Pearl, Natto](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/95k7nm/review_my_beauty_diary_bestseller_masks/)\n\n**Others**\n\n* Innisfree My Real Squeeze Mask: [Bamboo, Broccoli](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8wuhze/review_innisfree_my_real_squeeze_mask_pt3/), [Fig, Pomegranate, Honey](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8vtrbl/review_innisfree_my_real_squeeze_mask_pt2/), [Oatmeal, Coconut](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8upq33/review_innisfree_my_real_squeeze_mask_pt1_cream/) \\-   These are just nice to keep around in my rotation for occasional use in between since they're quite affordable especially when Innisfree has promotions, though they're pretty basic.  \n* [My Beauty Diary: Hyaluronic Acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/95k7nm/review_my_beauty_diary_bestseller_masks/) \\- Good for basic hydration when my skin is in need\n\n# Essences/ Serums/ Ampoules :\n\n**~~Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum~~** **(AM/PM, WNRP)**  \\-   This was my first introductory product that got me into AB in the first place. It has a special place in my heart, though honestly on hindsight, I probably fell in love with this only because I was so excited to have found a 'mass market' skincare product that didn't irritate my sensitive skin. I know some people can't stand the scent of this, but I personally didn't mind it. Nevertheless, I wasn't quite comfortable with ethanol being so high in the ingredient list, and also later on realised that for its price, this was quite a basic product that provided nothing much more than hydration. I did not repurchase this after finishing up the bottle, and do not plan to especially after discovering so many superior alternatives.\n\n**~~Cosrx Advanced Snail Mucin 96 Power Essence~~** **(AM/PM, WNRP)**  \\-   I really wanted to like this product, especially knowing how it's another cult fave around here. Unfortunately, I was getting a bit more CCs than usual while testing this, and even broke out in hives a couple of times after application, and wasn't sure if this was the culprit. Given its short ingredient list, I really have no idea which ingredient I was sensitive to. It's not snail either, since I've tried and loved and Holy Moly Snail Mask (discontinued, whyyy??), and the next product in this list which is my HG, also contains snail. I sold this off after making it about 20% through. Perhaps I was also put off by the idea applying snail secretion on my face, and the gloopy, stringy texture of this did not help at all. That said, I've found this to be great for soothing itchy mosquito bites! \n\n**Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence (AM/PM, HG)**  \\-   It took me abit of courage biting the bullet and trying this after my experience with the Cosrx Snail, but boy am I glad I did. Unlike the goopy, stringy texture of the Cosrx, this has more of an aqueous gel consistency that is refreshingly lightweight and is absorbed quickly by my skin after patting it in. It also noticeably calms my skin down whenever it’s red and irritated. I only wish that I managed to try the old formulation especially after hearing that many preferred that over this new one. That said, this has definitely taken an irreplaceable spot in my routine unless I find something just as great. I am currently starting on my second bottle of this!\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% (PM, WNRP)**  \\-   I've read about how this product helped many in resolving blemishes and oil production and thought this would be a good addition to my routine. I mix a few drops of this into my Hada Labo Premium which somehow helps it to absorb better, but I really don't see what this is doing for my my skin despite using this regularly for 2 months now. I'm also not a fan of how it tends to foam up when patting into my skin. I'm currently putting this on hiatus and will decide again if I'm selling off my used bottle or continuing to finish this through. Definitely won't repurchase, since on hindsight, a number of items in my routine already has niacinamide anyway. \n\n**~~Scinic Honey AIO Ampoule~~** **(PM, WNRP)**  \\-   This was yet another cult favourite I had high hopes for but got disappointed with. I read that some people really like the scent and I was expecting a fresh, sweet honey fragrance but this smelled a little more spicy and cloying than I expected, which took a little getting used to. The amount in the jar was generous but also really a chore to dispense, and I had to transfer to an airless pump bottle for convenience. It comes in the form of a slightly viscous, golden gel that is easy to spread (a little goes a long way) but leaves a sticky finish on the skin that takes some time to disappear. It's certainly hydrating and I can see why some people like it, but I wasn't sure what it was doing for me. I also stupidly introduced this into my routine with a few other new products simultaneously which gave me a bunch of CCs, so I had to pare down my routine, put this on pause, and with the huge bottle + need to decant this into a pump bottle, I eventually lost patience and just sold my remaining jar off. I never found out if this contributed to my CCs but to be on the safe side, I won't repurchase. I also recently tried a sample of the Skinfood's Propolis Enrich Essence and I much prefer its simpler formula, hydrating properties and luxurious packaging. \n\n# Lotions/ Emulsions :\n\n**Mamonde Floral Hydro Emulsion (AM/PM, MRP)**  \\-  This is a really lovely light and hydrating lotion to use in the AM, which is really saying something given that I live in hot and humid SG. I use this in the last step of my AM routine, or mixed with one pump of Stratia Liquid Gold before my moisturiser in the PM if my skin is desperately dry. This has a thin and non-oily consistency that spreads really easily and drys down to a satin finish, and plays nice with my sunscreen and makeup after. Close to HG status for me, my only qualm is that this contains fragrance and alcohol, both of which I'm trying to avoid in my routine. I'll most likely try other lightweight moisturisers before I make the call about repurchasing this when I'm through. Nevertheless, this is worth trying out if you're not sensitive to fragrance and alcohol! \n\n**Stratia Liquid Gold (PM, MRP)**  \\-   I recall being sold on this product after seeing this one heck of a sexy ingredient list. It's definitely a lifesaver for one of those times when your skin is rebelling, going through a drought or overexfoliated. This has worked well on dry patches on my face. On it's own, it's a little hard to spread but can quickly get too much if you pump just a bit more, so I found that this has the perfect slippage when mixed into my Mamonde Floral Hydro Emulsion. I only use this in the PM when I need it, since it leaves a slightly oily sheen on my face.\n\n# Creams:\n\n**~~A'Pieu Madecassoside Cream~~** **(AM/PM, WNRP)**  \\-   At this point I'm certain that my skin just enjoys being a *difficult little bitch* and protesting whenever I try this sub's favourites on it. I previously ranted about this product [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/91jt0f/discussion_what_products_will_you_never_touch/e2zhsjk) Basically it did the opposite of calming my skin down and made me realise I was sensitive to high amounts of essential oils, plus the urea and lactic acid probably irritated my skin further. Also, it pills awfully under my makeup. I sold the entire tube off after trying it only a couple of times. \n\n**Mamonde Moisture Ceramide Light Cream (PM, MRP)**  \\-   This product was a godsend for me dry, flaky skin when I first started on AB, and also introduced me to the wonderful world of ceramides. Having tried both this and a sample of the 'Intense' version in the same line, I much prefer this for its smooth, creamy texture that is sufficiently moisturising without being overly greasy or heavy. I usually scoop a small dollop of this and it absorbs well into my skin after patting it in, leaving my skin soft and silky the next morning. I just wish that this doesn't contain alcohol and fragrance, and like the Floral Hydro Emulsion, I will most likely try other fragrance and alcohol-free alternatives before deciding if I'm repurchasing this again.\n\n# Oils:\n\n**The Ordinary Rosehip Oil (PM, WNRP)**  \\-  This is another product I wanted to like, but I really don't see what it's doing for me. The smell is also rather unappealing to me. I've been mixing a few drops of this as well into my body moisturiser to use up the bottle more quickly. Perhaps I've been misinformed about the benefits of this oil and have been looking out for the wrong effects or using this wrong, and would appreciate if fans of this could talk me back into liking this!\n\n**The Ordinary Marula Oil (PM, MRP)**  \\-   It was tough finding reviews for this one on this sub, since its more popular counterparts like rosehip or squalene often outshine it. I decided to try this on Gothamista's recommendation and ended up fancying it more than rosehip oil. This is definitely more luxurious and 'oily' so a little goes a long way, and it leaves my skin plump and well-moisturised the next day. When I'm through with this, I might either repurchase or try TO's Squalene Oil instead just to see what the hype is about. \n\n# Eye Products:\n\n**Petitfee Black Pearl & Gold Hydrogel Eye Patch (AM, RP)** \\-   I've reviewed [this before](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8i7449/review_petitfee_black_pearl_gold_hydrogel_eye/), and ended up repurchasing my second tub of this after trying another product (SNP Bird's Nest Aqua Eye Patch reviewed below) and didn't like it. This is not so much of a must-have product for me, but nice to slap on for a quick, albeit temporary pick-me-up on those dreary mornings after a bad night's sleep. \n\n**~~SNP Bird's Nest Aqua Eye Patch~~** **(AM, WNRP)**  \\-   These were similar to the Petitfee ones, except that the essence in this was much more viscous and gooey. However, the main problem with this for me is that because of its consistency, it takes a lot longer for the essence to dry down before I can apply my concealer on my undereyes, and even when its dry, it PILLS. I resorted to having to wipe the extra essence off my face before I could proceed with my makeup which kinda defeats their purpose. I concede that these feel a tad more hydrating and brightening than the Petitfee ones, but unfortunately I don't have the luxury of time every morning to wait for these to dry and take effect. Finished and did not repurchase.\n\n**IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye Cream (AM/PM, MRP)** \\-   I'll admit, I was sold on this product purely by just looking at its sexyass ingredient list. I mean, an eye cream with *niacinamide, peptides, caffeine, vit C, vit E, ceramide and retinol, etc etc*?? Gimme!! It comes in a little blue tub and the cream is tinged blue as well, though I'd say it's just for cosmetic purposes and doesn't perform any colour-correcting functions. The cream is on the denser side and a little goes a long way, but even when I accidentally go a little heavy handed, this cream still spreads and absorbs really well without leaving a greasy layer. A plus is that it works well in the AM underneath my concealer without pilling too. That said, this is indeed on the slightly pricier side and given the price tag plus ingredient list, I haven't seen any miracles being performed on my awful dark circles yet. I've barey made a dent in the tub though, so perhaps i can only make a fair judgement after I've used this up. \n\n**Laneige Eye Sleeping Mask (PM, WNRP)**  \\-   This was an impulse buy, and while I wouldn't say that I regret this, I can definitely do without it. It comes in a white, viscous emulsion that takes a while to dry down into a slightly tacky film. It does nicely hydrate the skin around my eyes but doesn't do anything for dark eye circles, nor did it claim to do so. I like that this is one of the few eye products that comes with an applicator, but in this case I always cringe a little at how unsanitary it feels to dip the ceramic ball wand back into the bottle after application. The bottle seems to last forever though!\n\n# Sleeping Mask :\n\n**~~Mamonde Calming Hydro Sleeping Mask~~** **(PM, WNRP)**  \\-   Yet another impulse buy, this is what I dub as 'regret in a tub'. I actually enjoyed how lightweight this felt initially, with a texture and consistency similar to that of the Cosrx Overnight Honey Mask. Until one day I was applying this underneath my nose, and caught a whiff of what smelt like straight-up rubbing alcohol. Yeaa ignorant days when I didnt realise ethanol was 2nd in the ingredient list. I couldn't bring myself to use this on my face after that but couldn't sell it off either, so I ended up repurposing this as a subpar body moisturiser just to use it up. Pity about the alcohol, otherwise it feels like this would've been a nicely soothing and lightweight AM moisturiser. \n\n# Sunscreen :\n\n**Skin Aqua UV Watery Gel (AM, MRP)**  \\-   This is the first sunscreen I'm using on my face, on a daily basis, in my 24 years of living. *\\*Cue gasp\\** I guess better late than never, right? Thank goodness I was lucky enough to chance upon this product that my picky skin seems to like, especially after trying some samples of Innisfree's sunscreens, all of which stung and sensitized my skin for some reason. I have a suspicion its either the zinc/titanium/iron oxides that I'm sensitive to, so I'm steering clear of all physical sunscreens to be safe. This comes in a white gel that applies pretty smoothly and leaves no white cast nor sticky residue. It does leave my skin slightly dewy looking but never oily, and plays well underneath my makeup. This is definitely my first (sunscreen) love, but I might wanna check out other sunscreens in the market before deciding if I wanna return and bestow the title of HG to this baby.  Any recommendations are welcome!\n\n# Others :\n\n**Innisfree Bija Trouble Spot Essence (Am/PM as needed, WNRP)**  \\-  I find that most AB products tend to be a little vague when it comes to 'spot treatment' in terms of what should be used when, since 'spots' could refer to a huge range of skin issues. As far as I've tried, I'm not sure if I'm using this wrong but this does naught for whiteheads/ blackheads/ SFs/ clogged pores/ cystic acne or any other type of acne it seems. In fact, I discovered that this works the most effectively in calming down itchy spots or hives when my skin freaks out, or post-extraction to soothe broken skin. I'll probably replace this with the Cosrx Centella Blemish Cream once I've run out. \n\n**Cosrx Acne Patches (PM, HG)**  \\-   This used to do nothing for me until I realised that it works best when applied on zits that have already popped. It's now my go-to everytime I extract a spot, and this helps to draw the remaining gunk to the surface so that I can clear it proper the next day, or just help to flatten swollen spots within a couple of days. In comparison to other brands of hydrocolloid patches I've tried so far, this works the best in terms of adhesivity. \n\n**Mario Badescu Buffering Lotion (PM, MRP)**   \\-   I wouldn't call this a miracle worker, but it does help to either bring those deep, painful cystic acne to a head, or shrink them to a smaller, more tolerable size after several days of use. I just wish that the application of this was more friendly though.  I might wanna try the Alivelab Centella Dressing Powder after I've used this up.\n\n# Wishlist :\n\n* The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% / Paula's Choice 2% BHA / Stridex\n* Klairs Supple Preparation Toner (Unscented)\n* The Ordinary Squalane Oil\n* The Ordinary Ascorbic Acid 8% + Alpha Arbutin 2%\n* Melano CC Spot Treatment Essence\n* Skinfood's Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence/ LJH Vita Propolis Ampoule\n* Cosrx Centella Blemish Cream\n* Benton Aloe Propolis Gel / SoonJung Moist Relief All In One Gel\n* Mizon All In One Snail Repair Cream (Black/ Original)\n\nTo add on, I'm not sure if this will be helpful to anyone since they seem quite no-brainer, but these are tips that I wished someone shared with me earlier:\n\n* Do not, I repeat, DO NOT touch your skin even if it feels itchy, because that almost always guarantees problems worse than what you started off with\n* Double cleanse to remove your sunscreen and makeup if you wear any! I can't believe I only discovered oil cleansing this year. \n* Clean your makeup brushes well and frequently\n* Use only clean towels for your face, and also always wash your hands before application of skincare products\n* Change your pillowcase as frequently as possible!\n\nHope this review helps!",

Suggest adding a snail mucin toner (instead of the glow recipe one), a HA serum, and a thicker night cream - like skinceuticals triple lipid or something with ceramides like Dr Jart ceramidin. You may want to consider prescription retinol as well - you can get a Rx online from somewhere like Lemonaid - since you have entered your 30s. There is a big difference between OTC and Rx retinol imo. If you want to be really extra, I take hyaluronic acid internally as a supplement I got off Amazon and use a humidifier in drier months (legit game changer for skin) which both helped visibly with giving me a healthier look. I would also suggest a lighter weight, dewier foundation like ilia skin tint (I get tonssss of compliments when wearing this. Xx",

It’s stifling for skin (and then they get to sell you even more products to cover up the imperfections and blemishes that the makeup gives you!). \n\nYour makeup is matt and quite heavy; it makes you look way older than 33, while your features seem, if anything, to be the kind that would make you look younger than your actual age? The winter weather can be really drying, too.\n\nI’d still advise using the exfoliating products, but maybe try some different ones- I’ve recently found glycolic acid really good (but at 40 I’m quite a bit older than you are), and I’ve been using Dermalogica daily microfoliant for about 20 years (I use this every day and glycolic acid a few times a week). Just make sure you keep moisturising +++ more than you probably think you need to.\n\nFind a really good ‘wet’/high moisture moisturiser and layer it under another, heavier moisturiser with HA in it (you can even apply an additional serum with HA or glycerine over the top of this). Reapply moisturiser during the day if needed. If you’re addicted to seeing yourself with makeup, maybe mix in a bit of foundation to make it a tinted moisturiser",

        "body": "Hi!! Esthetician here 👋 and I see clients like you all the time.  First of all you are using hyaluronic acid which is meant for people with dry skin.  If you use any moisturizer that has that, it most likely has oils in it. You need OIL FREE moisturizer.  Everything you use MUST be oil free. That includes moisturizer, cleanser, makeup (should use mineral makeup, sunscreen etc.  A lot of people think they’re using things without oils, but they are wrong. You have to use a product that specifically says it is oil free.  \n\nAlso you are using cleanser with squalene which is comedogenic, meaning it’s clogging your pores! So right from the get go your cleanser is making the problem worse! And stop all those serums it’s the same thing!!We have certain products at our salon but if you’re buying online you can do the following:\n\n-Kiehls deep cleansing foaming face wash (the brown on)\n\n-the lactic acid is ok \n- kiehls ultra facial oil free gel cream for moisturizer. \n\n-retinol is great but if you can get tretnoin from your doctor it’s a much stronger version of a retnoid. It will make your skin peel at first but this is a good thing as it means it’s exfoliating your skin. ONLY USE RETNOIDS IN EVENING (and only after cleansing) order is cleanser, retnoid, then oil free moisturizer on top. \n\n-you can also ask your dr for topical clindamycin if breakouts are bad enough which is a topical antibiotic that will kill the bacteria causing the breakouts deep in the skin.  \n\n-you also need to see an esthetician who will do regular glycolic facial treatments with extractions to help the process along by removing all the breakouts from your skin.  The other products mentioned above will help reduce reccurance.    \n-mineral makeup oil free\n-oil free mineral sunscreen\n\nHope this helps!!!! You are using too many products, many of them which are having the exact opposite effect of what you are trying to accomplish.\n\nYou must wash skin morning AND night! Morning you can wash, clindamycin from Dr and then use oil free moisturizer and sunscreen. That’s it!!!!! \n\nEvening you cleanse, alternate nights of lactic acid and tretnoin/retnoids and then oil free moisturizer on top. THATS IT!!! Simple is better. Your skin will get much better if you do this!\n\nI’m happy to answer more questions about this in comments :)\n\nEdit:  I’m sorry to say this, and I know that most people are just trying to help, but most of the advice on here is completely counteractive to the results you are trying to achieve. I promise if you do what I say above, your skin will clear up.",

        "body": "Holy moly, that is a LOT of actives! OK here’s the thing, I’ve learned the hard way that the least “fun” routine is what really pays dividends when it comes to skincare. I have a Sephora in my closet but every time I try adding something fancy to this routine, it bites me in the ass (actually face):\n\n- Get a simple-ass cleanser. I’m talking Pond’s Cold Cream. Use that to get your makeup off, then use something just as gentle as your double-cleanser (I use Avene oil wash but anything that doesn’t have an active in it and that’s glycerin-forward will work).\n- Get a pack of 50 wash cloths and never reuse a washcloth to dry your face (read: PAT it dry) ever again. Ever. \n- Buy an essence and slather while your skin is still damp. CosRX snail mucin is great, Rhode milk is great too if you want to be fancy. So many good K-beauty options, though. You can be fancy here if you like spending money but it’s not necessary. \n- OK now it’s time for actives. I’d start with tretinoin at night, whatever your derm recommends. Yes, go to the derm and get it if you don’t have it already. Use it for a year then look back at this photo—you will be amazed. For daytime, something with azelic acid in it will pair really well with the nighttime tret. Dr Idriss has a whole line of very efficacious products that use azelic and others to fight hyperpigmentation and smooth texture. \n- Moisturizer. For day, you truly cannot do better than La Roche Posay Double Toleraine. For night, unsexy but LRP’s lipikar triple repair body lotion is god’s gift to earth. And it’s double duty face/body! You will simply never have softer skin at any dollar amount. \n- Finally, look up skin cycling and start doing it. Get an occlusive like Vaseline or Aquaphor (steroid-free diaper rash cream is also *chef’s kiss*) and slather over all of the above (except actives) on recovery night. Dr Whitney Bowe on IG invented this and has lots of helpful content on how to get started. \n\n\nObviously everyone’s skin is different, you may have to tweak here and there, but give this kind of routine a few months and you and your happy hydrated skin will never look back.",

        "body": "So I was looking into [Physiogel Calming Relief AI cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/physiogel-calming-relief-ai-cream) in more depth, and I'm so confused about the ingredient Palmitamide MEA aka PEA aka Palmitoylethanolamide. Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

    "body": "For many of us, winter is upon us, which means dry, itchy, chapped skin. As a result, most of us have to change up our routines a bit to compensate for the lack of moisture in the cold air as well the amount of time we spend inside with our heaters blasting. \n\nThe most important things you need to remember when evaluating your winter routine are as follows:\n\n* How much **moisture** is in my routine?\n* What is my daily **environment** like?\n* What are my **habits** like?\n\n---\n\n**Moisture**\n\nThough moisture is part of the environmental issues behind winter skin, this portion will be primarily focused upon *what you are putting on your skin.* Creams, lotions, serums, powders, oils, and soaps are all part of our daily lives. However, there are general tips to follow when choosing these products as well as applying them.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, you want to try to **avoid irritating ingredients** as much as possible. Irritants include [bad alcohols](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2ebpCvtrMU&list=PL7QNgFLgKuaJNHEYFWWlt_9g9tF5KpG7C), fragrance, essential oils (such as lavender, peppermint, and eucalyptus), menthol, camphor, clove, and soaps (primarily sodium LAURYL sulfate). \n\nWhile purely anecdotal, I have noticed that when my skin is drier, it is also irritated much easier. This may be due to a compromised moisture barrier, [which is explained very well by Veronica Gorgeois](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_ihqNtYvmE). Some ingredients also simply irritate otherwise normal skin and dry it out, causing a vicious cycle of moisturization -> drier skin -> moisturization. Some of you may notice this when you use a \"tingly\" lip balm, such as Carmex, and find that your chapped lips actually begin to feel DRIER than they were when you purchased the product. \n\nHowever, if you are not using any of these ingredients and find that your skin is still drying out, consider adding rich, skin-loving ingredients such as argan oil, mineral oil, petrolatum (Vaseline), lanolin (body only), cholesterol, ceramides, aloe, and shea butter. Antioxidants such as vitamin C, niacinamide, and quercetin, are also fantastic for any skin type, year 'round, and prevent irritation. You should also look for products with humectants high on the ingredient list, the most common being glycerin followed by [hyaluronic acid](http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/hyaluronic-acid) and squalane. These products will hold moisture to the skin while occlusives such as mineral oil and petrolatum will *seal* it in. This is why we recommend using Vaseline in conjunction with your regular moisturizer. \n\nIf you have oily skin, you don't necessarily need to use a very rich moisturizer if experiencing dryness. Simply apply an occlusive to your driest spots or try a light lotion rather than your regular gel moisturizer (for example).\n\n**I also highly recommend using your moisturizer right after the shower or bath.** You don't even need to pat dry completely before application.\n\n---\n\n**Environment**\n\nPossibly the largest reason skin dries out during the winter is the drier winter air. To combat this, **get a humidifier**. A humidifier is a fairly inexpensive way to combat dry skin all year 'round, but especially during the winter. If you have a very large home, you may need two or three humidifiers to really gain the benefit. I recommend a *warm* mist humidifier, as it does not get as germy, nor does it make a room feel clammy like a cool mist humidifier can. \n\nAlso, be sure you are using sunscreen 365 days a year, no matter whether or not the sun is shining. If you're on the market for a good sunscreen, I highly recommend [Skinacea's write-ups on sunscreen](http://www.skinacea.com/sunscreen/sunscreen.html#.Uq6vWfRDt1g) before you buy. \n\n---\n\n**Habits**\n\nThis is very individual, but these are the things that have helped me the most:\n\n* **Avoid soaking in a bath without epsom salts or taking very long, hot showers**. In short, water strips necessary oils from the skin, especially hot water. This is much worse if you have hard water. Strangely enough though, I've found that rich, epsom salt baths help my skin more than hinder it. \n* **Exfoliate your skin more often, but do it gently**. I know we frequently harp on about chemical exfoliation here, but it is truly one of the best forms of exfoliation, especially for the face, since it avoids irritating the skin when used correctly. Exfoliating will facilitate a more normal skin-cell turnover rate, and thus, less dry skin. Look for AHAs such as glycolic and lactic acid.\n* **Drink your water**. As I've said before, there's no reason to go overboard and drink water until you sound like an ambulatory kiddy pool, but I personally notice an enormous difference when I am skipping out on my 64 oz of water a day. \n* **Take a fish oil supplement, if you tolerate them and they do not interfere with any medication you are on**. This can help people with dry eyes and dry lips. Your mileage may vary, but my mother and her optometrist swear by this for managing dry, winter eyes.\n* **Avoid over-washing your hands when possible**. Hand soaps are brutal on your hands, but more so when your skin is already dry. If you have particularly dry hands and/or cannot avoid washing your hands during the day, consider applying a thick lotion at night as well as an occlusive (Vaseline or Aquaphor are good choices) before slipping your hands into a pair of cotton gloves. You can do the same thing with your feet, save for the gloves.\n* **Speaking of Aquaphor, use it at night on your lips**. In the AM, gently buff away dead skin with a warm, damp washcloth. If petrolatum does not agree with you, [Lansinoh](http://www.amazon.com/Lansinoh-HPA-Lanolin-1-41-oz/dp/B0018DMYX4) is also fantastic. During the day, use a rich, plain lip butter or balm. I *really* love Nivea, such as [this one](http://www.cvs.com/shop/product-detail/Nivea-Lip-Butter-Loose-Tin-Vanilla-&-Macadamia-Kiss?skuId=910170) and [this one](http://www.iherb.com/Nivea-A-Kiss-of-Smoothness-Hydrating-Lip-Care-SPF-10-0-17-oz-4-8-g/45747?gclid=CKb2_cyltLsCFaxr7Aod-XAAqQ&gclsrc=aw.ds).\n* **Limit how much alcohol you consume**. This is really difficult during the holidays, but personally, alcohol really wreaks havoc on my skin after awhile. Again, this is individual, but definitely try to study how your habits affect your skin.\n* **Get more sleep**. I know, this is a pretty general skincare tip, but my winter skin needs all the love it can get, and I find that my skin is the first place I see problems when I neglect getting enough rest.\n* **Find a gentle, sulfate-free toothpaste.** This may seem like a weird one, but like soaps, toothpastes can dry out the delicate mouth and lips. I found that using a gentle toothpaste, like Biotene, has reduced not only my dry lips, but also the mouth sores I used to get.\n\n---\n\nHopefully this guide has been helpful to some of you out there. I know how bad dry skin can be (hello, eczema!), but you can manage it by evaluating your current routines and being as kind to your skin as possible. \n\nHave a lovely holiday, beautiful people! :)\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Hey y’all,\n\nI am going to review as many sunscreens as I can based on the many I have tried over the years. This is going to be a long one, but it is because I want to be specific and give as many relevant details as possible. I have normal skin I’d say with combo tendencies - I live in a climate that has super dry winters and really humid summers, so I change my routine a lot over the year. \n\nMy AM routine is as follows:\n\n1. Splash with water\n2. COSRx’s Propolis Synergy Pads\n3. Isntree’s Onion Newpair Essence Toner\n4. Cos de Baha’s 10% Azelaic Acid Serum\n5. iUNIK’s Beta Glucan Power Moisture Serum\n6. Gel Cream\n7. Sunscreen\n\nMy PM routine:\n\n1. Oil/Balm Cleanser\n2. Foaming Cleanser\n3. Peter Thomas Roth’s Unwrinkle Turbo Toning Lotion\n4. Cos de Baha’s 20% Niacinamide Serum\n5. NIOD’s Survival 0\n6. Gel Cream\n7. COSRx’s B5 D-Panthenol Cream\n8. Isntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Water Sleeping Mask\n\nI am going to rate each on a scale of 1-5, and will discuss what I liked or disliked. I tend to like sunscreens that dry down to a hydrated yet dry-to-the-touch finish, don’t become more oily or provoke dryness throughout the day, don’t leave a white cast, don’t have fragrance or alcohol, and don’t clog pores. I am going to vaguely say something has an impressive ingredient list a few times, so I will briefly list some ingredients I look for:\n\n1. Preference on hybrid sunscreens\n2. B vitamins, primarily panthenol and niacinamide\n3. Ceramides\n4. Antioxidant- or generally nutrient-heavy, non-fragrant extracts like centella asiatica, broccoli, pine, etc.\n5. Antioxidants like vitamins C and E; ferulic acid, etc.\n6. Peptides\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF50+ PA++++\n\n3.75/5\n\nThis is a hard one for me, because it is truly one of my go-to’s in the winter time and I have a weird affinity for it. It is surprisingly emollient to the point where I was glowing all day even in the driest of winters. This is never, ever dry to the touch; but it leaves you with such a hydrated and healthy glow that I can’t complain about it. This, at the same time, is a tricky one to recommend for dry climates because of its HA contents. For some, hyaluronic acid is a loss-heavy hydrator if not sealed in, and since this is the last step, it’s difficult to recommend it. It is a wash in humid weather, and actively causes acne for me when I try to wear it in those climates. I love it, though! It has such an amazing smell (I love sunscreen smell don’t @ me) and I just love its texture. Its ingredient list is a genuine humble brag, as well. \n\nSkin1004’s Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum SPF50 PA++++\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis, to me, is like an upgrade of the Isntree sunscreen. It is surprisingly similar to me in terms of ingredients and texture, but it dries down rather immediately. It keeps my skin very moisturized and hydrated, leaving a nice hydrated finish that doesn’t get oilier throughout the day. I worry this will dry me out in the winter, but in the currently very humid summer I have been going to this one more and more often. \n\nCanmake’s Mermaid Gel UV SPF50+ PA++++ Clear\n\n4.25/10\n\nThis is a classic for a reason, and it was my first AB sunscreen that I tried. It has no white cast, has a neat little smell, and it is surprisingly moisturizing for a sunscreen that dries down to a dewy yet try to the touch finish. This will always be a go-to, but I don’t like wearing it in the winter because it will dry out my skin and lead to some oily redness on my forehead. Perfect for the summer, as well as any day that it’s not oppressively dry. It has an amazing ingredient list, as well. My main issue is that it pills very easily - more so than any other sunscreen I’ve used. It’s just weird to me that it’s made by a makeup company and they couldn’t nail that part down haha.\n\niUNIK’s Centella Soothing Sun Cream\n\n9wishes - Pine Treatment Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++\n\n5/5\n\nThis is remarkably similar to Canmake’ sunscreen for me. I find that it has a very similar texture, but instead of the yellow tinted color, it’s a bit green. It ends up being a bit whiter as you rub it in, as well. This is a genuinely impressive ingredient list as far as extracts go, with pine of course being at the forefront. I love how antioxidant heavy it is, but I also think it dries down to this lovely, glassy finish. I prefer it over Canmake’s because of its more specialized ingredient list and lack of anecdotal pilling. The finish is just so silky smooth and healthy - I am a huge fan of this one. \n\nLa Roche Posay’s Anthelios UV Correct SPF 70\n\n4.75/5\n\nI love this sunscreen, and if it weren’t so emollient it would be a 5/5. This is literally an SPF 70, but goes onto the face as if it were clear. I would say that apart from invisible sunscreens, this has the most immediately clear cast I’ve ever seen. It’s very thick, and smells violently of La Roche Posay sunscreen - that is to say amazing. It leaves your skin (and especially your pores) looking vehemently healthy, as if you’re actually eating your vegetables. The one problem is that it is too moisturizing for humid climates and will leave a layer on your skin even when you just apply a little. I haven’t had issues with clogged pores, but I do prefer to have my skin be dry to the touch. I am looking forward to testing this out in the winter months, and despite this being one of the most expensive sunscreens on this list, I will be repurchasing.\n\nPipette’s Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50\n\n2/5 \n\nThis is a no-go for me. It’s too moisturizing for a mineral sunscreen in my opinion, which may get a lot of people who enjoy it for that reason. This sunscreen bugs me because it advertises to people of color and brags about having no white cast when it is literally an SPF 50 Zinc-only sunscreen. Don’t lie, man. And it is a lie - while this has one of the tamest white casts I’ve seen on a sunscreen of its prior description, it is still basically white paint. It also stings when I use it, which almost never happens with sunscreens for me. It’s literally made for babies. It’s an amazing body sunscreen, but considering how much I love this brand, I have a mini beef with this product. \n\nBiossance’s Squalane + Zinc Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 PA +++\n\n2.5/5\n\nThis is fine - very similar to the above with less of a white cast and less of a chance to burn my skin. It is almost the same formulation as they have the same parent company. It is just super overpriced and virtually the same as a much cheaper product. I invest in their parent company (Amyris) because they're doing some super cool work that has the potential to be huge in the future of skincare, so believe me when I tell you I don't like their sunscreens haha.\n\nZitsticka’s MEGASHADE Breakout-proof SPF 50 Serum\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis is a top tier sunscreen, and I am surprised I have never really seen it mentioned online. It has a stunning ingredient list (truly… amazing), and it’s one of the only hybrid American sunscreens I’ve seen. It’s also very widely available, but has small packaging at a hefty price tag. The smell is amazing as far as sunscreens go (again I love the smell of sunscreens), and it has a very white color that goes away pretty quickly. It is a liquid sunscreen that comes in a serum bottle with a dropper. Because of it being a liquid, I find it sometimes difficult to disperse as it doesn’t quite sink in, or rather have the sensation of sinking in like other, thicker sunscreens have. It stays true to its breakout-proof promise, but I find that it isn’t dry to the touch and will get progressively oilier throughout the day. It makes your pores look super healthy, and gives you a hydrated, dewy finish, though! \n\nSupergoop’s Every. Single. Face. Watery Lotion SPF 50\n\n1.5/5\n\nThis is one of the worst sunscreens I’ve tried because it is both very moisturizing \\*and\\* heavy on the alcohol. It dries you out \\*and\\* leaves you with a visibly oily finish. This could be the perfect sunscreen for someone, though, as it is a lovely consistency, smells pretty nice, and has absolutely no white cast. My skin just kind of hated it haha. \n\nEtude House - Soon Jung X Director's Moisture Sun Cream SPF50+ PA++++\n\n4/5\n\nI love this one, and got it at a really decent price on sale recently. It is thoroughly moisturizing, has an interesting creamy texture I don’t see often, and has no white cast. When it is on your skin and needs to be rubbed in, it’s already basically clear. Once on, it dries down and leaves no visible oiliness at all, seemingly right off the bat; while leaving my skin moisturized and hydrated throughout most of the day. I’ve noticed this has a tendency to dry out my skin as I get towards the end of the day, though, so I am giving it a 4/5 despite it checking almost every box.\n\nBlack Girl Sunscreen’s Make It Matte SPF 45\n\n4.75/5\n\nThis is a dupe of the Unseen Sunscreen with a more basic ingredient list. I see this as a good thing, though. This kind of sunscreen is popular for a very good reason - it is visibly mattifying while also pulling off the cool feat of being completely clear. It is very moisturizing, and I’ve never experienced any issues after wearing it throughout the day of getting more oily or more dry. I also find this kind of formulation to be the one of the best as it never dries out my skin or leaves it more oily - it is all pros and no cons as far as skin health goes. The only problem is that it tends to just sit there, so despite being matte *looking*, my skin is never dry to the touch. This used to have awful packaging that broke over anything, but they’ve fixed it and it’s still readily available at Target in the US.\n\nSupergoop’s Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40\n\n3.5/5\n\nThis is almost the same thing as the above but quite literally double the price. Same exact experience with both products tbh.\n\nBiore’s UV Kids Pure Milk Sunscreen SPF50 PA+++\n\n4.5/5\n\nI love this sunscreen, and consider it one of the best mineral sunscreens I’ve used. It obviously leaves a white cast, and this is an aspect I’ve made peace with. Ever since getting into skincare, my skin has been very white, anyway, so this has a strangely tone-evening effect for me. It tends to pill up on itself and will flake off throughout the day sometimes, but these are rare occasions - the cause of which I haven’t quite identified. It has a beautiful, milky texture, and makes your skin have this smooth and soft effect that I can’t quite describe. I find my skin always looks much better after using this and feels so effing smooth while I am taking it off with an oil cleanser. I consider it a treatment of sorts, to be honest. It has become such a staple for me since getting it that I can’t help but overlook some of its flaws.\n\nGlow Recipe’s Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50\n\n4.25/5\n\nThis is a great American sunscreen, and like the Zitsticka one, it is a hybrid sunscreen. This is far more noticeably here as you really do have to work it in to get rid of the cast, which makes sense since it has over quadruple the zinc oxide content. This truly does make you glow, though; and while I am not sure, it feels like there’s some kind of glittery material because it really does do the thing better than any other sunscreen on this list. I’d compare it to the Zitsticka sunscreen and the LRP one above in terms of glow as well as finish as this never becomes dry to the touch. This has fragrance in it, and to be honest it’s all the better for it. Combining the smell of sunscreen and watermelon was something I was so grateful to them for - they should sell it as a perfume.\n\nThe Ordinary’s UV Filters SPF 30 with Antioxidants:\n\n3.25/5\n\nThis is fine, and I honestly don’t have much to say about it in their direction. It has a heavy white cast, which….. while we all know to expect that out of mineral sunscreens, this has a worse one than any of the others on this list, and has at the same time the lowest SPF rating. It even has a tint to it, so it’s just weird how white it goes on. This is a bit too drying for me, but the glow it provides is very specific. Like it is completely dry on your face, but looks like a highlighter it provides so much glow. I was hoping that since the ingredient list is so heavy on antioxidants and amino acids that this would be a cool upgrade to my Biore “treatment” sunscreen, but it is definitely a downgrade overall. It is so cheap, though, and it’s really not a bad product at all. If you have a whiter skin tone and have oily skin, I’d try this one out.\n\nI mentioned that I like my skin to look aggressively hydrated and glowy while also being dry to the touch. I am high maintenance - whatever. I am going to rank the top 5 in how well they achieve this effect on my skin while having no other disqualifying flaws.\n\n1. 9wishes - Pine Treatment Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++\n2. Skin1004’s Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum\n3. iUNIK’s Centella Calming Daily Sunscreen\n4. Canmake’s Mermaid Gel UV Clear\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung X Director's Moisture Sun Cream\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and have a lovely day!",

You can find the new guide here: https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/**\n\nHey guys,\n\nI first wrote this a year ago. However, since then, I've wanted to add a bunch of stuff to clear up some confusion as well as explain further why this occurs in the first place. Hopefully this update does just that.\n\n---\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\n\nDehydrated skin is not a skin type as much as it is a condition of the skin. It doesn't discriminate between dry, oily, or combination skin and can be aggravated by topical skin care as much as lifestyle (binge drinking or smoking, for instance).\n\nIt's hard to describe dehydrated skin, since I feel it can present itself differently in many people. However, in my experience, **it usually has two or more of the following symptoms:**\n\n* Lackluster, dull\n* Sallow or \"tired,\" almost sickly looking\n* Has no real \"bounce\" or spring to it -- looks dry and wrinkly when pulled taut\n* Prone to congestion, particularly closed comedones\n* Burns and feels irritated when applying bland moisturizers\n* Feels very dry and tight when cleansed\n* Very oily in appearance, but feels bone dry in places and flakes very badly in spots\n\nHowever, before explaining methods to fix dehydrated skin, you need to first understand why skin becomes dehydrated.\n\n[RECOMMENDED VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_ihqNtYvmE)\n\nSkin has what is called a \"moisture barrier.\" This is the barrier of the skin that is responsible for keeping moisture in and bad bacteria out (keeping in mind that there's always a mix of yeast and p. acnes bacteria, [among others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_flora), present on the skin). However, this barrier can become stripped away, which makes skin lose moisture at a rapid rate, leading to the production of more sebum (oil) to \"compensate,\" as well as more bacteria to feed on the dead skin cells and sebum. As a result, skin becomes more sensitive, dry, oily, dull, and potentially broken out. It also will heal slower and respond more viciously to skin remodelers (actives such as AHA, BHA, BP, sulfur, and tretinoin).\n\nThe most common culprit of this is a stripping cleanser: *Your skin should never feel dry or tight after cleansing.* It should feel clean, bouncy, and comfortable. You shouldn't feel like your cheeks or forehead may crack if you make a face. \n\nOther offenders in the line-up to consider are actives, irritating ingredients such as essential oils and fragrance, clay masks, and [bad alcohols](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2ebpCvtrMU&amp;list=PL7QNgFLgKuaJNHEYFWWlt_9g9tF5KpG7C). \n\nWhen looking to solve dehydrated skin or a \"stripped\" moisture barrir, the first thing to consider, and the most obvious, is moisture content. Do you drink adequate amounts of water a day? This doesn't mean chugging water until you feel like a portable kiddie pool, but you should be drinking at least eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day.\n\nAnother facet of moisture is how much moisture is around your skin and what is on your skin to drink that moisture up (and hold it to the skin itself). For people in drier environments or simply those of us prone to dry or dehydrated skin, I highly recommend investing in a humidifier (warm or cold). I run mine virtually every night, and it makes a noticeable difference in how plump my skin remains throughout the day and night.\n\nYou also want to be paying attention to what kind of ingredients are holding moisture to your skin and how you are using them. I'm talking humectants here, such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and squalane.\n\n[Glycerin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol) is easily the most recognizable and common humectant. It can be applied straight (but is not recommended due to how sticky it is), though a couple drops can be added to your favourite moisturizer if you feel in need of a boost. It *is* fairly sticky though, so I wouldn't recommend adding more than two drops. On that note, I recommend against doing this during the day, since it can make skin more \"shiny\" and sticky. Glycerin is found in most skincare products and is widely available. It is also an acne trigger in a small number of people.\n\n[Hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) is a naturally derived ingredient that can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water. It is very light, thin, and usually is not sticky. It is most commonly found in serums, but is also becoming more widely used in creams and lotions. It is best applied to damp skin (not sopping wet, but not completely patted dry either) during your water-soluable phase. If you're using it as a serum, follow it with a rich moisturizer. If you live in a drier climate, I highly recommend using a humidifier when using HA rich ingredients. This will allow you to get the most out of it.\n\nSome people find hyaluronic acid drying. Your mileage may vary.\n\n[Squalane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squalene) is a compound that is usually derived from olives, but can still be derived from shark oil (the product will usually mention this if this is the case). People who have a sensitivity to olives or break out from topical use of olive oil should spot test products with squalane before using. \n\nYour success with the various humectants are very individual. Some people prefer hyaluronic acid for their extra moisture while others prefer glycerin. Whatever you choose, keeping extra moisture around will allow your humectants to work to the best of their ability.\n\nThe skin barrier typically needs 14-17 days to repair itself. I highly recommend using an occlusive in addition to your regular, humectant-rich moiturize. The *best* product for repairing the skin barrier is the occlusive Vaseline, though other ingredients can be helpful, such as niacinamide and ceramides.\n\nIt should also go without saying that in order to repair the moisture barrier and heal dehydrated skin types, *you must drop the products that are dehydrating you in the first place*. In the instance of a stripping cleanser, I highly recommend trying something from our Beginner's Routine. I also recommend against any actives and spot treatments during this time, if possible, which can irritate the skin further. However, in the case of something like tretinoin, which disrupts the moisture barrier, consider adding a rich, bland moisturizer to your routine (such as CeraVe Cream topped with Vaseline or Aquaphor) that can help the skin function through the difficult adjustment period. \n\nOnce skin has healed, you may re-introduce potential irritants (AHAs, BHAs, BP, etc) gradually and see how you react.\n\n---\n\n**BASIC PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n* **SERUM**    \n\n    · [Garden of Wisdom Hyaluronic Acid Serums](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/hyaluronic.html) are fabulously light-weight and effective. They are also very reasonably priced. You can purchase a sampler pack to try, which has enough product to last you 1-2 months, depending on usage. I suggest trying the cosmocil CQ blend of preservatives if your skin is sensitive.    \n    · [HadaLabo Lotion](http://www.amazon.com/Rohto-Hadalabo-Gokujyn-Hyaluronic-Lotion/dp/B000FQUGXA) is amazing. In fact, I'd rate it above the GoW HA serums -- it's deeply moisturizing, extremely simple (ingredient-wise), and inexpensive for the volume you receive.    \n· [Hydraluron Moisture Booster](http://www.boots.com/en/Hydraluron-Moisture-Booster-From-Indeed-Labs-the-people-who-brought-you-Nanoblur_1262210/) is available from Boots and may be a great choice for people who are not sensitive to algae ingredients and just want a basic, no-frills HA product they can buy from a brick-and-mortar store. I've never used it personally, but it does seem to get rave reviews from people who use it.    \n\n\n* **CREAMS AND LOTIONS**     \n\n    · [CeraVe](http://www.lovelyskin.com/products.asp?MID=119) products are fabulous if they work well for your skin. I'm sure readers of this subreddit get tired of hearing us talk about CeraVe, but they are reasonably priced, widely available, and contain great skincare ingredients, such as niacinimide, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides ([which may be beneficial for eczema in some people](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18306855)). It is recommended that you spot test CeraVe products if you are acne-prone.    \n    · [Solvere](http://www.lovelyskin.com/details.asp?PID=115991&amp;amp;MID=545&amp;amp;PG=1) is a regularly recommended, no-frills moisturizer for those who do well with squalane.        \n    · [La Roche-Posay Toleraine Fluid](http://www.dermstore.com/product_Toleriane+Facial+Fluid_677.htm) is a cosmetically elegant, light moisturizer. It applies very light and thin, yet moisturizes beautifully if you have oily or combination skin.    \n    · [Oilatum Natural Repair Face Cream](http://www.boots.com/en/Oilatum-Natural-Repair-Face-Cream_9627/) is a fabulous option for UK residents on a tight budget. It is a great little moisturizer that packs quite a punch for roughly £8.    \n\n---\n\n**OILY SKIN VERSUS DEHYDRATED SKIN**\n\nEver since I wrote my original guide on [dehydrated skin](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1akqed/dehydrated_skin_what_is_it_what_it_looks_like_and/), I've seen a lot of confusion over dehydrated versus oily skin types. Because of that, I'd like to clear the air on the subject so people aren't left wondering if their skin is simply oily.\n\nNot all skin that is oily is dehydrated. In fact, if you don't feel like any of the above symptoms apply, save for the oily portion, your skin may simply be oily. Many times I'll see people say they moisturize religiously, never use stripping cleansers, use oils or Vaseline, and still have oily (and thus dehydrated) skin. This is most likely not the case. In this instance, it is highly likely that the skin type of this individual is just oily. \n\nIf this sounds like you, don't ditch your moisturizer or non-stripping cleansers (oily skin types can STILL become stripped and dehydrated). Instead, try to use a light, gel-based moisturizer during the day to cope, as well as silica-based powders to set your makeup or sunscreen (powder applied to my SS makes it less shiny and greasy overall). I also highly recommend blotting sheets rather than piling on any more powders, which can gunk up the compact. Some people also have better luck when they use a silica-based makeup primer rather than a basic silicone primer.\n\n---\n\n**DRY SKIN VERSUS DEHYDRATED SKIN**\n\nIf your skin is dry and flaky, it does not automatically mean it is dehydrated. Keep in mind that dehydration usually presents with MULTIPLE symptoms, mainly oiliness, dryness, and severe (and unusual) sensitivity. \n\nIf you feel like your skin is dry, please [check out this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1sztsq/a_winter_survival_guide_some_general_tips_for_dry/) that I wrote on winter skin and dryness in general.\n\n---\nHopefully this post has been helpful and answers questions I see many of you posing every day. Please feel free to ask questions. I'll do my best to answer them (no promises though -- I'm super busy lately).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I've recently been more conscious of my skincare and have noticed that my cleanser makes my skin feel tight after use. \n\nMy point in posting though, is that I've been noticing something strange lately. This could have been happening for a long time, but again, I'm becoming more aware of my skin. So I go through my skincare routine and go to bed.

    "body": " Do you need to replace your beloved CeraVe moisturizer to veganize your routine? Is your skin so sensitive, it turns red just *thinking* about a new cleanser? Your moisture barrier is shot and you're dreading spring hayfever?\nI'm here to help, thanks to far too many hours spent shopping for products that my skin will tolerate.\nEvery product here is:\n\n* Vegan\n* Cruelty-free\n* Completely fragrance-free: no masking fragrances, \"natural\" fragrances, or essential oils\n* Free of irritating and sensitizing plant oils like lavender, thyme, citrus, and eucalyptus\n* Ragweed allergy safe: free of chamomile, feverfew, echinacea, calendula, and other ragweed flowers\n* Retinol-free\n\n**Warning for the highly ragweed sensitive:** Certain non-ragweed ingredients can cause cross-reactions in some people with ragweed allergies. These ingredients include sunflower oil, safflower oil, watermelon seed oil, and cucumber fruit extract. Also, bisabolol/levonemol is often derived from chamomile and could cause reactions. I noted the products that contain these ingredients.\n\n**Products may contain other allergens, such as soy and nuts. If you have any severe allergies, read all ingredient lists carefully! No product can be safe for every allergy!**\n\nThis list is US-centric; products from other regions are marked with their country of sale. The list is sorted alphabetically. (The price-per-ounce column was falling out of date too quickly with rapid price fluctuations; please see the [outdated 2024 version of the list](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganBeauty/comments/18wh8k1/bland_fragrancefree_nonirritating_moisturizer/) for the most recent version sorted by price.)\nFeedback and corrections are always welcome! Please let me know of any products I can add or anything on the list that has been discontinued.\n\n**Moisturizers without SPF**\n\n**Name** | **Packaging** | **Notes**\n:- | :- | :- | :-\nAcne.org moisturizer | pump | may cause discoloration on pale skin\nACURE Everyday Eczema Lotion | tube | contains safflower and sunflower oils\nACURE Seriously Soothing 24hr Moisture Lotion | tube | contains safflower and sunflower oils\nATTITUDE Extra Gentle Daily Moisturizing Natural Body Lotion | pump | \nATTITUDE Hand Cream Unscented | tube | contains sunflower seed wax\nBambo Nature Snuggle Time Body Lotion | tube |\nbioClarity Primed & Ready | pump | contains sunflower, safflower, and watermelon\nBiossance Squalane + Omega Repair Cream | jar |\nBiossance Squalane + Omega Repair Hand Cream | tube | \nBooda Organics Booda Butter Daily Moisturizer | jar | plain combination of oils/butters\nBulldog Skincare Sensitive Moisturizer | tube |\nBYOMA Barrier+ Treatment | bottle | \nBYOMA Moisturising Gel Cream | bottle | \nBYOMA Moisturising Rich Cream | bottle | \nCeramedx Restoring Body Lotion | pump | contains safflower and sunflower oil\nCeramedx Soothing Facial Lotion | pump | \nChagrin Valley Soap & Salve Butter Me Up Body Balm | jar | plain combination of oils/butters\nChagrin Valley Soap & Salve Shower Lotion Bar Cocoa Shea | bar | plain combination of oils/butters\nChagrin Valley Soap & Salve Whipped Cocoa Butter Body Cream | jar | plain combination of oils/butters\nCocokind Sake Body Lotion | pump | contains sunflower oil\nCOSRX Hyaluronic Acid Intensive Cream | jar | contains sunflower oil\nCOSRX Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Spa Mask | tube | contains sunflower oil\nDesert Essence Hand and Body Lotion, Fragrance Free | tube | contains sunflower oil\nDrunk Elephant Lala Retro Whipped Cream | pump | contains watermelon seed oil; parent company is not cruelty-free\nDrunk Elephant Sili Body Lotion | pump | contains sunflower oil, banana extract; parent company is not cruelty-free\nDrunk Elephant Sili Whipped Body Lotion | pump | contains sunflower oil; parent company is not cruelty-free\nDrunk Elephant Therabu Buttered Reparative Hand Cream | tube | parent company is not cruelty-free\ne.l.f.

    "body": "I thought I’d share my experiences trying to cut down on my skincare spend. I’ve been a long time heavy Mecca spender, I’m talking upwards of $4k a year across makeup and skincare. I’m someone who tracks their spending to the dollar - I enjoy a good budget spreadsheet, and noticed my skincare costs climbing faster than I was comfortable with. Mecca’s recent price rises were the kick in the guts I needed to seek alternatives. I joined this sub and saw a lot of people recommending brands I’d never even heard of, like The Ordinary and CeraVe, so thought I’d shakeup my routine to see if a change was possible. \n\n**My skin and routine before the change**\n\nI’d classify my skin as combination - I get very oily in the t-zone but some dry patches around the forehead especially in winter. My skin is generally clear and even toned, bar the occasional breakout (due to hormones I assume). I have some light redness on my cheeks that could be rosacea but it’s been there as long as I can remember and I’ve never bothered to treat it because it’s so mild. I have generally avoided any oil-based skincare in the past. \n\nMy routine was: \n\n* Cleanser - Tatcha Rice Cleanser\n* Toner - Mecca Max toner \n* Essence - Tatcha Essence (you could argue this was pointless but I liked the way it helped makeup sit on my face!)\n* Day serum - Mecca Max Hydrating Watercooler serum\n* Night serum - Drunk Elephant Glycolic Night Serum \n* Day cream - Tatcha Water Cream \n* Night Cream - Tatcha Indigo Overnight Repair \n* Eye Cream - Tatcha Silk Peony eye cream\n* Twice a week exfoliation - Tatcha Rice Polish \n* Every 3 days - Dr Dennis Gross extra strength daily peel \n\nAll in all this was costing me around $8 a day - or almost $3k a year! And the recent price rises would see that number climbing. \n\n**New routine**\n\nI decided to cut down on the products as much as possible. I bought the Ordinary cleanser, glycolic toner, niacinamide serum, eye serum, and moisturiser and started with that, using no other products.  Immediately I took a dislike to the Squalane Cleanser - truthfully it felt like it was doing nothing. My skin felt oily and not clean. I stuck with it for a week but really wanted my face to feel clean so I went back to Priceline and picked up the CeraVe foaming cleanser. This was much more my style. \n\nInitially my skin reacted a bit to something. It could just be because of the change, but I suspected the Niacinamide serum was the culprit. I noticed that as long as I let the glycolic toner dry and then applied the serum, it didn’t react at all. I grew to love these products but felt the serum didn’t sit that well under makeup, and on days i wear make up (usually office days) I need it to last 12+ hours so I sheepishly went back to the Mecca serum which I love. But it’s only $25 so I don’t mind. I’ve stuck with this combination of products now for almost three months…. \n\n**Results**\n\nWell consider me a convert. My overall skin texture and appearance has transformed. I have less breakouts. Remember me saying I was oily? Well that has improved dramatically. Don’t get me wrong, by the end of the day there’s generally still some build up, but it’s much less than before. The dry patches have also disappeared - although with the cooler weather approaching, that might get tested. The red cheeks haven’t changed much in appearance but they have less bumps than before. \n\nOverall I’m super happy I made the switch - not only has my skincare routine become simpler and saves time, my skin has improved dramatically, and I’m going to save something in the realm of $2700 A YEAR. Thanks to this sub for recommendations, you’re all life savers! \n\n**TLDR; Ditched my expensive and expansive Mecca  skincare products for The Ordinary and CeraVe based on this sub’s reviews. Skin is less oily and smoother, my skincare routine is much quicker, and I’ll save around $2.7k a year.**\n\nEdit: formatting and a word",

Everything else is TO, Cerave, and some KBeauty products that are all well under that.",

    "body": "The cancer council has released a new sunscreen called hydration boost. The concept seems similar to the popular Ultra Violette Supreme Screen. I've noted how they compared on a few different factors.\n\nTEXTURE\n- Ultra Violette (UV) supreme screen is thicker more creamy than the Cancer council (CC) hydration boost which seems more viscous / liquid. Both are easy to spread. \n\nFINISH \nUV is dewy and has much more shine. UV is marketed as a make up primer too and my skin tone looks more even with it on. It's not a BBcream if you are expecting coverage.\n CC is more of a satin finish and looks more natural. There is a sheen. \nI didn't have a white cast for either and they seem to dry down clear. Not sure on darker tones. \n\nSMELL \nUV has a stronger scent than the CC. \n\nACTIVE INGREDIENTS \nBoth are SPF50+.  both seem reef friendly. \nUV : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (10%), Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (3%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (2.5%)\n\nCC: Octocrylene 5% w/w, Octyl Salicylate 5% w/w, Ethylhexyl Triazone 4% w/w, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane 3% w/w, Bemotrizinol 2% w/w\n\nHYDRATION\nUV: With Squalane, Kakadu Plum, Pentavitin\nCC : squalene, hylauronic acid, Polyfructol plus \n\nI have dry to normal skin and the UV doesn't make my skin feel tight at the end of the day however it doesn't feel noticeable after a couple of hours. CC seems to feel like a light film over the face which keeps the moisture intact. At the end of the day my face seems more supple than it started off with. \n\n\nCOST/VALUE\nCost is similar. \nUV : $52 RRP for 75ml or $0.69cents per ml. UV do a special sale once a year around sep - Oct  50% off. \nCC : $34 for 50 ml (price at Coles, chemist warehouse seems to be stating $36.95?) or $0.68 cents. Sales range from 30-50%. \n\nRecommendations from both companies suggest 1 face application is 5ml / a teaspoon. Both are pricey sunscreens considering with the recommended application CC would last 10 applications and UV 15 times. \n\nREPURCHASE?\nI'm an avid user of UV because I like the way it looks on my skin. I use it as a light skin tint. \nCC - it's a nice texture for a sunscreen and lives up to the claim of being hydrating however at the same price of UV I won't be repurchasing. \n\nSunscreen background in case anyone has questions on comparisons between other sunscreens - I have used the following:\n- pink CC a while back (broke me out) so I dont have much info I can remember on it. \n- enjoyed Hamilton everyday and their sensitive sunscreen. \n- use biore and anessa but not any other Asian sunscreens. \n- Mecca \n- La roche posay \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Wanted to share my experience with a looot of products I’ve tried over the last 12 months to try and get my skincare in line!\n\nHere’s the TLDR on my skin journey; had acne, moderate, but EVERYWHERE, since puberty. Got really bad. Found a skincare group. Through education and trying things out my skin is the best it’s ever been. Ever.  (I’m 27F for reference)\n\nSkin: oily, was dehydrated, semi-sensitive, very acne prone, some acne scarring, and folks I am a PICKER. Acne was closed comedones, whiteheads and blackheads galore. Potentially a little smidge of fungal acne. Problem spots were jaw, above my lip, cheek bones, neck and my shoulders. \n\nIt’s taken a lot of learning about skincare routines, reading peoples posts/comments, reading simpleskincarescience, watching youtubers like Beauty Within/Caroline Hiron/James Welsh/etc and experimenting/having patience but I’ve got my skin in the best condition it’s ever been!\n\nMy shoulders, which haven’t been free of a pimple in 5 years minimum, are totally cleared up. My face is glowing, I listen to it, I’ve deducted my picking by 95% (if I’d stop staring in the mirror so much I could stop completely lol), and my acne is basically completely gone! I have little tiny breakouts, and occasional whiteheads. But they are so small, insignificant and they definitely aren’t nearly as inflamed as the past has been! And I walk around without concealer or foundation on!\n\nREVIEWS! (With prices!)\n*anything with a price point and a size means it’s sold in a variety of sizes \n\n- e.l.f. Bounce Back Jelly cleanser ($6 USD)\nThis is a really simple, gentle cleanser. I used this in the mornings after I worked out because I didn’t need anything crazy or strong, just something to get off the dirt and sweat. Obviously the price point is clutch. I think it’d be a great cleanser so people who don’t have many acne issues, or the acne issues are minimal. Especially for college students and teenagers who aren’t looking to pour money into a skincare routine but want to get into the habit/routine. \nRating - 3.5/5\nWill I repurchase? No\n\n- Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser ($9 USD)\nThis is my holy grail. The price point is unbeatable. It’s so gentle, yet effective. I’ve used it both as a stand alone cleanser and as a second cleanse. Makes your skin feel clean without being stripped. Easily accessible (it’s in drugstores and it’s on amazon). Great for sensitive skin and fungal acne. Also gets eye makeup off really well without irritating the eyes. Lathers, but not overly. \nRating - 5/5\nWill I repurchase? Yessss!\n\n- Fresh Soy Face cleanser ($15 USD/50ml)\nI got a trail of this with a Sephora order and I was really excited about it. However I used it twice and both times my skin burned upon application and I almost immediately had to wash it off. It was my first time using a soy product, so that’s the only thing I can think of that bothered my skin. \nRating - 1/5\nWill I repurchase? No\n\n- Murad Essential-C Cleanser ($39 USD)\nThis was a great beginner cleanser for me. It was my second try in the Murad line (which I do enjoy their products but they are a little pricey). This has the little gel roller balls in it. Very gentle on the skin but didn’t really do much in improving my skin. \nRating - 3/5\nWill I repurchase? No\n\n- First Aid Beauty Face Cleanser ($21 USD)\nThe biggest thing I wasn’t a fan of with this cleanser was the smell. Smelled kind of like playdough (which I’ve always hated the smell of). The texture is that like a lotion, doesn’t really leather but definitely gets you clean and a little goes a long way. Did leave my skin feeling a LITTLE tight afterwards. I used this for a couple weeks and found myself having more small whiteheads and small breakouts then normal. Switched to another cleanser and my breakouts disappeared. \nRating - 2/5\nWill I repurchase? Nope\n\n- Drunk Elephant Beste Jelly Cleanser ($32 USD)\nSo I was really surprised by this. I got a free trial size of this and the protini for my birthday gift through Sephora. I wasn’t sure I even wanted to try it with all the very unimpressive customer service garbage they’ve been doing. But I’m doing a no buy until all my goodies are used up so I went to try it... crap guys I loved it. Great texture (way better than elf imo) and really lathers. No scent. Didn’t feel dry and tight afterwards. \nRating - 5/5\nWill I repurchase? Maybe. I have issues with their public relations/customer service and feedback. \n\n- Farmacy Green Clean Cleansing Balm ($34 USD/90ml)\nThis was my first cleansing balm. Really enjoyed the smell (smells “fresh”) and how long the jar lasted me. Great at melting off makeup and sunscreen. Definitely recommend using a washcloth and not just trying to rinse it off - the oil gets pretty runny if you’re trying to just rinse it off. \nRating - 4/5\nWill I repurchase? Yes\n\n- Caudalie Micellar Water ($28 USD)\nThis was my first stab at double cleansing. I don’t know why I went for a more expensive micellar water but here we are. Overall my skin loved it. Took off concealer/SPF/foundation but didn’t dry out my skin. However I wear mascara fairly often and this was TERRIBLE for getting eye makeup off. \nRating - 3/5\nWill I repurchase? No\n\n- Paula’s Choice Enriched Calming Toner ($21 USD)\nLiving in the desert I decided to go with a hydrating toner. This one was milky, love the texture. Makes my skin feel plump and hydrated after application. Only downside was I bought it from amazon and the bottom of the bottle was warped and I didn’t notice the first time I went to use it - when I set it down it fell over and spilled half out. Other than that no issues!\nRating - 4/5\nWill I repurchase? Yes\n\n- e.l.f. Keep Your Balance Hydrating Toner ($8 USD)\nHydrating? Nope not here. Disappointed in this, honestly. Was super excited BUT alcohol debate is high up on their ingredients list. I tried it out for a few days anyways and could definitely feel how tight my skin got afterwards. Really bummed. \nRating - 2/5\nWill I repurchase? No\n\n- Sephora Eye Brightening Cream ($16 USD)\nHoly luxurious Batman. This is a holy grail for sure. I didn’t even know I would enjoy an eye cream! I really loved a trial size of their All Day Hydrator so I ordered that and honestly tacked this on to the purchase because I thought “why not?” This feels so creamy and delicate on your skin, soaks in beautifully, and the results seem instant. \nRating - 5/5\nWill I repurchase? Yes!\n\n- LilyAna Naturals Eye Cream ($20 USD)\nSo I accidentally ordered this right before I bought the Sephora eye cream and didn’t realize it. So I decided to use both. I enjoy this eye cream but it’s definitely thicker, takes more time to soak in. So I use this one at night, on most nights. It’s hard to tell which has had the better results, but I think both eye creams have done wonders for the bags under my eyes! \nRating - 4/5\nWill I repurchase? No, simply because the Sephora is my favorite and I don’t need two. \n\n- Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence ($18 USD) \nI have nothing but good things to say about this essence. Definitely added an additional layer of moisture that my skin has really needed. I loved the way it felt on my skin and how long the bottle lasted. The price point is clutch for being able to use it 2x a day for about 6 months. Only downside was besides adding moisture I’m not sure it really did much for my skin. \nRating - 4/5\nWill I repurchase? Maybe. \n\n- The Ordinary Niacinimide 10% + Zinc 1% ($5.90 USD)\nThis didn’t do anything for me which was really disappointing. My shoulders had great success with zinc so I had high hopes for this. Didn’t irritate my skin but I saw no difference between days I used it and days I didn’t. \nRating - 3/5\nWill I repurchase? Nope\n\n- Sephora All Day Hydrator ($16 USD)\nLike it’s sister (the eye cream) this felt surprisingly luxurious on my face. LOVE for a day time moisturizer. Soaks in quickly. Makes my skin feel very silky. Doesn’t overdo it. Only downside? Fragrance.... \nRating - 4/5\nWill I repurchase? Absolutely \n\n- CosRX Honey Ceramide Cream ($20 USD)\nThis surprised me as well. This was my first CosRX product and man have I loved it. The jar is small so that was a little disappointing but a little goes a long way. This is my nighttime moisturizer and it’s my favorite by far. It feels halfway between a gel and a cream.\nRating - 4/5\nWill I repurchase? Yes\n\n- CeraVe Moisturizing Cream in the tub ($15 USD/19oz)\nThis was my first night time moisturizer. Personally this works really well for my skin. Biggest downside is that it feels a lot thicker than I want, but honestly it’s really doable. Great for folks with sensitive skin. Loved it especially for the cost. \nRating - 3/5\nWill I repurchase? Probably not\n\n- The Ordinary Rosehip Oil ($9.80 USD)\nThis oil is my jam. I throw this on all by itself or on top of my moisturizer at night. I live in the desert currently and this has been a delight to have in my routine. Nothing but good things to say. Wouldn’t recommend it as a part of your day routine though, doesn’t soak up quickly. \nRating - 4/5\nWill I repurchase? Yes\n\n- Biossance Squalane + Tea Tree Balancing Oil ($49 USD)\nMy skin HATED this. I got a trial size from Sephora. I read lots of great things about squalane and I’ve used products that have tea tree oil in them before... tried it three separate times and I broke out all three times. This was a total no-go for me. \ndisappeared. \nRating - 1/5\nWill I repurchase? Nope\n\n- Murad Multi Vitamin Infusion Oil ($73 USD)\nThis was the first ever oil I tried as I was breaking out into the skincare world. I had a trial size and slapped it on just to try and I almost instantly saw results. This helped a lot with my healing acne spots. It’s lightweight enough to use it during the day time (I often do) and it soaks in quickly. It is fragranced. It is expensive. BUT! I did thoroughly enjoy it. The bottle does last quite a while. \nRating - 4/5\nWill I repurchase? Maybe if it was $20 less\n\n- Drunk Elephant Marula Oil ($72 USD/30ml)\nGot this as a part of the night bright kit with Sephora. Tended to sit on top of my face for quite a while. Definitely felt thicker than rosehip which I just didn’t enjoy. Didn’t seem to break me out but didn’t seem to do anything for my skin. \nRating - 2/5\nWill I repurchase? Nope\n\n- LilyAna Naturals Retinol Cream ($20 USD)\nMy first Retinol of any type. I’ve really loved it. I saw some minor improvements basically overnight. Very non-irritating. I’d say a great start for folks wanting to dive into retinol but want to start light and inexpensive. Very thick cream, goes on easily, lasts a while. \nRating - 4/5\nWill I repurchase? Very likely\n\n- Drunk Elephant T.L.C. Framboos Glycolic Resurfacing Night Serum ($90 USD)\nI hate the price point so much. Again the customer service really makes me not want to purchase from the brand. I do enjoy this Serum. It hasn’t performed any miracles but it doesn’t irritate my skin. It does do some good overnight. I only use it once a week. \nRating - 3/5\nWill I repurchase? Probably not. So many AHA/BHAs on the market for way less with same results. \n\n- The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA ($6.80 USD)\nI found this to be perfectly effective and simultaneously gentle. Great price point. I’ve got nothing bad to say about it to be honest!\nRating - 4/5\nWill I repurchase? Probably\n\n- Glow Recipe Watermelon + AHA Glow Sleeping Mask ($22 USD/30ml)\nTried this on a whim and LOVED it. Skins always wakes up glowing. So soft. So gentle on my skin. If you can handle the fragrance then I highly suggest trying it. Probably my favorite AHA product to try.\nRating - 5/5\nWill I repurchase? Yes\n\n- Origins Retexturing Mask ($13 USD/30ml)\nDid nothing good, did nothing bad. The texture freaked me out at first (wasn’t prepared for it to have that texture). This is my “I want to relax and zone out” mask because it doesn’t nothing for me but I don’t have to change up my routine to use it. \nRating - 3/5\nWill I repurchase? Nope\n\n- e.l.f. Moisturizing Sleeping Mask ($12 USD)\nI broke out in small hives and/or fungal acne the second time I used it. It was a bummer because I loved the way it felt on my face. Again I think this is a good product for a younger person with little acne issues and needing to establish a routine. \nRating - 2/5\nWill I repurchase? Nope\n\n- Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish SPF ($10 USD)\nHands down favorite SPF. Dries with a matte finish. Tiny bottle but lasts quite a long time. Had done an excellent job in protecting my face from getting sunburnt this summer! I’ve had no issues with pore clogging. \nRating - 5/5\nWill I repurchase? Absolutely\n \n- DermaZinc Z Bar ($18 USD for a pack of 3 bars)\nThis was my back/shoulders lifesaver. I tried a bunch of stuff. BP and SA were doing nothing (I tried both body wash and wipes/creams) and I was near the points of tears. I tried the Head and Shoulders as body wash trick, and this just dried my skin out. Thennn I tried this... it still took a month but this is the clearest my body acne has been since I was 16! This is my holy grail for my body acne. \nRating - 5/5\nWill I repurchase? Always\n\n\n\nI typed this all on my phone so forgive me... hope it helps!",

Wet your face and inevitably drip water down your arm, onto the floor, your shirt if your still wearing one (rookie mistake).\n\n2. Put cleanser on face while awkwardly hunched over the sink with your eyes closed cause your dripping water and now also soap\n\n3. Rinse face, try not to get soap in your eyes, and get even more water all over your self and your bathroom.\n\n4. Dry your face and possibly your sink if you're up for it since despite your best efforts you've splashed water everywhere\n\n5. Continue your life, now slightly damp and very frustrated. \n\nThe biggest reason the above method sucks is that the worst step IS THE FIRST STEP! And as we all know, getting started is the hardest part of a boring task, so it's super easy to dread the whole thing and weasle my way out of washing my face.\n\nFuck that shit. Never again.\n\nI got the Squalane Cleanser from The Ordinary last week and it has changed my life and I will never look back.IT COMPLETELY ELIMINATES STEP 1 AND 2! \n\nMy new amazing life is as follows:\n\n1. Put cleanser on my dry face (product starts as a cream texture and warms up to an oil)\n\n2. Massage it in, and because my face isn't wet i dont have to be hunched over my tiny sink and I can see what I am doing. \n\n3. Rinse it off and done! \n\nSo only one rinse, and its the last step! Plus, since it goes on your dry face, it's really easy to just slap some oil on your face and oop, now you might as well rub it around since you gotta rinse it off anyway. \n\nAlso the small size is only $8! \n\nIt's so much better that I actually look forward to washing my face now :O I use a few of their little serums after the cleanser cause my nose is a blackhead factory and it's really a testament to how easy to use they're products are cause I NEVER thought I'd have a \"skin care routine\" lol. \n\nTLDR: Squalane Cleanser from The Ordinary eliminates the step of wetting your face before you wash it, thus making it easier to begin the boring task. I have been able to keep the habit up for over a week, longest of my life. Genuinly and highly recommend if you struggle with washing your face for similar reasons.",

You can work the foam into your dampened skin and again use the rag to rinse it off.\n\nI’m a Skinfluencer and still struggle with wanting to do a whole skincare routine, but little hacks help.

    "body": "So, this is a bit scary for me to post. I'm a mod here and I've been a lurker on the MakeupAlley skin boards for years now, but my skin has always been a pretty sensitive issue for me. After all, with all the knowledge I have, my skin should be the epitome of perfection. Well, [it used to be](http://i.imgur.com/odM4hmx.jpg)...\n\nSee, my skin was very kind to me in my teens, relative to most people's experiences. I had a lot of issues with clogging on my forehead (as I see very frequently here) but that began to clear up in my adult years. \n\nRegardless, like many women, I was on a quest for magazine-style perfection, and in early 2011, when I visited a dermatologist for a biopsy, she prescribed me Veltin (tretinoin and clindamycin, similar to Ziana) for my mild acne.\n\nIt was the most expensive prescription I have ever purchased, literally and figuratively. Unfortunately, I wasn't given any real instructions, so I slathered it all over my face.\n\nWhat followed was a miserable year of the worst breakouts I've ever had. My previously unblemished skin turned on me, and the harder I tried, the worse it became. I remember having spots that were so large they practically merged, like some mouth sores do when they're close to one another. They'd linger for weeks, and when I'd extract them, what came out wasn't a normal colour (sorry -- gross, I know). In short, my skin had become grossly irritated. As if that wasn't bad enough, my skin would just peel off like a snake shedding its skin. I'd slather my face in CeraVe cream, running to the bathroom the next day only to see more spots ontop of old spots. \n\nI began crying myself to sleep and avoiding mirrors. My appearance had become a huge, festering wound in my life. I no longer felt \"pretty.\" I slathered on sunscreens, creams, oils and other potions, hoping that the \"purging\" period that everyone assured me I was going through would finally come to an end.\n\nBut it never did. I broke out like this for the entirety of 2011. I don't have any pictures of this period, but it was much, much worse than any of the worst pictures in my album. \n\nBy Oct-Nov of 2011, my mom, sick of seeing me moping about and engulfed by my acne, made an appointment for me at her trusted dermatologist. He took me off of the Veltin immediately and prescribed a round of antibiotics (Solodyn) as well as clindamycin.\n\nThings got better. I stopped hating my skin so much. It became less of a CONSTANT fixation in my mind. Those with bad skin know that you begin looking at everyone around you and wondering, \"Why can't my skin just be beautiful? Are they looking at me? Do I have another zit coming up? Can they see it? Oh god, oh god...\" Finally, I began thinking less like that and things began returning to normal.\n\n...And then I came off of the antibiotics.\n\nAt first, it was fine. For months, I'd just get the occasional spot, but nothing tremendous.  Then it began to snowball, and I'd get a couple spots here, and then more there.\n\nI began to get experimental. I tried AHA, BHA, and creams people swore by. Unfortunately, I am possibly the least consistent person with skincare since I am surrounded by so much of it on a daily basis due to this sub. I'm like a squirrel looking for the best acorn in a pile of promise -- they all look so good, which do I pick!? *HNNNGH!* BUT I WANT TO TRY THEM ALL! \n\nYou can already see where this is going: straight to hell in a handbasket.\n\nMy skin started to hate me again. I saw my mom's dermatologist once more in May-June of this year, and was prescribed another round of antibiotics. I took a month's worth before realizing how miserable they made me -- constipated, mostly -- and asked to be taken off of them.\n\nI remember being really upset again around this time. As those who recognize me here know, I am very, *very* sensitive to many common ingredients, such as (but not limited to) cetearyl, cetyl, and stearyl alcohol; jojoba, almond, coconut, argan, olive, and macadamia oil; algae extracts; squalane/squalene (humectant); and a good number of essential oils. This means that a majority of creams, oils, serums, cleansers, sunscreens, and even \"acne-friendly\" creams are out. \n\nI felt completely out of options. Hopelessness set in. I remember feeling so angry and depressed about how I could help others with their acne, but even with all that I knew, *I couldn't fix my own skin.*\n\nWell, to make this long story a bit shorter, I began testing out previously sworn-off ingredients and products once again. I decided that I had over-reacted with so much being swapped in and out of my routine constantly. My mom kept assuring me that I knew SO much at this point that I couldn't look at anything objectively anymore and just panicked at the slightest thing (you were right, mom).\n\nSo I began taking pictures to track my progress with ingredients and products. This is how I started to finally figure out what was actually helping or hindering my skin. I also stopped trying to apply my vast amounts of knowledge to my skin problems all at once and instead began to tackle things one at a time and in a VERY SIMPLE way: track progress in photos, cleanse, use BHA or AHA, let things be, moisturize, stop fretting so much.\n\n[Things have gotten better. Much better, actually.](http://imgur.com/a/2sbih)\n\nI'm trying not to get my hopes up (I've had a LOT of false positives), but I could cry with happiness when I see my skin these days. I don't wake up to 3-4 more spots anymore, just progress. \n\nSince I know you're probably curious, here's my current routine:\n\n**AM**\n\n* Cleanse with water and a washcloth/flannel\n* Pat on Vit C Serum ([NuFountain 10%](http://nufountain-fresh-cosmetics.amazonwebstore.com/Made-Fresh-NuFountain-C10-10-Vitamin/M/B002VLSBF2.htm))\n* Pat on moisturizer if feeling a bit dry ([Elta MD PM](http://eltamd.com/product/pm-therapy-facial-moisturizer/)). I only use a pea-sized amount.\n* Apply sunscreen if going out for longer than 15m ([Skinceuticals Physical Fusion](http://www.skinceuticals.com/_us/_en/category/physical-fusion-uv-defense-spf-50.htm))\n\n**PM**\n\n* Remove makeup/sunscreen with whatever I have on hand (Clinique TTDOB, baby oil, Albolene). Remove/wipe away excess.\n* Cleanse with Cetaphil Daily Cleanser (contains SLS but it is honest-to-god the ONLY thing I've found that works, and I keep coming back to it when other cleansers fail me)\n* Pat on vit C serum, let it dry while I get changed for bed\n* Apply [Paula's Choice 2% BHA LIQUID](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/aha-and-bha-exfoliants/_/Skin-Perfecting-Two-Percent-BHA-Liquid-Exfoliant/) (the one that feels a bit heavy and filmy -- this stuff is my HG) with a cotton square\n* Play [League of Legends](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/) past my bed time\n* Pat on Elta MD PM\n* Pat on Vaseline to any dry spots\n* Zzzz...\n\nI'm also taking 50mg of Zinc, which while I know is anecdotal for many, I do feel that it helps with my skin.**\n\nWhile my response isn't common -- I've yet to find anyone who had such a bad, long-term reaction from tretinoin -- please let my story be a cautionary tale for anyone who seeks perfection in any form. If I had learned to love my skin the way it was, or to try gentler methods first (such as the BHA we recommend so frequently here), I may never have gone through any of this. \n\n**tl;dr -- Wanted unobtainable perfection, paid a heavy emotional price, learned to appreciate my skin (with all of it's flaws) again.**\n\n[ALBUM LINK AGAIN IF YOU MISSED IT EARLIER](http://imgur.com/a/2sbih)\n\n**Please note that high doses of zinc messes with your copper levels and you shouldn't take it if you are taking anything that depletes copper OR if you don't get enough copper in your diet as is. Note that dietary changes and effects resulting from them are nearly exclusively anecdotal, which is why we try to refrain from giving any advice like that in this sub. \n\nEdit: Tried to clean up my crappy grammar a bit. \n\nThank you for all the love, guys. I know that my acne isn't as bad as some, but with limited treatment options, I felt incredibly hopeless for a really, really long time. If you're struggling with acne, regardless of how mild, *please don't give up.* There's hope out there, even if you're as wildly sensitive as me.\n\nEdit 2: Added valuable links.\n\nEdit 3: I am the Queen of Edits. For the curious, [here's a list of some of the products I tried in my quest to fix my skin](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1op52m/nearly_3_years_and_over_2000_worth_of_skincare/ccu8xj7).\n\nEdit 4: Holy nutsacks, someone gave me gold. You just made my evening, whoever you are. Thank you. ",

Low confidence in own product line or what?\n\n2) the moisturiser doesn't have ceramides but the suncare product claims to have ceramides in the description.\n\n3) However, *there are no ceramides in the ingredient list* for the suncare product\n\n4) an oil based suncare product- one wonders who is the target audience for this product. Definitely doesn't seem to be folks in the tropical, hot 82E country\n\n5) selling suncare product in serum form with dropper and 30ml quantity should be just criminal. It basically gives out the message that this product is to be used like a serum, like 2-3 drops will suffice. \n\n6) and the spf 40, pa +++ rating is nothing special either. Not even worth a look when brands are creating the most amazing textures and formulations in the suncare space\n\n7) regarding the moisturiser- formulation looks fine with ingredients like squalane and niacinamide. But I think youth to the people branded Ashwagandha better as an adaptogen in their adaptogen cream. Purely basis branding also, one would feel YTTP Ashwagandha is better value for money than this one. \n\n8) I don't know where this brand is sitting. It isn't as science as indewild as science meets Ayurveda or forest essentials or kama, which actually look and feel ayurvedic. \n\nThere is no Deepika factor to this brand, no personal skin care story. There is no evidence Deepika participated in the product creation. Just hopping on a bandwagon to create a brand. What a golden opportunity completely wasted",

    "body": "I know that there has been lots of discussion about whether people will continue to purchase Deciem products in light of recent events. That being said, there are still a lot of us using the products (particularly TO) either because we have just recieved them, or because of their affordability. I've seen so many posts asking for advice on how to use them, and people having problems that i thought it might be helpful to have a thread that is dedicated to this where people can share their tips? Sorry if this has been done elsewhere, but I have been unable to find anything similar through the search! I see so many people giving up when some simple tweaks could potentially save a lot of grief/wasted product. There is also a wealth of information that people have gleaned through Deciem customer service, blogs and articles that could be really helpful.\n\n\nMy top ten tips (with the caveat, as always, that YMMV):\n\n\n1. TO serum or liquid-type products work much better when mixed together, or with your moisturiser.  If you find your buffet/HA/SA/niacinimide etc 'froths up' or pills when you layer it, try this first before giving up! They are designed to be used together, but due to the formulations, don't always play well when layered.\n\n\n2. The 23% Vit C and HA is really gritty. However, you can mix it with a little HA serum in the palm of your hand before application which will rehydrate the HA granules nicely, and allow it to absorb more easily.\n\n\n3. You can mix the revestrol and ferulic acid with the Vit C serums/lotions to increase the effectiveness. Extra brownie points if you can add a drop of Vit E oil too!\n\n\n4. For some skin types, TO oil-containing products can sit on top of your skin leaving it greasy. For example the rosehip oil, or actives in squalane. Again - try mixing with your moisturiser to improve absorption. \n\n\n5. For dry skinned foundation wearers, a drop of TO oil in your foundation works wonders for ensuring you aren't left with a flaky/powdery finish during the day.\n\n\n6. Anything with sillicone in MUST be used as the final step in your routine. The sillicones act as an occlusive, so if you try to put more products on top, it will pill like crazy. The exception to this rule is during the day when you're wearing sunscreen. You need to make sure your sillicone product is absolutely dry, and wash your hands before applying your sunscreen. The sillicones stick to your palms and may cause your sunscreen to pill!\n\n\n7. Deciem recommend that no more that 3 serums are used together, and that your skin can't absorb more than this. I'm not a skincare scientist, so I can't speak for the validity of this claim. However, the more products you use at the same time (particularly actives), the more likely you are to experience irritation - especially if you are new to them. \n\n\n8. The NMF is a fab moisturiser, but is unlikely to be enough for dryer skin. You might want to mix in a few drops of oil, and ensure that you have added hydrating layers beneath. You might need to layer a thicker moisturiser over the top if your skin can handle it.\n\n\n9. The TO glycolic toner is fab - but pressing a soaked cotton pad gently over your skin in the asian beauty fashion can help reduce some of the initial redness that can be caused by the friction of 'sweeping' the pad over your skin.\n\n\n10. I'm sure it doesn't need to be mentioned on this sub, but just incase for any noobs - TO products can be great and affordable and it's tempting to pile in (guilty!) But it's imperative to patch test and introduce things slowly to avoid upsetting your skin.\n\n\n\nAnybody else have any tips they'd be willing to share?\n\nEdit: tip 6 assumes a chemical sunscreen is used. Physical sunscreens will need to go on first.",

I've only experienced frothing once or twice when I used too much and never experienced pulling. For convenience sake I would be interested in mixing. So I'm understanding, you mean just putting a few drops of one serum in with a few drops of another and putting it on your face at the same time right?\n\nAlso, any suggestions for the azelaic acid?

By itself isn't enough to spread on my face, even after layering multiple steps of toner, so I mix it in with my light moisturizer (Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n10) Patch testing is great, but make sure that you go slowly when doing chemical exfoliants as a beginner. I'm super sensitive so when I started using the AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution I did the patch test on my forearm, just a few drops, for 10 minutes. I didn't have any reaction but I still waited til the following day before I used it on my face. I started with 3 drops for 5 minutes then washed off. Next time I stretched the 3 drops to 10 minutes. The following time after I increased the drops by another 3 then went back to the 5 minute time. The most recent time I did a full dropper for 10 minutes and my skin was really angry after, it didn't feel bad while it was on, but I couldn't touch my face later that evening because it just hurt.",

For example, I recall that many users complain about the Caffeine Serum piling. Try to use just one small drop for both eyes - I've aways done it this way and I never had a piling issue, whereas the TO HA would always, always pill, no matter the quantity.

        "body": "*Routine at bottom* I’ve gotten some messages so I’ve made this writeup very detailed and lengthy. \n\nThis post is about my research and ~3 week progress with squalane treatment: first image was before (not true baseline image, I was treating with exfoliation + jojoba oil), middle was overnight results on first application, last is after 3 weeks. Special shoutout to u/rafinthecloud who posted their success with squalane and inspired me to try it 👏❤️\n\nResults: 95% reduction in bumps. 100% reduction in flushing (overnight!). Reduced affected area. Not perfect in eradicating every last active spot, but the constellations are shrinking way faster than they are being added to. \n\nWhat’s left: My remaining spots are post  inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) KP “freckles” that will probably fade in 6 months to a year. More on treating that in Routine section. Im comparing this to the usual duration of my acne PIH. If I get impatient I know peels or a laser would speed fading dramatically. The key is having no NEW KP return - and squalane is doing that to a satisfactory level. \n\n****Research**** \n\nTo begin, I went digging to find this paper. Look at the purple colored images to see what kind of KP best matches yours: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/272100262_Sebaceous_Gland_Hair_Shaft_and_Epidermal_Barrier_Abnormalities_in_Keratosis_Pilaris_with_and_without_Filaggrin_Deficiency\n\n“…Although a widely recognized hypothesis of KP pathogenesis suggests that the papules are caused by excessive accumulation of keratin debris within the follicular ori‭ﬁ‬ces‭,‬ it is uncertain if this is a primary or a secondary feature. Interestingly, we found a striking absence of sebaceous glands in all KP lesions. This absence of sebaceous\nglands was previously described by Giovannini in 1902 but fell into oblivion until our present study.”\n\nThey cite a reason KP is often on the back of arms and legs is bc those areas are naturally dryer/prone to less sebum production. This is why moisture with exfoliation works for a lot of people’s KP. \n\nNon-lesion KP may not respond like mine has to squalane, because there are still sebum glands present in those photos. I feel like I have BOTH kinds though. It was just as good for redness as bumps. \n\nSqualane: a synthetic oil serum pretty much chemically identical to what human bodies produce (squalene). \n\nMy KP level: Moderate/Severe on my arms, Mild on my legs. \n\nMy KP battle history: Jojoba oil has been okay - it 100% clears KP on my legs, maybe 50% on my arms. I’ve used it for years. I was missing out on squalene though- it’s even more lightweight and quick absorbing. I mean, damn. Over my lifetime I’ve sampled whole drugstore shelves. Creams, toners, balms, tret, micro dermabrasion and chemical peels/exfoliators did not work. It seemed to be just the sun and ocean that cleared it temporarily. Note that I’ve had the small bumps all my life including childhood but it only got red after my teens - my family has it too only not as bad as me.\n\nHypothesis/speculation: In my case, squalane seems to penetrate deeper than most moisturizers/oils past the hair shaft. The microscopic images in that paper show you how the hair follicle of KP sufferers is kinda weird. Squalane seems to have rebalanced the keratin buildup so I get no bumps. Most moisturizers would just sit on top of that “underneath” mess - with lotion my bumps stayed and absorbed the moisture, becoming more clogged and unpleasant feeling. That made me gravitate to jojoba, being the lightest oil I could find before I found squalane. \n\nConclusion: If your KP is No Sebum Glands Edition, there probably isn’t a cure for this (unless they can …grow back?) but squalane has been an effective sebum substitution for my skin, and might be for others. \n\n**********Routine**********\n\nGeneral info about my skin: I’m mid 30s, mostly dry skin, mild rosacea, mild cystic breakouts on face (hormonal) and back. Despite dryness I can tolerate potent active ingredients and acids like I’ve evolved to live in some ideal environment of humid, caustic swamp conditions. Some of this routine (*) is for managing breakouts and not KP specifically. \n\n1.) 100% Plant-Derived Squalane by The Ordinary. ~6 drops per arm, AM/PM. I think it’s critical to apply this product first for the reasons in my speculation. \n\n2.) Manual exfoliation with sisal washcloth each bath/shower, which I typically do at night. Put squalane on after towel drying. \n\n3.) Occasionally used Paula’s Choice BHA serum in the AM instead, then put squalane on before bed if I skipped a shower to sub for manual exfoliation. \n\nFor hyperpigmentation: will try adding the PC serum every AM, alternating days with The Ordinary Zinc & Niacinamide Serum now that I don’t have active KP and just PIH spots - this is the fastest way I have topically treated my acne PIH. These two products used back to back in 24hrs can be too much for many peoples’ skin but for me they work like tretinoin/retinol without the peeling. \n\n4.) My arms don’t get sun yet. But I use Elta MD UV Clear on my face and upper body. This also contains niacinamide which fades my PIH, so I may not need the extra products in #3 when I start wearing sunscreen. Sun exposure with or without sunscreen has always minimized my KP too.\n\n(*)Dead Sea Salt bath 2x week, 1-2 cups of the generic tub by Whole Foods.\n\n(*)Cerave bar soap - clay based soap can be drying but this was a nice balance of reducing oil yet not harsh. \n\nI’m not going to post about diet and whatever bc that has made no difference in my lifelong KP, only in my acne and rosacea. If you also have these I can elaborate in the comments. I have hereditary chronic gut issues (also lurk those subs) that are causing my skin hell in addition to hormones. \n\nThanks to THIS sub, my KP condition is well on its way to 100% managed 😁 The relief I feel after a 30+ year long battle is beyond words!!!",

    "body": "Hey y’all,\n\nI am going to review as many sunscreens as I can based on the many I have tried over the years. This is going to be a long one, but it is because I want to be specific and give as many relevant details as possible. I have normal skin I’d say with combo tendencies - I live in a climate that has super dry winters and really humid summers, so I change my routine a lot over the year. I also used to work a job that gave me a bunch of rewards to use online from contest winnings, and I used them all to explore Asian Beauty lol. Shoutout to r/AsianBeauty btw!\n\nMy AM routine is as follows:\n\n1. Toner pad (been using Rael Beauty’s pads with Peach Slice’s BHA, Jumiso’s PHA, and Cerave’s Hydrating Toner)\n2. One Thing’s 10% Niacinamide Toner\n3. Peach Slice’s Snail Rescue Blemish Busting Toner with added glycerin\n4. The Ordinary’s NMF + Beta Glucan\n5. iUNIK’s Centella Calming Daily Sunscreen\n\nMy PM routine:\n\n1. ma:nyo’s Pure Cleansing Oil\n2. Allies of Skin Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser\n3. Cerave’s Hydrating Toner\n4. ma:nyo’s Bifida Complex Ampoule with added niacinamide\n5. Illiyoon’s Ceramide ATO Soothing Gel \n6. The Ordinary’s NMF + Phytoceramides\n\nI am going to rate each on a scale of 1-5, and will discuss what I liked or disliked. I tend to like sunscreens that dry down to a hydrated yet dry-to-the-touch finish, don’t become more oily or provoke dryness throughout the day, don’t leave a white cast, don’t have fragrance or alcohol, and don’t clog pores. I am going to vaguely say something has an impressive ingredient list a few times, so I will briefly list some ingredients I look for:\n\n1. Preference on hybrid sunscreens\n2. B vitamins, primarily panthenol and niacinamide\n3. Ceramides\n4. Antioxidant- or generally nutrient-heavy, non-fragrant extracts like centella asiatica, broccoli, pine, etc.\n5. Antioxidants like vitamins C and E; ferulic acid, etc.\n6. Peptides\n7. Silicones are my arch nemesis, but they are so commonly used in sunscreens that I don't get too upset\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF50+ PA++++\n\n4.25/5\n\nThis is a hard one for me, because it is truly one of my go-to’s in the winter time and I have a weird affinity for it. It is surprisingly emollient to the point where I was glowing all day even in the driest of winters. This is only dry to the touch in super dry weather; but it leaves you with such a hydrated and healthy glow that I can’t complain about it. This, at the same time, is a tricky one to recommend for dry climates because of its HA contents. For some, hyaluronic acid is a loss-heavy hydrator if not sealed in, and since this is the last step, it’s difficult to recommend it. I personally love it, though! It has such an amazing smell (I love sunscreen smell don’t @ me) and I just love its texture. Its ingredient list is a genuine humble brag, as well.\n\nSkin1004’s Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum SPF50 PA++++\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis, to me, is like an upgrade of the Isntree sunscreen. It is surprisingly similar to me in terms of ingredients and texture, but it dries down rather immediately. It keeps my skin very moisturized and hydrated, leaving a nice hydrated finish that doesn’t get oilier throughout the day. I worry this will dry me out in the winter, but in the currently very humid summer I have been going to this one more and more often.\n\nCanmake’s Mermaid Gel UV SPF50+ PA++++ Clear\n\n4.25/10\n\nThis is a classic for a reason, and it was my first AB sunscreen that I tried. It has no white cast, has a neat little smell, and it is surprisingly moisturizing for a sunscreen that dries down to a dewy yet try to the touch finish. This will always be a go-to, but I don’t like wearing it in the winter because it will dry out my skin and lead to some oily redness on my forehead. Perfect for the summer, as well as any day that it’s not oppressively dry. It has an amazing ingredient list, as well. My main issue is that it pills very easily - more so than any other sunscreen I’ve used. It’s just weird to me that it’s made by a makeup company and they couldn’t nail that part down haha.\n\n[iUNIK’s Centella Soothing Sun Cream](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/woly4y/iuniks_new_centella_calming_daily_sunscreen_review/)\n\n9wishes - Pine Treatment Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++\n\n5/5\n\nThis is remarkably similar to Canmake’ sunscreen for me. I find that it has a very similar texture, but instead of the yellow tinted color, it’s a bit green. It ends up being a bit whiter as you rub it in, as well. This is a genuinely impressive ingredient list as far as extracts go, with pine of course being at the forefront. I love how antioxidant heavy it is, but I also think it dries down to this lovely, glassy finish. I prefer it over Canmake’s because of its more specialized ingredient list and lack of anecdotal pilling. The finish is just so silky smooth and healthy - I am a huge fan of this one.\n\nLa Roche Posay’s Anthelios UV Correct SPF 70\n\n4/5\n\nI love this sunscreen, and if it weren’t so emollient it would be a 5/5. This is literally an SPF 70, but goes onto the face as if it were clear. I would say that apart from invisible sunscreens, this has the most immediately clear cast I’ve ever seen. It’s very thick, and smells violently of La Roche Posay sunscreen - that is to say amazing. It leaves your skin (and especially your pores) looking vehemently healthy, as if you’re actually eating your vegetables. The one problem is that it is too moisturizing for humid climates and will leave a layer on your skin even when you just apply a little. I haven’t had issues with clogged pores, but I do prefer to have my skin be dry to the touch. This also will make my face a bit dry and itchy as the day goes on, so I deducted a bit for that.\n\nPipette’s Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50\n\n2/5\n\nThis is a no-go for me. It’s too moisturizing for a mineral sunscreen in my opinion, which may get a lot of people who enjoy it for that reason. This sunscreen bugs me because it advertises to people of color and brags about having no white cast when it is literally an SPF 50 Zinc-only sunscreen. Don’t lie, man. And it is a lie - while this has one of the tamest white casts I’ve seen on a sunscreen of its prior description, it is still basically white paint. It also stings when I use it, which almost never happens with sunscreens for me. It’s literally made for babies. It’s an amazing body sunscreen, but considering how much I love this brand, I have a mini beef with this product.\n\nBiossance’s Squalane + Zinc Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 PA +++\n\n2.5/5\n\nThis is fine - very similar to the above with less of a white cast and less of a chance to burn my skin. It is almost the same formulation as they have the same parent company. It is just super overpriced and virtually the same as a much cheaper product.\n\nZitsticka’s MEGASHADE Breakout-proof SPF 50 Serum\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis is a top tier sunscreen, and I am surprised I have never really seen it mentioned online. It has a stunning ingredient list (truly… amazing), and it’s one of the only hybrid American sunscreens I’ve seen. It’s also very widely available, but has small packaging at a hefty price tag. The smell is amazing as far as sunscreens go (again I love the smell of sunscreens), and it has a very white color that goes away pretty quickly. It is a liquid sunscreen that comes in a serum bottle with a dropper. Because of it being a liquid, I find it sometimes difficult to disperse as it doesn’t quite sink in, or rather have the sensation of sinking in like other, thicker sunscreens have. It stays true to its breakout-proof promise, but I find that it isn’t dry to the touch and will get progressively oilier throughout the day. It makes your pores look super healthy, and gives you a hydrated, dewy finish, though!\n\nEtude House - Soon Jung X Director's Moisture Sun Cream SPF50+ PA++++\n\n4.25/5\n\nI love this one, and got it at a really decent price on sale recently. It is thoroughly moisturizing, has an interesting creamy texture I don’t see often, and has no white cast. When it is on your skin and needs to be rubbed in, it’s already basically clear. Once on, it dries down and leaves no visible oiliness at all, seemingly right off the bat; while leaving my skin moisturized and hydrated throughout most of the day. I’ve noticed this has a tendency to dry out my skin as I get towards the end of the day, though, so I am giving it a 4.25/5 despite it checking almost every box.\n\nBlack Girl Sunscreen’s Make It Matte SPF 45\n\n4.25/5\n\nThis is a dupe of the Unseen Sunscreen with a more basic ingredient list. I see this as a good thing, though. This kind of sunscreen is popular for a very good reason - it is visibly mattifying while also pulling off the cool feat of being completely clear. It is very moisturizing, and I’ve never experienced any issues after wearing it throughout the day of getting more oily or more dry. I also find this kind of formulation to be the one of the best as it never dries out my skin or leaves it more oily - it is all pros and no cons as far as skin health goes. The only problem is that it tends to just sit there, so despite being matte looking, my skin is never dry to the touch. This used to have awful packaging that broke over anything, but they’ve fixed it and it’s still readily available at Target in the US.\n\nSupergoop’s Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40\n\n3.5/5\n\nThis is almost the same thing as the above but quite literally double the price with unnecessary added ingredients. Same exact experience with both products tbh.\n\nBiore’s UV Kids Pure Milk Sunscreen SPF50 PA+++\n\n4.5/5\n\nI love this sunscreen, and consider it one of the best mineral sunscreens I’ve used. It obviously leaves a white cast, and this is an aspect I’ve made peace with. Ever since getting into skincare, my skin has been very white, anyway, so this has a strangely tone-evening effect for me. It tends to pill up on itself and will flake off throughout the day sometimes, but these are rare occasions - the cause of which I haven’t quite identified. It has a beautiful, milky texture, and makes your skin have this smooth and soft effect that I can’t quite describe. I find my skin always looks much better after using this and feels so effing smooth while I am taking it off with an oil cleanser. I consider it a treatment of sorts, to be honest. It has become such a staple for me since getting it that I can’t help but overlook some of its flaws.\n\nGlow Recipe’s Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50\n\n4.25/5\n\nThis is a great American sunscreen, and like the Zitsticka one, it is a hybrid sunscreen. This is far more noticeably here as you really do have to work it in to get rid of the cast, which makes sense since it has over quadruple the zinc oxide content. This truly does make you glow, though; and while I am not sure, it feels like there’s some kind of glittery material because it really does do the thing better than any other sunscreen on this list. I’d compare it to the Zitsticka sunscreen and the LRP one above in terms of glow as well as finish as this never becomes dry to the touch. This has fragrance in it, and to be honest it’s all the better for it. Combining the smell of sunscreen and watermelon was something I was so grateful to them for - they should sell it as a perfume.\n\nThe Ordinary’s UV Filters SPF 30 with Antioxidants:\n\n3.25/5\n\nThis is fine, and I honestly don’t have much to say about it in their direction. It has a heavy white cast, which….. while we all know to expect that out of mineral sunscreens, this has a worse one than any of the others on this list, and has at the same time the lowest SPF rating. It even has a tint to it, so it’s just weird how white it goes on. This is a bit too drying for me, but the glow it provides is very specific. Like it is completely dry on your face, but looks like a highlighter it provides so much glow. I was hoping that since the ingredient list is so heavy on antioxidants and amino acids that this would be a cool upgrade to my Biore “treatment” sunscreen, but it is definitely a downgrade overall. It is so cheap, though, and it’s really not a bad product at all. If you have a whiter skin tone and have oily skin, I’d try this one out.\n\nBeauty of Joseon:\n\n3.25/5\n\nI am a decently big fan of this brand, but I have had hang ups on every product I have tried. It is usually the packaging, but this product has beautiful and easy-to-use packaging that makes sense. This sunscreen reminds me of Etude’s Director Moisture Sunscreen in the way that it spreads - it’s like using a moisturizer. It has no visible white pigment and has a gorgeous, silky texture. It smells heavily like sunscreen in a way that I can’t appreciate, and I am a massive appreciator of the typical sunscreen smell. The ingredient list has a lovely buffet of probiotic extracts and a really impressive 30% rice extract - I feel like it’s super rare to see sunscreens with concentrations that high of anything. My issue with this sunscreen was the breakout of closed comedones I would get every time I used it, but I truly think this is a person to person thing, and I completely understand why this is everyone’s holy grail. In addition to the texture, spreadability, and lack of white pigment; this also dries down really well with a natural, but not quite matte finish. If you don’t react to this, this would be a go-to for so many. I have given thought to it being the fermented ingredients in this that ended up giving me the breakout, but I am not typically sensitive to these ingredients anymore. It also contains a silicone (caprylyl methicone), but it’s low enough on the ingredient list that I’m not sure that would be the concern either. Either way, I hesitantly recommend this one, but it didn’t work for me. :)\n\nPurito’s Daily Go-to Sunscreen \n\n4.25/5\n\nThis is a sunscreen that I would never wear to anything important because of how dewy its finish is, but I do wear it on days where my skin is super dry. I find this one keeps my skin hydrated better and longer than any other sunscreen with no closed comedones or itchiness. The ingredient list is super basic with centella and all of its derivatives being the highlights of the list, and I think the simplicity of it is one of the reasons it’s so effective at hydrating and soothing the skin. It does take a bit of rubbing in to fully disperse the pigment, but it doesn’t end up leaving a white cast on my (admittedly very white) skin. It has a faint smell that I can’t really describe - it’s very similar to the iUNIK sunscreen in that they clearly tried to go for the scentless product that ends up smelling like raw ingredients. I’m not too sure if I will end up repurchasing this because Isntree’s HA SPF 50 sunscreen has a similar but better effect on my skin, but I would recommend it to someone with dry skin who has sensitivity to hyaluronic acid over that.\n\nThe Inkey List's Polyglutamic Acid Dewy Sunscreen SPF 30\n\n1/5\n\nThis brand, man. They continue to use packaging that is not only bad to look at, but also super difficult to use. Once you get halfway through any product you've bought from them in a tube, I wish you luck. It's genuinely baffling that they still manufacture these exact same tubes. The product itself such a misfire, as well - it is facial desert in a bottle, doesn't hydrate, and is difficult to work into the skin. When your product instantly dries on contact but is also difficult to work into the skin, you get a lot of rubbing. The pigment that is so difficult to spread doesn't even appear to be from the sunscreen agent, either - it is streaky like an emulsion gone wrong. I've never had a sunscreen have so many struggles, to be honest. How did they get to Sephora? Why did I buy this? On the day it came out? Keep me in your prayers. \n\nI mentioned that I like my skin to look aggressively hydrated and glowy while also being dry to the touch. I am high maintenance - whatever. I am going to rank the top 5 in how well they achieve this effect on my skin while having no other disqualifying flaws.\n\n1. 9wishes - Pine Treatment Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++\n2. Skin1004’s Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum\n3. Etude House - Soon Jung X Director's Moisture Sun Cream\n4. Canmake’s Mermaid Gel UV Clear\n5. iUNIK’s Centella Calming Daily Sunscreen\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and have a lovely day!",

Mildly broke out but then my skin rebalanced in better condition with less burning, redness, and itching. This one took some bravery because I though I would crash and burn without BP. \n\nConstants- 100% vitamin E oil and\nbaby zinc sunscreen DAILY or used as a spot treatment to soothe irritation. \n\nTL;DR: Even if you think something is working for you, don’t be afraid to try something new or gentler.

Not that I have an issue helping people, it's just wild to me I'm still getting messages about this eons later.\n\n**\"What helped your angular chelitis/did you fix your angular chelitis\"?** I sort of fixed it. Angular chelitis happens because the skin at the corners of your mouth is getting aggravated regularly and it happens to be a pretty sensitive part of your face. Your best bet to solve the problem is to figure out if anything you're semi-regularly putting in your mouth is pissing it off, for me it was my toothpaste. For some reason Sensodyne/\"sensitive teeth\" formulations of toothpaste seem to trigger it for me, I don't know exactly which ingredient because the moment I made an effort to avoid it even the most basic Crest/Colgate toothpaste was fine for me. I only had this idea because another friend of mine found out the SLS in a lot of toothpastes exacerbated his mouth ulcers, so it's possible in your case it's that.\n\n**\"What did I do to treat my angular chelitis\"?** Normal skincare stuff. For me squalane oil helped a lot to at least make it *feel* better, if not make it look better. Otherwise I just do my normal skincare routine and stuff that helps the rest of my face tends to make the angular chelitis less aggravated. This is basically just CosRX Snail Mucin, Cerave cream, and squalane oil. I really don't think you're gonna magically fix your angular chelitis with special skincare unless you figure out what exactly is aggravating it; it's kinda like trying to treat a wound with lotion. If it's especially bad I used some corticosteroid cream to appease the inflammation, but you probably shouldn't do that on a regular basis. \n\nAnyways that's all, idk if my one post about it on reddit is at the top of google or something but I just wanted to post this so it's visible on my profile and stuff so people can just have the info without having to dm me. Interact or whatever, or don't, idk it wasn't exactly a viral post the first time around so idk how people are finding me, but hopefully you can find this too. \n\nsorry if i sound mad im in a bad mood this has nothing to do with u ur great ilu go off king/queen/nonbinary monarch of the ages",

In this post, I will try to explain how to build a routine. In my last post, I shared [three rules to skincare](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/i0whz2/skincare_series_three_rules_to_skincare/) that I have learned over the years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, let’s understand how to build a basic skincare routine.\n\nMost of us have heard the golden sentence. “Cleanse, Exfoliate, and Moisturize.” It is true. Perhaps it could be - ***Cleanse, Exfoliate, Treat, Moisturize, and Sun Protect.*** I will talk mostly about building a skincare routine for the face but similar norms apply to the body. This post will discuss cleansing only.\n\nThe skin on the face is much thinner than the skin on the body. It is also a lot more reactive than the skin on your body. The face is almost always exposed to the environment, making it important to keep it clean.\n\n***Water as a cleanser*** \\-  Water is an exceptional solvent and attracts all the hydrophilic dirt particles. However, water alone may not be enough to break down fats, oils, and other hydrophobic substances. Some people cleanse with just water in the morning and that is alright and can cut your cleansing cost into half. Though, if you apply a facial oil/heavy cream at night I suggest you use a cleanser in the morning as well.\n\n***Micellar Waters*** \\-  This is a suspension in water of complex molecules, called micelles, which have a hydrophilic exterior (water-loving) and a hydrophobic interior (fat-loving, surfactants) structured in a way that they may be less irritating than regular cleansers. Micellar waters are also more effective than regular oil-based makeup removers as the micellar suspension is more homogeneous. But not all micellar waters are created the same. The ones with milder surfactants, skin-friendly PH, fewer irritants tend to be better than other micellar cleansers. After cleansing with Micellar water it is still a good idea to give a good rinse with regular water.\n\n*Some good micellar waters: Bioderma Sensible, Simple Kind to Skin Micellar water.*\n\n***Regular Cleansers*** *-* As discussed earlier, water alone may not be enough to clean your skin. All cleaners are formulated using surfactants that have a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and a hydrophobic (oil-loving) tail. So the tail attaches itself to the oil/dirt on the surface of the skin and when we splash water the head attaches itself to water and rinses away, leaving the skin clean.\n\nThe problem is most traditional surfactants can be harsh on the skin and even when we wash with water, some surfactants penetrate the skin. This can cause your epidermal barrier to disrupt and degenerate the skin barrier, cause irritation & itching, and lead to transepidermal water loss. Another issue is the PH of the cleansers. High PH cleansers can tamper the skin’s natural PH (around 5.5 - slightly acidic), which can cause a plethora of things but most importantly make your skin environment suitable for acne-causing bacteria to grow.\n\n***TL;DR: Surfactants in cleansers can penetrate inside our epidermis and disrupt our skin barrier and high PH cleansers can cause bacterial growth and skin irritation.***\n\nBut all surfactants are not alike and some are milder than others. Also, a bunch of mild surfactants can be used in the cleanser to form larger micelles, and thus their penetration might be reduced. A lot goes into a cleanser other than surfactants as well which can help reduce irritation caused by surfactants.\n\n[For basic understanding - How to choose a cleanser](https://preview.redd.it/skv3qvavd3e51.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=da199b005e1ac925192c9795d89da6ecaae48363)\n\n[How to use a cleanser?](https://preview.redd.it/pun6ay4u13e51.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=52bbdab86975eefd1c770cec8701a3e6d47a77ca)\n\nSome popular gentle cleansers:  [Glossier Milky Jelly](https://www.glossier.com/products/milky-jelly-cleanser), [The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-squalane-cleanser-50ml?_ga=`-1695965092.1595185067), [Hada Labo Goku-jyun Foaming Cleanser](https://incidecoder.com/products/hada-labo-goku-jyun-foaming-face-wash), [Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser](https://www.neutrogena.com/skin/ultra-gentle-hydrating-cleanser/6887296.html)\n\nGentle cleansers available in India: [Cleanse me](https://www.amazon.in/CleanseMe-Cleansing-Enriched-Allantoin-Colloidal/dp/B07VX3R5VF/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=cleanse+me&qid=1595921478&sr=8-1), [Innisfree Blueberry Cleanser](https://www.nykaa.com/innisfree-blueberry-5-5-cleanser/p/566012?ptype=product&productId=566012&skuId=566012&categoryId=8380), [Neutrogena Extra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser](https://www.amazon.in/Neutrogena-Extra-Gentle-Cleanser-200ml/dp/B000052ZB2?ref_=ast_sto_dp)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Oil cleansing/ Double cleansing*** \\- Our sebaceous glands present inside our pores produce a complex lipid called sebum which is insoluble in water. Sebum plays an important role in regulating skin moisturization and health. However, excessive sebum can clog pores, aid bacterial growth, enlarge pores, and make your skin oily. Excessive sebum can be caused by many factors including hormonal changes, climatic changes, skin irritation, dehydration, etc.\n\nOil cleansing is a technique of massaging an oil/a blend of oils on your face before using a regular cleanser to clean your face. This technique is referred to as double-cleansing. It has three important roles namely:\n\n1. Draw out excessive sebum from your pores. It helps in ***reducing sebaceous filaments***, and clogged pores.\n2. ***Break down the makeup, oil, dirt, and SUNSCREEN*** attached to the skin’s surface.\n3. ***Reducing irritation*** caused by surfactants in the second cleanser.\n\n*Oil cleansing is not just for dry skin though. All skin types can benefit from oil cleansing.* Choosing the right oil/oil blend for your skin type can be crucial to dictate the realization of this technique. Unlike cleansing oils, you can just use 100% cold-pressed oils for oil cleansing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Reasons why some oils work for some but not for others. The right can help you achieve your skin goals.](https://preview.redd.it/fcth7z4343e51.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=e54a1b2e4fab20c339ce1b1669dd48b220cd58e7)\n\n[Linoleic: Oleic ratio is important in choosing the right oil.](https://preview.redd.it/o8r7gmua53e51.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cbf80731860217066159e721eacdc60f6503ff0)\n\n[High Linoleic Oils for Oily\\/Combination](https://preview.redd.it/ik7eu8qh53e51.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=59a8f3c01135687c07842e62a6c0724f7b7b409f)\n\n[High Oleic Oils for Dry Skin](https://preview.redd.it/lxs67i4n53e51.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=427b96a9019d0af7b2e5cd24c65e504f54237908)\n\n**Cleansing Oils/Balms** \\- This is a mix of Steps 1 & 2 of double cleansing in a single product. It is an oil/oil blend with emulsifiers and surfactants. You massage it like in oil cleansing. The hydrophobic tails attach to the dirt & sebum on your face. Once you massage the oil thoroughly then you add some water to your face and continue massaging and rinsing. At this point, the cleansing oil emulsifies (turns milky & slightly foamy) and the water molecules attach themselves to the hydrophilic end and rinse off the gunk. This is for the lazy people out there. However, sometimes cleansing oils can leave a film and some people may not prefer it to oil cleansing. You can proceed with a double cleanse still but it is not necessary.\n\nCleansing oils are just starting to get popular in India. Shower oils work the same way and if cleansing oils are not your preferred method for the face, they can help cleanse your body. It can really help lazy people like me hit two bullets at a time. :P\n\nReinstating, the oils and emulsifiers in the mix in the formulation do matter and decide the performance of the cleansing oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could not find good cleansing oils/balms in India. If you have any recommendations please let us know.\n\nHere are some cleansing shower oils available: L'Occitane Almond Shower Oil, Sebamed Shower Oil, Innisfree Camellia Nourishing Shower Oil\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[How to perform double cleansing?](https://preview.redd.it/dzve9ch9e3e51.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa78664b2b572aa723dcb5bf3f59366968a2d4bf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n`Tip:` Use Ingredient sites like [COSDNA](https://www.cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php), [Incide-Coder](https://incidecoder.com/) & [Skin Carisma](https://www.skincarisma.com/ingredient-analyzer) to get a quick analysis of the ingredients. Develop a habit of reading the ingredient lists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***I hope I was able to cover all basics about cleansing.

I know this technique is pretty old but it was new to me & after the mind blowing results I saw I knew I needed to share for other newbies like me that haven’t seen it yet!!\n\nthis was based off the 50 shades of snail routine! I’ll share my exact process & products (these were just what I had on hand but all you need is salicylic or bha, a clay mask, & an oil cleanser of any kind)! my before & after photo was taken on the same day exactly one hour apart. right before doing the routine & immediately after\n\n1. to a clean, dry face I applied The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% mask to the my entire nose area. let sit for 15 mins before washing off with a gentle cleanser\n\n2. lightly dried my nose & applied Innisfree Pore Clearing Clay Mask to my nose. let sit for 15 mins before washing off with water\n\n3. lightly dried my nose & began oil cleansing with DHC Deep Cleansing Oil for a couple minutes. emulsified with water & rinsed. then wash with gentle cleanser to ensure no oil residue left.\n\nmy after photo was taken immediately after finishing this step. then I applied my morning routine products as usual (hydrating toners & very lightweight moisturizer) which felt important to me because I did have a slightly tight & dry feeling on my nose & I didn’t want my skin to overproduce oils trying to compensate for that. I’m also planning on adding Hero hydrocolloid nose patches to my routine, I’ll update on if those help too\n\nI have NEVER been able to achieve results like this at home! EVER! I will happily do this deep cleaning routine once a week for the rest of my life because wow does it deliver for results! it is now the next day & they have yet to refill!\n\n2 things that help me maintain throughout the week- double cleansing every night with oil based cleanser & when I apply my squalane oil at the end of my night routine I put it everywhere but my nose. I have noticed a cleaner looking nose when I wake up \n\nso happy to have found this! I’m going to stay consistent for another month or two & I’ll be sure to post any updates! so appreciative of everyone here sharing knowledge 🤍 I hope this can help someone else!",

    "body": "This new video called [Why Product Hopping Will Ruin Your Skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orP2YYqusDc) from Dr. Bunting is the tough love I needed to hear. It tears down a lot of concerning trends I have noticed in across internet skincare culture in recent years, many of which I've engaged in that have damaged my skin. Here's a summary.\n\n* People love newness. It's a bad habit. You need to look at your bathroom shelf and decide whether or not you have been pushing your skin too hard.\n* What is \"barrier function?\" The stratum corneum is the top layer of epidermis. It normally forms a tight waterproof barrier. It includes a film on top called the acid mantle which maintains a pH of 5.5 and allows a protective microbiome of healthy bacteria to thrive while inhibiting pathogenic bacterial growth. THIS is what healthy skin should be. When the acid mantle barrier is disrupted, the stratum corneum becomes cracked like a pair of leather shoes that were left out in the sun. Skincare products that are harmless on healthy, intact skin can now penetrate into deep layers where they aren't supposed to go, and this stimulates an inflammatory cascade which makes the skin behave in a sensitive way. It creates stinging, burning, breakouts, dry patches, etc.\n* *If you get cleansing wrong, it's hard to get skincare right.* Her patients with elaborate cleaning rituals tend to have skin problems. Oops. Foamy alkaline cleansers are bad. You want low-foam, low-pH cleansers that don't disrupt the barrier.\n* Have a good reason for using each of your leave-on actives. *No one needs a 10-skep routine**.* Too many people are using several actives in rotation and it wrecks their barrier. Introduce one active at a time and maintain a stable routine for several months to assess its long term effects. No product hopping. This is hard for those of us who get excited about ordering skincare hauls.\n* People always ask her how to combine their retinoids and AHAs. Many of these people already have sensitive skin, and some of them are playing fast and loose by rotating between multiple retinoids and multiple chemical exfoliants. She says to *stop the chemical exfoliants completely* and use the retinoid alone for a minimum of 3 months. Then make a careful decision about whether or not you still need an AHA.\n* Hydration: choose moisturizer with care. *S**imple formulas with fewer ingredients work best*. Look for products with aloe vera, bisabolol, and allantoin, which reduce the tendency of the skin to be fiery and irritable. Fragrance is bad.\n* Consider mineral-only sunscreen with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide\n* Basically if your skin is having problems don't add steps to your routine to fix it. Remove products from your routine instead. Keep it simple.\n\n***What are your thoughts?***\n\nI get so sad when I see people here or in FB skincare groups who had perfect skin until they spent $150 to try a \"proper\" skincare routine and wound up panicked because their skin got flaky and red and they developed terrible acne.\n\nWhen I first started reading this sub in 2015, I didn't see quite as many people struggling with sensitive, inflamed skin. There were lots of multi-step asian routines in here but the popular ones were pretty gentle. Most people used the official [ScA routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) which is in line with most dermatologist recommendations. Using that routine saved my skin! The ScA mods are awesome and they still nudge people toward this solid advice. But the skincare world keeps expanding, serums have become more affordable, and the list of miraculous must-have ingredients has grown.\n\nIt's tempting to use every single \"magic active\" and viral product even though we have a full routine at home. IMO, product hopping happens because people feel like they are supposed to use micellar water *and* cleansing oil *and* a  foaming cleanser *and* vitamin c *and* a niacinamide *and* azelaic acid *and* an AHA toner *and* a BHA toner *and* an AHA/BHA peel *and* glycolic acid *and* lactic acid *and* tranexamic acid *and* hyaluronic acid *and* caffeine *and* co-Q10 *and* rosehip oil *and* peptides *and* squalane *and* alpha arbutin *and* bakuchiol *and* differin/tretinoin *and* benzoyl peroxide *and* an occlusive ointment *and* an eye cream *and* 3 different sunscreens for various occasions. People with acne rub oil into their skin so hard that they pull out grits (to the dismay of most dermatologists) but then they wonder why they are breaking out, so they use harsher actives to fix it. When we ruin our acid mantle with products and our faces become red and dry and sensitive, we buy things like Great Barrier Relief to fix it so we can go back to our arsenal of actives.\n\nI am totally guilty of this. When I watched this video I closed all of my skincare shopping tabs. No dermatologist has ever suggested that I use as many products as I do. I own multiple serums from the ordinary that I haven't even tried yet bc it has taken so long to figure out which other products from my haul my skin can tolerate.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? I already knew most of the facts that she explained, but she put it all together in a way that knocked some sense into me.",

Most people do not need niacinamide, then alpha Arbutin, then ascorbic acid, then tranexmic acid, then azelaic acid, then salicylic acid, then glycolic acid, then granactive retinoid. And then rosehip oil and squalane oil. I get it though. I randomly picked up Azelaic acid even though I’m happy with my routine because my mind was like “ooh maybe this will make my skin THAT much better.” When in reality I have nowhere to put it in my routine if I don’t want to use two actives in one routine and if I don’t want to have 3 days a week where I’m not doing anything except hydration and moisturizer.",

    "body": "I used to be the kind of person who tried a ton of new skincare stuff because it was fun or smelled nice or came in pretty packaging until I realized that was causing the majority of my acne. So for the past several years I haven't really tried much new in my routine because my skin is sensitive and fairly reactive. I don't enjoy running around with acne or the feeling of covering itchy/irritated skin with foundation. With the stay-at-home order, I had the benefits of trying a lot of new stuff since no one was going to see my face besides my family and my zoom buddies. So that's what I did, and I love reading reviews, so I figured it was a good time to write some.\n\nI tried all the products separately from one another. If a product irritated my skin or caused a break out I gave myself a week for my skin to calm down before trying a new product. I have tried to list the prices from places that I know are common across the states (sorry out of the US, I'm not sure what stores you guys have) like Walmart, Target, Ulta, Sephora etc. I will be rating out of 5 stars.\n\nI tend to prefer cheaper, drugstore options to more expensive ones, but I can sometimes justify it for things with pretty packaging or that make me feel fancy.\n\n**Skin info**: 28F, very pale/easily sunburn, dry, sensitive/reactive skin, prone to hormonal acne and clogged pores\n\n**Skin concerns**: aging, hydration, whiteheads, papules/pustules, a fair amount of PIH and PIE\n\n**Fair warning:** My vendetta against fragrance is righteous and unrestrained. I don't mind so much if products have ingredients that are there solely for the purpose of fragrance but they need to TELL ME what it is so I know if it's what's causing me an issue instead of just listing \"fragrance\" on the label.\n\n**Sunscreen**\n\n*  **Neutrogena Clear Face Liquid Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30** ($10.99 for 3oz at Target) - 1 star. I hate this sunscreen. It was what I always used as a teen when I went to the beach, because it was the only face-specific drugstore option available to me. I repurchased because I haven't been using a sunscreen regularly and know how important it is, and I knew I had used it before. And wow, it reminded me why I hated putting sunscreen on my face so much. It smells so strongly with that chemical sunscreen scent, and it's right by your nose, so it is offensive and lasts a while. I suffer from chronic migraines, and scent is a common irritant and/or trigger for me, so this was extra awful. It’s thick. It’s sticky. It doesn’t wear well under makeup. It burns my face and eyes when I put it on, and then when I take it off it burns even more! It didn’t cause any breakouts to my knowledge, but I didn’t try it very long, so that is really left to be seen. I will not be repurchasing. \n*  **Sun Bum Mineral Face Stick SPF 50** ($11.99 for 0.45oz at Target) - 1 star. I picked this up to try a mineral face sunscreen. I was hoping that a mineral sunscreen would be better smell-wise. I also thought the stick idea was genius, because it fits in my purse so easily, and I knew it would not accidentally open up and squirt everywhere (am I the only one this happens to?). Unfortunately, the stick formula is hard to work with, and I found dragging it across my skin was way too harsh. So I used it by rubbing it on my hands and then into my face, but in general it was thick, difficult to work with, and did not want to rub in. It left a visible white cast on my face, despite me being one of the palest people I know. It also caused me some breakouts. It does wear well under makeup, but that may be the only positive I found. I will not be repurchasing this.\n* **Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF50+ PA++++** ($14.90 for 3oz on Amazon) - 4.5 stars. I love this sunscreen! It feels like a thick face lotion instead of being kind of goopy the way sunscreen typically does. It also lacks that typical sunscreen smell. It has a bit of an alcohol scent when it first comes out, but the smell dissipates very quickly. It doesn’t cause any issues under my makeup, and it hasn’t broken me out so far. I don’t notice a white cast, but I’m extremely pale, so take that with a grain of salt. It does have fragrance listed under ingredients, which I’m not super excited about, but otherwise is absolutely perfect. This is the first sunscreen that I've actually used every morning since trying instead of making excuses about why I don’t need it. I will most definitely be repurchasing.\n* I wanted to try some of the options from La Roche Posay, but considering Biore works so well for me and is considerably more affordable, I don't see myself purchasing them. I do, however, really want to try Supergoop Glowscreen because I love a good glow, and I could see myself using that on it's own in the summer for a light look, but it's also quite pricey, so it may be something I save for or ask for birthday/Christmas.\n\n**Cleansing Balms**\n\n* **Ponds Makeup Remover Cleansing Balm** ($9.99 for 3.38oz at Walmart) 3.5 stars. I had high hopes for this as a cheap cleansing balm that wasn't based off coconut oil (breaks me out real bad). It did the job just fine, but it took more rubbing than I'm used to from a cleansing balm. It just felt... lackluster? I'm not sure. It also had fragrance listed as an ingredient, which is annoying. I'm not planning on repurchasing.\n* **Banila‌ ‌Co‌ ‌Clean‌ ‌it‌ ‌Zero‌ ‌Original‌ ‌Cleansing‌ ‌Balm‌‌** ‌($26‌ ‌for‌ ‌6oz‌ ‌on‌ ‌Amazon or $19 for 3.3oz at Ulta)‌  4 stars. I like this product, but I’m not married to it. It’s got that typical cleansing balm texture, where it sort of turns to an oil on your face as you rub it into water. It took all of my makeup and sunscreen off quickly and easily without stinging my eyes. The smell is, in my opinion, offensive, and is labeled “fragrance” on the ingredients so no idea what it is. It’s a very perfume-y scent. I’m interested in trying some of the other versions to see if they smell better/different. I really love the packaging. It’s a matte pink and comes with a little spatula AND spatula holder. Genius. Every tub based product needs to have this. I haven’t experienced any breakouts from this, but I also use it as part of a double cleanse, so it isn’t left on my face for much time. I will be repurchasing this unless I see/hear of a better but still cheap alternative.\n* I have tried and loved Clinique Take the Day off but can't really justify spending that kind of money when it's not any better than the Banila Co. I am interested in trying other stuff, but almost all of the cheap options include fracking coconut oil, and I just can't justify the more expensive options when it's just a makeup remover.\n\n**Moisturizers**\n\n* **Vanicream Moisturizing Cream** ($13.49 for 16oz at Target) - 3 stars. I liked this in theory because there were so few ingredients. I figured nothing in this could possibly break out or irritate my skin, since it’s basically petroleum and water. And I was right! Unfortunately, it just wasn’t nearly moisturizing enough for my skin. It also has a kind of sour, unpleasant smell (I recognize my hypocrisy after complaining about fragrance in everything else, but like... it smells like spoiled milk, ew). I will continue using this on my body over other moisturizers to help seal in the moisture until it runs out, but I will not be repurchasing.\n* **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream** ($18.49 for 16oz at Target) - 3.5 stars. I wanted to like this, based on so many positive skincareaddiction reviews. I switched to this from the CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion (which I’ve been using almost 10 years now) because I needed extra moisture during the winter. For reasons I’m still trying to sort out, this broke me out, but the daily moisturizing lotion does not. I did an in depth look at the ingredients and found them to be almost exactly identical except for the cream having different ceramides and including petroleum and tocopherol where the lotion did not. Now the ceramides I’m not too worried about, and I already know that petroleum isn’t a problem for me, and tocopherol is in TO Azelaic Acid which I love and adore. I don’t entirely understand it, but I don’t make the rules, my skin does. I will continue using this on my body and will repurchase when it goes on sale because it’s so hard to find unscented products for my migraine days, and this is an excellent body moisturizer.\n* **Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel** ($7.99 for 0.5oz trial size or $16.99 for 1.7oz at Target)- 3 stars. Glad I got the trial size, though it lasted barely a week. Another skincareaddiction favorite that just didn’t work for me. I was so hopeful for this. While I didn’t see any breakouts in the few days I tried it, it just wasn’t hydrating enough for me. I kept adding more and more throughout the day. My skin is very, very dry, and I felt it getting tighter and rougher very quickly. I didn’t push it further, because my skin was so desperate for moisture. I also didn’t love that there was fragrance in the mini tub I got, but I read online that there is a fragrance-free option, so I'm not too mad. I used up my mini tub and will not be repurchasing, though I do still recommend it to my friends with more combination or oily skin.\n* **CeraVe Healing Ointment tube version** ($9.99 for 3oz at Target) - 5 stars. I used to use vaseline or aquaphor on my easily chapped lips at night, and I didn't really think there was anything out there that was better. But wow this is SO much better. My chapped lips LOVE this stuff. It’s still got that petroleum feel where it’s kind of slimy/goopy but honestly by morning it has sunk in unlike vaseline/aquaphor which are still there feeling filmy and gross in the morning. I feel like this may also be a game changer come cold and flu season to use around my nose, because I get the worse chapped skin around my nose when I’m sick. I will be repurchasing this and am currently seeking out the mini versions for my purse.\n\n**Acne Solutions**\n\n* **Adult Acnomel** ($11.99 for 1.3oz at Walmart)- 2 stars. I was intrigued by this because it was an acne medication without benzoyl peroxide, which tends to dry out my skin, even as a spot treatment. It has resorcinol and sulfur as its active ingredients, along with bentonite clay. It did help slightly when used as a spot treatment, but it also irritated my skin and left little red, irritation circles. I’m not surprised, as when I checked, I saw it has alcohol listed as the first inactive ingredient. Another star off for listing fragrance, because why would a spot treatment require fragrance?! I will not be repurchasing this.\n* **Stridex Sensitive with Aloe 0.5% Salicylic Acid pads** ($3.97 for a box of 90 at Walmart) - 4 stars. I appreciate that they have a low salicylic acid version and especially that these are alcohol free. In high school I was a huge user of alcohol based acne pads and was pretty badly turned off to acne pads, but these are definitely changing my mind. I still had to start by using them every other day to avoid the initial drying period, and I’m hoping to eventually graduate to using the regular strength. It has made a difference in clogged pores, especially on my chin. I would give this 5 stars but they have FRAGRANCE listed on their ingredients. In a SENSITIVE skin version. So frustrating, honestly. I will still be repurchasing, though.\n* **The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%** ($7.90 for 1oz at Ulta) - 4 stars - This is a product I will probably never stop using. Nothing has made more of a difference in my inflammatory acne than this product. I ran out and didn't repurchase sometime before the pandemic and was seeing a lot of papules and pustules. I got some more of this with the rest of my skincare order, and maybe a week after I reintroduced it was seeing a huge reduction in acne. I can’t give it 5 stars because it honestly pills something FIERCE under makeup or if other products are layered. The only other azelaic acid product on the market I’ve seen is the Paula’s Choice version, and I just can’t justify spending 3x what I spend on this, even if it doesn't have the pilling issue. If there are any other suggestions for better Azelaic Acid products that are affordable, let me know. Otherwise, I will be repurchasing this until the end of time. \n\n**Other stuff**\n\n* **The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% in Squalane** ($9.60 for 1oz at TO website) - 4 stars. This is another product that I’m not particularly married to. I can’t really tell if it’s doing anything, but I’m going to continue using it because I’m terrified of aging. I have pretty deep wrinkles in my forehead, but they’ve been there literally since I was 20. I have very expressive eyebrows, and that’s just not gonna change. I’ve heard that these newer retinoids aren’t as well studied as other types of retinol, but honestly this gave me no irritation, and that’s so important to me. If, in the future, evidence comes out that these don't work or work less than other types of retinol, I may make the switch. Until then, catch me rocking some irritation-free and hypothetically less-aged skin. I’ve actually already repurchased this for when it runs out, but in the 5% version because more has to be better, right?\n* **Glow Recipe Avocado Melt Retinol Eye Sleeping Mask** ($42 for 0.5oz at Sephora) - 3 stars. I got this as a free sample. I don’t normally do eye creams, because I think they’re kind of over-priced moisturizers, but I figured a retinol one might be useful because obviously I don’t put my regular retinol near my eyes. I haven’t really noticed a difference in my eye area from this product, though obviously as an anti-aging mask it would be more preventative. The packaging I saw online is super cute, and I do feel kind of boujee putting it on, so I thought it might be a cute self-care purchase even if it isn’t doing all that much. And then I saw the price tag. Hot damn $42 for 0.5oz? For that much money I better wake up looking like a model in a coffee commercial. AND I found out there is fragrance listed as one of the ingredients. I do not need fragrance near my eyes, thank you, next. I will not be repurchasing. But let a girl know if there's a decent (and cheap) retinol/anti-aging eye cream.\n* **Glow Recipe Watermelon + AHA Glow Sleeping Mask** ($45 for 2.7oz at Sephora) - 4 stars. I bought this in a travel size to try, and I hoped I would see some results from the AHA. It didn’t list the percentage, so I assume it’s fairly low. My skin feels so soft and smooth and hydrated and honestly just wonderful in the morning after using this, and it hasn’t caused any breakouts or irritation. I also feel like the whiteheads on my forehead have lessened as a result of this. It doesn’t exactly sink in the way it claims, and definitely needs to be rinsed off in the morning or it will pill under other products/makeup/sunscreen. It unfortunately has fragrance listed as an ingredient, and smells like watermelon candy. Whenever I put it on, I am transported to being 11 years old and using those roller-ball lip glosses from lipsmacker. The packaging is absolutely adorable, and I just really love the way it looks on my shelf. I will not be repurchasing at this time, though I may ask for it for my birthday or Christmas or save it for a special self-care-gift-to-myself, because it's so pretty and makes me feel fancy and actually does something for me.\n\nThanks for reading til the end. I hope this was useful to someone. I've got some more products on the way, and am currently still testing some, so if this review was helpful at all, let me know, and I'll make another post for those products when my testing is finished. Testing all these new products has been a really fun pandemic activity for me to keep me from going insane while trapped in the house.",

    "body": "hi guys! it's been a year since the beginning of my skincare journey, so i think it's time to give back to these skincare communities which have taught me so much! here is an extensive list of **AB** (asian beauty) and **non-AB** products i've tried in the past year, ranging mostly from drug-store to mid-range products. i've arranged the list in the order of the **highest to lowest** ratings.\n\n**skin type:** early 20s, sensitive, acne-prone, combination (oily over forehead, dry everywhere else), Fitzpatrick IV/brown\n\n**skin concerns:** inflammatory acne, closed comedones, some PIH/PIE, a few freckles, anti-aging\n\n**skin irritants:** most plant extracts, most essential oils, any form of physical exfoliation\n\ndespite my sensitive skin type, i have gone through a number of products with artificial fragrances/EOs/strange plant extracts, because i didn't know what my skin triggers were back then. hopefully even my negative experiences will be of some help! :)\n\ncaveat: my experiences will likely differ from most of yours, since everyone reacts differently even to the same ingredient :D. do note that i have a rather finicky skin type that sadly disagrees with an overwhelming majority of products!\n\n# 1st-step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) bioderma sensibio micellar water** ($14.90 for 16.7oz) is a no-frills micellar water that is extremely suitable for sensitive skin types. it has no fragrance, and also has an extremely short ingredients list which does not contain any comedogenic/irritating ingredients. because of this, it truly stands out from most other brands of micellar water! this has never once caused any breakouts for me. it is good at removing light makeup or non-waterresistant sunscreen. however, with heavier makeup/ water-resistant sunscreen, you'd need a lot more effort to rub (gently) them off. that irritates my skin, unfortunately. therefore, i'm currently only using this to quickly and gently remove non-water resistant sunscreen, and it causes no irritation this way, yay! for those of you with sensitive/dry skin types, using micellar water to remove light makeup/sunscreen may wind up being much gentler and less stripping than oil cleansers, as it is for me. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**muji sensitive cleansing oil** ($19.90 for 13.5oz) is a thick, non-stripping, unscented cleansing oil which is effective at removing sunscreen/makeup. it has no discernible scent to me. this rinses cleanly without leaving an oily film. while this did not cause any dryness, i experienced some irritation (redness, tingling) after a few uses. i am suspecting that something in the ingredients list (eg: ethylhexyl palmitate, which may be slightly irritating) did not agree with my skin. otherwise, the ingredients list is free of any other common skin irritants. i also did not enjoy the thick texture of the oil which was difficult to spread around my face. however, this is affordable and comes in a large pump bottle! i could see this working well for many other skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**shu uemera anti/oxi+ pollutant and dullness clarifying cleansing oil** ($58 for 9.8oz) is also a thick, non-stripping, luxurious, gorgeous cleansing oil that is effective at removing makeup. it is of very similar texture to muji's sensitive cleansing oil. but this contains a number of skin irritants, and is also heavily fragranced; it has an earthy, herbal smell. after about 4-5 uses, my skin began to feel irritated-- unbearable tingling in my cheeks. this was very disappointing given its steep price point :-(. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# 2nd step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser** ($19 for 6.4 oz) is the only cleanser so far that ticks all my boxes! it is non-irritating, non-stripping, ph-balanced, and does not break me out. i'd gone through at least a dozen cleansers throughout my life, before i found this, my very first ride-or-die cleanser! every other cleanser in the past would either strip my skin too dry OR irritate my skin. i love that it has no artificial fragrance; it only has a mild, inoffensive soapy scent. it also has an ingredients list that's free of irritants. this cleanser has a cream-gel texture that does not foam up at all. if you're used to foaming cleansers like i was, i totally understand your apprehension. however, many of us would benefit from gentler cleansers like this one, and i'd highly recommend this cleanser to any skin type except those with particularly oily skin. this also comes in a pretty, blue bottle with a pump dispenser! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh soy face cleanser** ($69 for 13.5oz) used to be a staple in my skincare routine till i discovered the cleanser above. yes, this contains rose water and other plant extracts, as well as rose oil, which are common skin irritants amongst folks with sensitive skin :(! apart from these irritating additives, however, it was perfect in my eyes. it has a heavenly cucumber scent. despite the alarming ingredients list, it caused no signs of irritation, also probably because i cleanse my face really quickly to minimise contact time with cleansers in general. it was non-stripping, rinsed off very easily and cleanly, and smelled great (like fresh cucumbers) to me. this is still the 2nd best cleanser i've tried to date despite the disappointing additives... and i've tried at least 20 different cleansers so far. go to sephora and take a whiff! if the scent is your cup of tea, and you're not at all sensitive to its ingredients, i'd still recommend this cleanser. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**krave matcha hemp cleanser** ($26 for 4 oz) is a gel cleanser that appeared perfect in every way till i used it. IMO, it was difficult to rinse off, and left an oily film on my face after washing. i know some people are fine with that, but that sensation of *something* left on my skin after cleansing my face unsettles me. it was also much more drying than fresh soy face cleanser, probably because it contains coco-betaine (which is a much harsher surfactant, as compared to the top surfactant in fresh soy face cleanser, coco-glucoside) at the top of its list. it was mildly irritating too if i took my time with it-- i was surprised when it made my skin tingle, since its ingredients list seemed so gentle! i expected this to smell like matcha but instead it smelled like soap... which is reasonable, since it has no artificial fragrance/EOs. i see that this could be a potential HG for many skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**innisfree blueberry cleanser** (\\~$9 for 3.4 oz) is a creamy cleanser that produces a rich lather. it has a pungent citrus smell which i simply couldn't come to terms with. it's also slightly irritating, and definitely too stripping for me. i eventually gave it away to my bf, and it works really well for him! he uses a tiny bit each time, otherwise it'd be too stripping for his normal-dry skin type. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) qv gentle wash** (\\~$24 for 33.8 oz) is a no-frills, unscented, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. this was definitely too stripping to be used on my face, so i use this sparingly on my body instead. this cleanser has a faint soapy smell that's much more pleasant than vanicream's, and it's completely non-irritating. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sebamed liquid face and body wash** ($13.5 for 6.8oz) is similarly a no-frills, unscented, foaming cleanser. it has a gel consistency and dried out my skin very badly. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene soapless foaming gel** is rather similar to the sebamed liquid face and body wash, in that they are both incredibly drying, no-frills sort of gel cleansers. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**hada labo super hyaluronic acid foaming wash** ($9 for 5.4oz) is an unscented self-foaming cleanser. the foam is very soft and abundant! it also rinses off effortlessly and cleanly. it has a pleasant, mild soapy scent. unfortunately, it caused my skin to burn after a few uses, and i had to discontinue use. it was also definitely too stripping for my skin. i think i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types, but my skin's just... *sighs.* **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) vanicream gentle facial cleanser** ($9 for 8 oz) is a no-frills, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. it is unscented and has one of the shortest ingredients lists. it left my skin squeaky clean within 1 wash despite using only a pea-sized amount of the cleanser. my cheeks were also blotchy afterwards, and i still haven't been able to identify what is the irritant within this short and innocuous-looking ingredients list! of all the basic drugstore cleansers, this had the least pleasant chemical scent to it. but i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche-posay toleriane hydrating gentle cleanser/ toleriane caring wash** ($15 for 13.5oz) is a non-foaming, ultra-gentle cream-gel cleanser. this burned both my bf's and my faces on the first wash... achievement unlocked, i guess! but i could feel that this was definitely non-stripping. i still don't know what irritated my skin here, since it works so well for so many other people with sensitive skin. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# toners\n\n**isntree green tea toner** ($20 for 6.7 oz) is a thin, watery toner with a rather strong herbal scent. this did nothing much for my skin. it wasn't effective at hydrating/soothing my skin, controlling sebum production or calming my breakouts, which some other reviewers seemed to experience with this toner. though this toner does not contain any artificial fragrance/EOs, it has a cloyingly sweet scent that i am not a fan of. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**klairs supple preparation unscented toner** ($22 for 6.1 oz) is a viscous, hydrating toner. this has a mild chemical scent to it which did not bother me at all. it did pack a punch of hydration but also broke me out after a week of use. i've since learnt that butylene glycol, which is 2nd in this ingredients list, is rather comedogenic for me. however, i really appreciated the inclusion of non-irritating and soothing ingredients! it would have been perfect if it didn't contain butylene glycol. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) kiehl's ultra facial toner** ($17 for 8.4 oz) is a milky, viscous, moisturising toner. this broke me out very quickly, possibly due to the squalane and quite a number of other comedogenic ingredients that are further down the ingredients list. this has no EOs/artificial fragrance, and has a neutral, inoffensive scent. i would recommend this only to normal-dry skin types which are not acne-prone. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# serums\n\n🌟 **purito centella unscented serum** ($20 for 2oz) is my favourite serum thus far! this contains 49% centella asiatica (tiger grass), \\~3% niacinamide, asiaticoside/asiatic acid/madecassic acid, sodium hyaluronate, and peptides. the star ingredient here is the centella! this calms my skin down like no other product ever has. my cheeks are less red and painful. my acne heals a lot quicker while using this too. while this doesn't contain artificial fragrance, it has a light sweet scent that doesn't bother me. it also provides a nice layer of hydration. it is viscuous, takes a short while to absorb, dries down kind of tacky and leaves your skin looking dewier. overall, it's still a cosmetically elegant serum to me. i've repurchased this a few times and i plan to use this for a looooooong time! i'd highly recommend this serum to almost anyone. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster** ($44 for 0.67 oz) is a great niacinamide serum. it's filled to the brim with great ingredients. this contains 10% niacinamide and stabilised derivatives of vitamin c (acetyl glucosamine, ascorbyl glucoside) which work together synergistically alongside niacinamide to effectively brighten your skin. it also has sodium hyaluronate, other soothing ingredients and antioxidants. it's a tiny bottle but it lasts half a year for me, because i mix this booster with purito's serum, so i use only 4 drops per day. it's watery and absorbs extremely quickly without leaving tackiness/shine. this has a light pleasant scent, but does not contain artificial fragrance. i'd highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a gentle but immensely brightening niacinamide serum with a ton of other great ingredients. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum** ($21 for 1 oz) is a minimalistic serum containing 5% MAP (magnesium ascorbyl phosphate). MAP is a gentle, stabilised derivative of vitamin c, that can help with skin brightening, and perhaps, prevent aging. my skin cannot tolerate daily use of L-ascorbic acid, hence i use this too. this also has 1% hyaluronic acid and 1.5% of matrixyl 3000. it is non-irritating and provides a nice layer of hydration despite being pretty thin. i definitely notice that my skin's duller and less plump when i go without this. this doesn't have a detectable scent. i love timeless, in general! it has a whole range of simple but effective serums that are suitable for even sensitive and acne-prone skin type. i highly recommend checking out their serums! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) timeless vitamin c + e ferulic acid serum** ($26 for 1oz) is a 20% unscented L-ascorbic acid serum. it has a very low pH of 2.4, so it's pretty irritating and drying :\\\\. this is really the only significant issue that i have with this product. i can only use this a maximum of 2 times per week, and even at this conservative frequency, i experience quite a bit of flaking. this has a bit of a sausage-like/metallic smell but it doesn't disturb me at all, personally. i absolutely loveeeee that this comes in an airless pump now. the ingredients list is as simple as it gets for an L-AA serum. it can easily last 6 months after opening as long as i keep it refrigerated! ensure that you order this from a reputable seller who orders fresh stocks or else your product may oxidise quickly. this is an affordable and effective L-AA serum. **4.5/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level buffet serum** ($20 for 2oz) is basically the scented version of purito centella unscented serum. this contains EOs so it has a stronger herbal scent. i've noticed that this is slightly irritating when my skin's very sensitive. i'd recommend the unscented version above if you're interested in this! but if you're a sucker for the scent of lavender oil, i think this would be great too, because i had really great results using this for months as well. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n# moisturisers\n\n🌟 **etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream** ($18 for 2 oz) is a medium-weight, unscented, simple creamy moisturiser. of all the creamy moisturisers that i've come across, this has one of the simplest and least comedogenic ingredients lists. it has a faint shea butter smell. don't be fooled by the name, it's definitely not a thick, suffocating cream! it spreads easily like a dream, and hasn't broken me out at all! this is also very effective at moisturising my skin-- my dry spots improve significantly overnight whenever i slather this on. however, it does leave your skin feeling pretty tacky especially if you layer other hydrating products beneath this. again, tackiness doesn't bother me since i don't (and shouldn't) touch my face much at all. this cream leaves me looking dewy too. even when my skin was at its worst, this caused 0 irritation, and in fact, helped to reduce redness and minimise tingling. i feel a fresh, cooling burst of hydration whenever i slather this on. i'd highly recommend this to almost any skin type. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene skin recovery cream** ($35 for 1.7 oz) is one of the simplest, most basic, unscented, no-frills cream moisturisers on the market. it has a slightly heavy, thick texture, but still glides on quite smoothly. the ingredients list only has 11 ingredients! i know that i can always switch back to this moisturiser if somethings goes awry. it is non-irritating but also doesn't soothe my skin. i think it moisturises decently but etude house soon jung barrier cream is a more efficacious moisturiser, IMO. the soonjung one's spreads much more effortlessly too. i'd recommend this to those with extremely sensitive skin types/those who may have accidentally destroyed their skin barrier. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) rocky mountain oils sacred skin facial moisturizer** ($50 for 1.7 oz) is a highly emollient, medium-weight, luxurious cream that is scented with frankincense EO. i was previously using this for half a year till i discovered a better replacement, aka etude house soonjung barrier cream. i adore the texture of this cream-- it's so emollient and rich, so it does require some warming up in your palms. while this worked beautifully as a moisturiser and caused me no issues such as irritation and breakouts, i wanted to move towards building a fragrance-free routine due to my pretty sensitive skin. perhaps the EO in this was not yet causing me issues, but in due time, it could potentially contribute to significant inflammation, then finally culminating in significant skin irritation. my risk threshold is pretty low now because i've come very close to ruining my skin barrier with products, so i've decided not to continue using this. regardless, i'd recommend this to anyone who'd like a medium-weight cream with an amazing frankincense scent. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**cosrx oil-free ultra-moisturising lotion** ($24 for 3.4 oz) is a gel-cream moisturiser which features a high amount of birch sap. i used this for a week and it was a decent, unimpressive moisturiser. i experienced a bit of irritation (skin burning) with this, perhaps due to the citrus peel EO in this. it has a distinct sweet, fruity scent. because of its thin gel-cream consistency, and their intention to exclude many emollients/oils, this moisturiser wouldn't be adequate for my combination skin type in the long run. sadly, this contains butylene glycol and dimethicone at the top of the ingredients list, which are known acne triggers for me. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# eye moisturisers\n\n**laneige water bank eye gel** ($39 for 0.8 oz) is fragranced gel moisturiser. it didn't cause any issues for me, but also wasn't impressive in any way. this had a sharp floral scent. again, i could do without this in-your-face sort of fragrance. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**laneige time freeze eye serum** ($52 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, thin, milky eye serum. i soldiered on despite the old-lady fragrance and then got milia after a few weeks of use... that isn't a surprise, in retrospect, because butylene glycol are dimethicone are at the top of the ingredients list. thankfully, i experienced no irritation with this. otherwise, this did moisturise pretty decently... but nothing different from other moisturisers that i've tried. it is expensive for the small amount, and i do think there are many other better eye/face moisturisers out there that contain far better ingredients at the same price point. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone simply because it is unimpressive. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# sunscreens\n\n🌟 **purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is an unscented, soothing, chemical sunscreen that is not water-resistant. this doesn't leave a white cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin even though i slather on a liberal amount-- about 1/8-1/4 teaspoon each time. many unscented products may smell a little strange but this only really has an extremely light chemical scent that doesn't seem to bother anyone so far! this is very hydrating and moisturising, so it leaves my skin looking dewy. it contains 2% niacinamide, centella asiatica, madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this pretty much looks and feels like a moisturiser with spf! i suspect that this, alone, would be enough in the AM for pretty dry skin types too. i break out from all sunscreens, and i think this one contributes a little to my acne. however it really is the least comedogenic sunscreen that i've tried/seen! i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**missha all-around safe block essence sun spf 45 pa +++** ($16 for 1.7 oz) is a fragranced, water-resistant sunscreen. i'm personally fine with its light floral scent. this has caused my no irritation, doesn't leave a white cast, and moisturises well! i could even skip my serums because this is THAT hydrating/moisturising. as a result, it does leave my skin looking quite dewy, but that's fine with me! unfortunately, it may have broken me out a little, but then again, all sunscreens, especially water-resistant ones, tend to have that effect on me. i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type who's looking for a water-resistant sunscreen! **4/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level safe sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is a scented version of the sunscreen above. this contains EOs and smells extremely strongly of lavender. the other difference is that this doesn't contain madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this caused no irritation for my skin type too! while this worked really well for my skin too, i'd recommend the unscented version instead for the reasons stated previously. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) skinceuticals physical fusion uv defense spf 50** ($34 for 1.7oz) is a tinted, physical, water-resistant sunscreen. this left me looking like a very anguished ghost. it is advertised to be suitable for all skin types, but obviously, if you do apply an adequate amount, it leaves an unavoidable violaceous-beige cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin... this was super disappointing! immediately upon application, i also experienced tingling on the more irritated areas of my face. i'd only recommend this to normal, fair (Fitzpatrick II-III) skin types... **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# wash-off face masks\n\n**(NON-AB) origins 10 minute drink up hydrating mask with apricot & glacier water** ($26 for 2.5oz) is a fragranced, creamy, ultra-moisturising wash-off mask. this caused closed comedones after 1 use (30min), though it was non-irritating. it smells strongly of fresh oranges. this would be awesome for drier skin types which are NOT at all acne-prone. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh rose face mask** ($62 for 3.3oz) is a gel mask containing bits of rose petals. this was supposed to soothe my skin, but instead, this irritated my skin right away and caused tingling/redness. it also did not seem to hydrate my skin much at all. i wouldn't recommend this (or any products featuring a high concentration of rose) to sensitive skin types. **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**raw manuka honey:** i decided to spread a generous amount of pure manuka honey with decent UMF rating. immediately, my face stung and turned pink. moral of the story: always patch test!\n\n# sheet masks\n\n**klairs rich moist soothing tencel sheet mask** ($30 for 10 sheets) is an unscented, ultra-hydrating, simple sheet mask. the essence is quite viscous but doesn't leave my skin feeling too tacky. it has pretty much no scent to it. it contains a list of non-irritating ingredients, and some ultra-calming ingredients such as panthenol and centella. it also has ceramides. all in all, this is a great mask to fix your skin barrier! within one use, all of my dry patches were gone. unrestrained sheet masking (a few times per week, in my case) always breaks me out, as it did when i used this mask too. however a single use is fine. i also love that the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft. i'm deducting 0.5 point just because butylene glycol is a known acne trigger for me, and it's at the top of this ingredients list. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**twotsp ggulba mask** ($30 for 5 sheets) is a fragranced, incredibly moisturising sheet mask containing very thick essence. what sets this apart from many other sheet masks is that the essence in this is INCREDIBLY sticky, since it is enriched with honey. there's also niacinamide in here, near the top of the ingredients list. the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft! it has a cloyingly sweet scent which reminds me of a sweet dessert. this is absolutely nourishing. however, it contains a few potential skin irritants, such as a few plant extracts, including rose extract. otherwise, this did not break me out (as long as i realllyyyy space out my sheet masking) or irritate my skin. i won't be repurchasing due to the potentially irritating additives. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**mediheal teatree care solution essential mask** ($3 per sheet) is a fragranced mask featuring centella asiatica and tea tree extract. the essence isn't sticky. there's nothing really outstanding about this. it contains lavender EO. while it didn't break me out or irritate my skin, it also didn't soothe or hydrate my skin remarkably. i'm nitpicking here... but the material of the sheet mask is pretty thick! **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**papa recipe bombee honey mask** ($20 for 10 sheets) is a fragranced mask that reminds me of a lighter version of the ggulba mask. the essence is pretty sticky here due to its star ingredient, honey. my experience with this is largely similar to my experience with ggulba, except this is less moisturising. both have a similar artificial, cloyingly sweet scent. **2.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**dr jart+ cicapair calming mask** ($23 for 5 sheets) is a mask featuring centella asiatica. it is pretty similar in its scent to the mediheal tea tree mask, but the centella in here seems to be lower in concentration. the mask material is very soft and thin, and seemed to hug my face better. the essence is a pretty thin too. this contains no artificial fragrance/ EOs. however! it irritated my skin slightly-- it caused a bit of tingling. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n# lip balms/masks\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) is a thick, unscented moisturising cream. it has a shea butter scent. it leaves a pretty tacky feeling and shiny appearance. of all the moisturisers that i've tried, this is the most moisturising! i apply a layer of this on my chapped lips, followed by a layer of laneige lip sleeping mask to seal the deal. when i wake up in the morning, my lips are all dandy again! this + laneige lip sleeping mask is my magical duo! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **laneige lip sleeping mask** ($20 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, extremely thick and emollient lip mask. there are a few flavours to choose from, and they all contain strong artificial fragrance. personally, i chose the berry flavour, and it really smells like a strawberry sweet, lol. i could do without the scent. aside from this, this is perfect. compared to other lip masks and balms that i've tried, this is the most hydrating and moisturising mask, by far. it comes with a cute little spatula too. **4.5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**klavuu nourishing care lip sleeping pack** ($15 for 0.7 oz) is a lightly fragranced lip mask. it feels much less oily and thick than laneige's. it also has a faint vanilla scent that's much more tolerable and lighter than the laneige's lip masks. sadly, it did a mediocre job at moisturising my lips. this doesn't come with a spatula :(. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n(**NON-AB) la roche posay cicaplast levres** ($12 for 0.25 oz) is a thick, unscented, simple lip balm. my lips were still very dry despite slathering this on generously. i appreciate the simplicity of this product, but it just didn't work for me. this had a waxy texture. i'd prefer a lighter lip balm than this, personally. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) supergoop! acai fusion lip balm spf 30** ($9.50 for 0.5 oz) is a thick, unscented spf lip balm. it has a waxy, thick texture, and would ball up and flake off my lips so badly. this is not at all cosmetically elegant and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone! **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# actives\n\n🌟 **differin gel** ($15 for 0.5 oz) is a form of acne treatment that contains 0.1% adapalene (a form of retinoid). since incorporating this regularly into my routine, i've noticed a lot less inflammatory acne (giant pimples) and smaller closed comedones too. it doesn't tingle on application but it definitely increases my sensitivity to other products in my routine and causes redness. it's too drying when i use it more than 4-5x per week. however, as long as i use it at a moderate frequency, and pay attention to how my skin's feeling and looking, i experience not many issues with this. i'd highly recommend this to those combating acne, because it's a relatively gentle topical acne treatment. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n# cleansing devices\n\n🌟  **muji unbleached cotton pads** ($3.9 for 80 pieces)are the softest cotton pads ever! it's so gentle on my face, so there's no chafing at all! i find that it's just the right amount of thickness. i never experience issues with loose fibers. i use this to gentlyyy remove my sunscreen with micellar water. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad** ($6.50 for 120 pieces) are extremely thin, compact cotton pads. they're pricey for cotton pads but they absorb very little product, so it'd be economical to use this for expensive products (toners/essences). i find that this is rougher than the muji unbleached cotton pads, so i personally use this on my bacne instead, since my back's not sensitive like my face is. i think this serves really niche purposes, i.e. to reduce wastage of pricier products, and to lightly physically exfoliate. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) normal foreo luna 2** ($169) is a cleansing device that gently vibrates to exfoliate your skin. it was too abrasive and irritating for my sensitive skin type. i experienced tingling and redness even after one use. i kept at it (i couldn't believe that even this would irritate my skin) and those symptoms only got worse! interestingly, this works very well at reducing breakouts for my sister (does not have sensitive skin)  without causing irritation. compared to other cleansing devices on the market, foreo is probably one of the gentlest around. it's still a form of physical exfoliation, so it'd be safer to use it with some caution, aka space out your use when you first begin. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# body care\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) physiogel ai lotion** ($25 for 3.4) is a lightweight, unscented, simple moisturiser. what sets this apart from most other body lotions is that it is so lightweight. it's almost like a milky emulsion! and it surprisingly does a great job at moisturising my dry skin despite its lightweight consistency. i love that it absorbs very quickly without leaving much tackiness or shine. it is also pretty non-comedogenic compared to other body moisturisers, which is a big deal to me, because i actually am acne-prone all over my body. :( it has a light shea butter scent. i'd recommend this to anyone who's looking for a light, no-frills body moisturiser! **5/5, WRP**\n\n🌟 **cos de baha niacin toner** ($17.50 for 6.76 oz) is an unscented toner packed with brightening ingredients. this contains 5% niacinamide, 1% panthenol, hyaluronic acid and licorice root extract. i use this on the areas of my body (back, neck, upper arms) which are suffering from acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/erythema. so far, it's caused no issues such as breakouts or irritation. i primarily chose this for the high concentration of niacinamide, to brighten my acne marks. it's pretty affordable too, so i can slather it on generously on my body. this would also make a good facial toner, but do note that it contains eucalyptus, which is a potential irritant. **5/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar fluide** is a lightweight, gel-cream moisturiser. it absorbs fully within minutes and leaves no tackiness/shine at all! this also contains 4% niacinamide. in general, LRP products contain no skin irritants in its products. if you're looking for a light body moisturiser, this is it! this make work very well as a facial moisturiser too. i personally prefer creamier moisturisers that are richer in emollients, so i may not repurchase. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) the ordinary 7% glycolic acid toner** ($8.70 for 8oz) is a potent AHA toner. it has no artificial fragrance, but it has quite a number of plant extracts. whenever i slather it on my back, i feel as though i'm in a bed of roses. this is rather potent, or perhaps the rose water in this is irritating me, because i do experience some tingling occasionally. i would never use this on my face because this is definitely too irritating/strong. this makes a great body AHA since it's affordable compared to most other exfoliants. **4/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sukin natural botanical body wash** ($17 for 33.8 oz) is a fragranced, non-stripping gel wash that is filled with plant extracts. it contains a number of EOs and artificial fragrances so its botanical scent is really strong. it's non-irritating to my skin, however. it doesn't dry out my skin unlike most body washes i've tried. a non-irritating version of this would be sukin's daily gentle face and body wash, if you're interested! **3.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) has been described above under the lip section! while this is intensely moisturising and leaves my skin feeling the softest, it also causes body acne for me, because it contains a high amount of shea butter and dimethicone, which are acne triggers for me. this would be best for pretty dry skin types/extremely dry patches/winter! if you're not acne-prone and have very dry skin, you can also apply this on your face too :). **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# summary: my holy grails\n\n1. bioderma sensibio micellar water\n2. paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser\n3. purito centella unscented serum\n4. paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster\n5. timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum\n6. etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream\n7. purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++\n8. la roche posay lipikar baume ap+\n9. laneige lip sleeping mask\n10. differin gel\n11. muji unbleached cotton pads\n12. klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad\n13. physiogel ai lotion\n14. cos de baha niacin toner\n\nwhew, that was a real mouthful. i'll be back in a year's time, with a hopefully shorter list :). my fingers are crossed!

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

    "body": "Hi, SCA! I was one of the people who was very excited to see The Ordinary come out with a cleanser, especially one advertised for makeup removal. I've had it about a week now, and I wanted to give some first impression thoughts in case anyone is curious about it. I have acne-prone, combination skin (oily T, very dry cheeks). At this time, I've used the cleanser daily for 5 days.\n\n - **Texture**: Very light cream\n - **Feeling on the skin**: Not as much slip as I expected, it kind of feels like rubbing in my hydrating cleanser, but it did eventually turn into an oil. \n - **Grits**: No\n - **Eyes stinging**: Yes\n - **Smell**: Definitely has a smell, but not strong. I don't smell it once I've rinsed.\n - **Breakout**: None for me\n\n - **Application**: I rub a quarter-sized amount between my hands and then apply on my face. For full makeup days, I use 2 quarters.\n\n - **Effectiveness**: I've tried it on full face makeup days that include waterproof mascara and eyeliner and on no makeup days. It did eventually get my eye makeup off, but it involved a lot more rubbing and work than my usual balm cleanser. I also think that because I had to rub it in so much, some of it got in my eyes. As for my foundation, it did not remove it completely. On days I just used water and sebum resistant sunscreen + tinted mattifying powder, I could see on my white towels that my powder was not completely removed from the cleanser alone. However, I do always double cleanse. When followed up with my Equate hydrating cleanser, my face was fully cleansed.\n\n - **Would I repurchase?**: It's a no from me. The price per oz is more than my usual balm cleanser that works 100x better, so I'll be sticking with that one. Removing all my makeup is really important to me to help prevent breakouts, so I want to not be stressed over that.\n\n - **Who might it be good for?**: I believe this cleanser would be good for people with dry skin that enjoy squalane in their ingredient list. I also think it would be good for people who just wear sunscreen most days, particularly sunscreen that maybe is not water or sebum proof. \n\n\nThose are my first impressions on the cleanser. I'm glad I was able to try it, but I will not be repurchasing. It was just okay for me, but ultimately too much work for removing my makeup. There's a lot of wonderful oil and balm cleansers for removing makeup and sunscreen, so I'm happy to stick with those instead. I hope I was able to answer most of the common questions, but let me know if there's something missing!\n\n\nAlbum photos to show cleanser: https://imgur.com/a/X572ytY\n\n\nMy usual PM routine:\n\n - 1st cleanser: Heimish All Clean Cleansing Balm\n - 2nd cleanser: Equate hydrating cleanser\n - Hydrating toner: Hada Labo Premium lotion\n - Essence: COSRX Snail Essence\n - Moisturizer: TO Natural Moisturizing Factors + 3-5 drops of hemi-squalane oil\n\n\nTreatments as needed:\n\n - Sulfur lotion (I get this from a pharmacy in Colombia): 3x a week\n\n - TO 30% AHA + 2% BHA peel mask: 1x every week or every other week\n\n - Wash off benzoyl peroxide mask: 1x a week",

Hair removal:\n\n- shaving every week with some mechanical peeling beforehand \n\n- face hair removal every 1.5-2 weeks with wax strips, tweezers. My brows naturally don't need a lot of shaping.\n\n4. Nails:\n\n- Manicure at home every week with some gentle cutting, shaping and very natural polish. Polish and long nails are sensory nightmare for me, so I keep it short and sweet, but shaped. Main idea is don't do any harm to cuticles.\n\n- pedicure at home with same ideas, adding mechanical feet peel and brighter polish. Nothing fancy, good old feet scrub.\n\n5. Teeth:\n\n- brushing every morning and every evening (after breakfast and supper)\n\n- electric toothbrush is preferred, but sometimes I do it manually\n\n- flossing every evening before brushing \n\n- flossing, mouthwash and no-sugar gum after every lunch at work \n\n- dental appointment every year, hygienist every half a year. I took it very seriously, gotta keep those teeth\n\n6. Iron, Magnesium everyday, folic acid, calcium etc -- sometimes\n\n7. Vegetables, preferably fresh, with every meal. Some big ass salad every day. I can eat as a horse, but with veggies. I also cook 90% of my food from scratch and understand oil, butter and sugar content of it. I bake my own bread, do my hummus, yougurt etc. No dieting and I am fat, and working on being less fat, but I eat very healthy. \n\n8. Water, tea and other drinks all day long. No sugar drinks -- it's just a habit, no hate on it. I have my coffee black.\n\n9. Every lunch break I walk for 20 mins and do simple upper/core body workout outside. In office clothes, yes. I also use public transportation to and from work and so need to walk 15-20 minutes minimum every morning and evening. In total, I walk more than an hour every day, often more. I am thinking about going back to gum.\n\n10. Stretching before bed. Nothing fancy, old yoga mat at home, 10 mins and I am done.",

However, I didn't get along with tamanu oil in the past (this serum contains 10%) so I'd hesitate to purchase this without trying it out first. \n\nOn a superficial level I love the pump bottle + the aesthetics and the fact that it's 40ml. And Krave Beauty will also donate 2% of every sale of the GBR serum to a foundation that protects the Great Barrier Reef here in Australia! Overall I'm really interested to read the reviews for this product :)\n\n*Edit: percentages and COSDNA link*\n\n*Edit 2: here’s the YouTube video introducing the product (https://youtu.be/q_HcZm9OjJ8).

It also seems weird to me that there would be lactic acid in this, as it can be bad for some with sensitive skin (which you’d think this product would want to be totally safe for) and according to the Simple Skincare Science post on repairing your barrier ( https://simpleskincarescience.com/dehydrated-skin-moisture-barrier-acne-fix/ ) would want to avoid all chemical exfoliants for a month at least while you are letting it repair and before you start to add a chemical exfoliants back in. So it’s odd to me that this would have lactic acid in it, instead of just being a super repairing moisturizer that anyone can use no matter what other actives they already use. I am on a Curology script for Tret and I’d be wary of over exfoliating with this as it has the lactic acid in it, but if it didn’t I’d love to be able to use a super moisturizing and barrier strengthening product after my Tret! 🤔",

    "body": "Don't panic, there is light at the end of the tunnel! I've waited until my skin has stayed routinely clear before I posted this to make sure my advice is solid. I relied on Reddit a lot for help and support when my skin was at its worst, so I want to pay it forward. I apologise for not having any photos, I was too triggered to document it.\n\nHere we go:\n\n**Skin in Nov 18:**\n\nSkin coloured bumps on my forehead, down both sides of my jaw and chin, and a few on my cheeks. My skin had been out of sorts for a while, but the bumps were getting worse and worse. An increase in pimples, but mostly bumps which couldn't be extracted. I was using Garner Micellar water, Ren Evercalm Cleansing Gel and then using hemp seed oil as a moisturiser. The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% once per week and one horrible experience with The Ordinary's Salicylic Acid which burned my skin.\n\n**Fungal Acne?:**\n\nWhile Googling the crap out of my symptoms, I came across Pityrosporum folliculitis (fungal acne) which sounded like it could be the culprit. I used a 1% Clotrimazole on the most red and bumpy patch on my chin and it reduced in size and crusted over overnight. I couldn't believe it. So I began smothering my forehead, chin and jaw in it ready to be bump free. However, I was disappointed when I saw no improvement. If anything, my skin was so dull. Not wanting to give up, I bought Nizoral and Head & Shoulders to use as masks, both of which made my skin angry, bumpy and so so dry.\n\nSo it seemed that only one patch was fungal - I now strongly suspect it was the incorrect use of hemp seed oil that caused it. (The oil would sit on my skin and not be washed off, causing the perfect hot and moist breeding ground for fungal nastiness).\n\n**How I tackled the bumps:**\n\nKnowing they weren't fungal, I had a better idea of how to treat these bumps, some of which were now cystic, and were ruining my self confidence. I switched all my skin care to simple and gentle brands such as Avene, Bioderma and La Roche Posay. I started treating my skin like a new born baby and stopped wearing make up.\n\n**Then I had the breakthrough moment!**\n\nMy change in skincare meant the rest of my face looked amazing, but the troubled parts stayed the same. I was close to giving up and then it hit me to look at my hair products. I was using OGX Coconut Water Shampoo and Conditioner which I naively thought didn't have coconut oil in. Holy crap, it was full of it. I finally found my culprit. I realised the bumps were exactly where the product would run down my face in the shower. As if I didn't realise sooner!!\n\n**The saviour product:**\n\nKnowing it was congestion on a huge scale. I went straight out and bought Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Extreme Night Pads and used them that evening. The next day I had a huge purge. HUGE. And this continued as I used them twice sometimes three times per week. I would cover the pimples in Eucerin Aquaphor and let them heal without extracting until the very moment when they were ready. La Roche Posay's Cicaplast Baume was amazing for healing the pimples. It all got a whole lot worse with every bump coming to a head. It was hard to be ok during that time, but I was grateful to have found a way to heal. Those who deal with persistent acne, you have my upmost respect and love.\n\n**How long to heal:**\n\nIt took 9 weeks to heal from the moment I took out the evil shampoo and conditioner, but all in all, it was about 4 months of struggle. When the bumps had gone, I started using lots of thin layers of hydration, vitamin C and suncreen, and, the TOTAL love of my life, The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid in Squalane 2%. These have reduced my hyperpigmentation and have finally given me my dream skin. Now that's something I never want to experience again!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**List of products I Swear By:**\n\n**Cleansing:**\n\nOil cleanse with Hemp Seed Oil (cold pressed unrefined, all that jazz). Take off with wash cloth\n\nSecond cleanse with Bioderma Sensibo Cleansing Gel (pink bottle). Take off with wash cloth (a new one each day)\n\nAvene Tolerance Extreme Cleansing Lotion. Take off excess with cotton round.\n\nAvene Thermal Spring Water\n\n**Moisturising:**\n\nLa Roche Toleraine Fluide\n\nAvene Tolerance Extreme Emulsion (love it but wouldn't repurchase as very expensive for what you get)\n\nLa Roche Cicaplast Baume B5 (as a sleeping pack or as a spot treatment on scarring)\n\nEucerin Aquaphor or Vaseline - for the slug life\n\n**Actives:**\n\nThe Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% (rarely used now I have retinoid)\n\nNip + Fab Glycolic Fix Extreme Night Pads (again, rarely used now my bumps are gone)\n\nThe Ordinary Granactive Retinoid in Squalane 2%\n\nIndeed Labs Vitamin C24 Facial Creme (use in the morning)\n\n**SPF**\n\nLa Roche Posay Anti Shine 50+ spf\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: to include SPF product and Vit C",

The new one is white, absorbs completely into the skin, no more of the good stuff like copper, zinc etc and i also used to love the color be used it would cover my redness a bit! Im sorry about my English, ill do my best to explain but, their \"philosophy\" is to make products with ingredients that \"mimic\" the skin's natural way of working, in French its cold \"ecobiology\", so by removing antibacterial agents and other stuff, the new formula is more \"alligned\" with their way pf thinking. They want to make products that help the skin do what its supposed to do. I hope that made sense 😅. I still am pissed about the reformulation anyway.

Your skin isn’t worth the earth. Cheaper!!! If they made you really pay for something you’d complain and want women being assaulted and abused for your face cream. Get out of our faces with that miss privilege. You need ingredients that match what you pay or thats a red flag and surprise everything isn’t that requiring people to deep sea dive for you to have the science. Y’all piss me off with that irrelevant crap. Does it have whatever you don’t know was in the other stuff in it? Then get out of their face. Oh no there’s a oil more compatible with your face’s natural sebum components that we lose a lot of after infancy and it’s very good to put back in and comes from olives. Darn it to hell. So miss humecabrat, triglycerides come from coconut oil AND glycerin-like the best humectant for us(I know it sucks how uncomplicated it has to be until you wanna complain about a teenager’s skincare or a ten step routine that’s working hella well tbh)-it’s fatty acids and they’re very nourishing for your skin. And don’t get all offended like you weren’t doing the most and being classist. Y’all will be okay getting it back like you dish it lol. You don’t need everything high up. You need the threshold amount so you work that out and get back to us.it seems they toned down the ingredients that turned over the skin and might stimulate more than calm and restore-like Rhamnose makes your cells turn over and so does kelp. It’s probably a lot for sensitive skin and they decided they wanted it to be a nourishing formula primarily and have just enough boost to encourage skin renewal. Sunflower oil is lovely and stupid good for your skin and hair....sorry. You get the point. Research over freak outs",

    "body": "##ABOUT ME/THE TRIP\n- 187 cm, chronic pain and joint issues (EDS), bony upper body so bags have a tendency to put pressure on weird spots\n- 2 nights at a hotel for a conference, 2 nights staying at a friends house\n- Traveling by train, longest walking done with the bag was approx. 1 km \n- Temperatures ranging from 3°C (night/mornings) to 13°C, sunshine/overcast and windy but no rain forecasted (and none had)\n- City trip without any outdoor activities apart from walking around\n\n##THE BAG\n__Osprey Quasar 26L__\nWeight on the way back: 7,8 kg (everything in photo 2, plus another tote, a notebook and a magnet I left out bc they are identifiable)\n\n__Positives:__\n- Lightweight and much more spacious than I thought! I thought it was full on the way out, but somehow ended up fitting a whole 1000 piece puzzle box and a scarf (and some smaller things) into it before going home. \n- Great big grab handle on top that lays flat against the bag. \n- Just enough pockets for me – the laptop pocket is maybe a little over-engineered with the extra pocket on the outside, but it’s literally just a flat piece of nylon fabric so I can look past that. \n- Surprisingly comfortable shoulder straps! They’re quite thin, but I found that the thicker straps on for example the Fjällräven Skule 28L (that I also tried) put a lot more pressure on my bony shoulders, while the Quasar straps spreads the pressure out more. \n- Can stand up on its own if packed ”correctly” (flat packing cubes at the bottom, heavy stuff towards the back panel), even if it has a slanted bottom. \n- Huge stretchy bottle pockets on each side. \n- Bungy cord – great for holding my scarf and/or jacket while on the movie. \n\n__Negatives:__\n- The compression straps cover the bottle pockets and are generally hard to compress with (compared to for example my Fjällräven Skule 20L, where they sit above the pockets). I get that it’s because they didn’t want them interfering with the main zipper, but they’re too low to do much difference in compression. You can use them to make your bottles more secure though.\n- The main zipper does go down quite far, but if you’re gonna be moving accommodations every day, maybe a clamshell would be easier to handle for unpacking and packing. \n\nAll in all, very happy with this bag and it will become my go-to for shorter trips going forward. \n\n##PACKING LIST\n\n__Clothes:__\nLightweight jacket (worn), merino cardigan (worn), 2 merino t-shirts, 1 Airism t-shirt (worn), 2 long sleeve merino shirts, jeans, cotton cargo pants (worn), long t-shirt + shorts (for pyjamas), 5 undies (1 worn), bra (worn, forgot to bring a second one lol), 4 pairs merino socks (1 worn), shoes (worn), scarf (worn)\n\n__Toiletries:__\nFoldable toothbrush, toothpaste, hand cream, face wash, TO squalane, TO rosehip seed oil, TO barrier support serum, heavy moisturiser, hair tie, hair clip, silk sleeping mask, comb, medications (earbuds, panty liners, floss not pictured) \n_Did not bring any shampoo, conditioner or soap since I could use the ones at the hotel/my friend’s place. Did not bother to decant my dropper bottles bc laziness._\n\n__Things in Osprey:__\n- iPad Pro with pen and charger\n- Apple Watch (worn) with charger\n- Big powerbank and Apple Watch charger (watch worn)\n- 0,6L water bottle\n- Small drawstring bag for dirty underwear\n- 2 totes (one brought, one aquired, did not use either)\n- 2 IKEA packing cubes with clothes (love these)\n- The pair of pants I wasn’t wearing\n- Tempur memory foam travel pillow (I am a fussy sleeper, it’s very heavy but I need it)\n- 5 energy bars (did not end up eating a single one lol I always bring too many bc I cannot function if I get hungry)\n- 1000 piece puzzle (don’t know why I felt the need to get it, I could’ve gotten this at home 🙄)\n- Thrifted scarf\n- Notebook (not pictured)\n- Sunglasses + case\n- Bose QCII (when not worn, forgot to include in photo, but fit in the bag)\n\n__Things in cross-body bag:__\nHand sanitizer, tissues, keys, paracetamol, iPhone charger, wallet, glasses + case, AirPods Pro, another energy bar (…)\n\n\n##TAKEAWAYS\n- Did not need a pyjamas, for the conference we had our own rooms and at my friend’s place I used one of the merino t-shirts I had yet to use. Had it gotten warmer, I would’ve used the long T-shirt as a regular top, but it was kinda cold. \n- Without the puzzle and my pillow, the backpack + my cross-body would’ve been below 7 kgs, so could’ve worked for flying carry-on only.\n- Had I stayed longer, I would’ve started handwashing my tops (did that last trip, even tho I wasn’t technically one bagging then). The amount was absolutely fine, but I’m one of those who doesn’t mind repeating outfits (much prefer it actually, less to think about) and didn’t have to dress up for this trip so what I brought worked fine. \n- I could’ve done this trip with a small roller bag, but the town we went to had lots of cobblestoned streets (which I knew) so I picked a backpack. The hotel was very close to the train station though, and had luggage storage, so my coworkers who brought rollers weren’t suffering in any way. Since I wasn’t going straight home after and had to hop around on different public transport, the backpack was still much easier to move around with.\n",

    "body": "Currently in use\n1. Mediplus gel - got it in Japan a while back, figured the best way to use it is with my Foreo Bear mini sessions. It’s advertised as a all in one, lotion, emulsion. Stays long “wet” which allows the device to glide nicely. It plumps and hydrates the skin exceptionally but it has a sticky feeling to it. Won’t repurchase. Price was about 30 eur for 180g bottle.\n\n2. Elixir Bouncing Moisture Lotion II (shiseido brand) - I really like it, hydrates and gives a glow to the skin, not sticky, contains fragrance, which I enjoy when it’s done well in cosmetics. It’s not a toner, has more viscosity and if you apply 2-3 layers you might not need anything else, in summer i.e. It’s def more high end skincare, reminds me of Ibuki line that shiseido had some time ago. 30 eur for 170ml, got it from Japan.\n\n3. Elixir Bouncing Moisture Emulsion II - it’s liquid cream, basically what we would call a lotion in west. Really nice. Glowy, bouncy hydration, has fragrance. 30-35 eur for 130ml, got it from Japan.\n\n4. Soon Jung 2xBarrier Cream - excellent affordable product to heal akin barrier. I had an outbreak of rosacea last summer and used only super gentle products to help heal skin along ivermectin. I compared this one to the La Roche Posay Toleriane Cream, same efficacy for me. 16 eur for 60ml on amazon.de\n\n5. Dr. Jart Ceramidin - it’s nice, has a herbal scent like the entire yellow line. Dries matte on the skin. I got it for a really good price, would not repurchase for full RP. \n\n6. Avene Cicalfate - my HG! Helped so much with my perioral dermatitis that I got due to using steroid nasal spray for pollen allergy. Anytime I feel my skin gets a bit more sensitive, I slather it at night and in the morning everything is good again. It’s a dense, oily paste, with a blue tint due tu copper, but glides nicely compared to a regular zinc paste.\nI prefer this one over LRP Cicaplast. 10-12 eur in the pharmacy\n\n7. La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume B5+ - this one was the first I got for my perioral dermatitis, didn’t really do much for me. I use it sometimes after exfoliation with acids. It’s handy in the house for minor burns or bug bites. 10 eur in the pharmacy\n\n8. Biossance Squalane + probiotic gel moisturizer - this was the product that made make the post. I wanted to try Biossance for a really long time and now that I did I’m unimpressed :( Furthermore this product is not for sensitive skin, every time I use it there a light stinging. It absorbs quickly as it’s gel, doesn’t have much of a fragrance, can’t say I enjoy it. 35 eur with discount\n\n9. Beauty of Joseon Revive Serum Snail Mucin and Ginseng - closest I got to try snail mucin :) still plan ti get to the cosrx one and see what’s the hype about. This one is ok, non irritating. Bot sure I would repurchase because of the next one. Price was 15 eur or so. \n\n10. The Ordinary Multipeptides + Copper - ok, the hype is real, it’s that good! Calms down my skin when necessary and plumps really nicely. Will repurchase. Got it with a discount for 27 eur. \n\n11. Hada Labo Premium Shirojyun Light - toner with hydroquinone. I have a bit of a melasma patch on the top of my nose, it looks like a shadow or dirt)) Tret and azelaic acid did nothing for it, so trying my luck with this one. 6-8 eur jn Japan\n\n12. Laneige Creamskin Mist - pressurised mist, gives a glowy finish, got it for traveling to hydrate skin. Was a deal, 15 eur or so, probably because of older packaging. \n\n13. The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% - all rounder, scalp, face, body. I use it sporadically, has an almost overnight effect. \n\n\n\n\n",

Is your skin so sensitive, it turns red just *thinking* about a new cleanser? Your moisture barrier is shot and you're dreading spring hayfever?\n\nI'm here to help, thanks to far too many hours spent shopping for products that my skin will tolerate.\n\nEvery product here is:\n\n* Vegan\n* Cruelty-free\n* Completely fragrance-free: no masking fragrances, \"natural\" fragrances, or essential oils\n* Free of irritating and sensitizing plant oils like lavender, thyme, citrus, and eucalyptus\n* Ragweed allergy safe: free of chamomile, feverfew, echinacea, calendula, and other ragweed flowers\n* Retinol-free\n\n**Warning for the extremely ragweed sensitive:** Certain non-ragweed ingredients can cause cross-reactions in some people with ragweed allergies. These ingredients include sunflower oil, safflower oil, watermelon seed oil, and cucumber fruit extract. I noted the products that contain these ingredients. \n\n**Products may contain other allergens, such as soy and nuts. If you have any severe allergies, read all ingredient lists carefully! No product can be safe for every allergy!**\n\nFeedback and corrections are always welcome!

    "body": "I think my methods work best with fuller coverage foundations but they can still work with light coverage depending on your needs! I use Estee Lauder Double Wear. Some of these techniques might seem labour intensive and will add time to your routine. Just use whatever works for you!\n\nBTW: though I mention various products, please use what you have and don't buy more! This is only because I have amassed a substantial collection of primers and skincare products over the years trying to make my skin look better, and I'm trying to use them up! (Also I finally ended up giving up and going on accutane which I wish I had done ages ago!)\n\n* **Prep your skin differently.** Sometimes I like to use a really sticky moisturizer (e.g. the A'PIEU Madecassoside Cica Gel) which gives my foundation a totally different finish. It's more moisturizing, dewy and adheres to the skin better. I might use oils (I like squalane and rosehip) which give a really smooth and dewy look to the face. Facemasks work to calm down angry blemishes and reduce the appearance of pores, so I like to use them on special occasions and it just makes my foundation sit more beautifully.\n* **Use different primers on different areas on their face.** Is your foundation just a bit too drying on your cheeks? Put a hydrating primer there.\n* **Mix your foundations with primer, moisturizers, toners or oils.** I have mixed my foundations with silicone-y primers when I want a lighter coverage, more airbrushed finish. Moisturizers, toners (like Hada Labo hyaluronic acid) and oils for more moisture. If you're worried the latter will make you too oily on your T zone, then skip it on just that area and use regular foundation!\n* **Use foundation as concealer on your light coverage days.** In my experience, foundation is usually more light coverage and more easily blendable than concealers. Since ELDW is so high-coverage, I can use it as a concealer.\n* **Use mismatched foundations and create a subtle, seamless contoured look with them.** I use my summer foundations which are too dark for me in areas I normally contour and blend them in. Vice versa for winter foundations in summer over the high points of my face.\n* **Try mixing foundations or using multiple foundations over different areas of your face** based on what is most appropriate for what area.\n* **Try different application methods**. I usually use a Real Techniques sponge but after watching some Korean beauty videos (e.g. [Pony's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5YK4cMKzwo)),  I've started using a flat paddle brush to apply the foundation in thin layers and then going over with a sponge at the end. I find that there is more of the foundation's \"watery-ness\" retained and the end result looks just a bit more dewy and far more natural but with the same amount of coverage. As someone with acne, large pores and acne scarring (including icepick scars), I am in love with this method and I highly recommend anyone to try it!\n* **Challenge yourself to use less foundation**. I used to use way too much foundation and concealer as that's what I saw on youtube. I looked so cakey! I used to look online for the perfect high-coverage yet uncakey foundation when turns out the problem was me. Now I challenge myself to use less foundation - about quarter pump/quarter pea sized amount. I also now follow [Lisa Eldridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwngbzv0gbY)'s recommendation of letting the less blemished areas of your skin shine through and only concentrating the coverage for where you really need it. I find that if you let your normal skin texture shine through, you come across as  wearing very little makeup.\n* **Use different powders**. So I have A LOT of powders and I actually use the majority of them now! I use Eglips Blurring powder for my areas with large pores, Mac Studio Fix powder for areas I need more coverage, and Maybelline Fit Me Loose powder for areas I want to be matte. I even mix all my powders (by dipping my brush into all 3) after watching [Hrush's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B3CWq4IBaI&list=PLW6zNYICIQlu3tB5To_lMbw1HRaW62cde&index=230) where she blended her 3 favourite powders together.\n* **Use fixing sprays and setting sprays.** I didn't use a fixing spray for the longest time because I had super oily skin and I thought Mac Fix+ was too expensive for what was basically water and glycerin. I ended up buying it in the end and I'm really enjoying it! It makes any base look more natural. Once I finish it up, I'm hoping to fill the bottle with one of my skincare toners. For setting spray, I think the Skindinavia Setting Spray is absolutely amazing. This + ELDW let me keep my makeup on during a sweaty ass rave in summer.",

It didn't even have an official sign on it, just the name and price handwritten in sharpie, so it must be super new. \n\n[Ultra Hydrating Gel Moisturizer with aloe and green tea extract](http://imgur.com/a/q6TViPm) 75ml - $8.99\n\nIt's definitely one of their more expensive cosmetics but based on the ingredients it looks pretty good for the price. Luckily TJs has a great return policy so if I don't like it I can get my money back.\n\n\nFull ingredients list:\n\nWater (aqua), glycerin, saccharide isomerate, propanediol, ammonium acryloxyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, phenoxyethanol, polyamide-5, dimethicone, hydroxyacetophenone, polysilicone-11, squalane, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, laureth-12, ceteryl olivate, glyceryl stearate, ethylhexylglycerin, sorbitan olivate, sunflower seed oil, cetearyl alcohol, lactobacillus ferment, tocopherol, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sodium hyaluronate, milk thistle extract, birch leaf extract, beta-sitosterol, panthenol, squalene, coconut fruit extract, citric acid, green tea leaf extract, sodium citrate.\n\n\nIt doesn't have a fancy smell, in fact it kind of smells like a medicinal cream like tret or hydrocortisone, but the smell dissipates on application. It's a very light gel cream and it sinks in fast. It comes in a frosted plastic jar.\n\nI am patch testing it tonight so I will update when I get to know it a little better. I'm not great at analyzing the more chemically-sounding ingredients, but I can tell that it does silicones and does not have alcohol denat, which is good for me. I was drawn to the buzzword ingredients like squalane, aloe, lactobacillus ferment, hyaluronic acid, green tea, and other extracts. If anyone has any more knowledgeable insight based on the ingredients, I would love to hear it. \n",

Aside from waiting out a \"skin cycle\", hormone variation through the month can also impact acne, so that's another reason for all of the waiting.\n\nEdit, for completeness sake: You should always have some kind of cleanser and sunscreen, those shouldn't be part of the elimination. I'd also leave in moisturizer, but if you'd rather be without one, it's not as vital as sunscreen and removing the sunscreen.

LOL Shit, I wish they supplied me with products! \n\nAnyway, Half & Half is my new favorite thing!! I’m really loving it. I do run oily, so I can use it alone during the day and be good. Or, I layer it under a heavier moisturizer at night just to amp up hydration and moisture. \n\nThe Multi Acid Milk Peel is interesting as well. I haven’t used it as frequently yet, since I just finished a procedure, so I’ve been pretty gentle and boring lately.

Been using these for a couple years). Now I’ve been using the Prequel on my face and body since January and plan on sticking with it. My skin looks and feels incredible. More hydrating than the DDG pads but still leaves that beautiful glow, pores are looking good, and my skin just looks nice and bouncy. AND it hasn’t irritated my rosacea (I also use Tret every other night). And for my body- no reappearance of KP on my legs or backs of arms, no booty acne, no ingrown hairs on my bikini line or underarms, knees and elbows are super soft, all of my skin texture in general is smooth af. And as long as it’s not crazy hot out, I can skip deodorant as long as I pat a bit of it under my arms. It’s light years better than the Ordinary acid\n\nAnd I was thinking about picking up these other two products.

    "body": "**Liquid Gold Review, or: How I learned overexfoliation is a bad thing**\n\n**TL;DR:** If your moisture barrier is damaged, this stuff will seriously change your life. Support an up-and-coming indie shop and repair your moisture barrier, all without breaking your wallet.\n\n**Background:** I recently upped my skincare game considerably through the infinite wisdom and patience of r/SkincareAddiction and r/AsianBeauty. I’ve always been both a science nerd (currently working myself through a Masters program to be a physician assistant) and a product junkie, and those two things have gloriously collided over the last few months to the benefit of my skin! The AB side bar has an excellent list of blogs, one of which I fell way down deep into is The Acid Queen. Alli, who runs the blog, is a seriously impressive DIY’er, which allowed me to get involved in her guinea pig pool for testing product formulations she was currently tinkering with. I’ve spent the last five weeks testing her moisture barrier repair moisturizer, Liquid Gold, and here are my thoughts! The formatting of these sections is shamelessly ripped from bloggers whose reviewing formats I admire: Fiddy Snails, Skin & Tonics, Fan-B, Snow, and of course, Her Majesty The Acid Queen Herself ;)\n\n**What it’s supposed to do:** Liquid Gold is a moisture barrier repair moisturizer/emulsion. (For more info on what a moisture barrier is, see Skin & Tonics excellent moisture barrier post linked in the sources.) Liquid Gold takes your thinned out, red, overexfoliated, stinging, weakened skin and makes it supple, bouncy, strong, and able to tolerate some serious heavy-lifting from acids and actives. It accomplishes all this with the magic of CERAMIDES *oooh ahhhh*\n\n**How to use it:** We’ve got two recommended options here. The first is a thin layer all over your face as the first occlusive step of…well, however many of those you have. The second is a thicker layer as a deeper moisturizing sleeping pack of sorts. I’ve been going with option 1, twice a day every day, AM and PM. Its consistency is slightly thicker than a serum, but not as thick as a gel cream or oily despite the ingredients list (more on that in a moment). It’s BRIGHT yellow-orange from the sea buckthorn, but spreads pretty easily and only leaves the tiiiiniest yellow cast after I’ve spread it in. However, my paleness makes Casper the ghost look like a tanning bed addict, so I imagine on most other skin tones it wouldn’t be visible at all. One of the things I love about this product is how quickly it dries down. I’m (gleefully) looking down the barrel at 15+ steps in my PM routine, so anywhere I don’t have to wait for dry time, I’m a happy camper. I don’t wear makeup often, but I’ve brought it out a number of days to see how Liquid Gold plays under makeup. I’m pleased to say it holds up just fine, without makeup settling into fine lines, caking, or otherwise disintegrating throughout the day.\n\n[**Here's some photos of it in action!**](http://imgur.com/a/knjp4)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Polyglyceryl-3 Methyglucose Distearate, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Seed Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Oil, Panthenol, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Squalane (olive-derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA.\n\n**Notable Ingredients:** Oh, man…all of them?! This ingredients list is STRAIGHT FIRE if we are talking moisture barrier repair. Let’s break that down, shall we? I’m going to limit my highlights because otherwise I will literally never finish this review.\n\n**Ceramide Complex** (Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP; Phytosphingosine; Cholesterol): The Beauty Brains, another fabulous “science of skincare” blog, has a great discussion of ceramides (see sources for link) and describes them so: “Ceramides form a kind of water-proofing barrier in the upper layers of skin. They’re not only critical for helping skin retain water but they also help repair the skin’s natural barrier and regulate cells. Ceramide production dwindles with age which can result in dry skin, wrinkles and even some types of dermatitis.” The other important thing to know about ceramides is that they are team players. Ceramides without fatty acids and cholesterol won’t get you very far. Specifically, ceramides penetrate best with a mixture of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% fatty acids. So maybe you’ll find a product with ceramide floating around in the ingredient list, but good luck finding one with all three players…and if you do, cross your fingers they’re in the optimal ratio. Except that’s exactly what we have in Liquid Gold. Hell yes.\n\n**Niacinamide:** Why hello, my old friend! I’ll let the Queen herself explain the wonders for niacinamide: “One of the most studied skincare ingredients, niacinamide does everything: smooths fine lines and wrinkles, increases ceramide and fatty acid synthesis, regulates skin cell turnover, fades hyperpigmentation, evens skin tone, and has powerful anti-inflammatory properties.” Naturally then, it seems like niaciamide is in errything these days, but who knows how much is in there? Niacinamide is most effective at 3-5%, so unless the percentage is disclosed, we’re left stacking niacinmide products to reach that threshhold. Liquid Gold has 4%, which happens to be the same amount you’d get if this ingredient was included in a Curology prescription. Jackpot.\n\n**Sea Buckthorn:** Again, from The Beauty Brains: “[Sea buckthorn is] known for being rich in a number of bioactive compounds, including the following: vitamins A, B1, B2, C, D, K, and P; omega 3, 6, 7, and 9; 43 lipids, organic acids, amino acids, folic acids, tocopherols, flavonoids, phenols, terpenes, tannins, [and] 20 mineral elements.” Okay…but what does all that do for your skin? Well, we’ve got some studies that show all that goodness adds up to improved wound healing, protection from UV damage, and increased collagen production (see sources for link).\n\n**Rose Hip Oil:** High in oleic and linoleic acids, both of which are polyunsaturated fatty acids important for the integrity and regeneration of skin cell membranes. More moisture barrier magic going on here, my friends.\n\n**Okay, but seriously…**everything in this ingredients list is AMAZING. And rightly so, that’s the whole idea behind DIY in the first place: if you make it yourself, you know everything is there for a reason without any fluff or fillers.\n\n**How it worked:** And here’s where the other part of the title of this post comes into play. I have a long and glorious history of overexfolating my skin because…well, basically because that’s what I thought I was supposed to do. Physical exfoliants, all sorts of acids, inappropriately high strength retinoids…I would throw them all at my face at once every single day until literally my whole top layer of skin peeled off in sheets in the shower and I was shiny and red as a cherry. Even normally gentle products would sting like the devil, and I never questioned it because I honestly thought that’s how it was supposed to work. I’d fry the life out of my skin until I couldn’t handle it (so like 3-4 straight days of all this), then take a break for a week, maybe less, and then I’d start all over again. It was a roller coaster, let me tell you, and I did this for years. \n\nThen I found this post on FutureDerm that totally blew my mind about setting a schedule for building tolerance to retinoids (see sources for link). So I mapped out my schedule for all 24 weeks and promised myself I would be patient. I went without actives for over a month, then took another crack at one night with lower strength Tazorac, my drug of choice. Disappointingly, I still peeled like a snake for the next three days, despite babying my skin before and after the Tazorac. The next week, the same thing. I was beginning to doubt the wisdom of the retinoid tolerance schedule.\n\nEnter Liquid Gold.\n\nI got on Alli’s testing list and got a bottle in the mail soon after. I am not exaggerating when I say this is literally the most amazing shit I have ever put on my face in my life. Redness starting receding within days. A night with retinoids was no longer followed with peeling, pain, redness, or stinging — all of my hallmarks of a compromised moisture barrier. I tentatively and slowly moved through increasing the frequency of the retinoid. Once, twice, three times, four times a week, two interminable week periods per increase. So far, so good. I can feel fairly confident that Liquid Gold is the responsible party here since the rest of my non-actives routine stayed stable while I was tinkering with how to reintroduce them after my hiatus. Gradually, I added all my actives back in so that now, here’s what I’ve got going on my face: 1) Tazorac 0.05% gel 4x/week; 2) Curology 0.009% tretinoin, 9% azelaic acid, 1% clindamycin every night; 3) Paula’s Choice Resist 2% BHA morning and night; 4) Timeless 20% Vitamin C+E Ferulic Acid serum (AM only).\n\nEvery time I wash my face, I think today will be the day I finally overdo it and start feeling my barrier damaged again. BUT NO. My skin feels strong, bouncy, resilient, and looks glowing. My husband pokes me in the face, nods knowingly, and declares, “Chok chok.” He’s right. Now, I’ve been throw actives at my face like there’s no tomorrow and my face takes it like a champ. Eventually, I’m hoping to add in an AHA and up my Tazorac to 0.1%, but my schedule says I’m not allowed to do that for another few months. I’m glowing like the goddamn North Star thanks to all those actives, and I can keep coming back for more thanks to the almost surreal talents of Liquid Gold.\n\nI started to panic a bit the closer I got to the end of my bottle since this was a DIY formula since I absolutely had neither time time nor inclination to whip up a batch myself and didn’t know what I would do when I ran out. The day before I was about to email Alli and beg her to keep making me some forever in exchange for my first born child, SHE OPENED HER OWN SHOP ONLINE!!! This is the best news my skin has ever had. I immediately purchased a 60 mL glass pump bottle of Liquid Gold for $24 from Stratia, The Acid Queen’s shop website. After having such a fabulous experience with this, you better believe I threw Rewind, her DMAE serum, into my cart with a quickness. \n\n**Conclusion:** This shit is my life now. It let’s me go active-crazy without unduly compromising my moisture barrier and makes my skin feel stronger than it has in my entire life. It’s affordable, pleasant to use day and/or night, well-formulated, conscientiously packaged, and made in-house by a fellow skincare junkie on the other side of the country. I couldn’t be happier to love this product and have the opportunity to support her shop.\n\n[Stratia Skin, Liquid Gold, $24](https://www.stratiaskin.com/collections/skincare/products/liquid-gold)\n\n*Disclosure: I was asked to write a review of this product that was originally intended only for Alli to read for formulation feedback and my experience with the product. I only decided to write it for public consumption when I realized she was opening the shop and other people could get this product. I did not accept the product with an agreement to review it positively, nor have I received any monetary compensation for doing so.

I tested Liquid Gold on half my face for two weeks and it didn't cause any visible changes. No increase in acne, no miraculous redness reduction. I find it very minimally moisturizing. My skin still feels dry and tight after letting it sink in (which I agree happens quickly) and I have to follow it with a heavier moisturizer (or three.) There is just a tiny amount of stickiness and little to no slip after it dries/absorbs.\n\nI, too, have been trying to find a way to use actives without over-exfoliating. Daily use of a mild BHA and AHA has proven too harsh in the past, so I've been increasing in frequency very  slowly and now I'm up to every other day with no discomfort or peeling, even when combining BHA and AHA and using my stronger products.\n\nI'm really happy with Liquid Gold and see myself using it indefinitely. The price and ingredients speak for themselves, and the packaging is really nice too. One last thing I just thought of: I was showing it to my mom and she had an irritated spot on her hand from a cut or something, so I put this on that spot and she said it was amazingly soothing.",

The gentle glide keeps your skin hydrated and moist during the night. Satin creates less friction on your skin l, resulting in less irritation and breakouts.\nI like this brand because is affordable and great satin quality.

You’re inundated with comments suggesting different things from well-meaning people, but that is overwhelming and you would do much better to see a dermatologist and have a real conversation about what you have tried, what you haven’t, and what your budget is for treating this (sometimes insurance will cover acne treatment, often it won’t). Often times the most stubborn acne needs prescription medication and a doctor’s oversight. Acne is a true medical problem requiring medical treatment, whereas this sub is mostly about how to achieve a healthy glow, reminders to wear SPF, which moisturizers are the best, and what over-the-counter products can give you the best skin possible.

My self-esteem has reached rock bottom. Tried many things but most recently my routine had included CeraVe cleanser among other things. It was the main constant I'd used whilst trying new moisturisers etc.\n\n\n\nA few weeks ago, I saw a post on here saying something along the lines of CeraVe doesn't work for everyone and that's OK.\n\nIt had never really occurred to me that it might be the problem as it's touted quite often as the Holy Grail of affordable cleansers and moisturisers. I liked how it felt, how well it cleaned my skin, and the price tag. So I was just comfortable with it.\n\nSomeone else in the comments of that post said to try squalene instead.\n\nSo on a whim I popped out to my local shop, found an affordable squalene cleanser and decided to give it a shot. My skin was so bad, I just felt like how much worse could it get to try something new.\n\n\nMy skin has improved MASSIVELY. I don't know if it was the dropping CeraVe, and I don't know if it's the use of squalene. All I know is I'm incredible grateful to that post and I wish I could remember who posted it, and the squalene suggester ❤️ for the first time in 5 years I don't feel hideous without makeup.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nEdit: I've been using squalene thinking the terms were interchangeable but apparently one is lighter than the other. The product I've found useful is squalAne.\n\nEdit 2: it was the foaming CeraVe cleanser, and the squalane I've been using is Boots own brand one (UK drugstore).",

It's even worse on the topic of tretinoin, where the gospel is still all about the \"purging period\", including auto-moderator comments endorsing this talk, and never mention that *you may have to change your routine while sloughing off the top layer of your skin.*\n\nI feel bad for every single lost soul who has a raging breakout that looks like severe skin irritation, and they're met with comments like, \"That's just purging, wait it out or tret is not for you.\" Meanwhile they're still using a daily salicylic acid face wash, AHA toners, heavy moisturizing creams, etc., because no one told them to switch to a sensitive skin routine.\n\nI developed rosacea in my late 20s and it drove me crazy because nothing worked. CeraVe was a huge problem, among other things in my routine, but not even my doctors told me that my old routine was prolonging the issue. It was just like, welp that's rosacea sorry everything burns all the time, let's try a new prescription! I eventually found Vanicream from some good folks at /r/rosacea and got into a very sensitive skin-focused routine that finally worked for me.\n\nThe long and short of it is that reddit is not a great place for advice. \"Common\" suggestions are upvoted to the top and people keep making them because well, everybody else upvoted it in the other thread, that must mean it's the right advice!

Amyris can produce these molecules at industrial scale. Amyris reprograms microorganisms to become mini biofactories capable of converting an input like sugar into a high value output like Farnesene (replacing petroleum as a source for chemicals). Amyris is the only synbio to date that has successfully scaled over 13 molecules with a 100% success rate since 2011.\n\nAll Precision Fermentation follows this process:\n\n1. **1. Strain engineering/screening (10% of the work)**\n   1. At this point, the strain can be monetized but comes with risks because Scale up and DSP are NOT proven. Companies like Ginkgo are on this stage (B2B)\n2. **Scale up fermentation (45% of the work)**\n3. **3. Down Steam Processing (45% of the work)**\n   1. At this point, ingredients can be sold in bulk + proven strain can be monetized (B2B)\n4. **4. Formulation**\n   1. At this point, white label formulas can be sold (B2B)\n5. **5. End Market**\n   1. Commercial Brand (D2C)\n6. **6. Valorization**\n   1. Companies like Amyris convert waste streams (from steps 1-3) to valuable ingredients like Bio Silica to be sold (in steps 3-5).\n\nAmyris is the only synbio that does steps 1-5 all by itself (Lab to Market) providing many advantages. Many other synbios are stuck on steps 2 and 3 which is where the real hardships are. Some synbios (like Ginkgo Bioworks) only do the 1st step and offset steps to their partners, but the reality is that *somebody* *has to deal with it*. It is my firm belief that **Synbios must go vertical before going horizontal**. Fermentation scale up and Down Stream Processing is where success is determined - do not fall for buzz words (AI, Codebase, AWS, etc.). **The reality is if a company is successful, their products will be successful in end-markets - You should be able to go to a store and purchase a product with an ingredient from your synbio.**\n\n[Synbio at a glance - Wiffle](https://preview.redd.it/4hkddycn1mo81.jpg?width=876&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfef1ca9474858d16aa5d7e3db1feb843e6b259d)\n\n**Amyris' business structure and technology came through the hardships of crossing the \"Valley of Death\".

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI've been using DECIEM products since 2015, but only just recently tried The Ordinary's Hyaluronic Acid +B5 and am truly impressed. This led me to compare my current budget-friendly routine with more expensive ones that included NIOD products in the past (albeit, I still use some from time to time).\n\n**Background**: I started getting into skincare about a decade ago, my spendings gradually grew over the years, so did the space all the products took up in my apartment and travel bags. Due to leaving my job, travelling a lot and living in places with limited access to skincare, I reduced my budget (mostly just using what I already had) a few years ago and decided to keep it rather low since I am happy with the results.\n\n**My skin type & circumstances**: normal or oily/dehydrated (depends on your definition). I currently live in a place with rather high humidity and I'm in the middle of a long, hot summer. If I didn't use any skincare at all, my skin would have a rough texture and be shiny most of the time. Without sunscreen it would be always red and irritated. I get dry patches occassionally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHydration - Hyaluronic Acid\n\n**NIOD MMHC vs. TO Hyaluronic Acid +B5**\n\nMMHC is a thin, slightly yellow-ish serum. Sinks in quickly, leaves skin a bit tacky (did not bother me though). A few years ago I traveled with only MMHC as hydration, to the place where I live right now, and my skin was so unbearably tense I ended up buying The Inkey List's Hyaluronic Acid, which quenched my skin's thirst. Some time ago I won a DECIEM kit and it included MMHC, so I tried it again in the past few weeks, but while I did not feel tense, I also did not feel that it added much (or anything?) in terms of hydration. I also had a feeling that it made me break out.\n\nEnter The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid + B5: I was a bit scared after reading mixed reviews that did not recommend it for oily skin as it \"doesn't sink in\" and has a \"tacky finish\" - not my experience at all! It is indeed more of a gel than a watery-serum, but in my case it sinks in within seconds and leaves my skin looking incredibly hydrated, glowing (in a healthy way, not greasy or anything) and the finish is quite natural, velvety, no tackiness whatsoever. It also works beautifully with TO's Vit C and Niacinamie Powder, or just the Niacinamide Serum mixed in or on top.\n\nWinner: **TO Hyaluronic Acid**, both in terms of costs and results.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Copper) Peptides\n\n**NIOD CAIS (& CAIL) vs. TO Buffet (+Copper)**\n\nNIOD's CAIS (the original formula) was the first product that intrigued me of the brand and it made me fall in love with the company. Despite the price tag, I've gifted it to numerous people. It instantly healed any wounds, kept inflammation, redness and shine of all kinds at bay, and cleared the acne I had back then. All while being thinner than water and getting absorbed faster than you can apply it (I only use 2 drops - not droplets, drops. One on the index finger, the other on the middle finger. Quickly swipe over the face and that's it). It was a truly miraculous product. The consequent versions are not quite as good, in my opinion, but still among the best skincare products I know. I tried CAIL too, it's not too greasy but for my skintype, the CAIS formula is much preferable and I felt like I got better results, too. The 0.5oz/15ml bottle lasts 2-3 months for me, while it took me around 5 or so to finish the same amount of CAIL.\n\nTO's Buffet + Copper is alright. It's more of a gel, the finish is slightly tacky, it definitely does not help with shine or acne (in my case, of course). I've used in for several years but I only liked the results when I combined it with TO's Sea Buckthorn Oil, which is only possible if you are willing to sleep on a towel. I still like to apply it to small injuries and sun burns, it definitely helps. The version without the Copper Peptides is a bit nicer to use, but with almost 0 benefits for me personally.\n\nI can't comment on any anti-aging benefit of either.\n\nWinner: **NIOD CAIS**, it's worth the money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClarifying Masks\n\n**NIOD Flavanone Mud (FM) / Mastic Must (MM) vs. TO Salicylic Acid 2% Mask**\n\nNIOD FV is an especially weird product - fun to try. Intense red/brown color and smells strongly of pepperoni/salami. Fine while applied, but taking it off with water causes a burning sensation that only ceases once I dry my skin with a towel. Curiously, there is never any visible irritation or redness, and no discomfort upon applying any other products afterwards. I do not remember any specific result other than a slight fear of using it again (I did, though, but not too regularly).\n\nNIOD MM is also a unique product, doesn't delivery any particular benefits to my skin either, but doesn't cause any pain, at least. It's an earthy smelling cream, a very creamy cream, that leaves a film behind after rinsing. It does not affect the amount of shine on my face at all, whether I use a hair dryer or not. I do not like the way it feels on my skin.\n\nTO's Salicylic Acid mask is quite strong - I can feel it after a few minutes. It has a very intense black colour and, as typical for mud masks, isn't the easiest to rinse off (the NIOD masks did/do rinse easily). It makes my skin look better instantly, cleaner, more soft, a bit rosy - but not red, I enjoy the effect. Not a necessity but especially when I can't exfoliate regularly it's a life saver. Due to my non-regular use, the large bottle lasts me an entire year.\n\nWinner: **TO Salicylic Acid 2% Mask** due to its effectiveness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCleansers\n\n**NIOD LVCE & SS vs. TO Squalane Cleanser**\n\nNIOD offers two cleansing products, LVCE to clean oil-based products and SS as a second step.\n\nLVCE works really well, it's less oily than an actual oil and dissolves absolutely everything as long as you apply it on dry skin first. It is a bit difficult to rinse, so I prefer to only use it when I step in the shower. A bottle lasts me almost a year so it's quite alright budget-wise.\n\nSS is an earthy smelling paste. I have used several tubes over the years and am still not sure whether I like it. I don't dislike it, that's for sure, and Brandon sure knew how to sell it (to me, at least). It doesn't do anything particular though. I go through them super slowly, it's not my standard 2nd cleanser, I just use it on 2-4 days per week in the AM. My current tube is a couple years old already.\n\nTO Squalane Cleanser: I did not like this one much. It's alright as a 1-step solution for travelling, but I felt like I needed a lot of product, it didn't clean well, and it was hard to empty the bottle. If you look at the volume and price, and especially the high amount you need, it ends up being much more expensive than the NIOD options.\n\nWinner: **NIOD LVCE**. It works, and it actually isn't expensive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants\n\n**NIOD Survival vs. TO EUK**\n\nNOD Survival is a liquid serum with a red to brownish colour. I like the smell. It helps the skin visibly recover after being exposed to the sun all day. I usually use about half a bottle during summer, when it's too hot for TO's EUK.\n\nTO EUK - I chose this one as it's my favorite option from The Ordinary; I don't like the others much. It's a single ingredient dissolved in Propanediol. Not the nicest formula but it works. It helps with inflammation and irritation, although it may sting upon application on sensitized skin. I wake up to clearer, calmer skin when I use it. I use about half a bottle (2 drops per day) during winter.\n\nWinner: **both**. I love EUK more, simply because of Brandon's excitement back in the day, but they're both equally good and unique.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Toner\"\n\n**NIOD SDSM vs. TO Marine Hyaluronics**\n\nNIOD SDSM comes in a large spray bottle and has a slightly blue hue. I didn't like it at first, despite feeling (and looking) like water, it leaves behind some tackiness, and the first version somehow irritated the skin on my face. But since I use it to wet my face before applying hyaluronic acid, I'm sold.\n\nTO Marine Hyaluronics are hydrating, feel and look like water, but have a somewhat weird smell. The small bottle is great for travelling. It's not as hydrating as hyaluronic acid, but still good. No tackiness whatsoever, sinks in quickly. Best kept in the fridge during summer.\n\nWinner: **NIOD SDSM** \\- it's cheaper by volume, and comes in a spray bottle. Also, it's blue(-ish).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoisturizer\n\n**NIOD HV vs. TO NMF**\n\nNIOD's Hydation Vaccine feels like a light, somewhat wet, yellow-ish silicone primer. It glides on effortlessly, the finish is velvety matte but super comfortable. No tackiness whatsoever, it's an entirely undetectable product, perfect for when you don't want to look like you use moisturizer (or anything else). Due to the texture/ingredients, it has somewhat of a blurring effect, making the skin look better immediately. But, when i do get shiny, I have the impression it shows even more with this on. I don't like the packaging though. The jar is not practical to use, and the tube is just huge, I've been using the current one since 2020. It's rather hydrating, less moisturizing. Good for normal to oily skin I presume. Not the best option during cold winters with heating in my opinion. If it was cheaper, I'd probably use it year round, but as things are, I use it for certain occassions (when people see me without sunscreen/make up...) and when I feel like it. It does make for \"juicy\" looking skin when combined with a heavier moisturizer.\n\nTO's Natural Moisturizing Factors are totally, entirely different. It's a light, somewhat dry, white-ish cream. Not moist or wet- dry. It gets absorbed so quickly, it's difficult to apply, it absolutely doesn't \"glide\". It has no silicones, it does not mattify or blur. There can be a slight tackiness, though that depends mostly on what I use beneath it. Even when absorbed and not tacky, you can feel it when touching your skin. It glides less. It's not velvety. The finish looks very natural too, rather matte, it definitely does not add oil or shine. I actually get less shiny when using this. It's my preferred moisturizer during summer. The tubes are ok, the 100ml one will probably also last me a couple of years (have only been using it for a little over a year, nowhere near finishing the bottle), the smaller size is good for travelling.\n\nWinner: **TO's NMF**, by a slight margin, it's more versatile and cheaper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Exfoliation\"\n\n**NIOD NAAP vs. TO SA 2%, LA 5% and MA 10%**\n\nNIOD's Non-Acid Acid-Percursor (NAAP) promises to deliver the same results as acidic acids without the irritation. They never did fully explain their reasoning behind their opposition to acids, but of course I had to try this alternative approach, especially because I had experienced somewhat similar results (softer, clearer skin) with certain non-acid ingredients (namely, ferments and peptides). And... I am not sure. I think I used 3 bottles over time, sometimes I was sure it was working, other times I got frustrated because it wasn't. My plan was to use it during summer, but the truth is, I have a half full/emtpy bottle in the bath that I haven't touched in months. It's a no for me.\n\nThe Ordinary's acids - I've tried all, but love none of them. The new (current) version of the Salicylic Acid 2% works just fine, it's watery and only slightly sticky, pretty potent, too. I use it 2-3 times per week and usually that's enough. The Lactic Acid at is a nice humectant, but at 5% too weak and at 10% too strong for my skin. It's also not fully transparent, a little yellow, and the ph is quite high (over 4). The Mandelic Acid is 10% dissolved in Propanediol, which makes it somewhat oily to apply. It's quite weak too, and not as moisturizing as the Lactic Acid. Regarding acids, I prefer other brands.\n\nWinner: **TO's Salicylic Acid 2%**, because it's the only product out of those that exfoliates with certainty and works well for my skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are a few more categories where I have only tried one brand, so I cannot compare them. Maybe someone can add their experiences regarding Vitamin C, Sunscreen, Eyes, brightening etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince Hylamide has been discontinued, I have not included them in this review. The only product of that line that I miss (albeit, still use...) is the HA Blur primer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't exclusively use DECIEM products, but many of their products are my staples. I can build an entire routine out of them, but I enjoy switching it up a little and not have all my bottles look the same.",

You can also post in the weekly help thread - it's stickied to the top of the sub every week! Here are our tops tips for avoiding peeling:\n\n- Make sure your skin is completely dry when you apply tretinoin. Wet skin increases absorption and flaking!\n- Make sure your routine is hydrating enough. Hydrating toners like those from Hada Labo can really help (Premium is the most popular since it has urea and 5 sizes of hyaluronic acid and is incredibly hydrating). /r/asianbeauty has lots of other recs. \n- A konjac sponge is a very gentle form of physical exfoliation that can really help!\n- A good moisturizer is key. Vanicream Lite, and Cerave are popular options. \n- Vaseline or Aquaphor on top of your tret at night can also really help prevent dryness. Pat on a very thin layer gently - don't slather it, just apply a thin layer.\n- Oil cleansing can work for many as a way to gently remove the excess skin. Get an emulsifying oil cleanser that will wash off easily.\n- Consider skipping a night of tret if you have lots of peeling. Yes that may slow down your progress by a few days but a damaged moisture barrier can take months to recover. Go slow. Skincare is a marathon. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She's claiming that the \"sensitive 6\" are the sole reason why people suffer from sensitivity, acne, and chronic skin conditions such as eczema, rosacea, etc. and kept harping on the \"fact\" that everyone's skin is the same. uhm WHAT!!!! cancelled. I couldn't even believe a skin care owner thinks of this. I then wonder why the brand has a bunch of products targeted for dull skin, acne-prone skin, dry skin, etc. if apparently, these conditions don't really exist according to the owner?? Not to mention their bizarre attacks that just scream petty, to other skincare brands.\n\nAnyways, besides DE I also cancelled Mario Badescu for an even more dangerous scandal: undisclosing steroids in their ingredients for the Healing Cream. So many ppl got TSW after that and as someone who has experienced that due to my severe facial eczema, I'm disgusted at how MB has done this to the general consumer population. Gross! Cancelled for life.\n\nBesides, DE is way too overpriced and MB products aren't even that good. Looks like I'm sticking to DECIEM all the way: Canadian, ethically-priced, offers free skin consultations, doesn't pay influencers to sponsor them, and most importantly, tries to inform the consumer of what their products and ingredients actually do! They're honest in their approach and even tell people not to try certain products due to their skin conditions, whereas DE is pushing all their products to everyone because their skin is all the same lol. I just hope DECIEM doesn't follow down the same rabbit hole that happened to Paula's Choice...\n\nEDIT re: Paula's Choice  \nNothing scandalous has happened with Paula's Choice, but basically the owner appears to have sold out to a bigger company and she's not involved in the company anymore. And ever since then, they started to price hike their products while simultaneously lowering the product volume. It's gone from a fairly affordable brand to a semi-upscale one. Their products are very well-formulated, however they're out of my price range now unfortunately.\n\nSince DECIEM received a hefty investment from Estee Lauder, I was basically thinking the same path might happen to them: they may end up increasing TO prices one day after they captured a huge loyal following, which includes me. I noticed their latest products (Squalane Cleanser and Salicylic Masque) are on the higher-end of their price spectrum. I hope they can break that trend with their new products",

It's so wasteful and confusing for consumers.

He was super problematic, and he never had a full stock of anything. It would take months to get anything back in stock. Personally when I’m buying skincare I want something I can count on getting again and TO wasn’t reliable enough. Now that Estée Lauder bought them out things have been in stock, there’s been little to no drama with the company and I haven’t noticed any price difference in the items I buy. \n\n But I agree with the others- drunk elephant, Sunday Riley, glossier, I just don’t think it’s worth the price. I got a the birthday sample from Sephora of the drunk elephant martini or whatever moisturizer and it burned my skin. I don’t have particularly sensitive skin either. Also I’m cheap as hell and I struggle to spend more than $30 on any skincare product. I have one moisturizer right now that was $40 and I like it enough but I don’t think it’s worth the price so I won’t repurchase it.",

Their holier-than-thou attitude irritates me to no end and the products are wildly overpriced. The entire “clean beauty” brigade needs to be binned tbh, the term doesn’t actually mean anything concrete and it’s used as a marketing ploy to vilify other brands. \n\nSunday Riley is another overpriced shit show, £85 for a concoction of essential oils and dyes, REALLY?! And whole fake review scandal, I mean I know other brands probably do it too, but forcing your employees to leave positive reviews shows you don’t believe in your product and you don’t care about your customers. There’s no way that their products will work for absolutely everyone so you’re lying while also saying “give us your money, we don’t care if you have a reaction to the product”. \n\nOtherwise I avoid things badly packaged or badly formulated. Creams in jars for example - what a terrible idea, it’s unsanitary and the product will expire much faster as it’s exposed to air (looking at you La Mer). Anything with fragrance or SLS - nope nope nope. Fashion and makeup brands that go into skincare like Dior are bad for that kind of stuff, I stay far away. \n\nI love Deciem though too, and I really hope their success doesn’t get to them. I wouldn’t mind paying more if they changed their packaging (the current packaging isn’t recyclable but it’s cheap to make) because their products are just that damn good. I love how open and genuine they are as a company too, I don’t feel like they’re out to get me and my money, I feel like they genuinely want to bring skincare science to the masses.",

Most people honestly can’t think for themselves (this isn’t directed at the OP) and see a video by Hyram or Cass and agree with everything they have to say word for word-when they weren’t even a DE customer to begin with. There’s such a bizarre hate campaign against DE. What’s funny to me, is why do all these people want dupes of their products if they hate them so much 😂 no disrespect to anyone, just my opinion. \n\nI also don’t “cancel” brands because of petty drama. There has to be something substantial. Deva Curl is a brand I no longer use (right now) because people were literally loosing hair from the products. I’m willing to give them a second chance once this is resolved pending the outcome. I also have naturally wavy hair -so it’s not a huge loss to me because I rotate shampoos anyways. \n\nI agree with a lot of you regarding the ordinary. My favorite item lately is their squalane -just such a high performer for me. If you haven’t tried it- I highly recommend it !",

These ingredients include sunflower oil, safflower oil, watermelon seed oil, and cucumber fruit extract. Also, bisabolol/levonemol is often derived from chamomile and could cause reactions. I noted the products that contain these ingredients.\n\n**Products may contain other allergens, such as soy and nuts. If you have any severe allergies, read all ingredient lists carefully!

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",
