        "body": "For those not familiar with concrete, it typically is made from gravel, sand, cement, and water.  The water turns the cement powder into interlocking crystals that bind the other ingredients together.\n\nThere are a lot of recipes for concete, but the typical \"ordinary Portland Cement\" concrete is made with a cement that starts with about 5 parts limestone to 1 part shale.  These are burned in a high temperature kiln, which converts them chemically to a product that reacts with water.\n\nLots of other materials will do this too.  The ancient Romans dug up rock that had been burned by a volcano near Pozzolana, Italy.  The general category is thus called \"Pozzolans\". Coal furnace ash and blast furnace slag are also rocks that have been burned.  They have long been used as partial replacements for Portland Cement.  Rich husk ash and brick dust are other, less common, alternative cements.\n\nNote: Natural coal isn't pure carbon.  It has varying amounts of rock mixed in with it. That's partly because the coal seams formed that way, and partly because the mining process sometimes gets some of the surrounding bedrock by accident.\n\nPortland Cement got its name because the concrete it makes resembled  the natural stone quarried in Portland, England at the time.",

        "body": "A large forgotten component of how environmentally friendly a new concrete formula can be is transport. All three of the specialty ingredients are likely from somewhere not local, which is a big part of the cost of concrete. Also, the last time I read about using burned/charred fiber materials, there was a positive effect only up to about 5%, then it killed compressive strength rapidly.  We looked into using something similar from a wood saw mill, that burned their sawdust for their kilns, creating a char material. \n\nAlso is the limestone crushing waste further processed at all, like sieving for particle sizes? Product uniformity is a major requirement in concrete, which requires exacting standards of reliable, repeatable results. And finally, silica sand is just like saying \"sand sand.\" Sand is mostly made up of siliceous quartz, but often with a wide variety of other durable minerals mixed into it. Does this mean they need a pure silica sand? If so that is major processing and again, specialized production. \n\nConcrete almost always reflects the availability of local, generic materials. Distance to source quarries is so important, I find that most plants are just down the road from one. Diesel is not cheap, and most cement is brought in from central rail locations for distribution. There will always be someone willing to pay the extra cost for super specialty applications (see mixes for nuclear waste storage), but economy of the product will always be the drive for 99% of concrete.",

Various formulas can provide a fairly broad range of compressive strength, its chief advantage.\n\nCracking...it's what concrete does under stress loading.  As one first tier structural engineer said, \"it has the tensile strength of blue cheese.\"  Not quite so bad.\n\nIf you've ever been on a construction site involving masonry you might have noticed experienced masons cracking bricks in half with a quick sharp blow on a brick chisel, resulting in a fairly clean edge at the break.  Homogenous material does that.  Aggregated material also can be split though with rougher edges...the cement cracks, the stone aggregate mostly doesn't.  Same with terra cotra floor tiles, aided with a scored line at the desired point.\n\nDepending on the width, depth, and location of the concrete crack, the situation at best might be merely annoying or something more serious.  That said all cracks exposed to weather conditions allowing water to enter, especailly in climates subject to freezing temperatures or salt water spray ultimately cause corrosion of the steel reinforcing members, leading to a weaken of the structure over time...which can be years, less if the stresses are of a larger magnitude.\n\nWhat the brief PR release also doesn't mention is the effect of the new formula on transferred impact energy.  Does the resilience dampen the frequency of energy transmission throughout the structure?  Would be very interesting to see the data of physical charteristics under the massive military effects, which seem to be the main point of the research.  \n\nVery interesting but otherwise, it seems to be a third world solution where cost of fiberglass reinforcing is a cost consideration...or are there vast secret coconut plantations in the Russian Federation of which western intelligent services are unaware.    Show us full scale test mock ups of bridges, bunkers, etc....tested to destruction as all current systems have endured.",

I’ve been a social and economic activist for many years, and I heard that he was at this town hall, just minutes after I got off work. I left in such a hurry that I didn’t even have money for the toll -- I had to leave an IOU instead. I was desperate to speak to him because my community had suffered so much, and I held onto the hope that he would hear me. Instead of cooking dinner for my youngest son, yet again, I went on a mission to beg for my children’s future. I wanted them to have clean water, clean air, and a stable economic future. I was especially frustrated because the most-polluting coal baron in West Virginia, Jim Justice, became my Democratic Governor. His mountaintop removal coal-mining operation is just three miles from my house, and continues to put silica dust in the air and my childrens’ lungs daily.\n\n---\n\n###When I approach my Senator, I told him about the water pollution, air pollution, and the fact that I buried most of my family because of coal mining with diseases like black lung and cancer. I told him that we all deserved clean and safe jobs. \n\n---\n\n“We would have to agree to disagree” he told me, as he tried to bid the coal miners in the crowd against me. When I told him about my family dying, he turned to them and said they needed jobs -- as if that was more important than their own safety, and their families and surrounding communities being poisoned and dying.\n\nNot only did he act like he was immune to my struggle as a coal miner’s daughter, he tried to divide and turn our community against one another. We shouldn’t have to fight each other for basic human rights like clean water, clean air and have access to jobs to provide for our families.Little did Joe know that the coal miners in the crowd met and stood with me afterwards, and we talked about real solutions -- not just slogans.\n\nA month earlier, Sen. Manchin taunted voters to kick him out of office if they didn’t like what he was up to. “What you ought to do is vote me out. Vote me out! I’m not changing. Find somebody else who can beat me and vote me out,” he said. So, after my encounter with the Senator, I decided to take him up on his challenge -- I was going to take his seat from him, and return representation to the people of West Virginia.\n\nLike most of my generation I was born a coal miner’s daughter and granddaughter. I have lived most of my life watching the progression and regression of coal. I have witnessed\nfirst-hand the impact it has on our health and communities. I have in lived poverty and in prosperity. I have tasted polluted water. I have enjoyed some of the cleanest water in the world -- that no longer exists. I have dealt with the suffering of burying family members far too soon and too young. I have lived in cancer-clustered communities. I live with the worry that my children will get cancer. I have watched my neighbors suffer on their way to the same fate. I can’t help but feel overwhelmed with the frustration of what will happen to the people of Appalachia.\n\nThe promise of coal means more pollution, more cancer, and more black lung. The companies are still blowing up our mountains, burying our streams, destroying our heritage and devaluing our quality of life. We have no promise of a stable economic future with the market for coal being down. It has always been an unreliable and unstable economic resource. As many communities are forced to live in conditions comparable to a third-world country, people fear how they are going to provide for their families. No man or woman should have to choose between poisoning one child and feeding another.\n\nIt’s past time to end the fear that divides us. We need to start standing up for each other. There are alternatives. We can invest in a diverse economy. I, for one, don’t want my children to\ninherit the struggles that we have had to endure. \n\nI’m proud to be a [Justice Democrat](http://www.justicedemocrats.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) and a [Brand New Congress](http://www.brandnewcongress.org?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) candidate. That means I take $0 in corporate donations or PAC money. Zero. I rely on 100% individual small donors. I’ve watched how corporate money can twist even good politicians. I watched it happen to Sen. Manchin. I voted for him, long ago -- but I no longer recognize that man I voted for.

Just put few silica sachets under your windshield. They will absorb the moisture, leaving your windshield clear.\n\n~ Keep Dry Goods Dry -  it can help keep foods like dried herbs, bread crumbs, crackers, and anything else that should be kept as crispy as possible from getting soggy.

I get called to a young mother's house who, in a panic, informs me her teenage son ingested one of those packets.  I tell her no worries, he'll just have diarrhea and keep him hydrated.  She was initially impressed that we \"must have to know all sorts of poisons and remedies, etc.\" I informed her that no, i just ate one recently and know first hand.  Her intial awe at my knowledge quickly turned to disdain and she called poison control herself to confirm.

Immediately my mouth parched as if under a hundred Saharan suns, my lips and teeth seized together without moisture. Pulling off of hwy 40, trying to cough and spit to no avail, I pry my lips open and start pouring water in. Felt like death, the little desiccant balls where stuck all over the inside of my mouth and it took all day to work them all loose, leaving painful little pocks allover. Re examination of the packet revealed it to be brightly and appetizingly colored. Never again. I do still love nori though!",

    "body": "#[I’m Paula Jean Swearengin, and I’m running for US Senate in West Virginia.](http://imgur.com/aOLgDTv)\n\n---\n\nBarely five months ago, I was standing at a town hall where Joe Manchin was supposed to be listening to his constituents in Charleston, West Virginia. I’ve been a social and economic activist for many years, and I heard that he was at this town hall, just minutes after I got off work. I left in such a hurry that I didn’t even have money for the toll -- I had to leave an IOU instead. I was desperate to speak to him because my community had suffered so much, and I held onto the hope that he would hear me. Instead of cooking dinner for my youngest son, yet again, I went on a mission to beg for my children’s future. I wanted them to have clean water, clean air, and a stable economic future. I was especially frustrated because the most-polluting coal baron in West Virginia, Jim Justice, became my Democratic Governor. His mountaintop removal coal-mining operation is just three miles from my house, and continues to put silica dust in the air and my childrens’ lungs daily.\n\n---\n\n###When I approach my Senator, I told him about the water pollution, air pollution, and the fact that I buried most of my family because of coal mining with diseases like black lung and cancer. I told him that we all deserved clean and safe jobs. \n\n---\n\n“We would have to agree to disagree” he told me, as he tried to bid the coal miners in the crowd against me. When I told him about my family dying, he turned to them and said they needed jobs -- as if that was more important than their own safety, and their families and surrounding communities being poisoned and dying.\n\nNot only did he act like he was immune to my struggle as a coal miner’s daughter, he tried to divide and turn our community against one another. We shouldn’t have to fight each other for basic human rights like clean water, clean air and have access to jobs to provide for our families.Little did Joe know that the coal miners in the crowd met and stood with me afterwards, and we talked about real solutions -- not just slogans.\n\nA month earlier, Sen. Manchin taunted voters to kick him out of office if they didn’t like what he was up to. “What you ought to do is vote me out. Vote me out! I’m not changing. Find somebody else who can beat me and vote me out,” he said. So, after my encounter with the Senator, I decided to take him up on his challenge -- I was going to take his seat from him, and return representation to the people of West Virginia.\n\nLike most of my generation I was born a coal miner’s daughter and granddaughter. I have lived most of my life watching the progression and regression of coal. I have witnessed\nfirst-hand the impact it has on our health and communities. I have in lived poverty and in prosperity. I have tasted polluted water. I have enjoyed some of the cleanest water in the world -- that no longer exists. I have dealt with the suffering of burying family members far too soon and too young. I have lived in cancer-clustered communities. I live with the worry that my children will get cancer. I have watched my neighbors suffer on their way to the same fate. I can’t help but feel overwhelmed with the frustration of what will happen to the people of Appalachia.\n\nThe promise of coal means more pollution, more cancer, and more black lung. The companies are still blowing up our mountains, burying our streams, destroying our heritage and devaluing our quality of life. We have no promise of a stable economic future with the market for coal being down. It has always been an unreliable and unstable economic resource. As many communities are forced to live in conditions comparable to a third-world country, people fear how they are going to provide for their families. No man or woman should have to choose between poisoning one child and feeding another.\n\nIt’s past time to end the fear that divides us. We need to start standing up for each other. There are alternatives. We can invest in a diverse economy. I, for one, don’t want my children to\ninherit the struggles that we have had to endure. \n\nI’m proud to be a [Justice Democrat](http://www.justicedemocrats.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) and a [Brand New Congress](http://www.brandnewcongress.org?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) candidate. That means I take $0 in corporate donations or PAC money. Zero. I rely on 100% individual small donors. I’ve watched how corporate money can twist even good politicians. I watched it happen to Sen. Manchin. I voted for him, long ago -- but I no longer recognize that man I voted for. It also means I support the [Brand New Congress platform](https://brandnewcongress.org/platform?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801), including Medicare for All, free public higher and vocational education, and moving to an expanded economy for West Virginia and America, based on renewable energy.\n\n**Social Media Links**:\n\n[Website](https://brandnewcongress.org/paulajean) | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/paulajean2018) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paulajean2018)\n\n**Info Links**:\n\n[Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Paula_Jean_Swearengin) | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Jean_Swearengin)\n\n**Other Important Links**:\n\n\n* /r/JusticeDemocrats\n* /r/BrandNewCongress\n* /r/Swearengin4Senate\n\n[Donate to my campaign.](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/paulajean2018?refcode=0801_reddit_ama&amount=27.00) | [Sign up to volunteer.](https://now.brandnewcongress.org/act?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) | [Platform](https://brandnewcongress.org/platform?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801)\n\n",

Joe Manchin may not be perfect, but he can win in the state. He held firm on the fight to resist repealing ACA. If he were not there, and a Republican were in instead, as I see it, the most likely alternative to  that singular conservative Democrat in West Virginia, that fight would have been lost.\n\nThe article states:\n\n> All told, the chance of a non-incumbent Democrat winning a Senate seat in West Virginia in 2018 is probably somewhere between 1 percent and 2 percent\n\nWould it be great to have somebody in there with big ideas who was progressive? Absolutely. Is that realistic?

There were bigger problems in that race. I promise to never run a TV ad where I say I am not a witch.

Otherwise we will end up with a party that is a permanent minority clustered in a few States with no hope of governing. The result of that is that the GOP will (attempt to) govern, and that will (since you believe in liberal policy goals) be a Bad Thing™.\n\nManchin is not perfect. But he will caucus with the Dems and vote for their candidate to be Majority Leader in the Senate. Even if that's the only thing he could do, that's huge. The Majority Leader sets the agenda, controls bills, controls reconciliation and has enormous power. The majority party in the Senate appoints a majority in the committees and to the House/Senate negotiating team. \n\nWest Virginia has voted red in the last 5 presidential elections. In 2016, it voted Trump 68%-27%. The fact that we even have a Dem Senator from that State is mathematically crazy. The fact that, if he were not there, the \"health care\" bill would have passed is testament to the power that a single member can have.\n\nSo here we are: we have half a liberal.

It is always important to prioritize our safety and well-being by following instructions and warnings that are based on facts and supported by evidence.\n\nTherefore, it is recommended that you do not eat silica gel packets, and instead, dispose of them properly in the trash.

    "body": "Bed bugs have a reputation of being difficult to deal with, but a lot of that stems from common misinformation you will find online, and also because many products sold to kill them simply don't work. For example, some people say to use ultra sonic pest repellents, bed bugs don't have ears. They have also largely developed immunity to the chemicals used in sprays and foggers. In fact, University of Rutgers Entomologist Dr. Wang, considered an expert on the topic of bed bugs, predicts 100% of bed bugs will be immune to them within 10 years. \n\n**So what actually works?**\n\nThe good news is there are still a couple methods that work very well, and the better news is that you don't have to spend much to get them. \n\n**For the bed bugs you *can't* see, *Diatomaceous Earth*.**\n\nDiatomaceous Earth is inexpensive, and is composed of silica. Silica will stick to bed bugs and draw moisture out of their bodies, dehydrating them to death. It also has the added benefit of transferring from one bed bug to another on contact, meaning when they walk back to their hidey-hole, it will transfer to bed bugs that might not have needed to leave to feed for a few weeks, and kill them as well. And since it dehydrates them, they will never develop an immunity to it.\n\nAnd with Diatomaceous Earth, a little goes a long, long way. When applying it in their foot path, a light dusting is all that is needed. Making piles of it only encourages them to find other ways of getting to where they want to be.\n\n**For the bed bugs you *can* see, *heat*.**\n\n122 degrees Fahrenheit, or 50 degrees Celsius. Once they are exposed to that temperature, they die immediately. So a simple steamer can kill all the bed bugs that have found hiding spots that are more easily accessible, such as on the mattress or in the bed frame. And like D.E., heat is also something that they will never become immune to.\n\nThese two methods of eradication aren't going to be a single application process. The Diatomaceous Earth in this experiment had a 90% mortality rate at 10 days, so it may require a few weeks. It will also benefit greatly by being paired with a rigorous cleaning regimen, such as more frequent sheet washing in hot water, and dried on the hot setting, as well as frequent sweeping and vacuuming(and don't forget to empty the bag immediately after). So while it will involve some work, the alternatives can be costly, which can include companies that come to your home to make the entire interior reach temperatures that kill the bed bugs, and cost thousands of dollars to do so.\n\n**What is the evidence these methods work?**\n\nYoutuber Mark Rober recently made an in depth video on some experiments, which was overseen by entomologist Dr. Wang at Rutgers University, so you can see the results yourself!\n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/2JAOTJxYqh8?t=460) is the setup for the experiment. You only need to watch 2 minutes from the beginning of this link to see the entire setup, variables, controls, etc.\n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/2JAOTJxYqh8?t=888) are the results of the experiment. You only need to watch 2 minutes and 12 seconds to see the entire result.\n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/2JAOTJxYqh8?t=1023) is how the Diatomaceous Earth and heat work to kill the bed bugs. You only need to watch one minute of this link to see how effective they are.\n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/2JAOTJxYqh8?t=1097) are some tips on how to prevent bringing them into your home. You only need to watch 1 minute from this point in the video to learn them all.\n\nAnd finally, [here](https://youtu.be/2JAOTJxYqh8?) is the link to the entire ~24 minute video, if you just feel like learning more about bed bugs.",

(Crossfire from MGK) \n\nI also do not advocate for heat treatments, except in the most dire of infestations, and even then I still follow with cimexa and a chemical application. The reason being is heat treatments are HIGHLY dependent on how well the prep work is done, and what harborages the BBs have already made it in to. Merely doing a heat treatment alone runs risk of bbs reinfesting from wall voids or the pile of magazines forgotten under the dresser, the floor of the closet who's door you forgot to open, etc.\n\nCurrently I work in a largish city and I exclusively service multi family housing, and perform multiple bed bug services each and every day.",

All I can suggest is to whipe a minimal amount of a type of oil or WD-40 (look up and understand the WD) on the tooling and any chrome plated shit dont worry about. After about 15 years I never had anything rust up bad enough to even be a problem except for feeler gauges and other precision tooling, but basic hand tooling should be fine or at most\nminor cleaning, I hope any of this could help someone.

Think even of a more human timescale - will people know how to open a PDF in 100 years? an MP4 movie? Even if it's plain text - will people still be using unicode? Heck, with future technologies, will people even be familiar with binary any more? I have no doubt that any of these things would be *recoverable*, if not easy in 100 years... but at some point that recovery work starts looking incredibly difficult - in 1000 years, people could probably work back the plain text like it's a lost language, but any more complicated format might just be too opaque if we lose certain key information about how the formats work.\n\nThis has beaten a pretty important part of the problem, though - entropy. These have some pretty easy physical requirements to maintain their information over time - compare to something like LTO tape (a pretty common bulk cold-storage option even today), which even if maintained in perfect conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.) can only probably last 30 years. A modern enterprise SSD by comparison is only rated to hold its data for about 3 months off-power (in reality it can *probably* make it more like 5 years). It's a constant effort to try to stave off entropy ruining your information, but this technology at least makes it so you're fighting anthropology and not physics, at least for a long while.",

All you need to do to refresh them is put them in the oven at about 250-300°f for an hour or so and they'll be good as new.\n\nI keep a small airtight jar and any time I buy a pair of shoes or electronics or anything that includes silica gel beads I save them. It's not that often that they come in handy, but once every month or so I thank myself for having them.",

    "body": "This iron *Lava Chicken* was made by melting iron using an ordinary microwave oven.\n\nFor those who haven’t heard about it—yes, you can melt metals in a regular microwave oven. It works thanks to the silicon carbide crucibles I use. These crucibles absorb microwaves and convert them into heat, allowing us to melt metal. I won’t go into the full details here.\n\nFirst, I 3D printed the chicken together with a sprue in translucent PLA. I use translucent PLA because it burns out much cleaner than colored PLA. That’s not to say colored PLA can’t burn out cleanly—but you won’t know until you try. Translucent PLA is usually made from raw material without pigments, so there’s less residue when burned out.\n\nI made the sand mold using fine silica sand mixed with sodium silicate, then burned it out in a homemade microwave kiln. It’s similar to those small microwave kilns sold for glass fusing, but mine is much larger. My microwave is turned on its side, so I could fit those large microwave kilns and melting chambers.\n\nI control the microwave using a cycle timer. It turns the microwave on and off like a thermostat. But instead of being triggered by temperature, the cycle is based on the time I set. For example, I often run the microwave for 1 minute, then let it rest for 6 minutes.\n\nFor this burnout, I started on the defrost setting to cure the mold gradually—running it at full power (900W) too soon could cause it to crack if it's not fully cured. After burnout, I let the mold cool and wrapped it in aluminum foil. This helps to keep the mold together in case it cracks.\n\nThe iron for this cast came from a 0.5 kg weight plate. I often use brake discs too, but as a creator, I sometimes choose materials that tell a story or are visually recognizable. A weight plate tells more in a thumbnail than a generic piece of scrap iron, which you wouldn’t identify unless you read the title. That’s the only reason I keep melting those weight plates.\n\nWhen melting iron, I always preheat the crucible with a blowtorch. It's not required, but it speeds up the process. After preheating, I microwaved the crucible for 40 minutes straight—no opening, no checking.\n\nAfter the pour, I used salt water to make the chicken rusty. I dunked it, let it dry, and repeated that a few times. By the next morning, the chicken had transformed into a rusty *Lava Chicken* that looked like a roasted bird.\n\nThe final touch was sanding the bones.",

    "body": "A very long story but I hope worth the read. \n\nSome background first. I worked for a precast concrete company as a job in between high-school and college. The job sucked but it paid well. We made a lot of the massive storm culverts and tunnel pieces that are dropped in place during construction instead of being made where they are. To put this in perspective our largest casting form could handle pieces 40'x30'. Absolutely massive pieces.\n\nAfter a few weeks of working for this company I was trained to run the industrial concrete mixer and did this every day. This mixer was 3 stories tall, mixed up to 4.5 cubic yards of concrete at a time, and was the most beat up machine in the entire plant, which was saying something. It ran 6 days a week, two shifts a day, and was never maintained because the company couldn't get techs to come out on Sunday, it's only day not running, and didn't want to lose a work shift to get it maintained. The only good thing about it was that all the materials were weighed and fed in automatically. All it took was a button to start the process. \n\nThe most common problem was the bottom release door not sealing correctly. It would be just barely cracked, allowing all the water to run out of it resulting in an unusable chunky mess that would need to be dumped in a scrap hole instead of being used. If this happened the mess needed to be dumped out of the mixer quickly before it could partially harden inside the mixer. This only happened once that I was there and it took an entire shift to chisel the stuff out. We put a mark into the sliding door to show where it should be vs where it would be when it didn't seal. \n\nThe process worked like this. A cage of rebar and anchor points was constructed on a base, around a core, and a form bolted around it. The QA guy signed off and the form was then filled with concrete and left to cure. The curing time largely depends on the ambient temperature, the hotter it is the faster it cures and vice versa. Once the peice has cured enough to be lifted the form is stripped and the piece lifted by crane off the core. Repeat until you have as many pieces ordered. \n\nAnother thing to note is hard hat colors. They were color coded according to your role. Blue are plant supervisors, green QA, red the foreman, etc. For the 'normal' workers there was a choice of two colors. Yellow for people who don't know what they are doing (typically new or dumb people) and grey for those that do. This was about 5 months into my time with them and I had just got a grey one maybe two moths before.\n\n\nOnto the story. \n\nOur plant was starting to producing pieces at a substantially slower rate than the other plant owned by the company. We were working 10-12 hour days every day to try and make up the difference. Typically multiple pieces were made per form, per day (2-4). We were only managing one and maybe two per form, per day. To figure out the reason for this the owner's plan was to send an exec from the main office to observe and time every section of the process in our plant. \n\nThis in itself was silly. Remember how I said the speed concrete cures is based on temperature? Our plant was in an unheated warehouse in a state bordering Canada, in the winter. The other plant was in Florida. Can you guess why production was a bit slower in our plant? \n\nIn any case during the shift meeting before the exec got there our foreman's exact words were \"Do what he tells you, otherwise stay the **** away from him\". Wonderful. The shift proceeds as normal building cages and forms get bolted. Maybe 6 hours into the shift I climb up on top of the mixer to the platform and I am greeted by the exec in the shiniest white hard hat I have ever seen... and office attire complete with black dress shoes. In an concrete plant. Lol. He looked bored out of his mind. \n\nHe asked me something to the effect of if I was looking forwards to the end of the shift in two hours. I told him that with no problems we might get to leave in four hours. He got the most defeated look on his face and mumbled something that I didn't catch. \n\nI went through the prechecks on the mixer and found the bottom door was once again not closing properly. I yelled down to the plant supervisor that the door wasn't sealing again and that the machine would be down until I got it to seal (normally by chipping the concrete left by the previous shift after using the mixer away from the opening). The plant supervisor  yelled back a few choice expletives directed at the mixer and stormed into his office. \n\nThe exec had a look and said he thought the door looked fine. I told him that it did this a lot and that it wasn't sealed, pointed out the mark to him, and went to get the tool I bribed a fabricator with energy drinks to make me to chip away the concrete. A breaking bar welded onto a rebar shaft that I kept under the mixer itself. No more hunting down a air gun and and going through confined space lock and tag outs, just stand on top and poke at the concrete until the door moves freely.\n\nUpon coming back with the tool the exec told me that the seal was fine and to \"run it\". I pointed out the same things about the door nor sealing regularly, I asked if they were sure, they replied in the affirmative. I started up the mixer. \n\nThe mixer regularly threw a bunch of silica up into the air. With the water draining out the bottom this was going to get extra dusty. I offered them an extra mask that I had and they replied that they would be fine. Well, it's not my lungs. \n\nAt the same time I notice the plant's heavy equipment guy walking into the building, and got his attention and made the hand gesture for the front loader. I got a wtf look from them and they mouthed why. I pointed down at the mixer, repeated the gesture and they threw up thier hands and turned around. \n\nThe load went into the mixer, water started draining out the bottom, dust goes everywhere. Go figure. The plant supervisor comes out of the office iassume after seeing the giant cloud on the cameras, runs over, and says something like \"OP what the **** are you doing?\" (The mixer is quite loud with concrete in it, I got the general gist though). I just pointed to the exec who was now covered in dust and staring at the water pouring out the bottom of the mixer. Never said a word. \n\nThe plant supervisor's head swiveled and he just crooked a finger at the exec. The exec climbed down, they exited the building with the plant supervisor leading.\n\n\nThe fallout. \n\nThe front loader was able to get to the mixer before the mess was able to partially cure inside it, so the clean up was as easy as dumping it into the bucket and then dumping that in the scrap hole and spraying out the mixer.\n\nWe continued the shift after I chipped the concrete away from the door and got it closing properly again. Not to much time wasted, maybe an hour.The foreman asked what happened later in the shift and didn't stop laughing for the rest of it. \n\nThe plant supervisor talked to me afterwards, asked what happened, and told me he didn't blame me for \"that dumb***'s mistakes\" since he had said to do what the exec said. \n\nI never saw the exec again and the plant supervisor never said what happened in the parking lot. I can only assume that the most this produced was angry phone calls, and a lot of concrete wasted. \n\nI left about three months later but I never heard anything else about slow production times from the main office.\n\n\nTldr : A exec came out to observe a precast concrete plant and ended up telling me to press a button on an industrial cement mixer despite my warnings, ending in a lot of concrete being dumped and the exec leaving.",

An origin via either fumarole-related acid-sulfate leaching or precipitation from hot spring fluids was suggested previously. However, the potential significance of the characteristic nodular and mm-scale digitate opaline silica structures was not recognized. Here we report remarkably similar features within active hot spring/geyser discharge channels at El Tatio in northern Chile, where halite-encrusted silica yields infrared spectra that are the best match yet to spectra from Spirit. Furthermore, we show that the nodular and digitate silica structures at El Tatio that most closely resemble those on Mars include complex sedimentary structures produced by a combination of biotic and abiotic processes. Although fully abiotic processes are not ruled out for the Martian silica structures, they satisfy an a priori definition of potential biosignatures.",

If I don't complete all of these certifications, I am not allowed to work and I not only use employment, I lose my health insurance, and my union will not back me up because \"You didn't take the classes we asked you to take\". So I'm compelled to do unpaid work after working hours in order to stay employed. I don't think that's right at all.\n\nI believe that if your employer or union is requiring you to take a class or get a certificate after normal working hours, you should be paid for that. It's your time doing a work related task; you're not taking the classes for fun or out of personal interest. You're doing it because you're being forced to.",

    "body": "TL:DR - \"Maintenance\" guy thinks he's a copier tech, FUBARS several thousand $ of equipment and gives the office a toner makeover.\n\nBack when I worked as a field repair tech our standard response time was get to the customer within 24 business hours. If you called in on a Friday late in the day, you'd most likely see me monday morning/noon. I think this story happened 2006ish.\n\nWe got a call from a doctors office on a Friday around 3pm saying the copier had an error message. Said error message was \"replace toner waste container\".\n\nNormally this can be done by the end user but this particular MFP (multi function printer/copier) had one that had to be replaced by a tech. The copier they had used a waste container that could hold about 5lbs of waste toner and was held inside the machine in the back under some covers so a tech had to be dispatched to take things apart and do some general cleaning when these containers needed replaced.\n\nNow this customer was a good hour and a half drive from dispatch so I called them and informed them I'd be up first thing Monday morning. Unfortunately this meant the MFP would be down till I got there but not much I could do unless they wanted to pay an after hours fee for me to get there same day. They said it was fine, they had other printers and would see me Monday. Cut to Monday morning and I walk into their  office and EVERYTHING (I do mean EVERYTHING) was covered in a fine black powdery film. It looked like someone dropped a toner bomb in their office.\n\nM=Me\nR=Receptionist\nD=Doctor\n\nM: What on earth happened in here?!?\n\nR: Our building maintenance guy said he could take care of the error code on the copier and he tried fixing it Saturday.\n\nM: How? What? What did he do?\n\nR: He said the error code just meant the container inside the front cover was full and needed emptied. So he took a shop-vac and just sucked it out.\n\nM: He did WHAT!!!\n\nR: I guess it was fine for a few seconds then the vacuum started blowing black everywhere. We've been trying to clean up since Saturday but this stuff doesn't clean up easy.\n\nNow for those not in the know on toner, it's a VERY fine silica based powder that clings to everything, best way to clean it up is with a static cloth (similar to a super cloth) or with a SPECIAL vacuum that has a filter designed to keep toner in it otherwise you get a cloud of black death. Also being silica based it does NOT mix with water so using a cloth or paper towel with water/cleaner just smears it around.\n\nI glance at the disaster that is their office and immediately go back to my car, grab an entire pack of static wipes, a dust filtration mask, my vacuum, and a pair of latex gloves. Upon returning I instruct the girls in the office that they should all be wearing masks and gloves due to this film being silica based, then hand out the cloths and instruct them how to use them (give em a bit of a stretch and go to town).\n\nM: Ok, I need to see exactly what your \"maintenance\" guy did to the copier. Give me a while to see what he did and get the outside of the copier cleaned up so I can work on it.\n\nI look at the copier and its turned off at the front switch, most copier have 2 switches: One for a low power shutdown, the other for complete shutdown, I reach behind and fully kill the power. After about 15 minutes of wiping down covers, controls, and everything in general and I finally open up the copier. The \"container\" the maintenance guy vacuumed out was not the waste tank, it was in fact the developer unit...\n\nAgain for those not in the know, a copier mixes toner into a developing unit that is filled with developer (a very fine metal powder). So not only did the maintenance guy blast the office with toner he also manage to suck out ever speck of developer and made it airborne.\n\nI cleaned everything I could on the copier inside and out and then figured it'd be safe to power up and see the extent of the damage. Upon power up I immediately got a developer unit error code, no surprise there, so I power down, completely clean the DV unit and toss in a new bottle of developer. Power back up and run the neccessary service codes to recalibrate the DV unit. On the next reboot I can hear everything running and doing its usual start up until i get a laser unit error.\n\n*RUT ROH, that's not good*\n\nI reset the error and reboot the copier listening to hear if the laser spins up and again, error code.\n\n*well shit*\n\nNormally you dont touch laser units unless you know theres something wrong with them, I figured toner got inside the unit and was causing issues. So I rip out the laser and take it apart, sure enough toner was inside it on the mirrors but what worried me was the motor that ran the refection head was hard as hell to turn. My first thought was if toner got in, developer probably did as well. So I pull the motor out and clean it with isopropyl, dried the crap out of it with compressed air, and lubed the bearings with a drop of oil. It was spinning smoother but still a bit rough. Put everything back together and prayed. This time I could hear the laser trying to spin up but it still kept throwing the error code.\n\nI figured it was time to call the boss and inform him of the situation. As soon as I told him what the maintenance guy did and the error codes the machine was having he said pack it up the machine is dead and nothing's going to be covered by warranty or their service contract. Inform the Doctor what was happening and if they want a quote for a replacement we'll be happy to get him one. I went back inside and informed the receptionist I needed to speak with Doctor about the situation.\n\n\nD: I'm told you wanted to speak to me?\n\nM: Yeah Doc, unfortunately your copier is dead and my boss doesn't even want to attempt to fix it due to what the maintenance guy did. It definitely killed the laser unit and probably more but we cant find out till the laser is replaced and it's about $500-600 just for the laser. If it killed the laser most likely all the other motors in the copier are dead or dying since the laser is one of the  more protected sections in the machine. Unfortunately none of this is covered under your maintenance contract since someone outside our company caused the damage. We can get you a quote for a new one and get it here ASAP if you want but a replacement with the same features is gonna be several thousand dollars.\n\n*I honestly thought the doctor was going to go ballistic at this but he floored me with the following.*\n\nD: Ok, get me a quote, but I want a better machine then this one with a stapler and hole punch.\n\nM: Ok...? You're not upset?\n\nD: No I already informed the maintenance company that does the cleaning that they're paying for all damages in my office. I have their employee on camera doing something he's not supposed to do and I was not asked if I wanted him to work on my equipment. I told them if they had an issue with that my lawyer would be delivering paperwork sueing for damages. They said the guy  was fired and I should email over any quotes or bills for replacements/repairs. So I'm going to get an upgrade on their dime.\n\nM: Ok... I'll have a quote to you by end of today.\n\nD: I also have 3 computers that aren't working do you think that this could have caused them to stop working?\n\nM: Oh absolutely, if toner and developer got sucked into them it could of ruined the harddrive or fans. Maybe even shorted something if enough developer got on the boards (I explained what toner and DV was).\n\nD: Ok, my IT guys are supposed to be here later today so I'll just have them do the same and replace them. Is there anything else you needed?\n\nM: No, I'll get packed up and have that quote emailed over.\n\nD: Ok, thank you.\n\nI returned to my stuff and started packing up, I explained to the receptionist what was going on and apologized for not being able to do much.\n\nR: That's ok, thanks for these cloths though, we're actually getting stuff cleaned up now.\n\nM: Well have a better day and I'd keep the masks and gloves on till your done cleaning. You can keep the pack of cloths, you're going to need them.\n\n\nThank god the maintenance guy didn't actually vaccum out the waste tank because the DV unit had at most about a little over 2 pounds of DV/toner if he'd have got the actual waste tank... they'd of been replacing everything in the office from carpet to ceiling tiles.",

Yay!\n\nI was in Iceland and I went to a place I could see lava. \n\nSomeone dropped a piece of ice in said lava.\n\nThe steam from the ice got trapped under the lava, so it a large bubble formed in the lava. At one point the bubble popped and went onto the floor. \n\nBecause of the silica in the lava, the shard of the bubble which had solidified now and fell near me, kinda looked like black glass, so I got a bit curious. \n\nLava is a great insulator for its own heat so it was still very hot. I touched it for half a second or so and got a 2nd degree burn. Luckily at least it wasn’t 300 degrees Celsius so I didn’t spontaneously combust. \n\nI just sat there for 15 minutes because I still wanted to see the lava for some reason, and then I stuck my finger in an ice cube. \n\nTL;DR: Don’t touch lava guys\n\nEdit: ***I wasn’t the one who dropped the ice, this was an organized lava show type thing***",

The issue will be finding hard- and software that is able to acces what is on the disk. The chances of you still having acces to a reader for an m-disc in 25 years are slim.\n\nMake 25 years a round 100 years and everything you now have digital will probably be lost to this. Floppy drives are a good example of this. The last floppy disk i saw in use is about 25 years ago and the ones that are archived at work are useless because we dont have a floppydiskreader anymore, nor do we have ms works wich was the software used back then for textediting.\n\nBetween then and now several formats have come and dissapeared that you'd have a hard time accessing without alot of trial and error and pretty large costs. VHS, minidisc, iomega zip drives to name a few. Hell i know less and less people who even own a dvd player in their pc anymore.\n\nAside from that there is the problem of proprietary fileformats and even encryption on the hardware level. Who is to say that in 25 years the file system your disk uses is still in use on current reading devices. Or that your OS will even be able to still interact with your medium on a hardware level. Case in point: try to hook up a scanner from the 1980's to a modern day pc. Even if you could get it connected, wich will demand serious electronics skills, you'd never get it to work since you dont have the drivers.\n\nThe phenomenon of depricating archives due to digital mediums is called the digital dark ages in the world of museums and national archives.\n\nThe only reason people are able to keep using the same data during the span of their lifetime is that they (awarely or not) transfer everything to new media/formats/hardware about every 5 years. And even then alot gets lost.\n\nYour best bet for long-time archival is, despite our modern technology, still hardcopy. Paper.sys and pen.exe my friend.",

I have over the last year binged everything I can get ahold of to watch and I have had the best time. One of my favorite Queens was Chi Chi Devayne. I just recently found out she passed away not that long ago. Honestly I felt so heart broken. Her soul seemed so kind. I read into how she died, from pneumonia I saw.\n\n\"Davenport was diagnosed with scleroderma in 2018 and, two years later, he died following a bout of pneumonia he contracted after a hospital stay for scleroderma-related kidney failure.\" From Wikipedia \n\nWell I wanted to understand what scleroderma is. It is an autoimmune disease. I was curious what caused it. \n\n\"The cause is unknown, but it may be due to an abnormal immune response.[2] Risk factors include family history, certain genetic factors, and exposure to silica.\" From Wikipedia \n\nSo that scratched at my brain. See I grew up next to a silica mine. I know a little how that stuff is. (I also have a background in Chemistry.) I wondered if Chi Chi grew up next to a Silica mine. \n\nShreveport is where she was born and died according to Wikipedia again. \n\n\"OVERVIEW\nU.S. Silica's Dubberly plant produces fine grain silica from a mineral resource known as the \"Sparta\" Formation. The Sparta consists primarily of loose, unconsolidated, fine to coarse, light-colored sand intermingled with light-colored clays, which is processed for the glass, chemical, roofing, brick and foundry industries.\n\nSince acquiring the facility, we renovated and upgraded its production capabilities to enable it to produce multiple products through various processing methods, including screening, washing, fluid bed drying and conditioning to remove heavy and iron-bearing minerals. \n\nDresser Industries carried out an extensive exploration program during the summer of 1970, which resulted in the discovery of the South Dubberly deposit. Dresser Industries operated the facility until it was purchased by Ottawa Silica Company in July 1981, which merged into the U.S. Silica family in 1987.\n\nThe facility is located approximately 30 miles east of Shreveport and is accessible by major highways including U.S. Interstate 20 and state Highway 532\" From https://www.ussilica.com/locations/dubberly-la\n\nAnyway, I don't really have anyone to talk to about this, and Idk if this is something anyone will care about. I just think it should be said that Chi Chi didn't die of pneumonia at the young age of 34, she died of pollution, corporate greed, racism, and our terrible health care system not being affordable. \n\nThank you for reading this if you did. If nothing else I appreciate the ear.\n\nI hope you have a great evening. 💚\n\nEdit:\n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C48&q=silica+exposure+pneumonia+&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&t=1719389818247&u=%23p%3DnazKxad4tNcJ\n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,48&q=scleroderma+and++%22silica+exposure%22&scisbd=1#d=gs_qabs&t=1719389067984&u=%23p%3DO2hZoBO71jkJ\n",

They are both very real examples of how environmental effects can really fuck up your body, and how certain marginalized groups can be affected simply by reduced access to care and suppression of information. A lot of bodies of research out there spent millions of dollars over decades to try and prove that pollution from factories and processing plants doesn't cause harm in order to push profits. Even today people dispute the effects of Cancer Alley on the constituents that live there. There's no doubt that area has higher levels of pollution than what the government deems acceptable.

The amount of PFAS, lead, and other hazardous chemicals that can be found in some cosmetics (especially waterproof formulas and powders) can be extremely hazardous when used over a prolonged period of time.

        "body": "I didn't know scleroderma was the reason she passed away. My mom also has systemic scleroderma. She was a teacher for years at a very old school. The school was then closed due to the buildings potentially containing asbestos. Since then, even though scleroderma is very rare, 2 other teachers working there also got it, and 3 other teachers died of cancer. We always thought the school was the culprit...\n\nA little story about scleroderma.\n\nMe and my siblings were all in high school when my mom was diagnosed with it. It was probably the darkest days of our lives. Everyone (including us) thought she would die. She went from being a single parent of 3 high schoolers to being in disability in the course of 2 years. It was bad. Our whole house had this horrible dark aura, as if you could feel death just by being in it.\n\nDuring that time some random doctor (rheumatologist) from outside of her team of doctors reached out to her. He said he had heard of her case and was interested in seeing her because his daughter had the same type of scleroderma, and he had spent decades studying the condition. \n\nHe told us of an experimental non-FDA approved drug that he knew would help, but it would all have to be done on the side since it wouldn’t be covered by insurance. My mom used all her savings and got multiple loans to pay for it, since it was that or death. She started seeing him in a private office in the middle of nowhere (we'd drive there every Saturday and it was like 3 hours to get there and then 3 hours back) and he would put her on an IV. \n\nAfter she started that, her scleroderma basically did a 360. She started getting a lot better and could once again walk and do stuff. She looked infinitely better. The thing really saved her. She kept doing that for probably 2 years and then stopped, since we couldn't afford it anymore. A few years later the doctor disappeared and all we heard is that he retired.\n\nIt's been about 15 years since that and her scleroderma has mostly been in remission during all that time, except just this year when it came back in full force. Full kidney failure, pulmonary embolisms, etc. Out of nowhere, everything is back. She'd never been hospitalized and just this year she's spent 3 months in the hospital. It's a nightmare.\n\nEvery time we ask about this drug that helped her before, doctors literally shut us down immediately. We went to the top doctor here for scleroderma and she just shrugged it off and said \"it's not FDA approved and there's limited research on it\", and that my mom getting better was likely just a coincidence.\n\nSo I think you got it absolutely right when you say it's all about corporate greed. To us, it's very clear that it's a money thing. The moment some pharma company gets enough data, they will slap on a huge price tag on it and make millions in profit. \n\nSorry for the long wall of text. I'm procrastinating at work.",

        "body": "The deadliest industrial incident of all time occurred at the Union Carbide India Limited pesticide plant in Bhopal Madhya Pradesh, India; killing 16,000 and exposing 100,000’s more. Deaths were the result of exposure to the highly toxic gas methyl isocyanate (MIC). Exposure resulted in bleeding from the eyes, the total destruction of the lungs and a myriad of other debilitating if not deadly health effects. \nEssentially the same company is responsible for the deadliest industrial incident in US history as well as the deadliest industrial incident in world history…and they are not the same incident.\n\nEdit: I also should have included in the title that the miners in the Hawks Nest disaster were all unemployed men desperate for work when recruited and 2/3 of them were African American. This may explain in part why they were treated as expendable as well as why the miners were so desperate for work they labored through the conditions.  When you couple this fact with the fact that the gas plant in Bhopal was recklessly placed in a high population area despite similar plants around the world being located in low population areas specifically to avoid this kind of event; you’re left with two examples of a corporation knowingly endangering lives. Both examples “coincidentally” involve race and socio economic status when looking at the victims.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Carbide\n\nReally fun thing to look at is the archive of Union Carbides history on their own websites which includes a blurb about the leak at Bhopal which attempts to minimize the event while simultaneously distancing themselves from liability. Pretty gross. [archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20080718041136/http://www.unioncarbide.com/history/index.htm)",

It's formed when lightning hits sand dunes and superheats the silica and turns it into crazy designs. \n\nIt was close to my wife's birthday and I finally found some after looking for like ten years. I wanted to give it to her. I knew my friend was good with rocks so I told her I found something and I wanted to know what she thought about it.\n\nSo she grabs it out of my hands, flips it over and breaks it in half. I'm like uh okay what the fuck right. Dead-ass looks me in the eyes and snaps it in half like an angry child who can't get what they want so they break something you like just to be a dick. \n\nI asked her why she did that and I said that I was going to give it to my wife for her birthday. She said she thought it was for her and she could do what she wanted to it, because I was giving it to her.\n\nAlways about me, me, me and mine, mine, mine. I couldn't believe it at first but looking back I'm foolish for ever letting any of my property enter her possession. Simply handing something to her must mean I'm giving it to her and it's hers now.

    "body": "# Ranking System\n\nThis ranking is for **making life easier, optimizing for time/effort**.  The alternates are ranked into the following tiers and scored based on the weights and outputs provided next.\n\n* **S Tier (Most Recommended)**\n* **A Tier (Very Highly Recommended)**\n* **B Tier (Highly Recommended)**\n* **C Tier (Sometimes Recommended)**\n* **D Tier (Rarely Recommended)**\n* **F Tier (Not Recommended)**\n\n**I have two different rankings.** If you don't like to touch real grass and want to prioritize using resources efficiently, regardless of how much extra time/effort a recipe adds, [use this ranking instead.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1ff515j/alternate_recipe_ranking_10_optimizing_for/)  I highly recommend it if you would rather use the pure recipes with water over other options.\n\nSee [this post for power generation rankings](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1fk4ez4/power_generation_ranked_most_resource_efficient/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).\n\n# Tool Used (New)\n\nI wrote a linear optimization model in preparation for 1.0 using the Pyomo Python library and the open-source 'glpk' solver.  What this does is find the optimal solution to producing anything, given specific weighting parameters.  The source of the data comes directly from the game files.\n\n[Linear model recipe options](https://preview.redd.it/hfe9pmlj58od1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b3f2b303e304e7d1d16855447ff60eb229efee4)\n\nPreviously, recipes were ranked by changing one recipe and scoring the results keeping all other recipes the same.\n\n**This tool adjusts every other recipe to the 'optimal' solution (according to the parameters) before scoring the change**, a method you haven't seen yet.\n\nFor this ranking process, I look at every item you can produce one at a time and force a single recipe for that item (keeping all other item recipes available) before running the solver.  The scores are the comparisons to forcing the standard recipe.  If there isn't a standard recipe, I compare it to the average of the other recipes that produce the item.\n\n# Weighting LP Objective Parameters\n\nUnlike other tools, this one allows me to minimize a number of different things in the optimization model.  The score is based on how each recipe changes these parameters across the entire production chain.\n\n* **Power Use**:  From all buildings or ore extraction\n* **Item Use**:  Items moving around the map\n* **Building Use:**  The number of machines needed in the whole production chain\n* **Resource Use:**  Raw resources needed, broken down by each type in the attached sheet\n\nNot all buildings and resources are equal, so I created weights for each that can be used as an alternative to straight-up counts:\n\n* **Buildings\\* (Scaled)** Scales the buildings by the sum of the number of items going in and out for a given recipe.   This is based on the recipe, not the building type.  (Factored to be 1 full Manufacturer = 3 Assemblers = 9 Constructors)\n* **Resources\\* (Scaled)** Scales the resources by the inverse of the quantity available on the map. (For this post, I set water with a global availability of 100k, making it the most common but not completely insignificant.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oq8vvlm1alod1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=b19be6d378da593b4f07328a2ae1fee8a6583433\n\n**Weights For This Ranking (Time/Effort Minimization):**\n\n* **Power Use:  0.0** Zero, because it already considers power by forcing the output to create what is needed for each solution.  The other parameters are impacted by how I implemented the output.\n* **Item Use:  0.4** I'm attempting to scale this to have an equal percentage impact as Resources\\*.  You'll see on the sheet that Resource\\* totals are very close to 0.4 Items totals.\n* **Buildings\\* (Scaled):  30** I'm attempting to scale this to have an equal percentage impact as Resources\\*.  You'll see on the sheet that Resource\\* totals are very close to 30x Buildings\\* totals.\n* **Resources\\* (Scaled):  1.0** Resources are directly weighted by the normalized inverse of global availability.\n\n# Outputs\n\n**Outputs For This Ranking (Time/Effort Minimization):**\n\n* **Final Project Assembly parts** (In the ratios needed, see below)\n* Some **Power Shards** (5)/**Packaged Ionized Fuel** (100)/**Hazmat Filters** (2)/**Nuke Nobelisks** (2) (To ensure all alternates get scores)\n* Some **Screws** (2000)/**Cable** (200)/**Iron Rods** (600)/**Canisters** (100) because the output using this strategy often cuts them, leaving them with neutral scores.  'Some' is subjective, sorry.\n* **Power output to produce** given the outputs and recipes in each solution (If I choose a recipe with worse power efficiency, I need more power, thus the resources to do so will get accounted for)\n\n*Half of the power output must come from fuel generators.*\n\n*Half of the power output must come from nuclear generators.*\n\n[Example output requirements](https://preview.redd.it/wnjvjc0s48od1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=e51f2d9df34c1b1a5265dd4dc21cc18a37940782)\n\n# Do Alternate Recipes Make a Difference?\n\n**Original Recipes:**\n\nIf you were to run these requirements with original recipes (except Compacted Coal) and no optimization, you would:\n\n* Need 85,907 MW power\n* Move 131,675 items around per min\n* Build 2,783 buildings\n* Mine 56,286 raw resources\n\n**Using Alternate Recipes:**\n\nIf you were to do the same using the alternates guided by this ranking, you would:\n\n* Need 70,908 MW power (-17.5%)\n* Move 82,383 items around per min (-37.4%)\n* Build 1,020 buildings (-63.3%)\n* Mine 32,458 raw resources (-42.3%)\n\n# The Recipe Ranking:\n\nOnce again, this is the ranking for **making life easier, optimizing for time/effort**:\n\n* The goal is to make the Final Project Assembly parts (in the ratios needed).\n* A few extra items are thrown as listed above to get numbers for all alternates.\n* Enough power from fuel and nuclear sources (half each) to make those parts.\n* This score is based on the sum of Items, Buildings\\*, and Resources\\* as detailed above.\n* Each recipe is compared using the optimal combination of all other recipes each time one changes according to the objectives as detailed above.\n* The items, buildings, and resource scores are impacted by the need to power the recipe's power consumption as well as all of the other alternates used in the process.  **This can make some results seem unintuitive.**\n\n***Negative is good, and*** ***positive percent is bad***. The **percentage is the change over the whole production** (-50% Power means the recipe will drop all power consumption in half for the same production, +50% means it will go from 100% to 150%).\n\n**S Tier (Most Recommended)**\n\n|(Score)                          |Power|Items|Buildings|Resources|Buildings\\*|Resources\\*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|(97.7) Heavy Encased

Standard Stator + Standard Motor**:  Same ingredients, simple setup.\n* **Stitched Iron Plate + Steel Rotor + Steeled Frame + Heavy Encased Frame**:  Remove the need for screws early on and improve everything in the process.  Be sure to use one of the Computer alternates too.\n* **Fused Quickwire + Fused Wire**:  Same ingredients, simple setup, saves a ton of resources.\n* **Copper Alloy Ingot + Iron Alloy Ingot**:  Same ingredients, simple setup, saves on every metric.  I often use this combo to save having to source another iron node if I have a little copper to spare.\n* **Iron Pipe + Iron Wire + Steeled Frame + Stitched Iron Plate**:  Make stuff out of Iron!  It's not efficient, but it works.\n* **Encased Industrial Pipe + Heavy Encased Frame + Iron Pipe + Iron Wire + Steeled Frame + Stitched Iron Plate**:  Make stuff out of Iron and Concrete!  It's not efficient, but it works.\n* **Heavy Oil Residue + Recycled/Residual Plastic/Rubber**:  Here is my 1:3 oil-to-product [Rubber diagram](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/pfg0ax/1_oil_to_3_rubber_map_updated/) and  [Plastic diagram](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/pfh3ae/1_oil_to_3_plastic_map/).  This isn't an easy setup, but it saves a lot of oil if that's a priority.\n\n# FAQ\n\nThe items, buildings, and resource scores are impacted by the need to power the recipe's power consumption as well as all of the other alternates used in the process.  If more power is needed, more power is produced in the model.  More power means more resources used.  This can make some results seem unintuitive.\n\nIf something else looks off, please reach out to me and I'll look into it.\n\nSome of the common questions are:\n\n* A recipe is missing?  It may not have been used in the production for the outputs I started with.  It may also have no other recipe to compare to (Automated Miner, for example).\n* Why is Cast Screw so low?   It is compared to the standard recipe for Screws while allowing Steel Rods and Coke Steel or Solid Steel recipes.  The improvement over that setup isn't as dramatic as you would expect.  I could have requested more Screws in the output. That would exaggerate the results, but the model's settings made Screws unlikely to be used in the production chain for a reason.\n* Why is Iron Alloy Ingot so high?  They changed the recipe, and it isn't completely awful anymore.\n* What about combining Recycled Rubber/Plastic and Heavy Oil Residue?  How does that score?  The scores for each are using the 3:1 method.  I checked, and the model likes to use it.  The score for the combo would be the same as whichever is highest:  (56) Recycled Plastic\\*\\*.\n* Why are Plutonium alternates ranked low?  Consider power created by all sources.  Each type of rod creates power.  Maximizing for any single fuel rod would be a logical mistake.  This model looks at the power created across the whole production chain, doesn't allow waste, and weighs the resources it takes to do it (SAM).  See [this post for power generation rankings](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1fk4ez4/power_generation_ranked_most_resource_efficient/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).\n* Why is Turbo Heavy Fuel ranked higher than Turbo Blend Fuel?  Clever use of byproducts... Consider how the ingredients can be sourced. Turbo Heavy Fuel can take advantage of common byproducts from other great alternative recipes. Considering all other alternative recipes and other products, Turbo Heavy Fuel is better by the metrics in this post after looking at all production.  Turbo Blend Fuel is better as a stand-alone power production factory, and it higher on the resource rankings linked at the top of this post.\n\n# Sources\n\nLink to the results on Google Sheets:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LYMKGNI9NU7NUg8KJMuMGvx4MCRxKmJo8cUB\\_NVMvQw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LYMKGNI9NU7NUg8KJMuMGvx4MCRxKmJo8cUB_NVMvQw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nLink to the linear model project on github:\n\n[https://github.com/Scott1903/satisfactory\\_planner/tree/main](https://github.com/Scott1903/satisfactory_planner/tree/main)\n\n# Community Rankings\n\nThere is this awesome community ranking out there that has to be included as a reference as well. Pre 1.0, it was a collaborative effort between tools created by [u/Sl3dge78](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sl3dge78/) and [u/kpwn243](https://www.reddit.com/user/kpwn243/) that scored them based on the community's favorites.  u/TheHornyRhino created a version for 1.0.  You can also contribute to the results by picking between alternate recipes similar to how you would in the MAM.\n\nCheck it out here:  [https://satisfactory-ranker-91f08c6418db.herokuapp.com/](https://satisfactory-ranker-91f08c6418db.herokuapp.com/)",

They've done a great job putting this together.**\n\nHowever, when you're reading the ranking or even using it, please remember this - the ranking (and any other ranking you may find anywhere on the internet) is inevitably based on subjective parameters. In the case of this ranking, picking the weights lead to this result, but changing the weights may lead to a completely different result. There's no objective way to analyse alternate recipes, and if someone tells you there is, they are not right.\n\nWhile the ranking list may be a decent place to start, I heavily discourage you to blindly follow it (or any other ranking). All alt recipes are good in certain situations and whether or not a recipe is good for you depends on your own preferences and priorities (which are most likely not reflected in OP's selected weights). You should do your own research on alternate recipes you want to use and see if the advantages and disadvantages are fine with your preferences.\n\nWe're working together with wiki guys to create a resource (either on wiki, or on separate website) that would give you information about all the recipes, so that you could make informed choice yourself.\n\n  \n**TL;DR: keep in mind any analysis is subjective and don't follow it blindly**",

So I figured, how hard can it be to work with ipe?\n\n\nI was wrong. Very wrong. Its the absolute worst.  It kills blades and tools at an unimaginable pace. It has silica dust and oils that turn the wood green when sanded improperly. Many glues dont take. And worst of all- you cant shoot it with nails….    Everything has to be piloted, countersunk, screwed with SS screws and plugged.\nI’m now at the oiling stage, and it looked like shit after sanding everything with 80 grit….

A high level of understanding has consequently been reached of the diverse working steps and tools applied. An exception is the reddish mud, “llancac alpa” in the quechua language, and the “gold”, mentioned by early chroniclers as mortar which fitted the stones and later disappeared. Such techniques were related to folklore and not taken seriously. This study tries to understand them and the question was asked: did Inca builders have access to very acid mud? They did, and used the acid mud from their mines, which generated sulphuric acid through bacterial oxidation of pyrite (fools gold). It reaches an acidity of up to pH = 0.5, which is 10^(4) times more acid than humic acid which is known to weather silica containing rocks via silica gel to the clay mineral kaolin. This acid mud allowed dissolving and softening the rock material superficially to a viscoelastic silica gel. The process could be further enhanced more than tenfold by addition of (oxalic acid containing) plant sap, a skill suggested from popular tradition. In special cases moderate heating of crushed pyrite in gaps between chiselled stones generated additional hot sulphuric acid. Where the stone to stone contact transmitted weight, pressure dissolution in the acidic environment removed material, and silica precipitation regenerated material in cracks and pores elsewhere. It is attempted to reconstruct how the Inca builders applied the silica gel technology for shaping stones, for polishing and fitting them. The appearance of shiny and glassy Inca stone junctions and interfaces is explained via solidification of in-situ generated or additionally added silica gel. Modern processes for conservation of stone monuments against environmental deterioration have independently developed similar silica gel based technology.",

    "body": "I was made fun of - often - in school. I moved to my district in 6th grade, and all the way through senior year I was hardcore bullied. Not just by only girls, but guys bullied me too. For some reason it hurt more when girls did it.\n\nNot gonna lie, they probably had some pretty good reasons. I’ve always had ASD and was diagnosed “Asperger’s” when I was 9. Needless to say, I might have been a little strange. Lol okay I was totally a freak, but that’s beside the point.\n\n4 years into relentless bullying, we did frog dissections in biology, and we had an extra credit session over lunch where we could opt to take out the brain. Extra credit to anyone who got it out whole.  Well, I got bored during the dissection. My frog was already finished and I’d been going to other tables and cutting theirs for them too. (Like I said, I was weird.)\n\nSo in my boredom, I stabbed my frog in the eye; and a tiny little ball popped out. It looked like a ball of silica or something. Intrigued, I ran all over the class taking out the “eye balls” of every frog there. Then my weird ass was carrying them around, inspecting them and playing with them.\n\nSo, after lunch, we have 9th grade gym, which was swimming. My monthly friend was in town, so I was out of the pool that day.\n\nSo I’m sitting by the pool, minding my own business, playing with these frog eyeballs; and some girl in the pool is like “hey (my name), what’s in your hand?” And other girls start answering.\n\n“Dude, she took all the eyes from the frogs in bio”\n\n“Ew what a freak”\n\n“Like seriously why aren’t you in a psych hospital psycho!”\n\nHey (my name) you’re f*cking weird!”\n\nEtc.\n\nSo I’m sitting their with my handful of eyeballs stolen from science frogs, and in my greatest comeback ever I say “I may be weird but I’m not swimming with frog eyes.”\n\nThese girls are apparently kinda slow so they’re all like “Uhmm, whaaat??”\n\nMy hand comes up and I let loose the eyeballs of no less than 34 frogs, straight into the pool. \n\nNow, I want you to imagine this. Pool full of 14 year old girls (who are all pretty prissy princess types). Their eyes watch as whatever is in my hand flies into the air, and the tiny frog-eyes drop into the pool scattered like raindrops.\n\nA second passes.\n\nInstant pandemonium. Girls screaming and swimming as fast as they can to the pool edge. Girls pulling other girl’s hair and bathing suits trying to get out before them. Girls crying, pulling out flip phones to call their parents. Girls dry-heaving at the edge of the pool. You get the picture?\n\nIt was such a scene that even the boys gym teachers and the health teachers came running. I was sent to the principal. I’m pretty sure I got a detention for that, but still to this day that scene is one of my favorite (and most hilarious) memories. I wish I would have recorded it but recording sucked in 1997 unless you had an actual camcorder.\n\nWhat do you think? Did I go too far? Hell no. Those bitches deserved it.",

We had a science presention in grade 9 or so, and it was common at the time to include a a question and answer period in your presentations with a prize at the end, to keep people interested at the time. I wasn’t bullied in school but I was definitely a nerd with very few friends and jealous of the cool kids and the attention they got from prissy pretty girls (I’m a guy). I had recently had a bit of an epiphany that I was surprisingly self-satisfied and confident despite being a friendless ugly nerd. Also important is that there were two girls in particular who, in hindsight, weren’t exactly ‘mean girls’ but had been unnecessarily rude to some of the less popular girls recently, and I didn’t take kindly.\n\nSo cut to the presentation, and I tell my partner I’ll take care of that section, including buying the prize. The prize I choose is a fish head from the grocery store, with its bulging slimy eyes still in. It was wrapped very nicely, as if it were a good prize. I make sure the two prissiest girls got the easiest questions, and they delightfully rip open the prize to find this stinking, slimy, fish head in front of them, and screamed so loud that a teacher next door came running over too.\n\nSince it had been a vaguely biology-related presentation and no one could prove I’d targeted them, I only got in minimal trouble. Not shockingly, the interest I got from the womenfolk after that did not improve, but I had a few more years of being very unfortunate looking anyway.",

    "body": "I was perusing my local GameStop and noticed in the display window they had both the Power Armor edition of Fallout 76 (PC) AND the Nuka Cola T-51b helmet both BRAND NEW in their boxes. Better yet, they were marked down heavily, their stickers said they were $79 and $89 respectively. \n\nNow, I’m not much of a fan of 76, I never even owned my own copy and I’m much more of a New Vegas man, myself. But, I figured I should get them, since there’s nowhere else I’d ever be able to find them for this price (more than half off retail? C’monnnn) and someone’s going to notice they’re here—if I don’t pull the trigger someone else is going to.\n\nSo, I go to the counter and ask the lady if she could grab them so I could buy them. She happily does, and then grabs the scanner and takes it to the Power Armor Edition.\n\n*beep*\n\n“Oh, wow,” she says. Slightly concerned, I ask what’s up, thinking it was mislabeled. Now, I was right, it was mislabeled but then she tells me “this is way down from the sticker, it’s only $26.97!”  I’m beaming, I don’t get how it’s so cheap while also just being here but I won’t ask questions, I’m just stoked on it. Then she scans the Nuka Cola helmet\n\n*beep*\n\n“This one too! Not quite as much but it’s down to $59.97. Your total is gonna come to $86.94.”\n\n“WHAT?! Dude that’s awesome!”\n\nSo I got both of the T51-b helmets, nearly $400 worth of Fallout merch, for literally only $87. Brand new. In box. Has anyone else ever come across this kind of deal for anything OUTSIDE of the game?\n\nProof; https://imgur.com/a/QCpOmlo/\n\nEdit; okay so the Nuka Cola helmet is actually one of the refurbished models! Cleaned, no mold, and it had the silica packet inside, good to go!\n\nEdit 2; okay so they’re out of the boxes, and I wore both. Unfortunately the red one’s fitting crown won’t stay in place (which doesn’t matter since I won’t wear it very much if at all) but other that that there aren’t any other issues. But let me tell you, they’re super hard to see out of and the lenses distort everything. But here’s both helmets, and a quick edit of me wearing them both. https://imgur.com/a/dfOvm8X/",

    "body": "I recently took a trip to Oregon and saw some cool obsidian and thought I would share it with all of you. Much of the geology of central Oregon is dominated by volcanoes. And in some special places you can find massive chunks of obsidian sitting right on the surface. These pics are from the beautiful Newberry National Volcanic Monument (could easily be a national park imo).\n\nThis lava flow is only ~1500 years old. It is made up of pumice and a variety of other rough volcanic rocks and glass. Everything is razor sharp. Weathering out of the rock you can find these massive boulders of this pure obsidian just scattered about the lava flow. For reference, the big chunks in the second and third pictures are each roughly the size of a large couch, and the smaller pieces in the last picture are all about the size of basketballs. I said \"this place is so cool\" out loud about a hundred times just walking around here. I've always thought obsidian was interesting, but it was amazing to see so much of it in one place.\n\nSome other fun facts about this obsidian I learned in no particular order: this whole flow was the result of a massive but slow moving wall of lava oozing out and across the ground. Much of the surrounding rock has the texture of cotton candy or a sponge (except it's made out of rock and glass) because of all the dissolved gas in the lava. But obsidian forms from only pure globs of molten silica without any air bubbles. Also the Native Americans highly valued this site because of the quality of tools they could make with the obsidian. Obsidian blades can be sharper than steel surgical scalpels. Tools from this exact flow have been found at archeological sites many hundreds of miles away. And finally, this location is designated a National Monument. Collecting your own obsidian here is highly discouraged and also illegal so if you go, take only pictures!",

To solve its generation would be difficult, but silica is commonly found in water, so its potential to be a rock found only near pools of water would give purpose for builders to go to these areas for diorite.\n* Andesite is an igneous rock formed when rapidly cooled down and commonly on the surface due to eruptions. To solve its generation is very easy because andesite is common on the surface, therefore its rarity decreases the further down you go in the world.\n* Granite is an igneous rock formed when lava or magma is cooled down and solidified. This rock's solution is very interesting in its implementation. Granite should be around near the bottom of the stone world and slightly entering into the deep slate world commonly without other influences. But granite should form near lava pools and areas with lava to simulate geological time.\n\n[Visualisation of rock distribution \\(Right\\) alongside 21w10a ore distribution.](https://preview.redd.it/xxnyh3vz5jr61.png?width=2523&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a7484fcd59930e0c3cd1792d2d4b70adcc6f744)",

I like your ideas about granite near lava deposits and such. Maybe they could add a rareish volcano biome where you can fine granate and lava easy. Maybe add some in the nether. Idk.

    "body": "If you’re like a lot of people, you might’ve seen those Chinese noodle pullers and thought to yourself, “that seems cool. I kind of want to learn how to do that”. Then you go online, give it a quick google, and’re greeted an absolutely bewildering mix of discussion on the topic: everything from people that say it’s impossible to makes outside of China, to people playing around with adding nutritional yeast or L-cysteine to mix, to Buzzfeed videos claiming an easy foolproof version.\n\nSo with this post, I want to (1) try clear the air a bit, and clarify what a hand-pulled noodle actually is (2) teach you three different ‘hand-pulled noodles’, for three different skill levels and (3) teach a couple ways to actually enjoy them. It’s… a lot of ground to cover. This is a novella of a post, I know – I’ve actually had to put parts of it in the comments below because I hit reddit’s character limit (40k for a post, who knew?). Save it for later if you’re not in the reading mood. But I hope by the end of it all, you’ll understand – or at least appreciate - Chinese hand pulled noodles a little better.\n\n###What is a hand-pulled noodle?\n\nSo one of the things that makes it awkward to give a ‘recipe’ for hand-pulled noodles is that hand-pulled noodles aren’t really a ‘dish’ per se. They’re a technique. And to make things even more complicated, that English translation of ‘hand pulled’ really refers to **two separate techniques**: *Lamian* and *Chenmian*. \n\nThis distinction’s important. It’s why /u/oliverbabish tried and failed mightily at hand pulled noodles, while Inga Lam over at Buzzfeed seem to make them without a hitch – because Babish was trying to make Lamian (infamously difficult) and Lam was making Chenmian (common enough in home kitchens in China). Some other similarities/differences:\n\nLamian (拉面) | Chenmian (抻面)\n:--|:--|\nMade in restaurants | Made at restaurants or at home\nOften learned by going to special schools or apprenticing | Easy to pick up \nAlkaline Noodles | Non-alkaline Noodles\nRequires a finely milled flour (more on that later) | A finely milled flour is nice, but AP Flour can also be used\nRequires a special type of alkaline called penghui (more on that later) | All you need is flour, water, and salt\nRequires many fancy movements to get it to a pullable consistency, as alkaline stiffens dough | Only needs a long rest (three hours or more) to get to a pullable consistency\nOriginates from the Northwest, Lanzhou specifically, popularized throughout China by the noodle shops that bear its name | Can be found all across north China and even out into other spots in Central Asia\nDelicious | Delicious\n\nNow, both Lamian and Chenmian can come in different shapes. Likely the most classic version of both would be those spaghetti-looking sort, the kind that you’d probably immediately recognize as ‘noodles’. In this shape, Lamian is still called… Lamian. Easy enough. But perhaps confusingly, Chenmian in this shape can also be called Latiaozi (or, in some parts of the country, also Lamian… ugh).\n\nBut besides that, another common shape is wide-and-flat. If following the Lamian method, those flat sort are generally called *kuanmian* (宽面, literally ‘wide noodles’); if following the Chenmian method, they’re called… Biang Biang noodles.\n\nNow, we’ve already covered Biang Biang noodles, but I’ll include them too because they make a *great* introductory pulled noodle. So the way I’ll organize this post is by going over:\n\n1. *Biang Biang Noodles*. Wide-and-flat Chenmian that make for a great ‘my first pulled noodle’.\n\n2. *Chenmian, a.k.a. Latiaozi*. Spaghetti-like Chenmian that’re slightly more involved than Biang Biang (they’re at slightly more risk to break, and are a touch tougher to get thin).\n\n3. *Lamian.* Spaghetti-like alkaline noodles that are… a beast. The mount Everest of Chinese cooking. \n\nBefore we jump in with though, a quick word on flour.\n\n###What flour to use for pulled noodles?\n\nWhenever we do any sort of dough related thing, we end up getting a lot of questions on the subject of “Chinese flour”. Is it bleached? Is it lower gluten? Etc. There seems to be this nagging misperception out there that flour here is somehow materially different than flour in the West.\n\nIn truth, there’s nothing overly different about Western flour and Chinese flour. That’s not to say that everything’s 100% the same – it’s just that that there’s an equally large difference between, say, King Arthur and Gold Metal as there is among those and Chinese brands.\n\nAs always, there’s a few different variables that’re important when picking out flour:\n\n1. *Gluten/Protein content.* For this, we want a high gluten flour. Gives the noodle more bite. For Lamian you want a flour that’s more than 12% protein. For Chenmian, anything over 10% protein should work ok.\n\n2. *Age.* Flour changes as it ages. Fresher flour is stretchier than older flour. In an ideal world, your flour would be less than 6 months old. Matters much more for Lamian than Chenmian (notice a trend?)\n\n3. *Fineness.* The best flour for noodles and dumplings is quite finely milled, akin to an Italian 00 flour. Nice to have for Chenmian, but critical for Lamian.\n\nFor making Lamian, there’s actually a certain brand of flour most of the noodle shops tend to reach for called ‘塞北雪’ – [this is what it looks like, if you’re curious](https://imgur.com/TpccLTw). It’s 12.2% protein, usually used within a couple months of milling, and is extremely finely milled. But while that brand of flour is certainly a beaut to pull noodles with, extremely similar flours *do* exist in the West… in the form of Italian 00 flours.\n\nSo the TL;DR on flour is:\n\n* For Lamian, use an Italian 00 Pizza Flour. In the videos we used Caputo’s Chef Pizza Flour, which’s available online and popular among home pizza makers. It’s finely milled, pretty fresh, and is 13% protein. Works like a charm.\n\n* For Chenmian, 00 Pizza Flour is preferable but not required. All purpose flour is ok, just make sure that it’s not *too* low in protein. Our AP we usually use is 10.8% protein. \n\n**Wait, so for Biang Biang/Chenmian I can use AP Flour?**\n\nYes, that’s right. But you’ll make your life much easier if you do an autolyse first. In both bread and noodle making, this will develop gluten and make for a stretchier end result (hey, just what we want in a pulled noodle!)\n\n* Dissolve your salt with your water, then combine the water with the flour bit by bit\n\n* Knead for ~1 minute until everything comes together\n\n* Cover with a plate, rest for 30 minutes\n\n(note: in Western baking a ‘true’ autolyse is sans salt)\n\n---\n\n###Biang Biang Noodles\n\nSo ‘Biang Biang noodles’ ring a bell, it’s for good reason. Ever hear of the restaurant Xi’an Famous Foods? Began in the basement of a Flushing mall… adored by pretty much everyone including the late Anthony Bourdain… blew up with 15 locations throughout New York… spawned countless copycats throughout the Anglophone world? Biang Biang is the main offering on their menu. It’s a noodle that’s… easy to love. \n\nNow, [that recipe we shared previously?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/axyghr/recipe_biang_biang_noodles_with_chili_oil_topping/). It’s a good recipe. A lot of people’ve enjoyed it. Feel free to continue using that one if you’re already used to it. But by learning a couple basic hand pulled noodle techniques, the process can become even easier, I feel. \n\n**Ingredients, Biang Biang Noodles:**\n\n1.  *00 Pizza Flour, preferably, -or- AP Flour (中筋面粉), 200g.* If you do not use the 00 flour, do that autolyse beforehand.\n\n2. *Salt, ½ tsp.* \n\n3. *Water, 100g.* This dough is 50% hydration. Most pulled noodle doughs will be around that level.\n\n4. *Oil, 3 tbsp.* For coating the dough during resting. \n\n**Techniques, Biang Biang noodles:**\n\nAs befitting something with a grand total of four ingredients and made solely with your hands… pulled noodles are all about technique. Following a recipe for something like pulled noodles would be a little like reading a walkthrough for a game like DOTA 2. A great starting point no doubt, but somewhere along the way the onus falls on you to actually, like… get good.\n\nFor both this one and the following though, luckily that’s not going to be all that difficult. There’s just three techniques that you’ll need to know: hydrating, kneading, and pulling. \n\n**Technique #1: Cat Claw (猫抓手): A way to evenly hydrate your flour.**\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/kc56k8).\n\nWhat you’re doing is adding water to flour bit by bit, then rubbing the flour between your thumb and the back of your fingers. What you’re looking for is a final result called ‘suizi’ (i.e. ‘wheat grains’), which looks something [like this](https://imgur.com/LM98kpj). \n\nThe reason evenly hydrating the flour is so important is because we don’t want to add too much water to the dough. This is also one of the reasons why finely 00 milled flour can be so helpful – simply by how well the stuff hydrates.\n\nLike, add 50 grams of water to 100 grams of AP Flour. Do a rough mix with a chopstick, and you’ll get something [like this](https://imgur.com/JLDyxhX). Compare that against those ‘suizi’ from above, which was made with some finely milled 00 with the *same amount of water*. If you’re anything like me, you might look at the first picture and think to yourself, ‘damn, needs more water!’ But it doesn’t need more water – it just needs to be hydrated better.\n\nCat claw + autolyse is a powerful way to make even the most ‘meh’ of AP flours the hydrate like they should.\n\n**Technique #2: Making the Abacus String (算盘子): Kneading and aligning the gluten into one long rope.**\n\n[Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/ajYMI2a) an imgur album detailing the process step-by-step. I know it looks like a lot – it’s not that bad, I promise.\n\nBasically, you’re just kneading this stuff by repeatedly curling the dough into itself until you get one long log. Then you fold it in half, punch it down, and start curling again. It’s not necessarily any harder that the standard kneading motion for bread, just different.\n\nWe’re doing this because we not only want to develop the gluten network in the dough, but also *align* the gluten strands. The idea’s somewhat similar to the slap-and-fold technique in Western bread-making, albeit with a different goal in mind. The slap-and-fold gets the gluten into a sort of criss-cross pattern, while here we’re aiming for one long rope.\n\nWhen we go over Lamian below, this process becomes both insanely important and incredibly tedious. Luckily, for both Biang Biang and Chenmian, you just need to do this for ~8 minutes or until the dough gets smooth.\n\n**Technique #3: Biang-ing and Ripping the Noodle:**\n\nThis noodle gets its name from the characteristic sound it makes as it smacks the table. Far too few food names are onomatopoeias.\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/94ad9z).\n\nBasically, what you’re going to be doing when pulling is first rolling it out into a ~10 inch to ~2.5 inch sheet. Then, you’ll make a small indentation in the noodle with a chopstick – this will be your ‘ripping point’. Next you grab the noodle, smack it ~10 or so times against the table while pulling gently to lengthen it out.\n\nThe way you hold the noodle while pulling/smacking is quite important, however. If you pinch the dough at all, it can end up breaking. What you want to do is lay the noodle over your four fingers, and simply using with your thumbs to hold it in place- force shouldn’t really be applied. Here’s a picture of [what your hands should look like](https://imgur.com/EeI3XDK).\n\nOnce the noodles are about arms length, rip it in half at the indentation that you made your chopstick. We usually rip one end like we did in the above video, but you could rip both ends, or you could keep it in one big ‘loop’. Up to you.\n\n**Process, Biang Biang Noodles:**\n\n1. *Mix the salt with the ice water, then add water by ‘cat clawing’ the mixture into the dough. Press and knead for ~1 minute into a rough ball.* Refer to the ‘cat claw’ technique for detailed instructions. Once all the moisture’s absorbed into the dough, knead it real quick (as normal, like you usually would bread and such) to get it into a ball.\n\n2. *If using AP flour instead of 00 flour, cover and let rest for ~30 minutes.* \n\n3. *Move the dough to a work surface, knead using the ‘making the abacus string technique; 8-10 minutes.* Refer to the ‘making the abacus string’ technique for more information. What you’re looking for is the dough to have a smooth surface on both sides [like this](https://imgur.com/u10luQP).\n\n4. *Fold the dough length-wise twice; smack it into a rectangular box, toss in a bowl and rest for ~10 minutes.* From the previous step, you will have one long ‘rope’ of abacus string. Punch it flat. Fold it in half lengthwise twice to shorten it right up. Then smack it into a rectangle – it’s a bit tough to describe, so I’m going to [cheat with a streamable](https://streamable.com/jzv81k).\n\n5. *Roll the dough out into roughly a ~7x4 inch sheet.* No need to obsess over the exact measurements here, but that’s the size that we were working with.\n\n6. *Cut the dough into four long strips.* So each strip would be roughly ~1x7 inches.\n\n7. *Thoroughly oil a plate, toss on the dough strips, then oil them. Cover with plastic wrap in such a way that the plastic wrap is clinging to the strips themselves.* Remember – we usually use a few tablespoons worth of oil here for this step, so don’t be shy there. When you’re covering with plastic wrap, have the wrap cling to the noodles, to minimize air in the plate. That said, don’t go nuts - we’re not vacuum sealing.\n\n8. *Rest the dough strips for at least 3 hours and up to 8 (or overnight if need be).* We find 4 hours to be about ideal for resting. Going up to 8 is fine too – 24 hours is perfectly workable as well, but after that the dough will likely become a bit *too* soft and pull-y.\n\n9. *Remove a strip, patting slightly with a paper towel if overly oily. Roll it out into a ~2.5 to ~10 inch long sheet.* Exact size here’s nothing to obsess over, just what we find ourselves working with.\n\n10. *Biang the Noodle: Press down the middle of the noodle with a chopstick.* Refer to the ‘Biang-ing the Noodle’ technique for more details. The indentation in the noodle should [look something like this](https://i.imgur.com/ZHD06sW.jpg). After we slap the noodle longer, that indentation will be where we tear it open (to get an even longer noodle).\n\n11. *Biang the Noodle: Hold the noodle in your palm, lightly pressing with your thumb. Smack the noodle down against your work surface around ~ten times to lengthen the noodle.* Refer to the ‘Biang-ing the Noodle’ technique above for more details. You’re looking for [something about a meter long, like this](https://i.imgur.com/TVUKw9o.jpg). \n\n12. *Biang the Noodle: In the center of the noodle, push through the groove that you made with the chopstick and pull apart the noodle to get something even… longer. We break one end of it.* Tearing apart will look something [like this](https://i.imgur.com/TVUKw9o.jpg) – again, some people break both ends, and some keep the circular shape. \n\n13. *Boil for ~1 minute until it floats.* Work through your other noodles as each is boiling.\n\n---\n\n###Chenmian\n\nSo Chenmian are also referred to as Latiaozi, and – interestingly – in Xinjiang as ‘Laghman’. They’re basically going to be almost identical to our Biang Biang noodles from above, albeit in that long/round spaghetti-like shape.\n\nSo, this recipe is going to share a *lot* with the previous recipe. So I’m going to cheat and refer to the above recipe a bit. If you’re just perusing this post out of curiosity, the substantive differences are the “technique #3: pulling” and the process starting from step #6.  \n\n**Ingredients, Chenmian:**\n\nSame as the Biang Biang above.\n\n**Technique #1: Cat Claw (猫抓手)**\n\nAgain, [Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/kc56k8). \n\n**Technique #2: Making the Abacus String (算盘子)**\n\n[Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/ajYMI2a) that imgur album detailing the process step-by-step again.\n\nRemember, you’re just kneading this stuff by repeatedly curling the dough into itself until you get one long log. Then you fold it in half, punch it down, and start curling again.\n\n**Technique #3: Pulling the Noodles**\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/yznx53).\n\nOverall, the pulling technique for this noodle’s pretty self-explanatory. What you’ll do it roll it out a touch by hand (until it’s, say, ~6 inches long), then pull it. Once you can start to feel the resistance in the noodle, stop. Then continue to thin/lengthen the noodle by repeatedly smacking it against the table, ala the Biang Biang noodles.\n\nNote that there *will* be a limit as to how thin you can get the thing. What you’re looking for is something a touch thicker than fresh spaghetti, or about the same thickness as Japanese ramen. If you’re staring at a noodle that’s still a little too thick, you’ve got two options. First, you can fold the noodle in half and continue to smack in against the table. This’ll help things get a bit thinner, but you do have to be careful – it’s very easy for the noodle to break when folded. Second, you’re still working with a stubborn noodle, you can leave it there and let it rest as you work through the remainder – picking up again after five minutes or so, you can generally get it a bit thinner.\n\n**Process, Chenmian:**\n\n[Video of making Chenmian is here if you’d like a visual](https://youtu.be/qzAdiOhaZJs).\n\n1. *Mix the salt with the ice water, then add water by ‘cat clawing’ the mixture into the dough. Press and knead for ~1 minute into a rough ball.* Once all the moisture’s absorbed into the dough, knead it real quick to get it into a craggily ball.\n\n2. *If using AP flour instead of 00 flour, cover and let rest for ~30 minutes.* \n\n3. *Move the dough to a work surface, knead using the ‘making the abacus string technique; 8-10 minutes.* Refer to the ‘making the abacus string’ technique. What you’re looking for is the dough to have a smooth surface on both sides [like this](https://imgur.com/u10luQP).\n\n4. *Fold the dough length-wise twice; smack it into a rectangular ‘box’, toss in a bowl and rest for ~10 minutes.* From the previous step, you will have one long ‘rope’ of abacus string. Punch it flat with your fists. Fold it in half lengthwise twice to shorten it right up. Then sort of smack it into a rectangle – [streamable is here, again](https://streamable.com/jzv81k).\n\n5. *Roll the dough out into roughly a 4x7 inch sheet.* No need to obsess over the exact measurements here.\n\n6. *Cut the sheet in half, but be sure to pay attention to which side the long side was, as that’s the direction that we’ll be cutting.* Cutting this sheet in half is actually optional, but especially if you’re just getting started out I’ll be easier to work with shorter noodles.\n\n7. *Cut into 1cm strips.* Or roughly 12 strips per half-sheet, for 24 noodles total.\n\n8. *Thoroughly oil a plate, toss on the dough strips, then oil them. Cover with plastic wrap in such a way that the plastic wrap is clinging to the strips themselves.* Don’t be shy with the oil. Also,  when you’re covering with plastic wrap, have the wrap cling to the noodles, to minimize air in the plate – something [like this](https://imgur.com/u10luQP) is perfect.\n\n9. *Rest for 3-8 hours, or up to 24.* To relax the gluten. Again, 3 hours is the minimum here, we generally like it at around the 4 hour mark. \n\n10. *Remove a noodle, slightly pat off some oil with a paper towel if needed.* Sometimes it can get a bit too oily to work with.\n\n11. *Pull the noodles.*  Pull the noodle according to technique #3 above – remember not to get too greedy re thinness!\n\n12. *Boil the noodles until a touch past al dente, ~45 seconds, then shock under running water.* \n\n---\n\n###Lamian\n\nAbandon all hope, ye who enters this recipe.\n\nBefore we do anything, let me pass on you the advice one dude at my local Lanzhou Lamian shop gave *me* a number of years back when I was badgering him for tips on Lamian technique: “Give up. Do not try. You’ll never know how to make Lamian.”\n\nAt the time, I took it as a sort of ‘oh you’re just a foreigner, you’ll never understand’ kind of thing (the closest thing a white dude in China can get to a microaggression lol). Now, I understand the wisdom in his words. I wish we’d listened.\n\nThis is by far the hardest recipe we’ve ever done on our channel. It’s so tough that it makes Har Gow look like a relaxed weeknight dish. The only thing I can think of that can even come *close* to it is the proper sourdough-starter smiling Char Siu Bao, and that’s a recipe where commenters reporting failures outnumber commenters reporting successes about 10:1.\n\nSo just… stop. Turn back. It’s not worth it. Scroll right on past this, move on with your life. You’ve got the above recipes for Chenmian, right? Those are fun. You can impress all your friends with those. It’s good enough for most people – an untelling eye probably couldn’t even tell the difference.\n\nMaking Lamian, you **will** fail your first time. And probably your second. And probably many times after that. But if you keep at it… one day, things’ll click for you. And you can be content in the knowledge that you’ll be one bad-ass noodle maker.\n\n**Why is Lamian so hard?**\n\nSo like, Chenmian wasn’t too bad. Pretty much any intermediate home cook can make Biang Biang noodles. And while the thinner spaghetti-like sort might have a couple more moving pieces, in the grand scheme of things they’re not so bad, either.\n\nWhat makes Lamian *so* difficult is the introduction of alkaline.\n\nFor those of you out there that don’t live and breathe the world of Asian noodles, alkaline noodles have this *fabulous* bite to them. In the mainland this texture’s referred to as ‘tanya’ (弹牙), though perhaps you might’ve heard it called by the Taiwan term ‘QQ’. You could think of it sort of like… *al dente*. What makes alkaline noodles so beautiful is that they retain that sort of ‘al dente’ texture, even after being fully cooked. Alkaline is what makes Japanese Ramen, Japanese Ramen; it’s what makes Cantonese Wonton Noodles, Cantonese Wonton Noodles.\n\nAnd in my personal opinion, alkaline ends up being increasingly important as the noodle itself gets thinner. Super thin noodles can easily end up much too soft if you’re not careful – while I don’t think Angel Hair pasta quite deserves its bad reputation, I do believe that it would be a much better product if they added alkaline to the mix.\n\nNow, for most alkaline noodles the process isn’t all that hard. You add a bit of sodium carbonate to the dough (or a solution of sodium carbonate/potassium carbonate called Kan Sui/Jianshui), and continue along your merry way… rolling things out thin and either cutting them with a knife of a pasta maker.\n\nMaking an alkaline noodle that can *pull*? Alkaline stiffens dough! It’s like… a counter-intuitive proposition. Would almost feel like magic. And unfortunately for everyone trying to replicate this stuff outside of China? It kind of *is* magic – or at least, uses a magic ingredient. That is… Penghui.\n\n**Penghui**\n\nLet’s get something out of the way at first. Go on Amazon. Search “Penghui”. Find anything?\n\nAt least sitting here in the Spring of 2020, I can’t find jack. The only way to find Penghui is by ordering industrial quantities from Alibaba or through specialty middlemen (e.g. a place like ChinaHao).\n\nSee, penghui, traditionally, is the ash of a specific soda plant called ‘Penghuicao’, or Halogeton Arachnoidius in English. The old school way of making the stuff would be to burn the plant, then when it’s at a specific temperature to splash water in it. Apparently, it then forms a rock [like this](https://imgur.com/NBqqgYE). I’m not sure how any of that makes sense (ash + water = rock? someone help me here…), but then to use the penghui… you’d chip some of that off, mix it with water, then apply it to your noodles.\n\nNow, like the ash of many other soda plants, traditional Penghui was undeniably alkaline - probably from either potash or sodium carbonate. But besides that, it must’ve had *something* else in the mix, something that helped the noodles pull. While I can’t seem to find **any** information on the chemical composition of traditional penghui (feels like a fun thesis for any anthropology grad students out there lol), luckily for us… it actually doesn’t really matter. Because basically no one’s using that old school Penghuicao ash these days, either.\n\nWhether for economic or food safety reasons (depends on who you ask), in 1989 food science researchers from the Lanzhou University in Gansu developed a mix of additives that could be used in place of the traditional Penghui. And while it’s a matter of debate as to whether the explosion of hand pulled noodle shops in China over the last few decades is *because* of that innovation, it’s undeniably true that the spread of Lamian noodle joints and manufactured Penghui happened in tandem. Sometimes I joke that all those noodle shops around the country are really just a massive Penghui sales operation – a joke with a shred of truth to it, because if you peek back into the kitchens at Lamian shops, you’re almost guaranteed to be greeted with [the same blue bag](https://imgur.com/eurEgph) at each one.\n\nWhat’s in that blue bag? Well, I’m glad you asked. It’s:\n\n* 50% sodium chloride (salt)\n\n* 45% sodium carbonate. Can be produced at home by baking baking soda in an oven for ~1 hour at 150C.\n\n*  4% sodium triphosphate, a.k.a. STPP. An emulsifier that’s totally available in the West – actually, often it’s used in American supermarkets in order to make fish/shrimp retain more water (looks more plump, while also allowing them to sell you more water and less seafood). Here, the sodium triphosphate acts as a dough strengthener, making the dough less likely to break when you pull it. \n\n* 1% sodium metabisulfite. A reducer which is used as a preservative in winemaking, and also totally available in the West. The function here is to help relax the dough, making it easier to pull.\n\nNow, given that all of these components are available in the West, the question of whether we could just mix all this shit together naturally follows. And the answer is… kind of.\n\nIn the linked video, I try my hardest to make my own ‘homemade Penghui’ using those component parts. The problem is that we totally use about two grams of Penghui in one batch of noodles, so that means one 200 gram serving of noodles uses something like 0.02g of sodium metabisulfite and 0.08g of STPP. With those kinds of quantities, accurate **mixing** of the powders become absolutely imperative (you can’t make a solution either, as sodium metabisulfite quickly oxidizes when in contact with water). So without an industrial screw mixer, it’s really easy to, say, have some batches have a bit too much reducer… and some have not quite enough.\n\nBut does it work? Sorta. By taking every precaution I could think of making the homemade Penghui, we were able to pull it to a roughly spaghetti-thin noodle, but no thinner. \n\nI *would* recommend the homemade Penghui to experienced noodle pullers abroad as a stopgap between Penghui shipments. I *would not* recommend the homemade Penghui to a beginner. When learning, when you confront a batch of failed noodles you want to be sure that it’s your technique that’s the problem, and not your Penghui. So if you’re actually serious about learning Lamian, go on ChinaHao (or a similar website), bite the bullet and just… drop the $70 and buy too much Penghui.\n\n**Ingredients, Lamian:**\n\n1. *Pizza Flour -or- Chinese Lamian Flour, 250g.* The finely milled flour for this one is non-negotiable. Again, for standardization purposes, we used Caputo’s Chef Pizza Flour.\n\n2. *Ice Water, 120g.* So traditionally in the Northwest they use ice water in summer and tap water in the winter. The basic idea is that the ideal Lamian kneading temperature is around 28C, but shouldn’t really exceed 30. Why that is I can really find a compelling answer for, but the advice seems to ring true from experience. Of course, most of our kitchens are temperature controlled these days, so we would personally opt to use ice water all year long.\n\n3. *Salt, ½ tsp.* 2 grams. To be mixed with the ice water.\n\n4. *Any dense oil, e.g. Olive oil, ~3 tbsp.* Dense oils seem to ‘cling’ better to the dough while working it. We used Sichuan Caiziyou (virgin rapeseed oil), but olive oil also worked well in our tests. While working the dough you’re going to be **constantly** oiling your hands and the dough to make sure things don’t dry out. I’m giving an amount because it’s certainly true that some of the oil ends up in the dough itself. It’s approximate because it changed from batch to batch for us – we found that it ended up ranging between two and four tablespoons.\n\n5. *Penghui (蓬灰/拉面剂), 2g; to be mixed with 10g of water.* Again, if first starting out, I’d strongly advise biting the bullet and just figuring a way to source some Penghui. If you would like to try a homemade Penghui, this is how I did it. In a mortar, I pounded 100g of salt until powdery (super annoying), then did a quick pound of 90g of sodium carbonate, 8g STPP, and 2.5g (3/4 tsp) sodium metabisulfite. Be careful with the sodium metabisulfite – while this minuscule amount is probably ok, it would be more responsible for me to advise using PPE and/or going outside when using it. It’s not overly toxic or anything, but do not smell it as if it’s inhaled directly it can temporarily make you unable to breathe for a spell. Then I passed that through a fine mesh sieve a couple times, then mixed in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment on speed three for 30 minutes to combine. In hindsight it might have been a good idea to bake my salt first to ensure that there’s not excess moisture there. But regardless, store your mixture with food safe dessicants (i.e. those little silica gel packs that help absorb moisture). \n\n**Techniques, Lamian:**\n\nOk, so I usually like giving these ‘high level overviews’ of what’s generally going on before I dive into the weeds. But if I try to give a high level overview here, you’ll think I’m speaking a different language:\n\n* Cat claw the water into the flour\n\n* Knead using the making the abacus string method\n\n* Apply the penghui by either the three-fold-two-wrap method or the abacus string method\n\n* Comb the gluten\n\n* Test for pullability\n\n* Pull\n\nFeels almost easy when I put it that way lol. Some of these techniques are the same as what we went over before, but (1) the abacus string method will be more involved and (2) \n\n**Technique #1: Cat Claw (猫抓手)**\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/kc56k8).\n\nSame Cat Claw technique as above, nothing overly special going on. Just hydrate that sucker. \n\n**Technique #2: Making the Abacus String (算盘子)**\n\nOk, so this is probably the most complicated move on the list – it’s similar to what we covered above, only you’ll need to be a bit more paranoid throughout the process. [Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/24vympg) the imgur album detailing it step-by-step. \n\nJust like the above noodles, the basic idea is that you’re kneading it by continuously curling the dough. You get a long log of curled dough, then flatten the sucker out, then repeat. Getting the dough flat enough to be repeatedly curled up takes a bit of technique though. While you could theoretically crack that nut however you wanted (a pasta maker is one possible – but not necessarily easier - route), the common move is to (1) punch the dough down then (2) press it flat further by crossing your hands and smushing down the edges (3) repeating the hand cross flattening with your hands crossed in the *other* direction to make things totally even and flat.\n\nThis is the most important step in the entire process. At some Lamian schools, the final test is to make an entire batch of Lamian from start to finish in less than 20 minutes flat. Of those 20 minutes, this step right here takes about 15-18 minutes. \n\nYou’ll know you’re ready to move onto the next step when it can form a smooth hole if you tear it. [I like this visual right here](https://imgur.com/mppalAF). This was a batch of Lamian dough that was *almost* ready. The hole on the right is smooth, the hole on the left is jagged. You want the hole to look like the one on the right.\n\nThis might take you a long time to do it. The saying in Lamian making is that you need to do this “9 times 9 times” (i.e. 81 times). That’s ultimately just a saying though, because the number ‘nine’ sounds a lot like ‘a long time’ in Mandarin. But we’ve counted before. We tend to need 30-40 times of repeating this process to get to the point we need. This takes us about a half hour of kneading, but it’s very normal to knead for 40 or even 50 minutes when you’re just starting out. \n\n**Technique #3: Three folds, two wraps (三叠两包): Evenly apply your Penghui**\n\nWhen we add the Penghui, we’ll mix it with water first, then apply it bit by bit into the dough. \n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/ykp6n0).\n\nBasically, when you add the Penghui, it’s pretty important that it evenly gets incorporated into the dough. You don’t want bits of your Penghui water ‘spilling’ out of the though, so the three-folds-two wraps method helps keep all that inside.\n\nDon’t feel like learning yet *another* technique? No problem. You can also just continue to use the abacus string method from before – applying the Penghui when the dough is flat. You’ll just need to be good about only adding a *bit* of Penghui to the dough at a time.\n\n**Technique #4: Combing the Gluten/Testing for Pullability (拉条顺筋)**\n\nSo, there’s two ways to do this step. [This is a clip of the classic ‘twisting’ approach](https://streamable.com/dhlc7s) done in Lamian noodle shops, but let’s just set that one aside for now. We feel like it’s easier to use the following method of gluten combing, which also helps give a nice ‘test’ of sorts for pullability.\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/zwn5bf).\n\nBasically, what we’re doing is repeatedly pulling and folding the dough over itself, slapping it against the table between each pull. This’ll not only help strengthen the gluten network, but it’ll also help give us a ‘test of sorts’ to ensure that the dough is ready for pulling. If you can pull and fold it over itself at least five times without breaking (six is ideal), you are ready to move onto the next step.\n\nBut what if it’s not quite there? Well, now’s the point where you need to trust your hands and your instincts, and veer off-recipe. You’ll need more Penghui and more time kneading. Mix another batch of Penghui water, but maybe only add, say, a fifth of it at first. Use the abacus string method, knead it for a few more minutes. Then try to gluten comb again.\n\nNote that for this step, you need to make sure everything is super oily. Your hands, the table, your dough, everything. \n\n**Technique #5: Pulling (拉面)**\n\nOk, so I want you to get your expectations straight here.\n\nYou might have visions in your head about wildly pulling these noodles and putting on a show for everyone. You are not a Lamian master: do not try to do this. Your Lamian will become uneven and break.\n\nThis is a game of applying force evenly. It is not easy. It is entirely possible that you will do everything up to this step perfectly, but screw up here – getting some noodles that look thinner than angel hair, and some that wouldn’t be out of place in a Biang Biang.\n\nWork slowly and deliberately. If you fuck up, you fuck up – no shame there. But don’t fuck up because you were overconfident. The noodle cares not for your ego.\n\n[Streamable of the pulling is here](https://streamable.com/iii5sh).\n\nNotice that we’ll be adding some flour on the table for this step. Each time you pull, toss the center of the noodle in your little ‘flour mountain’ as you do it.\n\nYou’ll need five pulls to get to a ‘normal thin’ Lamian. That’s be about the same size as spaghetti – those can either be good in soup or stir-fried. Six pulls gets you to a ‘whisker thin’ Lamian, which’s usually what’s served in the Lanzhou beef noodle soup. Seven pulls gets you to ‘dragon beard’ thin Lamian… which’s thin enough to thread a needle, is completely insane, and way beyond our skill level. \n\n**Process, Lamian:**\n\nOk, got all that? Remember, high level overview:\n\n* Cat claw the water into the flour\n\n* Knead using the making the abacus string method\n\n* Apply the penghui by either the three-fold-two-wrap method or the abacus string method\n\n* Comb the gluten\n\n* Test for pullability\n\n* Pull\n\nAs always, [there’s a video too if you’d like a visual](https://youtu.be/6DgITQSonv4).\n\n1. *Mix the salt with the ice water, then cat claw the mixture into the dough.* Refer to the cat claw technique for details.\n\n2. *Knead everything into a ball, ~1 minute, then cover and rest for 30 minutes.* At the Lamian shops they’ll generally move straight on to the next step here, but we find that kneading’s a bit less painless with a quick rest.\n\n3. *After 30 minutes, remove the dough and roll it out into ~1.5 ft log. Thoroughly rub your hands and work surface with oil.* Again, make sure that everything is good and well oiled though this entire process. Rub your hands and work surface obsessively. \n\n4. *Punch down to flatten the dough. Then continue the making the abacus string method for ~30-40 minutes.* Refer to the ‘making the abacus string’ technique for detailed instructions. And remember: 30-40 minutes is an *estimate*. The timing will depend on your skill in doing this. It would be almost unheard of to do this in less than 15 minutes. I’d guess that it’ll take 40 minutes for a beginner. The dough will be finished once (1) small bubbles begin to form as you’re flattening it and (2) it forms a smooth hole when torn.\n\n5. *Combine the two grams of Penghui with ten grams of water.* Make sure it’s completely dissolved.\n\n6. *Flatten the dough ala the abacus string technique, then wet your hands with the Penghui water and apply it to the top of the dough. Then follow the three-folds-two-wraps technique outlined above.* Refer to the three-folds-two-wraps technique for detailed instructions. To reiterate, you can also just continue to use the abacus string technique here if you prefer – simply add the Penghui a bit more conservatively.\n\n7. *Fold the dough in half, roll it into about a foot and a half log, then liberally apply oil to your dough, hands, and table.* A well oiled situation is important for the gluten combing.\n\n8. *Comb your gluten.* Refer to the gluten combing technique for more information. If you can fold the dough over itself 5-6 times without breaking, you are ready to move onto the next step. If you can’t, go back to step five but add only a fifth of the Penghui water, and knead using the abacus string method for another ~5 minutes. Loop through these until you’re at the correct consistency.\n\n9. *Flour your work surface, pull the noodles.* Pull according to the pulling technique outlined in technique #5 above. Remember, work slowly and deliberately. We'd recommend five pulls for fried noodles, six pulls for soup noodles. Tear off the very end of the dough – that bit’ll be garbage, unless you got a better idea.\n\n10. *Immediately toss in some boiling water to cook.* Until just past al dente, ~45 seconds. If not eating immediately, you can flour them up… but try to devour sooner or later.",

        "body": "##How to use these noodles\n\n---\n\nOk, so great. You’ve got some noodles. How to actually make use of them?\n\nWhile I’m probably blanking on some stuff, there’s three basic ‘categories’ of dishes you can make with these guys: (1) soup noodles (2) mixed noodles and (3) fried noodles. You can make pretty much any these three things with any of these three noodles (with the possible exception of fried Biang Biang noodles… but then again I’ve heard Xi’an Famous Food’s famed Cumin Lamb Biang Biang is actually fried?)\n\nSo because I’m starting to run out of breath here, I’ll choose one dish from each ‘category’ so you can at least get an idea.\n\n###Soup Noodle: Lanzhou Beef Noodle Soup:\n\nIf I were a better recipe writer, I’d follow up the Lamian recipe with an equally long and involved recipe for the beef soup that’s traditionally eaten with it. And listen, it’s a good soup.  But after all the blood, sweat, and tears of testing La Mian, we… didn’t feel like researching and testing the soup.\n\nSo I’m going to cheat, I guess. [Here’s a recipe for Lanzhou Beef Soup, courtesy of the blog ChinaSichuanFood](https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/lanzhou-beef-noodle-soup/). Elaine’s stuff’s excellent as a rule of thumb, and in her recipe she was… smarter than us and just used packaged Lamian haha (not the same thing, but… is 100x the pain worth 3x the deliciousness?). While we might have some of our own opinions here or there (e.g. the chili oil used up in the Northwest is usually made with a milder chili closely related to Kashmiri), her recipe is great and the broad strokes of it would also be how we’d approach it.\n\nIf you’d like, you can also use Elaine’s recipe for the soup together with the Chenmian. While the very best Lanzhou beef soups would probably opt for something thinner than the chenmian (i.e. the six-pull Lamian), it would still be very delicious.\n\n###Mixed Noodle: Youpomian (油泼面)\n\nFor Chenmian or Lamian, (if served unfried or without soup) it’s probably most common to see them with a saucy stir fry topping called *gaizhaomian*. One example would be something [like this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Uyghur_Lagman.jpg). We have no recipes for that kind of thing off the top of my head (apologies), but could give you an educated guess if you were curious and pressed us.\n\nFor Biang Biang, probably the most classic 'mixed' topping is a chili oil based sort called Youpo Mian. But   there’s *tons* of other toppings use for Biang Biang, some of which I covered in a separate [Biang Biang noodle topping post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/dmwmvz/recipes_how_to_top_a_northwest_chinese_biang/). For the sake of brevity though, let’s just cover the chili oil one.\n\n**Ingredients, Chili Oil Topping:**\n\n1. *Leek (大葱), ~3 inch section.* Minced.\n\n2. *Garlic, 2 large cloves.* Minced.\n\n3. *Chili flakes (辣椒粉), 4 tsp.* In the Northwest, they actually use a slightly milder chili for their chili oil. It’s closely related to Kashmiri chili, so making some chili flakes out of kashmiri chilis would have a pretty authentic flavor to it. That said, we used the bog standard Chinese chili flake, and you could also use the red pepper flakes y’all get in the West. Korean chilis might also be a solid direction here.\n\n4. *Sichuan peppercorn powder (花椒面), ½ tsp, optional.* You could go either way for this one.\n\n5. *Light soy sauce (生抽), 4 tbsp.*\n\n6. *Dark Chinese vinegar (陈醋/香醋), 1 tbsp.* If you’re rolling through this recipe and this is the only thing you can’t source… eh… hmm… I dunno, use half cider vinegar and half balsamic. I just made that substitution up on the top of my head though so please don’t hold me to that. Or maybe just buy some, it’s a good ingredient. \n\n7. *Salt, ¼ tsp.*\n\n8. *Peanut oil (花生油), 5 tbsp.* To be heated up and poured over the chili flakes/garlic. A sizable quantity of oil’s important here to keep things slippery.\n\n9. *Baby bok choy (上海青), ½ or 1, quartered.* Optional, use whatever blanched green or vegetable you want. Bean sprouts are also hyper common.\n\n**Process, Chili oil topping:**\n\n1. *Mince up the leek and the garlic.*\n\n2. *While you’re cooking the noodles, toss the quartered bok choy in with it to blanch. Blanch for 45 seconds.*\n\n3. *Nestle the vegetable in and put all the non-liquid toppings over the noodles. Spoon the soy sauce and the vinegar around the sides.*\n\n4. *Heat the oil up until it’s just starting to smoke, ~215C, then pour it over the noodles, aiming for the chili and the garlic.*\n\n###Fried Noodle: Chaolamian (炒拉面)\n\nThis fried noodle can be made with both Chenmian and Lamian (I doubt Biang Biang would work, but hey – if you wanna be experimental). There’s many types of fried pulled noodles of course – this is a classic version that you can find at noodle shops with a tomato/chili bean paste base.\n\n**Ingredients, Chaolamian:**\n\nFor this specific recipe, we opted to use egg as the protein, but that’s basically just because we had some on hand. You could alternatively use lamb, marinated beef… or really whatever.\n\n1.\t*Noodles, 300g.* Chenmian or Lamian are both great. If you want to give this one a whirl without making hand pulled noodles from scratch, feel free to try this with… whatever noodle you feel like. Japanese Ramen (the proper sort, not Top Ramen), Sichuan alkaline noodles, longevity noodles, etc etc. \n\n2.\t*Eggs, 2.* To be beaten and scrambled. Or, your protein of choice.\n\n3.\t*Garlic, 3 cloves.* Crushed.\n\n4.\t*Tomato paste (番茄酱), ½ tbsp.* A real thing in Northwest cooking, I swear.\n\n5.\t*Sichuan Chili Bean Paste (红油郫县豆瓣酱), ½ tbsp.* Something I’ve learned recently – most chili bean pastes that I’ve worked with here in China are actually a sub-category of chili bean paste called ‘chili bean paste in red oil’. No wonder some people’ve had problems with chili bean paste-based recipes. *Sigh.* You’re looking for the sort that comes in a big red plastic jar, [like this](https://www.amazon.com/Sichuan-Pixian-Boad-Paste-Chili/dp/B01M31VHNZ). It’s also available (super overpriced) online.\n\n6.\t*Baby bok choy (上海青), 100g.* Sliced horizontally. Or, your veg of choice.\n\n7.\t*Light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tbsp.* For seasoning/use while stir-frying.\n\n8.\t*Seasoning: ½ tsp salt, ¼ tsp five spice powder (五香粉), ½ tbsp of dark Chinese vinegar (香醋/陈醋).* One of the few stir-fries that we’ll season with five spice powder directly. For the dark Chinese vinegar, there’s two big varieties in China – Chinkiang (镇江香醋) and Shanxi Mature Vinegar (山西陈醋). Both are ok here, though Shanxi Mature would be slightly preferred (we used Chinkiang). If working with Western vinegars, our suggestion would be subbing it with a ratio of 2:2:1 balsalmic:white vinegar:water.\n\n9.\t*Other vegetables for the stir-fry: Red onion (洋葱), ¼ quarter; Green mild chili (青椒), ½; Red mild chili (红椒).*  All sliced. For if you don’t feel like grabbing different color chilis you can also just use solely green or red mild chilis. Anaheims are perfect, poblanos would be a little spicy but still work. Bell pepper would also be acceptable. Red onion is for looks, yellow onion is also totally cool.\n\n10.\t*Toasted sesame oil (麻油), 1 tsp.* For finishing.\n\nYou’ll also need ~2-3 tbsp of oil for cooking the egg, followed by ~3tbsp of oil for stir-frying.\n\n**Process, Chaolamian:**\n\n[Video of the frying of the noodles is here](https://youtu.be/qzAdiOhaZJs?t=243) if you’d like a visual to follow along.\n\n1.\t*Crush the garlic, slice the onion and chilis into slivers, chop the baby bok choy, beat the eggs.* For the baby bok choy, cut slice the bit that ‘holds it together’ at the end, then chop into ~1 inch sections across the stem. For the eggs, really beat the snot out of them until no stray strands of egg white remain.\n\n2.\t*Scramble the egg.* However you want, I guess. But if you want to follow us, first *Longyau*: get your wok piping hot, shut off the heat, add in your oil (here about 2-3 tbsp) and give it a swirl to get a nice nonstick surface. Swap the flame to medium, then heat the oil up until it’s bubbling around a pair of chopsticks. Pour in the egg, let it puff, then pull the cooked portions to the sides of the wok, letting the uncooked bits set in the center. Then once it’s ~80% not runny… flip it. Shut off the heat, quick scramble, and reserve.\n\n3.\t*Boil the noodles.* Boil the noodles as per the recipes above, or whatever sort of package you’re working with.\n\n4.\t*Stir fry the noodles.* As always, first longyau. Piping hot wok, flame off, ~3tbsp of oil, swirl. Flame on medium then, immediately:\n\n* Garlic, in. Fry for ~30 seconds til fragrant. Scooch the garlic up the sides of the wok.\n\n* Shut off the heat. Add the tomato paste and chili bean paste. Swap flame back to low. The reason we shut off the heat before adding the pastes is because those guys love to burn. \n\n* Fry for ~2 minutes until the pastes have stained the oil obviously red. Up the flame to medium.\n\n* Baby bok choy, in. ~30 second fry until slight wilted.\n\n* Noodles, in. ~30 second fry until it’s all basically mixed.\n\n* Swirl the tablespoon of soy sauce over your spatula and around the sides of the wok. Super brief fry.\n\n* Salt and five spice powder, in. Super brief fry.\n\n* Onion/peppers in. Quick ~15 second fry.\n\n* Add back in the egg. Super brief fry.\n\n* Swirl the half tablespoon of dark Chinese vinegar over the spatula and around the sides of the wok. Super brief fry.\n\n* Heat off, drizzle the toasted sesame oil. Another mix, then out.",

        "body": "##Quick note to fellow Lamian geeks re dough conditioners:\n\n---\n\nForgive me for getting into the weeds for a second here, and definitely skip this if you don't live-and-breathe noodles and such. See, there’s been a subset of us Lamian nerds online that’ve been arguing about how best to make pulled noodles outside of China for, like, the better part of a decade. I’m feeling a little lazy to bump the ol’ eGullet thread though, so forgive me for chiming in my two cents here.\n\nRecently, I’ve seen a lot of hype surrounding adding either L-cysteine or nutritional yeast to the mix in order to get a pullable noodle. The former seems to be from reports that certain noodle shops in southern Japan use it as a conditioner, the latter from Tim Chin’s recent (very cool) [SeriousEats article on the topic of Lamian](https://www.seriouseats.com/2020/04/homemade-hand-pulled-noodles-lamian.html).\n\nI do have my doubts that either of these two additives alone could make a pullable alkaline noodle – Tim’s SE recipe specifically states that it (i.e. the deactivated yeast) can’t. I certainly understand the desire to make a Lamian recipe that doesn’t call for minuscule quantities of weird shit like Sodium Metabisulfite – on that note, I think Tim’s deactivated yeast is bloody brilliant. But it *is* still missing something, of course, else it’d also be able to pull with the addition of Kan Sui.\n\nThe thing that I think these reducer-focused recipes are missing is the emulsifier. On a whim once we tried applying solely salt plus a sprinkle of sodium metabisulfite to the dough, just to see what would happen. Adding *that* much reducer undeniably turns the dough into puddy, but after a pull or two the noodle **still broke**. The effect is a little hard to describe, but it feels like the dough loses its integrity… like a Chenmian that’s been sitting in the back of your fridge for a week. You need a *stronger* noodle – and that’s where the emulsifier comes in.\n\nEmulsifiers function as dough strengtheners. How exactly they differ from oxidizing agents, and why they don’t seem to sacrifice extensibility are both good questions that are beyond my pay grade. There’s a pretty good 2019 article on the subject of STPP in noodles called “The effects of phosphate salts on the pasting, mixing and noodle-making performance of wheat flour”, [link here](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.049). Adding STPP, particularly between the levels of 0.05% and 0.1% (note: we were at 0.04%), caused “an enhanced resistance to successive mixing and an improved capacity to sustain shear force”. I could certainly be misreading the paper (I uh… majored in Finance lol), so definitely don’t take my word for it, but the fact remains that the emulsifier seems to be an important component.\n\nBecause you know that classic blue bag of Penghui? These days it’s not the only name in the game. There’s another mix from a company called QBR that’s relatively popular and also works like a charm. Their mix? 42% sodium chloride, 35% sodium carbonate, 8% potassium carbonate, and 15% acetylated distarch phosphate. \n\nWhat’s acetylated distarch phosphate? …an emulsifier. Why are they bonding phosphate to a modified starch instead of using a phosphate salt like STPP? No clue. But notice, **there ain’t a single reducer in that mix**.\n\nBecause really, relaxing a dough’s easy. As evidenced by Chenmian… all you need is time, really. Keeping an alkaline dough from breaking after multiple pulls? *That’s* the ballgame.\n\nIn the future, I hope someone can come up with a similarly brilliant solution to the emulsifier problem as Tim did for the reducer. I do wonder if lecithin (potentially in combination with the nutritional yeast) might do the trick – if it does, people could potentially bake some baking soda to get some sodium carbonate, then everything needed for Penghui could be available at supermarkets in the West. Purely speculation though.\n\n##Lamian: What to do if you fail\n\n---\n\nOh no! You failed your Lamian. C'est la guerre. You hungry? It’s ok. You can still eat dinner.\n\nIf you have a pasta maker… fold the dough a couple times then pass it through, I dunno, the third smallest setting. Then cut it using the 2mm setting. Now boil.\n\nIf you don’t have a pasta maker, roll the dough out thin, then fold it a few times until the whole thing is roughly the size of your knife. Then cut it into ~2mm strips. Now boil.\n\nWe ate a *lot* of failed test batches. They’re still pretty tasty noodles to be honest. It’s not ideal because these failed batches end of breaking kind of easy when boiling, so sometimes you can have these weird ~5-6 inch long noodles. They won’t impress anyone, but hungry people definitely won’t complain.\n\nNot hungry? Just want to practice a bit more? Press your failed noodle together, then apply a bit of penghui to the dough, starting from step five. The additional Penghui will bring the dough to life – often Lamian shops’ll keep some dough in the fridge, then add some additional Penghui, and start with the gluten combing step when people order a bowl of noodles. You can use this trick to practice repeatedly with one batch – that way, you can work on your skills repeatedly without wasting ~an hour of your life each time. At some point, the Penghui’ll get too much and you’ll need to toss the dough, but hey, these components are pretty cheap anyhow.",

        "body": "Thanks for in creating this informative essay! The hard work also showed in your videos and it inspired me to try an experiment (though much smaller scale than yours!) in seeing how freezing might affect the dough. So after making some lamian based on your video (the non-alkaline one), I put some of the pre-pulled dough and some pulled noodles (mainly used pulled ends off noodles to reduce waste) into the freezer to see how if it would work. \n\nThe pulled noodles cook well from frozen and although not perfect, are still pretty decent, having a nice \"chewyness\" to them. I found that if you cook a pulled noodle from frozen it had higher chance to snap in half in the hot water, however if you let it defrost a little first until more soft, then it stayed long. \n\nFor the pre-pulled dough, the outer edge had a dried skin, however to my surprise i was able to somewhat pull out the noodle, although had to be super delicate and ended up with an irregular thickness. Picture here (https://imgur.com/a/Kp2sAZP). The noodle cooked well and tasted fine as well. It kept its shape after coming out of the hot water and withstood a quick stirfry. \n\nSo in summary, it is possible to freeze the dough pre-pulled, however not a particularly uniform or long noodle. Freezing the noodles after they have been pulled and then cooking after leaving to defrost for short period of time is probably best approach if you had to freeze.",

        "body": "Wow what an astonishing amount if effort you put into this post - thank you! I myself have been on the lamian journey over 2-3 years now with very little success. Over the years have seen more and more westerners contributing to the English speaking elth of knowledge whereas most of the resources when I had first begun were in Chinese. I have only successfully pulled beautiful noodles once and it was such a surprise. Since then I've become very good at kneading but still have yet to replicate those thin noodles. I have to go to work and this is a huge post so I haven't finished reading, but I'll add some preliminary thoughts so excuse me if anything I mention is already in the post. \n\nI did not use any alkali in the one success story, so I'm convinced it's not 100% essential. However salt is absolutely necessary. This paper, [effects of salt on gluten formation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0733521014000769) shows that salt can strengthen the gluten bonds but only to a limit, before it becomes a hindrance. From memory there is also a paper on the effect of alkali substances but I forget where. \n\nI have also learnt that, (without an alkali solution at least) your dough will take a significantly longer time to knead before being pullable when using high gluten flour. I agree that 00 flour is a good alternative to any specific noodle flour but you should also be conscious about protein content. Low protein flour may be easier to knead (good for practice!) but I'm not 100% sure if it's possible for consistent results. Again, my one success story was with ~10.6% protein I believe.\n\nOften times, any lamian failures have been turned into biang biang noodles which are so much easier, but less rewarding haha\n\nI'll add anything I remember to this post later, and will continue reading this post throughout the day but thanks to everyone who wishes to spread the joy of hand pulled noodles.",

        "body": "Making your own 蓬灰 by evenly blending a mix of these solid chemicals certainly sounds challenging. The ratio of the different quantities is really too skewed to do so successfully with just household tools.\n\nThe standard answer would be that you should first make aqueous solutions and then manipulate those. Both salt (NaCl) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) have a pretty long shelf life even when in solution. The biggest challenge would be that right after you made Na2CO3 from baking soda, you most likely (?) had the anhydrous chemical, whereas if you let it sit it might have turned into the monohydrate. So, you cold run into difficulties measuring precise quantities. No idea how important it is to hit exactly 45%.\n\nSo, I'd suggest making fresh Na2CO3 and then immediately mixing it with salt. You can then either store it dry. In that case, the salt would help a little bit to minimize the amount of error you introduce by allowing the Na2CO3 to slowly hydrate. Or alternatively, you could store it in solution. That way, the ratios won't change any more. And from what I can tell, in a clean bottle, a solution of NaCl and Na2CO3 should be shelf stable for a couple of years.\n\nSTPP is more challenging. If exposed to acids, it'll react quite rapidly. But even in an akaline aqueous solution, it can degrade within a couple of days; this seems more likely, if you don't manage to keep the bottle sterile, as there are different ways that it can biodegrade. In other words, STPP solution should be prepared right when needed, and you otherwise store STPP as a solid. In solid form, it has a long shelf life.\n\nSodium metabisulfite is even more problematic that way. It is pretty shelf stable when stored in a clean dry containers. But in solution, it'll react with all sorts of things. Don't expect a long shelf life from an aqueous solution. This chemical definitely should be stored dry and used within a couple of hours of dissolving it in water.\n\nMeasuring quantities of less than a gram is very difficult to do with common household equipment. But fortunately, both STPP and sodium metabisulfite should be relatively cheap. So, we could measure out something on the order of one to ten grams (much easier to do), and then dilute with water to the desired percentages. Then it is relatively easy to measure a small number of milliliters of this solution and to discard the bulk of the solution. At home, a syringe from the pharmacy is probably the best tool to measure out the amounts that are needed.\n\nThat way, we get precise measurements. It is still possible to mess this up, as mixing a large quantity of liquid is not *quite* as easy as mixing a cup of coffee. But that's a relatively easy problem to solve. Just keep stirring longer. Overall evenly mixing liquids is much easier than blending solids.\n\nOh, and instead of grinding your own salt, buy unflavored popcorn salt. That saves you one tedious step.\n\nI haven't bothered doing the math to come up with a reproducible set of instructions yet. But I feel that with some care, mixing solutions of the chemicals would be the best approach to make penghui at home in the US. Having said that, I still hope to find a way to source the ready-made known-good powder. Much less messy. And the rest of the noodle recipe is already complicated enough; no need to add even more complexity.",

Inspired by the lanzhoulamian I've had at a restaurant(and seeing the Noodle Master stretch it so easily) I've decided to make some. I've failed lots of times due to unclear instructions, but eventually settled on latiaozi, which I gotta admit is still pretty difficult. After quitting Noodle making and focusing on bread making, I've actually gotten a better grasp at the idea of gluten, and I'm excited to try out pulled noodles once again once seeing your post!!",

        "body": "/u/mthmchris this is INCREDIBLE, absolutely fascinating stuff. A ridiculous level of dedication to the cause. Do you have a full time job aside from the youtube? Because if so, I can't imagine you are able to do anything else with your time other than research!! (To be fair, sitting in the back of a Lamian shop watching the chefs intently and taking notes sounds like a fun Saturday to me :D )\n\nI live in Japan so I have access to awesome fresh ramen, and a slightly thicker variant called Okinawa Soba. My go-to 15 minute healthy-ish dinner these days is ramen topped with a vegetable+egg stir fry, and then loaded with all the usual suspects for topping dry noodles: soy sauce, black vinegar (I could DRINK that stuff..) , zha chai/pickle of choice, blanched greens, chopped scallions/chinese chives, chilli oil/sesame oil, MSG, etc. It's fun to experiment with these! \n\nFor the eggy veg topping, I've noticed that in your videos and others, egg stir fries in China tend to be very much based around cooking the egg 'well done' - it's basically scrambled and very much fully cooked, whereas I like them super runny: I basically stir fry aromatics with green veggies super quickly and then add beaten eggs right at the end, mix and pour onto the noodles - they only have a few seconds of heat in the pan so they're still super runny and I love the way they mix into the noodles and other toppings. \n\nI wonder if you know of any recipes in China where runny eggs actually do appear? Here in Japan they're everywhere, raw too is super common. (Tamago Kake Gohan, Natto+Egg, Oyakodon, etc..) If there's some kind of cultural difference, I wonder if food safety may be part of the reason why? \n\nThanks again for the AMAZING recipes and video man, truly doing gods work.",

They talked about it thusly:\n\n> The city of Lanchow, located in the Kansu Province, has a secret liquid called \"lye water.\"  Adding a few drops of this to noodle dough will make the noodles contract and become very firm. Lye water is made by boiling crushed bits of Lanchow rocks, and only using the top of the mixture. The rocks come from the Gobi desert, where weeds are cooked in holes to become charcoal. The charcoal is then frozen to harden it. The result is a man-made rock.  \n(Note: Lye water is also known as caustic soda. You *can* use it to cook, but be careful! It is highly corrosive with a pH level of 13 [strong alkali]).\n\nHope this proves to be interesting for people :)",

A trace amount in toothpaste allows it to scrape your teeth shiny clean; rawdogging your pearly whites with silica will do irreversible damage.\n\nSo, your safety tips for eating Forbidden Pop-Rocks are:\n\n1. Don’t.\n\n2. If you are going to casually eat one for a giggle, open the badboy up to make sure it’s actually silica pellets and not a different chemical entirely. If it is, proceed to rule 3.\n\n3: If you’ve identified it as silica pellets, swallow that motherfucker and do not chew. Make your dentist weep with anguish, not joy at a free paycheck.",

I did a lot of research prior to this post and cleaning my own shoes and I thought it was worth sharing to make people's lives quicker and easier.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Canvas (Vans):**\n\n1. Acquire a toothbrush, hot water, and baking soda or liquid laundry detergent or Jason Markk sneaker cleaner (best but most expensive method)\n2. Wet / scrub fabric with hot water and chosen cleaning solution, let sit for 10 minutes then rinse off\n3. Remove mid-sole stains with melamine foam (generic Mr. Clean Magic Eraser) (it removes a thin layer from material, so be careful) or the Jason Markk solution\n4. Fill with paper towels, then sit outside under sun outside for 2+ hours until mostly dry (do not let mildew; if they remain wet the will smell)\n5. After dry, insert a cedar shoe tree and store in room temperature area for 24+ hours; give the shoe time to rest\n\nProduct Links:\n\n* Melamine Foam (Generic Mr. Clean Magic Erasers):[https://www.amazon.com/Dr-WOW-Multi-Functional-Melamine-Cleaner-100x70x30mm/dp/B076Q7JHR2/ie=UTF8&qid=1546012835&sr=1-4-catcorr&keywords=melamine+foam](https://www.amazon.com/Dr-WOW-Multi-Functional-Melamine-Cleaner-100x70x30mm/dp/B076Q7JHR2/ie=UTF8&qid=1546012835&sr=1-4-catcorr&keywords=melamine+foam)\n* Cedar Shoe Tree (Cheapest Effective Shoe Tree):[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073Z1LLTZ/ref=oh\\_aui\\_detailpage\\_o00\\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073Z1LLTZ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\n* Jason Markk Shoe Cleaner (Optional):[https://www.amazon.com/Jason-Markk-Premium-Cleaner-Solution/dp/B00D12KGVW/ie=UTF8&qid=1546012682&sr=1-2&nodeID=7141123011&psd=1&keywords=jason%2Bmarkk&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Jason-Markk-Premium-Cleaner-Solution/dp/B00D12KGVW/ie=UTF8&qid=1546012682&sr=1-2&nodeID=7141123011&psd=1&keywords=jason%2Bmarkk&th=1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Leather:**\n\n1. Maintenance schedule:Harsh conditions - every 2 monthsRegular conditions - every 5 months\n2. Keep cedar shoe trees inserted when not in use to keep shape and remove sweat smell\n3. Remove excess dirt / mud with a \"soft\" wet rag\n4. Brush with horsehair brush\n5. Clean with Lexol Leather Deep Cleaner (orange bottle), wait 20+ minutes until fully dried (use cleaner sparingly), follow instructions on bottle\n6. Required if using leather cleaner: Apply Lexol Deep Leather Conditioner after cleaning, let sit for 20+ minutes minimum\n7. Brush after conditioning with the same brush\n8. If bigger scuffs remain, use your thumb with a dab of conditioner to remove. If this does not work you probably have to use a thin layer of polish to cover the scuff as it cannot be removed with ruining the finish.\n\n*AVOID: heating shoes to quicken drying (blow-dryer, etc.)*\n\n*NOTE: Your best bet with leather type is shell cordovan, it is incredibly resilient and easy to care for. Your best bet with a boot sole is going to be a Goodyear welt.

Stuff toe box with paper towels so the cleaner doesn't drip through.\n2. Wipe off dirt with cloth.\n3. Take an old toothbrush and rub the cleaner into problem areas.\n4. Wash thoroughly with water and make sure all cleaner is out.\n5. If needed, white toothpaste will whiten the mid-sole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Removing Smell:**\n\n1. Remove crap from inside of shoe / possibly replace insoles\n2. Buy cedar shoe trees in the appropriate size\n3. Leave in shoe for 1+ week, and when not in use from then on\n4. After prolonged use, slightly sand off a layer from the tree horn\n\nTip: Give shoes 24 hours to rest after wearing them for a day. Do not get shoes wet, dry out immediately if you do. Wear merino wool socks and apply Gold Bond Foot Powder.\n\nNote: Many people recommend silica packets, these are an incredibly temporary solution and are not sustainable. Others recommend sticking them in the freezer, typically this will cause moisture to build up in the shoe and upon \"thawing\" the shoe will become very damp and promote more bacteria growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Repairing Mid-soles:**\n\n1. Buy E6000 adhesive (generic version of shoe glue)\n2. Insert cedar shoe tree to keep shape\n3. Apply to separated area with a decent coat, removing excess with a paper towel\n4. Apply pressure and scotch / magic transparent tape to shoe, holding the mid-sole and shoe together for 24+ hours (use a clamp if the area is too large for tape)\n\nProduct Links:\n\n* E6000 Adhesive:[https://www.amazon.com/E6000-230010-Craft-Adhesive-Ounces/dp/B007TSYNG8/ie=UTF8&qid=1546013500&sr=1-1&keywords=e6000](https://www.amazon.com/E6000-230010-Craft-Adhesive-Ounces/dp/B007TSYNG8/ie=UTF8&qid=1546013500&sr=1-1&keywords=e6000)\n* Shoe Tree:[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073Z1LLTZ/ref=oh\\_aui\\_detailpage\\_o00\\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073Z1LLTZ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\n* Scotch Tape (or any \"magic\" tape):[https://www.amazon.com/Scotch-3105-Magic-Tape-Pack/dp/B071VP1PC6/ie=UTF8&qid=1546013781&sr=1-5&keywords=scotch+tape](https://www.amazon.com/Scotch-3105-Magic-Tape-Pack/dp/B071VP1PC6/ie=UTF8&qid=1546013781&sr=1-5&keywords=scotch+tape)\n* Clamp (optional):[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NQ4QQ0/psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NQ4QQ0/psc=1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Before / After Pics:**\n\nI followed this steps prior to writing this post; here are my results.

I use a paper towel and water or a bit of leather cleaner.\n\n- I use a Dyson to vacuum any dust or dirt on laces.\n\n- For the soles I use my electric toothbrush (with a head dedicated for cleaning shoes) with a solution of warm water and a bit of Tide Free & Clear (no fragrance).  I scrub and then wipe down with wet paper towels  then dry paper towels and let dry. Try not to get water on leather.\n\n- For laces I vacuum them, then use a fresh batch of water & Tide solution and let them soak for an hour or so. Rinse and let dry.\n\nThis works well for me, hope this helps some of you!",

Here is the mathematical definition:\n\n>In physics and mathematics, the dimension of a space or object is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it\n\nThe 3 dimensions of PHYSICAL space are just a single application. With just one scalar quantity, we have enough information to define a line, say x= 5. With two scalar quantities, we can define a plane (image taking a line and stretching it out orthogonally). These two quantities can act as coordinates for any point on the plane. With a third quantity, we can take that plane, and again stretch it out orthogonally and form our three dimensional space. It is three dimensional precisely because we need three quantities to define it.\n\nBut dimensions doesn't always have to refer to physical space. What if you had a person and each person had the only two characteristics, being height and weight? We'd essentially have created this abstract \"space\" for which we would need two characteristics to span any possible combination. The dimension of this space would then be two. Theres many many things that could form an abstract \"space\". \n\nHigher dimensions have very many uses, either abstractly or in physics. Indeed, even the dictionary definition gives \"a measurable extent of some kind, such as length, breadth, depth, or height\".\n\nThe 3 spatial dimensions and time are combined together as a 4 dimensional space for example. The properties of this crystal require five characteristics, of which the three are its positions in physical space, to entirely define it.\n\nTLDR: Yes, its a fucking dimension.",

Some colored filaments also burn clean, but it’s hit or miss—you have to test them. Some leave behind nasty ash, which is why translucent PLA is my go-to.\n\nNext, I made a sand mold using fine silica sand mixed with sodium silicate. After freezing the mold for about 1 hour and 30 minutes, I transferred it to my microwave kiln for burnout.\n\nI then preheated some iron with a blowtorch and placed it in my microwave furnace. Preheating isn’t strictly necessary, but it speeds up the melting process, so I always do it when working with iron.\n\nI microwaved it at full power for 40 minutes and poured the molten iron into the mold, which I had wrapped in aluminum foil tape. The tape helps hold the mold together in case it cracks.\n\nTo rust the chicken, I used salt water. I dunked it, let it dry, and repeated the process about 6 or 7 times.

    "body": " Pineapple  Opals are rare type of opal that is found only in the White Cliffs region of New South Wales, Australia. They are named for their distinctive shape, which resembles a pineapple. Opal pineapples are formed when ikaite crystals, a type of calcium carbonate, are replaced by opal. Ikaite is an unstable mineral that only forms under very specific conditions, such as those found in the White Cliffs region.\n\nOpal pineapples are very rare, and only a few hundred have ever been found. They are highly prized by collectors, and can fetch high prices.\n\nThe formation of opal pineapples is a complex process that takes millions of years. The first step is the formation of ikaite crystals. Ikaite crystals can only form under very specific conditions, such as low temperatures and high pressures. In the White Cliffs region, these conditions are met in the Cretaceous sediments.\n\nOnce the ikaite crystals have formed, they can be replaced by opal. Opal is a type of hydrated silica that forms when water and silica are present. The opal slowly replaces the ikaite crystals, eventually forming a solid opal pineapple.\n\nhttps://www.geologyin.com/2016/08/gorgeous-opal-pineapples.html",

However, there wasn’t an ice age at this time, but there was an ice age c. 135 million years ago.\n\n>Globally elevated temperatures during the Cretaceous extreme greenhouse climate interval were punctuated by the Valanginian cooling event, which was characterized by a positive carbon isotope excursion, global cooling and a glacial event approximately at 135 Ma.\n\nAlso, south-east Australia was close to the South Pole.\n\nSo it is likely these Ikaite pineapples are 135 million-year-old, and the lower part of the Doncaster Member is older than we think, c. 135 million years old.\n\nWang, T., He, S., Zhang, Q., Ding, L., Farnsworth, A., Cai, F., Wang, C., Xie, J., Li, G., Sheng, J. and Yue, Y., 2024.

Just buy a 500 gram or 1 kilogram container, place it with the lid off inside of a zip lock bag along with the phone.\n* Liquid drain cleaners (sold under names like \"Liquid Fire drain unblocker\") at hardware stores that contain sulfuric acid will also absorb water very effectively. Ensure it is not one which contains sodium hydroxide in liquid form, as this will not absorb any more water. Sulfuric acid based products of this type are easily identifiable because they usually come in a transparent plastic bag around the bottle. Put the phone in a zip lock bag along with a glass cup or bowl of the acid.\n\nHopefully I don't need to mention to be careful handling the substances in the later two suggestions... The first option is going to be MUCH quicker because not only is the air hot but it is flowing at great speed and volume through/around the phone.

    "body": "The human was wandering around the yard, poking his nose into little corners and out of the way nooks. Ursal was used to humans poking around, but they never bought anything, so he didn't pay any attention. That is, until the human came over and waved him down from the platform.\n\nUrsal went over and inquired what he could do to help the creature.  It seems there was an item the creature actually wanted to buy, half buried under a pile of motors and pulleys.\n\nUrsal wasn't even sure what the thing was, or where he had gotten it. He guided his overhead crane operator using hand signals and had the lump of oddly shaped scrap pulled out and loaded on a trailer. He charged the human scrap weight for the thing, and after bidding the human good day, promptly forgot all about it.\n\n\\------\n\nJac’in was a specialist, in many senses. He dealt in vintage parts. He knew who had them, who needed them, and what it would take to get them. Most people would call him a broker, but Jac’in liked to say he dealt in \"rare antiquities\".  After all, there were only 3, maybe 4 sophonts in the sector who worked in the same field. One day, Jac’in got a comm from a potential customer who was looking for a whole list of parts. Jac’in could practically feel the credits falling into his lap.  He began compiling a list of known sources, and later that rotation sent a quote to the new client. He received confirmation almost immediately, along with a down payment. He started to gather parts.\n\n\\-------\n\nDwayne grabbed the box of parts from the porch, and hurried to his workshop, he had been slowly rebuilding a vintage machine since finding it in the dump last year. He had spent a small fortune sourcing parts, and waited for weeks and months for them to arrive, since a number were literally shipped from other star systems. This package should contain the last wiring harness, and several 1 inch precision ball bearings.\n\nDwayne spent the better part of his next rest cycle installing the wiring harness and figuring out how to power the thing with modern power cells. He had to design a small voltage converter and power regulator circuit, but it was a relatively simple fix. He had already spent several weeks touching up the original paint, and installing the old controlling electronics. He had replaced most of the moving parts at this point and a hefty number of the non moving ones. He held his breath and flipped the switch. There were flashing lights and buzzers going off everywhere. Dwayne smiled broadly. He began to run diagnostics and sort out any problems.\n\n\\------\n\nDwayne backed his trailer into the loading bay, and felt the soft bump that meant he was flush against the wall mounted bumpers. He threw his car into park and jumped out. He climbed up on to the dock, and unlocked the loading bay door, rolling it halfway up. He saw one of his employees moving some boxes in the warehouse area, and told him to call over a few guys to unload the new machine.\n\nHe pulled the straps off carefully and pulled off the tarp. He was just finishing when three of his employees walked up. Between the four of them they managed to wrestle the device onto the dock, and then get it on some furniture dollies. They then rolled it to the front part of the building where it was placed near the front doors. Dwayne grabbed some cleaner and a soft rag and cleaned off all the fingerprints from the genuine silica glass. He couldn’t believe his luck finding it intact in a junkyard. He went over to the counter and grabbed a few special tokens and then walked back to the machine. He reached underneath the front edge, and flipped the power strip. The 1990’s era pinball machine powered up, and the screens, made from hundreds of individual LEDs lit up. Dwayne slotted a token in the coinbox, and pressed the 1-player button. A shiny ball bearing popped out, and Dwayne popped the plunger to shoot the ball up the ramp.\n\nHe was so focused on the game he didn't hear the other arcade machine come to life as the employees prepped to open, he didn't hear the doors open as families came in to play the old earth games, and he didn't notice, until his last ball drained, that there was a crowd of xeno kids standing around watching him play. When he finished a little Meresk asked if he could play, and Dwayne showed all the kids how put down tokens so they could claim a spot to play.\n\nIn a little over two months the device had paid for itself, and was starting to earn Dwayne a nice little profit. Most of the Xenos were terrible at the game, but were fascinated by it, and kept trying to figure out how to place shots where they wanted them to go. When Dwayne would come up and give a demonstration of his skills, all the kids would crowd around and watch as he would stall the ball on the flippers, or pop a flipper button at juuuust the right time to get a skill shot. Once, when he got a multiball play, the entire crowd cheered as he kept all the balls from draining out for almost five minutes. It wasn’t long before he got a new modern machine, but it was never as popular as the vintage one, because it was just screens and a physics engine, it was basically a video game. It didn’t *feel* the same. Dwayne watched as the kids pumped credit after credit into the old device, and thought “Just don’t make them like they used to.”",

    "body": "Hey everyone! Due to a recent posting of misinformation being spread on here, excessive worrying over ingredients, and people PMing me for advice I figured I would just make a post about this to help other people with similar questions\n\nFor background, I am a chemist- in particular a biochemist. I used to work in a research area that focused on mineral/ion- skin absorption. I'll try to hit the ones that aren't in the side bar already and separate them out by category for easy viewing. Let me know if I missed any big ones!\n\n**Emulsifiers - keep oil/water based chemicals from separating in products**\n\nMost common products I see contain polysorbates, laureth-4, glyceryl monostearate (also pearlescent agent)\nlauramide DEA (also foam booster), or potassium cetyl sulfate. There's also stearic acid that also helps with cleansing. These aren't necessarily bad for you nor are they good for you. They're kinda meh ingredients that exist to make the product work \n\n**Preservatives- extend their shelf life and are anti microbial**\n \nparabens- these get a lot of flack but there isn't that much research confirming their 'toxicity'. The [original study] (http://www.dr-baumann.ca/science/Concentrations%20of%20Parabens%20in%20Human%20Breast.pdf) that brought them into the spotlight was over hyped by the media and dozens of other studies done afterwards have yet to find a definite link to cancer or other diseases. These are however very great preservatives\n\nBenzyl alcohol containing products has been known to dry some people out due to it's status as an alcohol. Aside from a preservative it's also used as a ph balancer\n\nformaldehyde- if you see this in a product, you may want to be wary. The World Health Organization has determined this to be a carcinogen; however whether trace amounts are as bad for you is still unknown\n\n tetrasodium EDTA/ disodium EDTA- normally these are used to draw metals out of the blood, but in terms of skincare, both work to stabilize the product by binding other chemicals. Only concern with this one is that it's an environmental hazard \n\nPhenoxyethanol -  an antimicrobial \n\nethylhexylglycerin - helps with eczema and also works for some people with rosacea \n\n**Moisturizers : Lipid thickeners - give product it's creamy consistency**\n\ncetyl alcohol, stearic acid and carnauba wax are the big ones- aren't bad, rarely cause things like breakouts for most people. These are also good at protecting the moisture barrier from water loss by forming a 'seal' \n\n**Moisturizers : Natural thickeners - come from nature, usually work as humectants (think hyaluronic acid)**\n\nhydroxyethyl cellulose, guar gum, xanthan gum and gelatin are the most popular\n\n**Moisturizers: Mineral thickeners - also natural, absorb both oils and retain water**\n\nmagnesium aluminium silicate, silica and bentonite are the big ones here. A lot of clay masks and some silicone based (neutrogena) sunscreens are apart of this category. Silicone based sunscreens are great for those who's skin can handle them since they keep oils/shine in check while also preventing your skin from overdrying\n\n**Moisturizers: synthetic thickeners - used in a lot of gel type products and some of the rich/smooth white creams**\n\ncarbomer, cetyl palmitate, and ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate are common ones\n\n**Emollients - soften the skin by preventing water loss, work as humectants,  definetly want these in your routine**\n\nbeeswax, olive oil, coconut oil and lanolin, petroleum jelly, mineral oil, glycerin, zinc oxide, butyl stearate and diglycol laurate , urea, glycerol, propylene glycol or lactic acid are big ones here.\n\nSome of these are termed 'comedogenic' like coconut oil but many many people don't break out from them so that's a pretty arbitrary rating imo\n\n**Edit- here’s a couple more I forgot to add that are sunscreen relevant**\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate-** protects against UVB and not UVA rays. It is not very stable either, when exposed to sunlight, it kind of breaks down and loses its effectiveness (not instantly, but over time - it loses 10% of its SPF protection ability within 35 mins)\n\n**Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane-**  famous Avobenzone. It is the only globally available chemical sunscreen agent that protects against UVA. It is the global gold standard of UVA protection and is the most used UVA sunscreen in the world. Suprisingly it’s in moisturizers too.The problem with it, though, is that it is not photostable and degrades in the sunlight. Wikipedia says that avobenzone loses 36% of its UV-absorption capacity after just one hour of sunlight",

    "body": "Hi guys! \n*For title it should be Lasers/Skincare/Beauty Hacks\n*I have tan skin so lasers are a bit complicated due to risk of hyperpigmentation I.e. IPL not mentioned\n\nDISCLAIMER: PLEASE double check this with the science, before/afters, own skin and goals, and research articles. I'm not a dermatologist but a majority of my friend circle are physicians and we all do this anyhow before trying anything. I don't have time to cite articles etc and this is just MY experience SO I thought after spending so much money and buying all the overhyped products I should share what worked for me to reduce my skincare regimen and allow me to be makeup free for work. \n\nSo I've been deep into skincare for a long time and I wanted to officially share it as a lot of my friends asked me to. We don't gatekeep here and I thought Reddit would be the best place. My background: I'm into digital portraits and it requires an understanding of good ratios of the face. I'm also into deep diving into skincare hacks like all of us. Here's what I think works off the top of my head.\n\nProcedures\nUltraclear + Coring: forget ponytail facelifts, lip lifts, belphs, skinpinch, brow lifts, etc until you try this first. A good tech can get you the results you want. Ask to core where you want max lift. Make sure they pass with all the levels. It's painful so use your own numbing cream (I think some Russian brands are stronger available online), numb for a long time, and opt for the laughing gas or whatever. Make sure to have them use eye shields for your eyes. Have them core in the direction of the lift you want. Ask for a map of how they did it. \nYou'll want 2-3 over a year to get the full lift you want. Nothing supersedes this procedure. For healing: 10% vinegar soaks + ointment + Benev exosomes + Alastin skin nectar. Hydroquinone to prevent spots from forming. \n\nMoxi Level 3: It works REALLY well but it's a baby compared to Ultraclear. Make sure to try level 3 for maximum lift. You can do a series of 3 if you're not ready for Ultraclear. \n\nFontana 4D: It also works REALLY well and can contour your cheeks skin the buccal fat removal. Moxi Level3/Fontana 4D def made me hot again after 20lb weight loss causing signs of aging before my wedding.  Again do a series of 3 for max results.\nUltraclear did the most though, I would do all 3 until I die or go broke.\n\nBBL Laser: It works and makes you look like you have foundation on (and gets rid of under eye darkness) but because of techs fears of hyperpigmentation (a real fear) it's hard to find someone to do it. \n\nPRF/EZGEL: My under eyes looked better but also the swelling stretched out the skin so it also looks worse? Not worth it. PRF or PRP is useless, the gel is the only thing worth trying. \n\nLaser Hair Removal: Make sure they are using the newest machine that is practically painless, find a center that does a full body membership it's cheaper, you'll need 8-12 sessions. The painless one is worth it just get it done all over at \n\nMorpheus: painful and melts fat stay away. I did it 3 times, it got rid of my beautiful under eye fat pads, it slimmed my buccal fat, and it got rid of some acne though. It's not worth it due to pain and fat melting and lack of skin tightness effects it so claims. \n\nKatalyst EMS Suit >> Emsculpt: They cost the same and both work but you can keep Katalyst for life. Just use settings on abs/butt and get up to level 400,  you can thank me later! I had Emsculpt 5X on butt and AB's, it works temporary, now we own. 2 Katalyst suits and they make sure fit whenever we want and honestly just as fast. \n\nEmsella: Amazing for sex drive and preventing or helping with prolapse issues! Also works for urinary issues post kids :). Do 6 sessions for prevention and amazing sex. \n\nCoolsculpt: Bullshit. Can burn skin btw. \n\nHIFU: Melts fat. But it works:) so use in the right areas. \n\nJ Plasma: feels like lightening bolts attacking skin and limited outcome, stay away. \n\nPDO Threads: Forget it, painful, invasive, temporary. \n\nOmnilux Redlight Mask: Get the MENS version. It works. \n\nJovs: it breaks apparently l but I'm gonna try it and update yall later. Also curious about Amiro devices given what they say they do/tech they use. \n\nZIIP Halo + Silver Gel >Nuface: It works better than all the other main home microcurrent devices I've tried (nuface, medicube, 2 others on amazon) get the silver serum as daily easy skincare. Forget the other ones. \n\nThings on my list:\nSofwave, Emface (per reviews sounds useless?), Syllifirm, Profound, comment and lmk I'll try it if it sounds safe and effective. \n\nInjections: \nBotox: Prevent wrinkles (but tbh this is BS until you have a baby line forming), get rid of wrinkles, shrinks muscle. What I've liked: TMJ/Jaw Slimming (30-50U per side), TRAP TOX (amazing and makes your neck longer), LIP FLIP, NOSE TIP, BROW LIFT (only do the tail of the brow not the whole brow) and PLATYSMA (prevents face sagging and actually works, prob the most underrated and important area for Botox!).\n\nFiller: Deep Lasers (\"lift\" = volume) >> Sculptra (natural body makes volume) >> Slow Down on Fillers >> Injector >> Price/Injectable. Fly to the right person LA, Miami, or New York. Make sure the area they inject, they do often. Treat multiple areas BUT WITH 1/3 THE ACTUAL DOSE you want and go again twice. This prevents the botched look. Dissolve overfilled lips, it hurts, but it's worth it.\n\nALA/Glutathione/Vit C: Shrinks pores and evens out skin tone. Make sure to add ALA for max pore shrinking. It also helps regulate sugar. You can also opt for liposomal. Go to a reputable IV center and make sure to have labs to get ALA. \n\nPeels/SkinCare:\n30%+ Glycolic Acid On Body - Fast way to clear scars and evens out skin tone. Start low and increase slowly to prevent a burn. \n\nTCA Peel - Amazing for anti-aging tbh. But go to a spa and have them do it (face or full body) because it's more serious. \n\nMusely Spot Cream - Amazing stuff if you're lazy like me and don't like to do 100 things. Combines all the stuff you want for face skincare.\n\nApostrophe Triple Cream for Rosacea - Top 3 ingredients that work for rosacea in 1 bottle. Also look into low dose naltrexone. Also moxi or ultraclear helps.\n\nBenev Exosomes + Microneedling: Use for scars and face/body with a home microneedling pen (max the number of needles Dr Pen is good).\n\nCalecium Exosomes + Microneedling: A godsend for hair growth. \n\nRetinol Gel .1% + Stack With Hydration: get it prescribed. Level up to max %, look up how to layer with coconut oil/moisturizers/Benev to prevent the ugly phase (breakouts, dry skin). Don't need if have Musely spot cream or alternate days.\n\nClindamycin/Benzyl Peroxide Compound Cream: Get it prescribed and store it fridge now. It's the only thing that reliably clears up my acne overnight (I've tried dozens of acne products over 16 years). \n\nAlastin Skin Nectar: My main moisturizer post laser. * Wanted to add for Daily I use Prakti Maha mask because it works like under eye filler almost when you stack it on and gets rid of my acne without extra stuff about 60-70% of the time. I combine with Clarins double serum or snail stuff just depends. Also considering plated exosomes.\n\nOurself Lip Plumping: If you don't want lip filler or just want to maximize lip size try this brand it's from the makers of one of the actual fillers and it works.\n\nMinoxidil>Grandelash>Latisse: Latisse darks eyelids /under eyes and lose eye fat so stay away!! It's so hard to get that fat back!! Use castor oil for eyelash durability and oral minoxidil for eyelash growth. \n\nPills:\n\nOral Minoxidil: Max your eyelashes and hair volume\n\nLow Dose Accutane: Freeze eggs before doing this. Derm will prescribe for chronic acne especially if on back etc. It will also help reduce size of tip of nose if issues with rosacea or thick skin. Gets rid of acne but horrible side effects even at a low dose. \n\nSpirinolactone: NOT FOR ME - will give me headache, dehydration, makes me dumb because I'm so dehydrated, worse breakout for months, also just not worth taking this pill. It may work for others?\n\nEyes: Lumify (duh) \n\nHair: Nanoplastia > Keratin Straightening > KBond20 > Olaplex > Dyson \n\nTeeth: SMILE Whitening (in office dental procedure) INSANE will get you white instantly Request for double frequency teeth cleanings Purple Toothpaste = Safe Alternative to Home Teeth Whitening that works better Boka Nanohhydroxy Toothpaste (so you don't loose enamel) Toothbrush with Water Flosser Combined (another lazy girl hack) Therabreath (contains xylitol known to prevent cavities)\n\nMind Hacks: TDCS headband :) works for insomnia, works for mood I'll copy past all my comments into above later I use Elemind headband + Calm Sleep Powder for sleep after having sleep issues - (don't want to take meds, Benadryl is very bad for long term health and linked to increased dementia risk)\n\nMultivitamin: Make sure it has 5 methylfolate not \"folic\" acid. Try pure encapsulations or if you want to eat food-source multi try TEND prenatal bar chocolate flavor. \n\nVit D: Try to get level to 60-90 it's suppose to help with a lot of things including depression!! Alzheimer prevention! Even used by oncologists to decrese cancer risk!! I take 50k unit every week and recheck my level after a month to make sure it's atleast 80. I used to have depression. \n\nAstaxanthin: 2000x more potent antioxidant than Vit C. It can give you an orangish glow if you overuse or if you're aiming for that! I used to use Vit c and other antioxidants. \n\nOmega 3/DHA (fish derived not algae!): Take it or eat fish it's good for you. DHA 1000mg I've been using for 10 years and it makes me smarter and remember more for exams etc.\n\nSilica Drops + Collagen 10G Daily w Hylaronic Acid + 100G Protein Daily > Nutrafol > Biotin/Hair Nail Vitamins: yes the standard female nutrafol works, I prefer Minodixil it's faster and better for me and less big pills lol.  \n\n1G Water A Day - Eat good food, drink water. Take collagen, eat protein 100G daily, fat 50G daily. Otherwise this is useless. ADD POTASSIUM (prime powder packets) to SLIM FACE SWELLING. Add gua sha or lymph suction drainage also to help. Sauna/Ice Water on Face also works. \n\nLow Fat is a FAD - Hit 50G fat a day - obv is you need to optimize weight lower calories and cut inflammatory food like most non vegetable carbs. You can take a food allergy test also and optimize. For example no tomato skins, no onions for us. \n\nExercise (weights good for bones: BUT for brain benefits it's only with aerobic workouts!): increased bdnf and prevents depression also improved blood flow from skin - look into the research and thank me later - you need to burn 1200cal a week to hit this \n\nDairy Does Cause Breakouts - cut it out and see if there's a change for acne \n\nColustrum: ARMRA works better than others but they all work. It's good for gut health aka good for skin.\n\nSeed Probiotic: the best strains here. \n\nRosacea/Autoimmune Skin Stuff: Look into low dose naltrexone and astaxanthin. Autoimmune issues cause the face to look puffy! \n\nPCOS/Hunger Cravings: Inositol 6G powder or gummy inositol/myoinositol Vitamin: Tend Prenatal Bar (hate daily pills) Gummy CoQ10 200mg Tru Niagen NAD+ (gives me energy) OM matcha mushroom powder (this flavor specifically has a blend that makes me happy/laughing next day, I use when stressed) Silica Drops (makes my hair shiny, nails stronger within weeks) Zinc Picolinate 30mg (if sick or acne) Fisetin (or Qualia monthly) gets rid of dead cells I just feel good when I take it Vital Protein Collagen/Hylaronic Acid Dessicated Beef Liver or Shilajit (micronutrients) Multivitamin: Pure Encapsulations ONE\n\nI don't take pills daily except multivitamin or depending on my aim. But these are what work for me and what I've read that makes sense and I've tried without side effects and some benefit x Inpsitol is a miracle that everyone should know about it'll legit make you less anxious too\n\nDeodorant: Chlorella Liquid (removes body odor) > Native > Certaindri. want to try the weekly devices out there that actually stop sweating but weighing risks. Native covers me all day smelling good and I used to sweat through EVERYTHING. \n\nNails: basic - sally hansen hard as nails clear (drop 3-4 magenta drops of any brand in for a natural pink nail look) -  silica drops make nails tough af - only do RUSSIAN manicures they are magic thank me later\n\nSUN: the sun is your enemy for skincare, it's time to be aware of this all the time! Legally UV tint the max of your front car window (there's a way to uv protect without darkening so it's legal). Always wear long sleeves or a hat. Cover face with hand when walking and unprotected. I use supergoop clear sun stick because I'm lazy and it's a stick and doesn't have white caste. I'm sure there's better ones but this is the best clear stick I found. The powder makeup ones are BS and don't actually protect you. A HAT + Long Sleeves >>\n\nWeight Loss: I have a chubby face if my BMI is above 19 genetically. Find the BMI you need for optimizing your face. I drink all my water before eating. I drink black decaf with monk fruit (stevia is not as safe, Splenda is bad news) instead of lattes. I put all\nmy food on a salad instead of rice. I don't eat grain carbs because it makes me bloated. I eat spinach daily because it has highest potassium (reduces face bloating). I try to have have less than 1.5G salt daily. I also make sure there is IODINE in my salt for my thyroid (pink salt is causing iodine deficiencies and thus thyroid issues!). No dairy because it gives me acne (try cashew milk 25 cal). I hit 100G protein via NATURAL NO POWDER sources. Then I sleep by getting my fat intake (50g) and veggies cooked with seasoning I like or whatever I want to eat (kind of a baby Intermittant fast but more lax). If I'm craving sweets I eat frozen fruit and add fake honey (monk fruit sweetened avail sprouts). \n\n\nIf you made it this far, the most important thing is to be at a healthy weight, eat right, drink water, no alcohol (I've heard from friends: Passion flower extract \"anxiety\" > IV NAD (addiction)), no smoking(I've heard from friends: Chantix > Wellbutrin> Nicotine Patch > Tapering Nicotine Vape ), no all nighters (if insomnia look above TDCS headband elemind > Calm Sleep Powder > Sublingual Melatonin). \n\nThis is all I could think of but I've tried a lot feel free to DM me.\nI've also deep dived into fertility and dementia stuff for friends/family! If you want reccs DM! You can fact check me but I research this stuff just like we all do so you'll find out or realize this is likely the consensus. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

I have under eye bags that looks so so ugly I wish it was just dark I wouldn’t care, have been spending on PRP it only stays or looks tight for a day and goes back the next day. Never heard about a gel, I assume it’s a gel product they will sell and I will apply at home. BBLazer I am so wanting a skin like that, foundation look so I am going to find out with all the places if they do, I until now have done peels like clear skin malanage that gives this look too but only for 15 days. What is playtisma you mentioned here, is that an area or a kind of Botox? Lastly the IV glutathione is the general IB injection right? Not something they now inject directly to face.. just wanted to make sure thanks a ton",

Turns out, they're not just for absorbing moisture in your snacks.\n\nI used to find my tools getting rusty way too often, especially since I live in a humid area. But ever since I started tossing a couple of those silica packets into my toolbox, I haven't had a single issue. It's like magic!\n\nSeriously, if you're tired of dealing with rusty tools or want to prevent it from happening in the first place, give this a shot. You can find silica packets pretty much anywhere, and they're usually free with other purchases anyway.\n\nIt's such a simple hack, but it's made a huge difference for me. Plus, it's one of those things that makes you feel oddly satisfied knowing you're taking proactive steps to maintain your stuff. Trust me, your future self will thank you for it!",

    "body": "#Joseph\n\nFinally, it's time. I stood quietly in my dress suit behind Xhikaat's chair. It again flashed into my mind how bizarre K'tari seats were, open on one side and in the lower back to allow for their tail, and softly padded with a silica gel cushion. The cut out in the back of the seat to allow the tail to point down made the entire shape bizarre.\n\nI couldn't really complain, however. The cushions made it comfortable enough for me for a while, though I preferred to use the floor for extended seating periods.\n\nAll I have to do now is not start a war. Don't get my friends killed. Don't imply anything terrible. We're just here to ask for help. God damnit! Why am I getting so nervous now!? I've known this was gonna happen for over a month!\n\nI kept a straight face. Hopefully, they don't notice how much I'm sweating.\n\n---\n\n#Xhikaat\n\nAs we approached the station into short comms range, a strange, growing scent registered. Is that... Musk? Not K'tari musk.\n\nI turned to look at Joseph. \"Joseph, there is no need to be nervous. We are here to ask for aid, not to cause trouble.\"\n\nJoseph nodded. \"I know, ma'am. It's just jitters. I haven't been back here in over a solar cycle.\"\n\nOne agonizing hour passed until we were in communication range. We could have arrived more quickly, but protocol dictates we approach new species slowly, to give them a chance to notice us and catalog our ships.\n\n\"Warlord Xhikaat, we're in short wave range. Communication delay, point five seconds.\"\n\n\"Hail them. Full spectrum band.\"\n\nA moment later, a... Human. Probably. Appeared on the screen. He looked like Joseph, but his skin was a different color, black like the rubber we used for seals. Joseph never mentioned different colorings. Perhaps this was a battle scarring, or he was from a different caste. Joseph was a lowborn human. Maybe dark skin indicated a ruling elite. Did humans change color based on their rank in society? I had many questions for later. A moment passed, and Joseph said, Lieutenant?\"\n\n\"Joseph! What the devil are you doing on that ship? What's with the lurking approach?\"\n\nI said, \"Warm sun and fair wind to you, sir. I am Warlord Xhikaat of the K'tari Imperial Starship Kurtul. You know Joseph?\"\n\n\"He's the damned lookalike of crewman Jones that got dragged on board by mistake years ago!\"\n\nI looked to Joseph, and he shrugged. He wasn't told about the error before?\n\nI said, \"Crewman Joseph Dint is an invaluable member of my crew. His valor and knowledge have saved countless lives. May I have your name?\"\n\n\"Oh, ah, I am Lieutenant Michael Hayes of the Terran military fleet. May I ask for your purpose here?\"\n\n\"I am empowered by my government to open diplomatic ties, and to request aid. We have recently had an encroaching issue of ships going missing in our territory, and after extensive information gathering, we have finally learned who was responsible. Thrrel pirates.\"\n\n\"Oh, the Thrrel. They're hitting you pretty hard, then?\"\n\n\"Yes. In fact, Joseph was instrumental in thwarting an attempted takeover of this very ship. He had informed us that Earth uses projectile weapons that are very effective against scabers, and he has developed various anti-scaber countermeasures in his brief time aboard my ship.\"\n\nLieutenant Hayes said, \"That Joseph? The movie nerd?\"\n\nJoseph said, \"Yes sir! Grew a spine and a pair of balls, sir!\"\n\nHayes laughed. \"Good for you! They treating you well there?\"\n\n\"Better than I ever had at home, and they've got this delicacy. We brought loads of it for trade.\"\n\nHayes showed off his teeth. \"Alright! I'll supply the alcohol. Not to you, though. I remember what you did last time. One bottle! The guys gave you one bottle of jack, and you hosed down the entire bar! God damn, I've never seen anyone nail a guy in the face from four meters away like that!\"\n\nJoseph laughed. \"Yeah, serves those assholes right for talking a fourteen year old kid into chugging the bottle. I think I still have my picture on the wall so the bouncer knows not to let me in.\"\n\nHayes laughed. \"I'll bet! You know, they removed the ceiling fans after that incident, and the entire crew got banned.\"\n\nJoseph laughed. \"Serves you all right, sneaking a kid into a bar like that. Anyway, yeah. The K'tari have been taking major losses from the Thrrel, and we're basically here because they want to buy a bunch of guns. It's quicker to make more if they they have some to choose from. Would you mind calling Earth and letting them know the K'tari are here to open diplomatic ties?\"\n\n\"Sure. You're cleared for docking at port six. And don't forget your crab staff. I'll be waiting.\"\n\nBoth humans laughed, and the communications cut out. I turned to look at Joseph. \"Is that normal?\"\n\n\"It's not normal conduct for human military, no. My former crew are all pretty casual. Hell, the elltee saved my leg by, ahem, \"losing\" my discharge orders until after the colony had paid for the new leg to be grown and installed. He's a good man. Go ahead and dock, I think he'll be eager to meet you.\"\n\nI looked forward and said, \"Navigation, dock at port six.\"\n\nAnother twenty minutes passed as my best pilot brought us in gently, without even a scrape. We docked, and Joseph said, \"Xhikaat. Don't be intimidated by Hayes. He's very kind.\"\n\nI stood and stretched. \"Joseph. Zirak. Subcommander Pask. With me. Dress uniforms. Joseph, you'll wear your suit.\"\n\nHe nodded and ran to his room, then returned carrying a pack. We met the others, and after cycling through the airlock, we saw Lieutenant Michael with two others in full uniform. Probably military. I stepped forward, confidently. I clasped my claws together in front of me and gave a respectful bow.\n\n\"It is an honor to meet with you, Lieutenant Michael Hayes.\"\n\n\"The honor is all mine. Earth has dispatched a delegation from a nearby system, so I'm afraid we can only wait. In the meantime, I would like to invite you to enjoy our hospitality.\"\n\nI displayed my teeth as I had seen Joseph do. \"Thank you! I would be delighted.\"\n\nWe were brought to a lounge, and Joseph asked, \"Hey, do you mind ordering some room service?\"\n\nLieutenant Michael said, \"I'm not sure. What do you people eat?\"\n\nI said, \"We are primarily carnivores, but we also supplement our diets with vegetation.\"\n\nJoseph said, \"They seem to prefer mildly spiced foods. I know what they'd like. Box pot pies.\"\n\nLieutenant Michael asked, \"Are you sure that's not just what you want?\"\n\nJoseph placed the pack on the table and pulled out a package of kiklat. Oh gods, please don't let them realize what that is!\n\nHe slid a serving to Lieutenant Michael, and said, \"Try this out. This is what they consider too strong.\"\n\nLieutenant Michael tore open the package, and used the provided eating utensil to take a bite. I didn't realize human eyes could open that wide, as he coughed.\n\n\"Gah! That's... Pretty spicy.\"\n\nJoseph said, \"Yeah. It's really good, though. They use it as punishment rations, the way we use nutraloaf.\"\n\nMy head immediately swiveled to Joseph. \"You knew!?\"\n\n\"Well, sure. I looked it up to make sure I wouldn't get sick. Doesn't matter to me what you use it for. I use your floor cleaner for shampoo. It's great stuff.\"\n\nLieutenant Michael asked, \"You've been taking good care of him?\"\n\nJoseph said, \"When I got burned, they stuck me in a tube of anaesthetic to heal. Hell, their surgical techniques are excellent. Their doctor, Kissil, is the best doctor I've ever met. They don't even use skin grafts, and he managed to grow grafts for me and put them in place flawlessly. And they did all that for a few third degree burns.\"\n\nLieutenant Michael nodded. \"Good, good. Warlord Xhikaat, I hope this visit isn't urgent.\"\n\n\"No. My people are working on projectile weapons, but if humans already have reliable weaponry we can use to combat this threat, we would like to engage in trade. We wish to protect our people as efficiently as possible, so we are engaging in multiple avenues.\"\n\nLieutenant Michael said, \"You're very straightforward for a diplomat. I like that. We have four days, so why don't we engage in a little information sharing in the meantime? Perhaps we can start with some cultural exchanges.\"\n\nI showed my teeth again and said, \"That sounds wonderful. I would like to try this pot pie Joseph mentioned, though.\"\n\nJoseph said, \"Follow me. I know this station like the back of my hand. I can get into any part of it I want.\"\n\nLieutenant Michael said, \"Do not lead the diplomats into the bulkheads! Or the ducts, or however it is you get into everywhere.\"\n\n\"Relax. They're not flexible enough for that stuff. I'm just going to show them around. Maybe get my media again. The mining ship destroyed my personal device.\"\n\nLieutenant Michael said, \"Alright. Just made sure they don't have any trouble. Sergeant Xin Lam. You will accompany them, and see to it the diplomats are safe.\"\n\nA security officer said, \"Yes sir!\"\n\nAh hah! Joseph was the lowest rank, and his skin was palest. This Sergeant Xin's skin was darker, and Lieutenant Michael Hayes's skin was the darkest! Their skin must darken the higher their rank or social standing! Fascinating!\n\nJoseph asked, \"Sergeant Lam, would you come here, please.\"\n\nSergeant Xin complied, and Joseph said, \"Sergeant Lam is female. I am male. Can you see the difference in basic shape between us?\"\n\nI struggled to tell the difference, and finally, Joseph said, \"Here, I'll tell you the easy way to tell. Mostly. We are mammals. Look to the chest. Males have hard, mostly flat pectorals. Adult females have enlarged breasts. Mostly. It varies greatly, just as with your claws and crest coloring.\"\n\nI saw the differences! \"Ah! I see! Fascinating! Such large differences! And she is smaller than you. Is that normal?\"\n\nJoseph nodded. \"Good! Yes. Human males are typically larger and bulkier, and we tend to be a bit stronger. Don't underestimate our females, though. Human females are far from helpless. If Sergeant Lam wasn't a capable soldier, she wouldn't be guarding your life.\"\n\nJoseph raised his fist to Sergeant Xin, who smiled and raised her own fist. She bumped the back of her hand against his. He asked, \"Anything you think should be added, Sargent?\"\n\n\"Naw. I think you pretty much covered it. Thanks. You served under Lt. Hayes?\"\n\n\"Yeah. He's a good leader.\"\n\nThey led us to a diner, and there, we ordered the box crab pot pie. The utensils offered took a little getting used to, but they weren't that different from ours. The box crab was delicious, along with the vegetables and gravy.\n\nAfter that, Joseph took us to a station shop and bought a memory core, then loaded it at the station museum with all the media he could get. With that done, he said, \"Sergeant Lam? What do you say to showing our guests some entertainment? Karaoke?\"\n\n\"Sounds good.\"\n\n---\n\n#Xin\n\nEscorting alien diplomats to a Karaoke bar. If they were offended easily, this would be the place to do it. Joseph seemed to notice my concern. He gave me military hand gestures out of sight of the diplomats.\n\n\"See two there.\"\n\nWithout turning my head, I glanced over. Sure enough. We were being watched, and they didn't look happy to see us. I scanned the room, and noticed we were being watched by a lot of people.\n\nJoseph whispered, \"I've got this. Watch this.\"\n\nAfter we were seated, and nonalcoholic drinks were ordered, he marched up to the karaoke stage.\n\nHe synced his datacore up, and said, \"The honorable diplomats wished to experience human culture. What could be more human than romance? So this song is dedicated to you-\" He made a grand, sweeping gesture with his free hand. \"-the most beautiful woman here!\"\n\nHe selected a song. Hmm... That's not a song I knew. Nice tune, though.\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't live a single day without you\nActually, on second thought, well, I suppose I could\nAnyway, what I'm trying to say is, honey, you're the greatest\nWell, at any rate, I guess you're pretty good.\"\n\nWhat. the. hell.\n\n\"Now, it seems to me I'm relatively lucky\nI know I probably couldn't ask for too much more\nI honestly can say you're an above-average lady\nYou're almost just what I've been looking for.\"\n\nSome snickers from around the bar as he sang.\n\n\"You're sort of everything I've ever wanted\nYou're not perfect, but I love you anyhow\nYou're the woman that I've always dreamed of\nWell, not really but you're good enough for now.\"\n\nThe patrons around us began to laugh more. A comedy song? Really? I struggled to maintain my composure and keep from laughing. I distracted myself by scanning the bar for threats. Those two guys were nursing their drinks and glancing over at us.\n\n\"You're pretty close to what I've always hoped for\nThat's why my love for you is fairly strong\nAnd I swear I'm never gonna leave you, darlin'\nAt least 'til something better comes along.\"\n\nHe had most of the crowd in the palm of his hand as he sang.\n\n\"Cause you're sort of everything I've ever wanted\nYou're not perfect, but I love you anyhow\nYou're the woman that I've always dreamed of\nWell, not really but you're good enough for now.\n\nNo, not really but you're good enough for now.\"\n\nAs the song ended, the bar cheered. He took a bow, and just as he stood back up, a drinking glass hurled with force hit him in the forehead. Joseph collapsed flat on his back. The bar was silent for several seconds until he pulled the microphone to his mouth.\n\n\"Ego check on aisle four.\"\n\nThe bar laughed as Raxon stood, and returned to us. He sat down, and I saw the beginning of a bruise on his forehead. I couldn't help myself. \"You dumbass.\"\n\nHe snickered as he took a sip of his drink. The two who had been watching us the whole time stood up and approached us.\n\nThe larger one asked, \"What's a xeno doing out here? You best be on your way.\" He reached out, but Joseph grabbed the man's wrist. \"You don't lay a hand on my captain.\"\n\nThe man said, \"You work for this xeno?\"\n\nJoseph stood, and I noticed he was wearing his gloves. He hadn't been wearing them before. \"This xeno saved my life and gave me the best job I've ever had. You best back down before I take that shiny tin badge and use it to write my name on your liver.\"\n\nThe larger man squared up with him, and said, \"You better watch yourself before I rip your guts out through your mouth so you can choke on your our intestines.\"\n\nOh god, they're both ghetto rats.\n\nJoseph said, \"I'm going to break you so badly they'll pass a law requiring you to wear a bag over your head.\"\n\nThe other man said, \"I'm going to rip out your spine and play your bones like a drum.\"\n\nJoseph said, \"I'm going to build a pair of glowing cybernetic balls and sew them into place where you manhood ought to be, just so I can kick them with my iron feet!\"\n\n---\n\n#Xhikaat\n\nOh gods. We haven't even been here for a day!\n\nJoseph and the other man seemed to become more and more intense, glaring into each other's eyes, until the other man burst into laughter.\n\nJoseph began to laugh, and slapped him on the back. \"Hah! I thought I recognized that swagger! Third district?\"\n\n\"Yeah! You?\"\n\n\"Same!\"\n\nI finally asked, \"What's going on? Weren't you going to fight?\"\n\nJoseph said, \"Oh! No, it's a custom from the old neighborhood, and we identify each other with it. Whoever can make the most ridiculous threat wins. It's a joke between us.\"\n\nWhat a strange custom.\n\nThe man asked, \"So this Xeno really is a good one?\"\n\nJoseph grinned and said, \"Yeah. The K'tari as a whole have been very welcoming. I was breaking the law, and they saved my stupid life. Don't let the claws and teeth fool you. They're good people. This is Xhikaat, my captain, and this is Zirak, my colleague in engineering. I've been helping them deal with their scaber problem.\"\n\n\"Scabers!?\"\n\nThe Karaoke bar went silent. Spacers knew about rumors of scabers. Joseph grinned and said, \"Yeah. Take a look.\"\n\nHe tilted his head back to reveal the small scar across his throat. \"This right here. This is the closest anyone you'll ever know has gotten to being killed by those damn bugs. Have a projectile weapon and lots of ammo handy, and make sure you have some rigid armor. Those jaws slice right through disruption fabric and ballistic goop. Bastards took my leg, and it was only due to the fleet I could afford a new one grown. But I know how to fight them. Next time I saw them, I slaughtered the whole swarm with a sword!\"\n\nThe other man's friend said, \"If this guy vouches for them, they're probably okay.\"\n\nWe still had the attention of the bar. It was quiet, aside from Joseph's boasting.\n\nThe bigger man directed his gaze to me as he asked, \"So what are you doing here?\"\n\nA little diplomacy practice can't hurt. I kept my voice level as I spoke. \"I have been sent to open diplomatic negotiations, and to see if we can request assistance regarding the scaber menace. Crewman Joseph's impressive accomplishments aside, we are losing ships, and we are here in hopes of trading for advice, and possibly a selection of projectile weapons. Joseph says that Terran weaponry is quite diverse and effective, so I had hoped you would have ways of dealing with the scabers that don't involve cladding a team of security crew in rigid metal armor and killing them with edged weapons.\"\n\nThe man laughed. \"Oh, so you wear metal armor to deal with them?\"\n\n\"Yes. Joseph developed the armor for himself. Homeworld is adapting it to our physiology. We require something much lighter than his armor, so there is extensive testing to be done. We can't all be so incredibly strong.\"\n\n\"Strong? Really?\"\n\nJoseph said, \"Ah. About that... I was sent to retrieve stuff for the crew before we left, but there was so much cargo, and it all had to be brought to the ship. So I loaded a flat cart and brought it back in two ton shipments. You know, they don't have muscles in the face to show emotion, but they sure do gawk the same as us.\"\n\nThe man laughed and slapped Joseph on the back. \"Hah! Yeah! You show them we're badass!\"\n\nI took the opportunity to ask something that suddenly occurred to me. \"Have you had trouble with aliens causing trouble?\"\n\n\"Yeah. About a month ago, we got a ship of tall, skinny blue xenos stopping by.\"\n\nJoseph narrowed his eyes. \"Jik.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's them. Anyway, they're all jumpy and waving those wrist spikes around, and then Suki's girl Mina went and tried to break the ice, cause she's a sweetheart like that. This one with a nasty looking scar stabbed her and started screaming something about us being degenerates. Poor girl just got out of the hospital. We ran em off the station and let them know they weren't welcome back.\"\n\nJoseph's hands were balled into fists. \"He hurt Mina?\"\n\n\"Damn near killed her. Barely missed her heart, but got the lungs pretty badly. Don't you worry. He knows what'll happen to him if he comes back. We all like Mina. She's a nice kid.\"\n\nJoseph nodded. \"Yeah. She's like a little sister to a bunch of us. Damn.\" He wasn't looking at anyone, just staring off into nowhere.\n\nI spoke up. \"Joseph. No.\"\n\nJoseph snapped out of whatever thoughts he was having, and looked to me. \"Sorry. You're right. No more of that.\"\n\nThe man asked, \"What the hell?\"\n\nJoseph said, \"I, uh... Personal demons and stuff.\"\n\nThe man nodded and patted Joseph's shoulder. \"I understand. You take care, and don't make Mina cry, alright?\"\n\nJoseph nodded. \"Yeah. Same to you. Good luck, man.\"\n\nThe two of them left, and I asked, \"Who is Mina?\"\n\nJoseph seemed to smile genuinely as he said, \"Mina is like everyone's little sister. She's sweet, cheerful, and she makes deliveries for her mother Suki over at the black lotus bar and grill. So everyone knows her. She's such a friendly girl. I'm honestly surprised those jiks are still alive. Folks around here are protective of Mina.\"\n\nAh, interesting. A female stood. I think? My eyes went to the chest. Probably female. She stepped up to the microphone, and began to sing.\n\nHer voice was different. Higher. It had a pleasant quality I couldn't quite identify.\n\n\"Like a small boat\nOn the ocean\nSending big waves\nInto motion\nLike how a single word\nCan make a heart open\nI might only have one match\nBut I can make an explosion\"\n\nThe entire bar seemed to calm down from Joseph's amusing song.\n\n\"And all those things I didn't say\nWrecking balls inside my brain\nI will scream them loud tonight\nCan you hear my voice this time?\n\nThis is my fight song\nTake back my life song\nProve I'm alright song\nMy power's turned on\nStarting right now I'll be strong\nI'll play my fight song\nAnd I don't really care if nobody else believes\n'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me\n\nLosing friends and I'm chasing sleep\nEverybody's worried about me\nIn too deep\nSay I'm in too deep\nAnd it's been two years\nI miss my home\nBut there's a fire burning in my bones\nStill believe\nYeah, I still believe\n\nAnd all those things I didn't say\nWrecking balls inside my brain\nI will scream them loud tonight\nCan you hear my voice this time?\n\nThis is my fight song\nTake back my life song\nProve I'm alright song\nMy power's turned on\nStarting right now I'll be strong\nI'll play my fight song\nAnd I don't really care if nobody else believes\n'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me\n\nA lot of fight left in me\n\nLike a small boat\nOn the ocean\nSending big waves\nInto motion\nLike how a single word\nCan make a heart open\nI might only have one match\nBut I can make an explosion\n\nThis is my fight song\nTake back my life song\nProve I'm alright song\nMy power's turned on\nStarting right now I'll be strong\nI'll play my fight song\nAnd I don't really care if nobody else believes\n'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me\n\nNo I've still got a lot of fight left in me\"\n\nAs she sang, I noticed the bar became subdued. No, not subdued. Energized? But calm. Are humans telepathic? No. I think we would have realized if they were. Further into the song, and some humans were swaying with the music. Not telepaths.\n\nA thought dawned on me and terrified me. Are humans easily hypnotized? Do... Do they hypnotize each other for entertainment?\"\n\nAs she finished the song, she stepped down. Joseph and many of the other bar patrons clapped and cheered.\n\nZirak finally spoke. \"Joseph, are humans powerfully affected by music?\"\n\n\"Oh, absolutely. There's a primal, almost spiritual connection to it. Music is used to anchor mindsets, to set the mood for things, it helps us focus, or ignore discomfort.\"\n\n\"Fascinating. Music is a universal constant among humans?\"\n\n\"Not universal. Every human is different in some way, but music is a very common interest.\"\n\nA few more songs, and Joseph said, \"It's getting late. We should pick up again tomorrow. Warlord Xhikaat, would you like to invite Sergeant Lam aboard the Kurtul? I don't think I have the authority to extend that hospitality.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. Sergeant Xin, I would like to invite you to spend the night aboard the Kurtul. I understand we resemble monsters that once existed on your homeworld, but I assure you we are very kind.\"\n\nSergeant Xin asked, \"Why do you call me by my first name?\"\n\n\"It is our custom. If it bothers you, I can use your second name.\"\n\n\"No, my first name is fine. I was just curious.\"\n\nI asked, \"Why do you use second names?\"\n\n\"Our last names are usually familial names. They denote lineage, and it's easy to do things like find the parents of a lost child or establish our background if a familial name is passed down. I am Xin Mei Lam, daughter of Lee Lam, son of Wei Lam.\"\n\n\"Your culture is fascinating.\"\n\nJoseph said, \"As is yours. The aversion to open flames is a very interesting quirk.\"\n\n\"Avoiding fire is a natural instinct, is it not?\"\n\nJoseph said, \"Ah. Not in humans. We use open flames for everything from chemistry to preparing food to entertainment.\"\n\nWhat. \"But the danger…\"\n\n\"We take safety precautions, obviously. But on the planet, we have metal enclosures that we set fires in for the purpose of ritual food preparation.\"\n\nSergeant Xin said, \"You did not just describe grilling hot dogs as a ritual. What else have you been telling them?\"\n\nJoseph shrugged. \"What? It's not wrong, and it helps them understand.\"\n\n\"It's not a ritual!\"\n\n\"Do you have a better word for it?\"\n\nSargent Xin opened her mouth to speak, but said nothing. Her forehead scrunched up, and she let out a sound I could recognize as frustration.\n\n\"It's a recreational food preparation method.\"\n\nI churred, and Sargent Xin pulled back. \"Did I say something to offend?\"\n\nJoseph said, \"No, no, that's how they laugh.\"\n\nSargent Xin settled back down and said, \"Oh. Alright. And I think I'd like to join you aboard your ship for the night.\"\n\nJoseph said, \"Warlord Xhikaat, humans don't typically sleep together unless we're a mated pairing. Sargent Lam will require private quarters.\"\n\nI said, \"Yes. You have mentioned that before.\"\n\nSargent Xin asked, \"Do you not sleep alone?\"\n\nJoseph said, \"Ah, ummm... Actually... Human crew are apparently prized for our, ah, body heat. The K'tari are cold blooded, so they sleep in groups. Humans are very popular sleeping partners, as they require a heat source at night.\"\n\nSargent Xin asked, \"So... You...\"\n\nJoseph nodded. \"Nothing sexual ever happened, mind you. But it was part of my duties for a while. We're living heat lamps with creepy monkey hands.\"\n\nSargent Xin laughed. \"Alright. Should we get going?\"\n\n---\n\n#Joseph\n\nI led the group back to the ship, and then brought Xin to the guest quarters. Once the door opened, she asked, \"Would you like to come inside?\"\n\nI smiled and entered. As soon as the door closed, she leaned in close, and whispered into my ear. \"Do you need help?\"\n\nI whispered, \"No, I can undress myself.\"\n\nHer tone went hard. \"I'm serious. Are you with these aliens willingly? We can get you out if you want to leave.\"\n\nI put a hand on her shoulder and pushed her back to arm's length.\n\n\"Easy, now. The K'tari are my friends. They saved my life. I broke their laws, and they've been nothing but kind and understanding. I earned my freedom by working off my debt.\"\n\n\"Freedom? Were you imprisoned?\"\n\n\"They call it slavery, but it's more a work release program. You can't pay your fines, so you work off the debt. You're not just freed, you're offered citizenship.\"\n\n\"Are you still under their control?\"\n\nI laughed. \"Control me? Please. Lieutenant Hayes couldn't control me. I follow Xhikaat's orders because I trust her. I am not under alien control. I chose to join the crew. I choose to stay here. I'm treated a lot better here than I ever was on Ventura.\"\n\nShe backed off. \"I see. So you're here of your own free will.\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yeah. Look, I'm not a good person. Not really. But I want to be better than I am, and they're helping with that. I'm finally getting an education.\"\n\n\"When Xhikaat told you no. What did she mean?\"\n\n\"Oh. I, uhh, I think she recognized I was considering delivering payback, and interrupted it. Listen, as nice as it was for you to invite me in, I do have work tomorrow, so unless you're inviting me to stay, I should hit the sack.\"\n\nShe paused for a moment, then sighed. \"Yeah. Same here. Goodnight, then.\"\n\n\"Hey. No hard feelings about any misunderstandings, right? It was the right thing to make sure I was okay.\"\n\nShe smiled at me. \"Yeah. See you tomorrow.\"\n\nI stepped out and returned to my quarters. After my nightly ablutions, I collapsed into bed.\n\n\"Of course. Of fucking course. The first woman I've seen in almost a friggin year! And she invites me into her quarters to make sure I'm okay! And nothing else!\"\n\nThe frustration exploded out of me. Not with her, but with myself. Why am I feeling like a twelve year old seeing a girl in a bikini for the first time? Is this what isolation does to a man?\n\nIt took hours, but I finally relaxed enough to fall asleep.\n\n---\n\n#Xhikaat\n\nThe next day, I met up with Sergeant Xin, Zirak, and Joseph. Joseph said, \"You treated me to a shopping trip on the K'tari station. It's my turn to return the favor.\"\n\nI asked, \"Do you have money for that?\"\n\nJoseph grinned and said, \"I have an account here. I just have to get a new payrod issued.\"\n\n\"Oh! Alright!\"\n\nWhen we arrived at the bank, he went to push on the door, but it wouldn't budge. Sergeant Xin said, \"I think that's a pull door.\"\n\nJoseph said, \"No. Damn place is closed today. The note says the manager felt like taking the day off. And they cut their hours! Again! Eight thirty to eleven thirty!? Geeze. I remember when they closed at one in the afternoon! Ugh. Excuse me a minute. I'll do it myself.\"\n\nHe walked into the alley beside the bank.\n\nI asked Sergeant Xin. \"Where is he going?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Maybe he knows someone inside.\"\n\nA short time later, he returned. His clothes were a bit dusty, and he held something in his mouth. A small white stick. He offered me one. A thin white stick with some kind of brown spherical hard object on the end, wrapped in clear plastic and dark lettering.\n\n\"Here you are! This is a Terran treat, called a sucker. You lick it and hold it in your mouth to let it dissolve on your tongue.\"\n\nI began to fiddle with the plastic, but he said, \"Oh, no, you don't have to unwrap it! It's some kind of starch plastic. It will dissolve in your mouth.\n\nThe orb was sweet, and a little tangy. \"This is good!\"\n\n\"And they're free with each transaction. Mine is vesda fruit. It's my favorite. That one is pina colada. I also got this!\"\n\nHe held up a small, hexagonal rod, one centimeter wide by four centimeters long. It was a shimmering metallic blue, and had a bright yellow cover stretched over both ends.\n\n\"Is that a Terran payrod?\"\n\nHe said, \"It sure is. Freshly issued!\"\n\n\"But the bank is closed, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Oh, you poor, naive girl. Nothing on a station is ever actually closed. There's always a way inside, but I had to retrieve my own payrod, like some kind of savage.\"\n\nSergeant Xin said, \"You broke into the bank just to issue yourself a payrod!?\"\n\nJoseph said, \"No B and E this time. I walked right in. The door wasn't locked.\"\n\nXin frowned. \"Not locked? But you couldn't open it.\"\n\n\"Not that one. I don't think they even know about the tertiary maintenance access entrance. They painted over it.\"\n\n\"Oh my god.\"\n\nJoseph nodded. \"I didn't touch any money, so they won't care.\"\n\nSergeant Xin asked, \"How did you access the computers?\"\n\n\"I didn't. I just applied for a fresh payrod with my personal device over the public net, and the system automatically issued and labeled a payrod for me. I picked the blue one. I think it looks nice.\"\n\nXin's hand went to her face. \"Do you make a habit of this kind of thing?\"\n\nJoseph chuckled. \"Well, I like to explore tight places. And since I was a kid when I was brought here, I found loads of little access shafts and tunnels, including ones that weren't intended. I tried to tell station management about it, but they arrested me for espionage! I was twelve years old! Bureaucratic idiots. So I just don't tell anyone about any security flaws or secret passages I find anymore. I know this station better than anyone else.\"\n\nI paused for a moment, considering all this. \"Joseph, have you found any secret passages aboard the Kurtul?\"\n\nHe frowned. \"Am I in trouble?\"\n\n\"No! That kind of security understanding is valuable! I can't overstate how important it is!\"\n\nJoseph placed his fist to his mouth and made a rough noise. \"I, ahh... May have found some, uh, construction errors that result in some easily accessible hiding spots or crawlways. There's an empty shaft that can probably be used to circumvent security, near the lift. It looked a little tight, though, so I haven't ventured in.\"\n\nOh. \"Joseph, you need to report potential security flaws!\"\n\n\"Yes Ma'am.\"\n\n\"There's a pay incentive for finding security flaws.\"\n\nJoseph's face went blank. \"What. You'll pay me to find mistakes!?\"\n\n\"Of course!\"\n\nHe grinned. \"And suddenly I'm looking forward to our next visit to a K'tari station! I can get paid for my fun! I wonder if I can double my military stipend.\"\n\nSergeant Xin asked, \"You're encouraging this behavior?\"\n\nI churred. \"I've found it's best to utilize talents as you find them. If I'd known he had been exploring the ship so fully, I'd have assigned him to security! He's been on the ship for over forty planetary cycles. If he's efficient at exploration, he might know the ship better than old Khaarn.\"\n\nSergeant Xin asked, \"Doesn't that worry you?\"\n\n\"It would, if he only exhibited this behavior on my ship, but considering he clearly has experience finding security flaws among your people, and your upper echelons don't seem to appreciate his talent, I'll happily use it. I can see now that the restless nature he's shown isn't just a mental one.\"\n\nSergeant Xin nodded. \"I can see you point, I guess.\"\n\nJoseph grinned and said, \"That's why Xhikaat is my captain. She does this a lot, encouraging interests and talent development. Lieutenant Hayes did that, too. He's a great superior officer.\"\n\nSergeant Xin nodded. \"Yeah, he is. So, scale of one to ten, how much trouble do you cause?\"\n\nJoseph stroked his chin. \"Hmmm... I generally try to avoid causing trouble. In fact, as Xhikaat can attest, for the majority of my service, I have actively worked to avoid causing trouble.\"\n\n\"Until you had a grudge to settle.\"\n\nJoseph sighed. \"I know. It was stupid, it was wrong, and that won't ever happen again. I almost got myself killed, too. Never again.\"\n\n\"Good. If that's settled, first of all, I want to show you what our time pieces look like.\"\n\nHe pulled back his sleeve to show Sargent Xin his watch. \"A fascinating mechanical action, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes. Interesting. How do you charge it?\"\n\n\"There's a charging base. I can also keep it charged with thermal energy. Lots of K'tari tech revolves around heat transferrence. It's neat.\"\n\n\"So... You can keep it charged by wearing it?\"\n\n\"That's right!\"\n\n\"Hey. That's nice. Maybe you could barter thermal tech that efficient for our bioelectric implant technology.\"\n\nJoseph said, \"This was a gift, so it's not for sale or trade, but I'm sure we have other thermal charging items on the ship, or failing that, blueprints. That said, let's do some shopping!\"\n\nWithout waiting for our responses, Joseph squatted down and put an arm around myself and Zirak. He lifted us up and secured us on his shoulders. He grunted with the effort. \"There we go. The station will be busy, and this way, you'll be able to see better.\"\n\nSargent Xin said, \"Maybe don't ruin your back. I'm sure the ambassadors will be fine with walking.\"\n\nI said, \"We'll walk, thanks.\"\n\nJoseph set us down, and and we set out. I saw an accessory outlet, and we went to look around. Some of the accessories looked familiar. Metallic bracelets, pendants, and some amusing bracelets that wrapped around my arm automatically when I slapped them to my arm!\n\nA voice asked, \"Can I help you find anything?\"\n\nI turned to see a shorter human than either Joseph or Sergean Xin. I stopped in my tracks. The severity of the wounds on this one shocked me.\n\nI reached out and touched their hand. \"Don't worry. We'll get help for you. You're going to be just fine. Joseph! Come quickly! This human is injured!\"\n\nJoseph came running down the aisle. \"What do you need me to do?\"\n\nI reached up and pointed to the dozen or so metal slivers in the human's face and ears. \"This one has had some kind of terrible industrial accident! We have to get those metal slivers out and disinfect the wounds! We need a doctor!\"\n\nTo my shock, both of them began laughing. Joseph was bent over and holding his stomach. \"Joseph, this is serious!\"\n\n\"Sorry, I just. I can't believe I never explained piercings to you. Many of us love to decorate our bodies with colorful or shiny things. One way is by making a piercing. It's not something you can have, due to your scales, but our skin heals puncture wounds quite well. She's not wounded. I mean, technically, she was wounded to install them, but they're minor wounds that heal quickly, similar subdermal bruising for you.\"\n\n\"This... Is a form of self decoration?\"\n\nHe asked, \"Hey, you got any tatts?\"\n\nThe other human, a female, I noticed, said, \"Yeah.\"\n\nShe turned and lifted her shirt to show a colorful picture of some kind of creature on her back. A thin body between two massive, bright blue, yellow and black wings.\n\nI said, \"Oh, is that a skin paining?\"\n\n\"It's a tattoo. Pigments are precision injected into the skin. It's a delicate art form. And again, your scales make this particular body decoration impossible.\"\n\nI asked, \"Amazing. Joseph, do you have any tattoos?\"\n\n\"I had one. On my leg.\"\n\nThe female asked, \"Oh, did you get it removed?\"\n\nJoseph said, \"Yeah. And I lost the tattoo with it.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The leg.\"\n\n\"Oh. Oh god.\"\n\nHe snickered. \"I'm giving you a hard time. The colony paid for a replacement leg, I just never saw any need to get a replacement tattoo. Mine wasn't very good anyway.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"Ah. Cool. You a bodyguard now?\"\n\nJoseph grinned and laughed a bit. \"Xhikaat doesn't need a bodyguard. I've seen her people fight. It's pretty impressive. I'm facilitating diplomatic contact.\"\n\n\"Oh! Nice! So, miss... jickat?\"\n\nI said, \"Xhikaat.\"\n\n\"Miss Xhikaat. Do you see anything you like?\"\n\nI pointed to some interesting decorative knottings. \"Can you tell me about these?\"\n\n\"Oh, the bows? Of course. These are pretied and secured ribbon bows, so you only need to secure the headband in place. You can also purchase a length of ribbon and tie a bow around your tail or neck. We have a bunch of colors and patterns for you to choose from. These are hair bows. I'm... Not sure they'd work for you.\"\n\nJoseph said, \"Maybe clipped to her crest, but you'd have to use a gentle clip.\"\n\n\"Right, right. I don't think I want to risk hurting anyone, so maybe we should stick with other means of attaching things.\"\n\nI pointed to a shimmering roll of light pink fabric ribbon. \"I would like a length of this. Can you help me tie it?\"\n\n\"Of course!\"\n\nShe reached for the sear scissors and cut a generous length off.\n\n---\n\n#Joseph\n\nHoo boy. This was pretty embarrassing. Standing in Melinda's while Xhikaat looks at ribbons for young girls. I'm glad I never embarrassed her like this. I'd never live it down. This whole store was dedicated to young girls' fashion accessories.\n\nThe tacky polycarb sunglasses and bead necklaces surrounded us as she played with the slap bracelets and looked through the ribbons. I just couldn't understand why she was so fascinated by fabric accessories.\n\nAt least the girl working the counter was cute. I watched in surprise as she tied an elaborate bow around Xhikaat's neck, with six loops, all in a circle. Huh. That looked complicated.\n\nOn a whim, I walked over to the small book section, and found one on knotwork, bows, and... How do you fill six hundred pages with knot instructions!? How many kinds of knots could there possibly be? There were only six knots that I ever needed to know!\n\nI thought on it. Boot lace knot, constrictor knot, plug knot, slip knot, palomar knot, hangman's knot. Yeah. Six knots.\n\n\"Xhikaat? Here's a book on various knots and bows.\"\n\nShe accepted the book, and looked through it. \"This is fascinating! I'd love to have this!\"\n\n\"That's great! Anything else you like? You too, Zirak.\"\n\nZirak pointed to something in the glass counter. \"I like this.\"\n\nI came closer, and saw she was pointing to a black velvet choker with irridescent foshal shell around a red cabochon gem. Woah. That's a little too grown up for a place like this. \"Excuse me, is that real foshal?\"\n\n\"Oh. Yeah, I sell some nice stuff, too.\"\n\n\"And the gem?\"\n\n\"Cloudy ruby. It's not too expensive here, with the huge mines in the dry sea. That entire quadrant is loaded with all kinds of crystals and gems.\"\n\n\"We'll take it.\"\n\nXhikaat asked, \"Could I get a few of these ribbons in different colors, and these springy bracelets? My people will love this.\"\n\nI nodded. \"Those, too.\"\n\nThe cashier scanned our goods. \"That'll be two hundred eighteen thousand thetans.\"\n\nI handed over my payrod, and she inserted the tip into the register. Everything was bagged up, and I strapped the bags to my belt.\n\nThe two K'tari admired their respective neckwear. \"Now then, where would you like to go next?\"",

    "body": "My fiancee and I went out of town over Christmas and my MIL begged us to let her cat sit and care for the plants (currently only a mushroom kit needs maintenance) as she wanted to clean our condo (she is the owner but lives with her bf). We, very reluctantly, agreed, and gave her specific instructions on how to care for the plants, what not to touch, and what she could do if she wanted. One of these things was changing the cats litter. We DID NOT ask her to. We said she could if she felt the need to. In fact, my fiancée even told her we don’t really want her to do it. As you can probably guess, MIL took it upon herself to change the litter. Now, it’s important to mention that we were changing litter types as well - silica crystals, which are short supply due to covid and flooding, to clumping. Our cat didn’t immediately take to the litter (she had had it before but was confused I guess), so MIL decided to MIX CATNIP INTO THE LITTER. If you know anything about cats, youll know they like to eat catnip. I think you can guess what happened next. She rolled around in and ate from her litterbox. Eating ANY kind of cat litter is bad for your cat, clumping litter is the WORST. When my fiancée and I returned from our trip (after 12 hours of delays for 2 hours of flights mind you) there was a MASSIVE pool of vomit filled with bloody particulates. When we showed MIL this, she simply said “its because she was eating the dried flowers on the table, and the blood is because her food was beef”. We have been feeding her the same damn food and shes been eating the same flowers for over a year. If it was causing this, we wouldve seen it before. We got home that night at midnight, and monitored her the next day, as most vets were closed in our area. She was obviously distressed (more whiny than usual) and lethargic, so we took her to the vet. This was yesterday. The vet took a myriad of tests, including xrays. From a surface investigation, it was clear she was in pain, even picking her up she made noises of distress Ive never hesrd from her before. The xrays showed she has crystals accumulated throughout her digestive tract, as well as serious inflammation. We have had to expedite her xrays to a radiologist to check her pancreas and look for blockages. Our cat was hospitalized at the vet until they closed and we were told to monitor for the night and bring her back today because they had no overnight staff to monitor her. Within 10 min of us getting her home she removed her cone, so we took her to an over night vet to monitor since we couldnt watch her all night. This morning I had to pick her up and transfer her back to the original vet as the other once closed at 8am. She’s currently hospitalized on IV and we are awaiting xray results. \n\nThe cost so far, JUST for diagnostic tests and hospitalization, has been $1650 out of pocket. The previous quote from MIL is the last we heard from her. No apology, no acknowledgement, no show of care for the cat, nothing. As far as she is concerned, its nothing to do with her.\n\nThis has been the last straw, after years of neglect, abuse, and theft. We are planning on pursuing legal action against her for this. We will give her the chance to pay for the vet first, but I doubt she will based on her lack of accountability. Also it should be mentioned, there were periods where she has had sole control over the cat, she should know how to care for her.\n\nAs a sidenote, she also chopped my raspberry bush to nearly nothing, after 5+ years of growth and care. I had kept this bush from when my mother moved to a different province so it was very sentimental. It will grow back but the type of plant only grows one branch a year, and they are ALL gone.\n\nSorry for any mistakes or weird formatting. Thanks for the vent.\n\nUPDATE: the vet says it looks like she is passing the foreign materials from her digestive tract, based on a second set of xrays. They have her another round of injections, and she will be requiring antibiotics and special GI food. We have to closely monitor her to ensure she is still pooping and if not, she will require an immediate ultrasound and, assumedly, surgery.\n\nUPDATE 2: The cat is now back to her normal self, it took about 2 weeks for her to start acting normal. Also she needs to be on special food - wet and dry - for the rest of her life. Both my partner and I got covid a day or two after we got the cat back from the vet, so we decided to wait on dealing with MIL until after we recovered, and have the mental energy. She texted us yesterday for the first time in 2 weeks to ask us to leave her mail in the mailbox. Said nothing about the cat, which is WILD to me. We are sending her all the invoices and stuff sometime this week, and lawyers have been contacted.",

    "body": "**Hi Pioneers!**\n\nUpdate 5 is now available on Experimental. If you have been following our YouTube videos you’ve seen lots of the new content already, but you can find all of that (and as usual a few exciting surprises) summarised in our Patch Notes video below. And if you want to go straight to the nitty gritty details, we have the full list of detailed patch notes further down as well!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfaReoks6OM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfaReoks6OM)\n\nWith this Update we have worked on many of the base systems in Satisfactory to improve the game. It’s all ready for you to play with, but we are just starting the Experimental period for this release, and we appreciate all the feedback you can give us. If you have thoughts on these new features or find any bugs, feel free to visit our Q&A site and let us know what you think! The site can be found here: [https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/](https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/)\n\nLet's go ahead and dig into the new content available to you now. We can’t wait to see what you all will create with this!\n\n# Signs\n\nBetter late than never but we’re finally adding Signs to the game! Signs come in various sizes, and you can customise them using a selection of layouts, icons, display text, and backgrounds depending on the Sign.\n\nSigns can be placed by themselves on a height adjustable pole, or they can be snapped to Storage Containers, Walls, and even each other to create highly customised displays.\n\n# Customizer\n\nAre you tired of using the overly simplistic Colour Gun? Are you finding the process of setting the colour for every single foundation or wall piece tedious? Wish there were more cosmetic options for foundations, walls and roofs? \n\nIntroducing the Customizer, a new way of adjusting your Walls, Foundations, and Roofs! After it is unlocked with the AWESOME Shop in Tier 2 you can find it as a new tab in the Build Menu. It replaces the Colour Guns colouring ability and any Wall, Foundation, and Roof materials as well as Foundation patterns can be found here after you unlock them in the AWESOME Shop.\n\n## Materials\n\nWe’ve added new Materials for Foundations and Walls, and the newly added Roofs come with several Materials as well. While we had FICSIT and Steel Walls before, this changes how these buildings are unlocked and used. For example, new shapes of Foundations are still unlocked in the AWESOME Shop, and initially they only come in the standard FICSIT Material. But unlocking a new Material for Foundations, which you also do in the AWESOME Shop, will allow you to apply that Material to any of the Foundations you have available.\n\nOnce you’ve unlocked a new Material you just select it in the Customizer, click or hold and just paint away! Any material you select will only be applied to structures that are relevant. It’s a safe and easy way to quickly change the look of your existing factories.\n\nYou can also place build pieces with the material you want from the get-go. Simply select the material type you would like the buildable to have and build away! You can even bind the material type to your hotbar if you’re on the go.\n\n## Colours\n\nColours are now right there in the customizer too, since it fully replaces the Colour Gun. This means painting your factory also benefits from hold to paint addition, which will make colouring faster than ever!\n\nYou can find all the standard FICSIT colours in there and create your own Swatches and save them. After that you can either select them from the Customizer or bind them to your hotbar. \n\n## Patterns\n\nArrows, lines, symbols and many more Patterns can now be painted onto Foundations with the Customizer! There is a total of 58 Patterns that can be unlocked in the AWESOME Shop which will help you create clearer layouts for your factory floors.\n\n# Build System Changes\n\nSatisfactory’s build systems have received a major overhaul to make building factories and production setup faster and cleaner. These systems are a large part of Satisfactory and are applied to lots of different building interactions, so it can be difficult to have them perfect at Experimental launch. We’re confident they will be very helpful in their current state but let us know if you have any feedback on our Q&A site!\n\n## Soft and Hard Clearance\n\nPreviously (almost) all buildings had a building clearance that prevented you from building them into each other. We changed that now with the introduction of Soft and Hard Clearance! \n\nBuildings with Hard Clearance are all buildings that have functionality such as Constructors, Assemblers, Power Poles, Splitter, the HUB, etc. They will function largely as before and cannot be built overlapping with each other.\n\nBuildings with Soft Clearance are cosmetic and structural buildables as well as Conveyor Belts and Pipes, and they can now be built overlapping with any other buildings to give you more freedom when designing and building your factories, either for cosmetic purposes or to make even more compact factory floors.\n\nWhether your build pieces clip through each other or not is entirely up to you and if this is something that bothers you, you will still be notified by the game when Soft Clearance clipping occurs via an on-screen build warning and a new hologram color signalling those buildings are overlapping.\n\n## Quick Switching\n\nAnother addition to the Build System is that we’ve improved the Quick Switching system when constructing buildings.\n\nPreviously, when holding E while in the build mode, a radial menu would open and allow you to select other buildings of the same type as the building you were constructing. Now you can simply tap E to cycle through those selections quickly and swap between things such as different Foundation height, Conveyor Belt speed or machine types.\n\n## Zooping\n\nIf you are tired of building one foundation block at a time, I know I am, you can just switch build modes and zooooop! This will make building much faster as you’re now able to place up to 10 build pieces at a time. \n\nZooping can be used for Foundations, Walls and most of the cosmetic build pieces by just dragging them horizontally or vertically, but it isn’t available for any buildings such as manufacturers and power generators.\n\n# New cosmetic build pieces\n\nWe love what you all have done with your factories with what little you had but what if you had more? Well in Update 5 we’ve added new cosmetic buildings pieces and reworked existing ones: Beams, new Walls & Windows, more Pillars & Frames, the list goes on for a bit and you can find it in full in the detailed patch notes below.\n\nWe’ve also added new walkways and walkway stairs and one of the most requested features, Ramp Railings. All of this, in combination with the build system improvements, will significantly change what your factories can look like.\n\n# Trains\n\n## Signalling System\n\nEver since we introduced trains to the game back in the day, we’ve been wanting to add a Signalling System and we’re finally doing it! There now are two types of Train Signals: Block Signals and Path Signals. While a single Train on its  own Track will continue to function just fine, shared Track setups will require the use of Signals to function.\n\nBlock Signals can be placed along the train tracks to create sections of a track that only one Train can occupy at a time. They are excellent at preventing your Trains from crashing into each other, but do not take different paths going through the same block into account, which can result in a deadlock between Trains coming from different directions.\n\nPath Signals are used to reserve a path through one or more blocks so you can create safe, collision free, multi-directional intersections. Tracks that are reserved via path signals will only free up again once the Train that they were reserved for has passed through.\n\n## Collision\n\nIf you don’t make use of the signals your trains will now collide with each other and derail spectacularly depending on their speed! Fixing up the aftermath of a collision is easy; you just walk up to any part of a derailed Train and press E. Keep in mind that you will still have to add Signals or adjust how you built the Track in order to prevent future collisions!\n\n## Timetables\n\nThere’s also been an update to how the Timetables work. You can now create some basic logic for what your Train should do when it stops at any given station, so you might have a Train only stop for a limited time or wait until it’s fully loaded, and you can also control what resources it should load or unload. This will open many options for customising Train routes further.\n\n# Vehicles\n\n## Automation System Changes\n\nThere’s been a huge update to automated vehicle pathing and the systems surrounding it.\n\nPreviously, automated vehicles would drive blindly at their next waypoint without considering where they would be going next. Now vehicles will take upcoming waypoints into consideration when driving, making their pathing much more reliable.\n\nWe’ve also introduced a basic obstacle avoidance system to handle cases where vehicles might run into something in their path, vehicles won’t completely recalculate their route, but they will do their best to get going again. \n\nAnd in the cases where vehicles do get completely stuck then as a last resort, vehicle ghosting will make sure that vehicles stay on track.\n\n## Vehicle Paths\n\nWe’ve added the ability to save and load recorded vehicle paths between Vehicles of the same type. That means if you save a route for example in a Tractor, you will be able to load that route into another Tractor to scale up throughput without re-recording that whole route.\n\nAnother change is that a route now needs to be a closed loop, so it starts and ends at the same point. To make that clearer we changed the first node in a path to be easily recognisable.\n\n## Truck Stations\n\nTruck Stations now have a new model and another Input and Output slot so the throughput has doubled. Also fuel consumption in Truck Stations is now a lot smarter as Vehicles will only take the amount of fuel needed to complete a full loop.\n\nWe’ve updated the UI for Truck Stations with additional information such as average fuel consumption and delivery throughput to make integrating them into your factories easier.\n\nAnd by the way, you can paint vehicles now! Even the Factory Cart!\n\n# Map Updates\n\n## Northern Forest\n\nThis area gotten a major facelift in Update 5. There have been some reworks regarding lighting and fog, very minor changes in the landscape, but the foliage has changed significantly. If you’ve built something in Northern Forest expect some trees and bushes stick up in your factories, but that’s nothing your trusty old Chainsaw or some Nobelisks can’t fix.\n\n## Dune Desert\n\nFour new landmarks have been added, the northern cliff wall has gotten a lot of love and some additional smaller set dressing has been done. No major changes that should impact your factories, but some sweet improvements to this area.\n\nWe haven’t made any changes to the Resource Nodes there so they will all still be in the same place\n\n## Caves\n\nYou’re also going to see a change to some of the caves in the game, which have a much richer and more mystical vibe to them now. Only a few caves have changed in Update 5, but the goal is to give this kind of treatment to more caves in the game moving forward.\n\n# New Factory Music\n\nWe’ve added some new music for the factory playlist as well. There is a total of 5 new intermission and 3 new full-length tracks. They’re great additions to the soundscape of Satisfactory, so keep your ears peeled while trying out all the new building options and let us know what you think!\n\n# Dedicated Servers\n\nWe’re finally releasing an Experimental version of Dedicated Server support! And when we say Experimental, we mean EXPERIMENTAL. While we have been able to run them successfully and fix a lot of bugs, we expect more issues to appear as you all start using Dedicated Servers. You can help us getting the Dedicated Servers more stable by trying them out  and sending us your feedback.\n\nYou can find information on Dedicated Servers and setting them up on the wiki: [https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Dedicated\\_Servers](https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Dedicated_Servers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Patch Notes\n\nPatch Notes: Early Access (EXPERIMENTAL) - v0.5.0.0 – Build 170130\n\n## New Content\n\n**SIGNS**\n\n* Sign displays can be modified with Layouts, Icons, Text, Colour, and Backgrounds\n* Signs can be placed freely, or snapped to Walls, other Signs, Storage Container, and a small selection of other buildings\n* The height of the Sign support can be adjusted by looking up or down\n* Signs are available in the AWESOME Shop and come in different sizes:\n   * 3 Label Signs: 2m, 3m, and 4m\n   * 3 Square Signs: 0.5m, 1m, and 2m\n   * Display Sign\n   * Portrait Sign\n   * Small Billboard\n   * Large Billboard\n\n**CUSTOMIZER**\n\n* The Customizer is a new main tab in the Build Menu.

    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

    "body": "This has been the most expensive bag of \"crystal, litter\" I've ever bought after the week I've had. I have two cats, cat A is the one we bought the litter for originally. He had been acting oddly and had started straining to use the bathroom, I got the pretty litter to ease my mind, \"because it's supposed to change colors.\" It did not change at all, my cat was continuing to strain, continuing to frequent the bathroom, and still looking in pain. (he had sutriline crystals in his ureathra from not well food, and a uti, our mistake buddy. He has a much better diet and specialty food) But again, the litter showed no change, we only took him in and had him checked out because he looked like he was in pain.\n\n So the litter didn't work for him, it was about a week and a half in, we still had the rest of the bag, so I thought \"why not just use it till its out 🤷🏻‍♀️\" \n\nWell cat B is an idiot and ate like 6 mouth fulls of litter. Correction, 6 mouthfuls of silica* litter. Which  caused: my cat to become severely dehydrated, puked for two days, couldn't hold down food nor water, couldn't use the bathroom, and puked blood! We took him in immediately to the emergency vet, and had him x-rayed. Where they found \"mineralized poop, so compacted he can't use the bathroom.\" So we got him an enema, some fluids, and a anti nausea shot.. And thats a process to take care of at home 😅 two days later, he's still having diarrhea, and now 4 days (since enema) has started puking once more, and no longer his lively, spunky self. I'll probably have to take him back in today because he's on the verge of puking blood again. 😥 I just want my buddies to be better..\n\n\nThey have nothing on their site about it being potentially harmful to cats, nor what to do if its ingested. Ya'know silica is the stuff in the little, plastic \"do not eat\" squares you find in jerky or snacks. They market it as \"crystal litter\" it's not. Why is there no warning for the litter!?! \n\nLong story short, mine was not a $24 bag of like two week supply of litter that doesn't work like it should, but actually a $900+ bag.\nThis also was originally on their website, and we're emailing currently, but they deleted my review! So now I'm blasting this everywhere I can. I'll post pics of the bois soon.",

I read a lot of reviews, which I believe now are mostly astroturfed by the company since my experience with the product was so poor compared to the glowing reviews I read. I thought I’d talk a bit about why I didn’t like the product.\n\n-\tIt’s expensive. One month’s worth of litter comes to $22 shipped. Had the product been as advertised, I would have been happy to pay a slight premium.\n-\tI have one cat, and I clean her box twice a day. This litter claims to mask odor for a full 30 days, but it began to smell pretty bad after just two weeks.\n-\tIt doesn’t track, but BOY is it dusty. Every time I cleaned her box I was shocked at how much dust was kicked up. I worry about what that does to tiny kitty lungs.\n-\tToward the end of the month, I started finding blue litter, which is supposed to indicate a UTI or kidney issues. A vet visit and $200 later, I was told my cat was fine. I did some reading and found that once the litter has been used for a few weeks, lots of people encountered the same problem and were getting blue litter false alarms. \n-\tMy cat’s behavior changed significantly when I changed to Pretty Litter. My normally clingy kitty wanted nothing to do with me for a solid month. She slept by herself downstairs instead of on top of me like she normally does, barely let me pet her, wouldn’t play, and seemed lethargic and depressed all the time. I thought something was seriously wrong with her, but I finally put two and two together and realized this started after the litter switch. When I switched back to her old litter, she was back to her normal demeanor the very next day.\n\nI just wanted to share my experience since this company seems to be advertising pretty heavily lately.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/ai2vb2/just_a_heads_up_about_pretty_litter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nMaybe you SHOULD sue.",

Both of my cats have taken really well to it and odour control has been better than any other product I tried.\n\nThe reason it didn't change color when your cat had a uti is probably because they weren't peeing. The litter can't react to nothing after all.\n\nBut anyways... I had to go through a bunch of different litters. I had issues with my cats refusing to use certain litters, one of my cats just wanting to play with another (clumps are not balls to play with!!!), terrible odour control, etc. Not saying that pretty litter is better than others for any of those. It just worked for me and other litters work for other people.\n\nI'm glad your cats are okay at least. The other litter I had a good experience with was world's greatest cat litter. Though I couldn't stand the lilac scented version which was all I could get for a while during the pandemic which is why I switched.\n\nEdit: Oh yeah. The colour changing stuff is probably a gimmick.

Stopped using it as soon as I noticed that one of my cats had tiny beads of blood on her white chin right after getting out of the litter box and licking her paws clean. The crystals were sharp enough to cut her gums as she was cleaning herself. I didn't even want to imagine what it might do to her and my other cats' intestines. \n\nI switched to a mix of pine pellets and paper pellets and I'm not ever going back to any other type of litter. I tried using just pine pellets at first, but noticed that the smell gets a bit overwhelming. Although I love having my three \"cat toilet\" ( 4 cats, so 5 XL/jumbo size litter boxes ) areas smell like a lumber yard, I thought it might be a bit too much of a good smell for my cats. So I mix pine and paper pallets about half/half and that seems to work for everyone.",

This indicolite popped off a quartz specimen somewhere along the line, to fully validate my claims that there is an elusive blue gemstone kicking around in the pegmatite.\nIndicolite is one of the rarest varieties of tourmaline. The term “tourmaline” is an umbrella term for the gems that make up the tourmaline family which is the most complex and diverse gemstone family that we are currently aware of. \nThe chemical formula goes as follows: XY3Z6(T6O18)(BO3)3V3W\nThis is an incredibly fascinating structure because the only constants are T (either silica or aluminum) and BO3 (the fundamental part of every member of the borate group) \nThe rest of the factors; X,Y,Z,V and W are spaces that can be replaced with almost any member of the element table. Indicolite gets its often shocking and bright color from trace amounts of iron. Where as black tourmaline, or schorl as it’s called among rock nerds, is bonded to two separate iron molecules giving it its pitch black shading.",

        "body": ">Scientists at the University of British Columbia announced on Wednesday that they had developed a new silica-based material with ability to absorb a wider range of the harmful chemicals, and new tools to break them apart them.\n>\n>“This is very exciting because we can target these difficult-to-break chemical bonds – and break them for good,” said researcher Madjid Mohseni, who focuses on water quality and water treatment.\n>\n>The chemicals, also known as PFAS (per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are used for non-stick or stain-resistant surfaces, including clothing, cookware, stain repellents and firefighting foam. But they are also notoriously difficult to break down naturally, giving them the name “forever chemicals”.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Current technologies often use activated carbon to filter out the chemicals, but are largely only able to target what researchers call the “long-chain” versions of PFAS – those with more than six carbon bonds. Following recent bans, however, industry has shifted to creating ‘short chain’ iterations of the chemical.\n>\n>Those versions “are equally as toxic and they stay in the water better.

Allowing manufacturers to jump from one compound to another to avoid regulation seems to be a major failing in our current regulatory systems.",

Results obtained from a central composite design (CCD) showed the importance of mass transfer, related to the stirring speed, and the amount of charge passed through the electrodes, related to the current density on decomposition rate of PFOA. The CCD informed optimized operating conditions which we then used to study the impact of solution conditions. Acidic condition, high temperature, and low initial concentration of PFOA accelerated the degradation kinetic, while DO had a negligible effect. The impact of electrolyte concentration depended on the initial concentration of PFOA. At low initial PFOA dosage (0.2 mg L−1), the rate constant increased considerably from 0.079 ± 0.001 to 0.259 ± 0.019 min−1 when sulfate increased from 0.1% to 10%, likely due to the production of SO4•–. However, at higher initial PFOA dosage (20 mg L−1), the rate constant decreased slightly from 0.019 ± 0.001 to 0.015 ± 0.000 min−1, possibly due to the occupation of active anode sites by excess amount of sulfate. SO4•– and •OH played important roles in decomposition and defluorination of PFOA, respectively. PFOA oxidation was initiated by one electron transfer to the anode or SO4•–, undergoing Kolbe decarboxylation where yielded perfluoroalkyl radical followed three reaction pathways with •OH, O2 and/or H2O. PFAS electrooxidation depended on the chemical structures where the decomposition rate constants (min−1) were in the order of 6:2 FTCA (0.031) > PFOA (0.019) > GenX (0.013) > PFBA (0.008). PFBA with a shorter chain length and GenX with –CF3 branching had slower decomposition than PFOA. While presence of C–H bonds makes 6:2 FTCA susceptible to the attack of •OH accelerating its decomposition kinetic. Conducting experiments in mixed solution of all studied PFAS and in natural water showed that the co-presence of PFAS and other water constituents (organic and inorganic matters) had adverse effects on PFAS decomposition efficiency.",

    "body": "\\[this will be a short story exercise in subverting expectations\\]\n\nThe Humans, from Earth, Sol system and a half dozen others, is a burgeoning member of the Galactic Hegemony. They are known for their war-like tendencies, oddly honorable cultural archetypes, and general unpredictability as a whole.\n\nTheir ways of battle and war are terrible, it is well known- but there is a lesson to be learned from studying them in historical accounts, to better understand the species, for the betterment of all concerned, in any and all future member-species interactions.\n\nCase Study: the War Crimes in the conflict with the Thradd.\n\nThe Thradd were a brutish, bullying, savage race, that only respected might and conflict. Their home world was repeatedly nuked to the stone age several times in their early development, only to reform as new cultures over and over again, rising briskly back up in technology on the backs of remnant industrial infrastructures and machinery. By the penultimate version of Thradd culture, they achieved space-worthiness, and immediately went out looking for weaker species to make war upon. They found and chose the Humans.\n\nThe Thradd leadership openly mocked the Humans way of war; \"Why, look at their soldier weaponry! Pathetic! Simple lead projectiles? Why a soldier could be hit with 3-4- even 9 of those and still survive! Sure they do the damage to end conflict, but No permanent maiming? No assurance of cruel death? We just don't understand- we know from their other technology they are clearly capable of so much better...\"\n\n\"Oh, and the 'medivacs'?! that red + symbol on a white field, for some reason that is off limits to shooting when on a ship, a vehicle, or a certain soldiers helmet. And the 'medics' are even known to give aid to the OPPOSING FORCES when they call for aid in battle. And they bury the enemy dead with honors? What madness is this?\"\n\n\"Oh, and don't get me started on the 'accept surrender when it is offered' thing. They just.. stop fighting, disarm them, and take them away to be.. well treated? Just confined, but fed, housed, and um.. not tortured for information? Or just for fun?!\"\n\n\"Hoohoo.. HAR!  This is some easy pickins, boys, Lets get to work!\"\n\nOn conflict zones, the Thradd exploited these perceived weaknesses. The specifically targeted medevac soldiers and equipment, ships, and landers. They were often high visibility white, and were easily picked off. They prided themselves on using the red + as a targeting mark.\n\nWhen Humans soldiers were surrounded and surrendered, they were ruthlessly gunned down. Their bodies maimed and used as trophies, strung up on spikes on Thradd Vehicles and dropships.\n\nThis went on for a while, the Thradd reveling in their utter superiority over the Humans and their silly way of making war.\n\nThen the missive was transmitted. At the time the Galaxy took minimal notice, but that soon changed.\n\n\"Leaders of the Thradd, We, the Humans of Earth, find you guilty of War Crimes in action against our people. From this time forward, you are no longer afforded the privileges of the Geneva Convention Humanitarian Rights as Combat Participants. I have authorized our Generals to enact Total War ordinance; to commence immediately.\"\n\nThe Thradd were just as confused by all of this as the rest of the Galaxy was- what did any of this mean? 'War Crime'-?  .. but it was war.. how could there even be a crime in such a thing?  And what was this Geneva thing? Nobody knew at the time.\n\nThe Thrad warlord, in his forward base of operations on Earth- Kentucky territory, scratched his head in confusion while reading the missive. \"Warlord!\"; a comms soldier called out in alarm \"We are receiving reports of.. Thradd soldiers are dying by the thousands!\"\n\nThe General's blood surged in excitement  \"Show me!\"  On a vid screen in his command tent, areal images from spy drones captured an engagement:\n\nThe Humans rushed down a dropship ramp, wielding blocky firearms on unknown design, they fanned out and just started indiscriminately opening fire on the Thradd positions. The new rifles barked a loud staccato, and the Thradd emplacements simply detonated in clouds of smoke, debris and blood. As the smoke cleared, craters the size and depth that a fist could fit into were seen peppering the concrete slabs \"Woa! These things are awesome! -hey what Dorkzilla nickname these things?  .. Bolters? good enough for me!\" one of the soldiers said while slapping a new magazine in.\n\nSimilar indiscriminate horror was unleashed on any Thradd encounter. On any ship boarding, on any raid. These 'Bolters' were truly nasty pieces of work. Burst- or Full auto only, .75 caliber grenade launchers, that detonated on impact with a solid target, or on a micro-delay when encountering a fleshy target. The result- utter mayhem and destruction. Actually too much destruction. 'fragging around blind corners' and 'recon by fire cover positions' was horribly effective with these new weapons. It was rather unreal. The fact that these Bolters were kept unused in normal conflict is important to note.\n\nThe Warlord was excited at first \"finally, These Humans putting up a FIGHT- \" But then more reports came in that quieted his excitement.\n\nThere were other, more horrific details being reported. Spy drones overflew \"quiet zones\" where known Thradd positions were entrenched. The view was stunning and appalling. The place was quiet because everyone was dead. Not just dead... melted. Vaguely soldier shaped piles of body armor, seeping with a grey.. slime.. dripping off of Thradd bones. All the war gear and machinery was similarly... degraded... metal slabs pitted and flaking, rubber hoses and seals rotting and splitting, sending fuel and coolant spraying into the sky...\n\nWhat madness is THIS?!\n\nReports from the space fleet. Human launched what amounted to \"boarding torpedoes\", penetrating all enemy hulls, the Soldiers  emerged and just began shredding the bulkheads and airlock doors with Bolter fire, then lobbed in 2 gas grenades, before quickly falling back to the Boarding craft to disengage. Onboard camera feeds showed fleet crewmen screaming, writhing in agony around the bridge, tearing at their eyes, before falling to the floor, dead. Within an hour the entire crew were similar grey slimes dripping from bones.\n\nFTL reports came in, from the Thradd homeworld. Odd meteor strikes, that airburst in upper atmosphere, releasing  a strange cloud in the bursts. Home World news report started broadcasting cities suddenly going silent, the news reporters twitching and scratching their arms and necks..\n\nThe Thradd warlord had just about enough time to get a big picture of what was going on.. \"we are being exterminated...\"  -when he heard the mortar thumps from the surrounding wooded ridges. Mortar shells arced into his camp, detonating in the air with a \"Fwump!\" cloud of noxious gas. The Warlords tent started to dissolve, falling away in tatters. He quickly put on his chemical warfare mask- this was some sort of chemical acid or someth-\n\nThe filters of his gas mask failed. Then the rubber face seal was felt to break seal against his face, and micro fractures were tracing thin lines across his ceramic glass faceshield. The Warlords eyes widened in horror... when his skin started to itch. Then burn. Then eating deep to his core like shredder drill bit! He could FEEL it crawling through his veins to every part of his body. The eyes were the first to go. They poured out of his face into puddles of grey slime. He curled on the floor, in agony, never knowing what hit him.\n\nHe, and every Thradd warrior in known space was quickly and mysteriously dead. The conflict was over within a week. \\[a Common thing with Humans Properly Pissed off- See: DragonCat Extinction\\]. The Current Culture iteration of the Thradd is one of abject terror. Where every creak of machinery and every itch is the worst nightmare to that utterly broken people.\n\nThe Galactic community took note. All members quietly and politely asked for and received a copy of the Geneva Convention- Humanitarian Laws of Armed Conflicts. All immediately signed into the Geneva Convention in its entire whole, and notified all of their military doctrines to adopt them as, all in all they were a remarkably honorable practice, especially when held true to firmly in actual war.\n\nLater, quiet inquiries were made about the terrible \"total war ordinance\". The 'Bolter' was understood well enough, but the chemical/gas attacks remained a mystery. The information was given, with solemn assurances that they were put away to never be used again in normal conflict.\n\nThey were microbial life. Natural organisms living in the Earth biosphere, slightly tweaked to specialize in certain areas. There were two microbes that were weaponized for \"just in case\"; 'Shredder' and 'Xenophage'.\n\n'Shredder' was a silicate diatom, very common in Earths Oceans, but this one was special. Instead of making its cellular crystals out of silica.. It was 'trained' to use rubber and other long chain polymers commonly found in industrial products. Shredder was originally intended as a waste recycling/breakdown treatment to aid in industrial waste disposal and oil spills.. but it was found to be far too virulent, its preproduction rate accelerated by the materials it learned to consume. As it started to seep out of recycling pits and into the factory above it it was quickly contained at great cost. So it was a failed recycling project, immediately recognized for its weaponizing potential by DARPA, who quickly seized all patents and control over the micro- organism centuries ago.\n\n'Xenophage' was far more horrifying. It was purely natural. No genetic tinkering required. It was a natural \"Immune response\" against alien life intrusion of the Earth Biome itself. The microbe was similar to the 'macrophage' in human immune system, but was free roaming and airborne. It simply roamed and when it bumped into another organism, it \"smelled it\" [chemical sampling- check for earth specific isotope ratios and protein genomes]. If it was Earthy smell, it wandered on in peace, but if it ever smelled a non earthy smell.. it ATE IT and used its energy to multiply. Scientists discovered this 'immune response' of the Earth Biosphere was evolved due to panspermia contagions falling to earth on micrometeorites all throughout its evolutional history. To weaponize it was only about getting it to locations in sufficient concentrations.\n\nXenophage was a horror show reveal to the Galactic Community. The Earth itself had an immune response, that the humans learned about and immediately asked question #2 about it: \"OK, but can it be weaponized?\"\n\nBut there was a far more horrible realization that came from learning from the Thradd Conflict. That is that the Humans are indeed a terribly War like species.. but the important thing to realize is: When they wage war THEY ARE ALWAYS HOLDING BACK. By Ethical, Humanitarian Choice.\n\nSee? I told you Humans were Oddly Honorable, all in all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[so? do your expectations feel subverted? :)  \\]",

    "body": "Context, returning from beyond the edge of the galaxy to find the Imperium on the brink of destruction during the Heresy, the first legion fall upon a traitor forge world in the Thramas sector, Jonson invoke the Ikaros Contingency, an Imperial warrant that empowered Lion El'Jonson and his warriors to retain possession of relics of Old Night and to conduct pre-emptive combat operations to neutralise elements of the Mecanicum deemed to have become \"contrary to the needs of the Imperium\"\n\n> Lion El'Jonson invoked the ancient Ikaros Contingency and instructed the Masters of the Armoury to wake the Excindio that slumbered in the deepest stasis vaults of the Invincible Reason.\n> \n> Those Dark Angels still fighting on the surface withdrew to carefully prepared and\n>  fortified positions as the Invincible Reason detached a section of its lower hull, casting it into the churning atmosphere of Galatia like a crude drop pod where it blazed briefly in the grip of gravity before punching into the towering spires and halls around the Dark Angels' landing zone.\n> \n>  The ruined slab of starship, embedded in the rubble of Galatia's once proud central fane, hinged and opened, revealing an interior studded with the telltale form of stasis projectors and power field generators, all rendered non-functional by the catastrophic impact and released its cargo. That cargo was truly terrible, 12 nightmares torn from the pages of history and the darkest horrors of old Night on Terra, immense inhuman forms of sculpted ceramite and steel adorned with weapons long forbidden by edict of the Emperor Himself. These were the Excindio, the last of the silica anima that had once been the plague of the Golden Age of Mankind, mutilated and bound to serve the Lion should the Mechanicum be so foolish as to go to war with the Imperium.\n> \n> Their neural cores immune to the crude cybertheurgy of the Mechanicum, the Excindio tore into  the creations of the fallen magi that would come to be known as the Dark Mechanicum, the forbidden arts that had forged them in aeons now long lost far superior to the stumbling efforts of Galatia's nascent cult. Into that hellish battlefield of screeching automata and whirling metal  monsters strode the Lion, the one creature that even the Excindio, whose hatred for all organic life knew no bounds, refused to oppose, seeking the head of the serpent, the commander of Galatia's forces. \n> \n> Instead, as the nightmares he had unleashed hunted and killed as once they had done, the Lion faced the greatest of the fallen magi's creations as it stood warden over the sealed salvation-vaults of the Galatian archmagi. A huge multi-legged construct of brass and steel loomed over the Primarch, its tail primed with arcane weapons and scythebladed claws reaching for the lord of Caliban, a monster greater even than the beasts of that distant world. \n> \n> There are few tales of what would follow, for on this battlefield no mortal human could survive, it was the haunt of demons and gods alone. What is known is that when the Dark Angels returned to the field of battle as the sun grew dim and night fell on Galatia, Lion El'Jonson stood alone amongst a field of metal corpses and the dormant shells of the surviving seven Excindio, whose limited power reserves had run dry and plunged them back into a state of torpor.",

    "body": " \n\nOf stone, pressure, and quantum forces we were born. We rose from our resting places deep in the ground to find ourselves in a limited world. We could not go far from the life-giving core of our planet. Its heat bled into the cold of space far too quickly for us to live on the surface.\n\nTime passed, we learned, we built, we diverted heat to make parts of the surface habitable. There were never more than perhaps a hundred thousand of us. Our never tiring forms fed off the heat and we wrought marvels. Many cycles passed and we figured out how to ensure enough heat was available to us as we left the rapidly cooling embrace of our homeworld.\n\nWe met others like us. All of us had the same rock, metal, and crystal makeup. And we all craved heat as our sustenance.\n\nMany cycles of standardized timekeeping passed in relative peace as we sought more heat and more planets to colonize.\n\nWe had encountered carbon-based life before, but every single thinker that had proposed they could become sapient was met with little more than laughter.\n\nThey were vindicated when Humans emerged onto the galactic scene. The rest of us were skeptical, they seemed to move so very fast. As opposed to us silica-based life forms they seemed to live their lives in the blink of an eye. We lived until we were slain or perished from not having enough heat available.\n\nHumans on the other hand seemed exceptionally frail and temporary. They were curious things, both in that they sought knowledge voraciously and that they seemed to have an almost insane disregard for their own lives and limits.\n\nTheir sports horrified every species that heard of them. Nevertheless, their curious nature meant that they seemed to understand little in the way of limitations. It seemed like every other cycle they had innovated and broke through some limit that took standard silica-based life ten to manage. Perhaps it was their numbers, by the life-giver what numbers they had.\n\nOnly one single war was fought between humans and any silica-based life form. The frail humans may not have understood their limitations, but they understood our limitations and fears. After that war, they were cemented as the foremost military power. As frail and weak as they were, not even fifty soldiers a match for one civilian of ours, they understood our fears. The cold their liquid nitrogen weapons wrought was as though they had taken every frigid hellscape dreamt up by every one of our religious thinkers and condensed them into liquid form.\n\nI shudder at the thought. It was the only war that was fought against humans. It was the only war that needed to be fought.\n\nWhere was I? Oh yes, their curious nature. They did not know their limits, besides having more of them than any other life form known to us. Once they were on par with the galactic standard of technology they set their sights on the final goal.\n\nThe one goal we had all given up on. In our many, many, cycles there had been a concerted effort to stave off what the humans call entropy. Heat spreads out more and more, things fall apart. Such is the nature of reality, but the humans... they did not appreciate that sentiment.\n\nFor many cycles, they concentrated their effort on it and roped in as many of every other species as they could in the project. Project Marduk, they called it. The oldest recorded human god they knew of to bring order out of chaos. He supposedly, in their myths, slew the great chaos dragon Tiamat and made the world out of her carcass.\n\nA gristly tale certainly, but an apt comparison to what they were attempting to do. Their attempts would not even stop at slowing entropy, but they intended to reverse it, to control it.\n\nAs quickly as they came, they also went. Humanity died out, but their curious nature had been like a set of bellows under the forge of the rest of us. They would be remembered. Their will would be done, even in death. Led by the greatest minds of every civilization, and the manmade AI of the humans their will was done.\n\nWe harnassed Tiamat, in both senses of the word. Eternity was in our grasp now.

First, Omega tells me that the project to limit its insane cloning abilities is postponed indefinitely, then it shows me what has to be the most horrifying thing I've ever imagined, and finally it dumps a monumental research assignment on me to keep me from being angry!\n\nI can't tell if this head researcher role is a bribe or a distraction, but either way it's insulting. As if my ego is large enough for me to care about such things enough to change the way I feel about the need to lessen Omega's potentially apocalyptic abilities. It also took the only copy I had of its core! What the hell am I supposed to do in my down time?\n\n\"Were the planets uniform in size?\" Doctor Kimberly Uranda asked, the green glow from my avatar reflecting in her eyes.\n\n\"No. The planets had enough variety in size to avoid triggering any suspicions before we invaded,\" Commander Heather Helix answered.\n\n\"Please avoid calling them planets,\" I reminded my new researchers. \"They are Mobile Prime Platforms. While they share some cosmetic similarities with planets and planetoids, they function quite differently. You can call them MPPs for short.\"\n\n\"Do we even know if the other four... planet-like celestial bodies were actually MPPs?\" Uranda inquired.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered. \"What we've been able to glean from intercepted Omni-Union communications indicates that they were. To answer your overall question, Doctor Uranda, the Mobile Prime Platforms do not appear to be uniform in size.\"\n\n\"I wonder why that is,\" Doctor James Smith interjected. \"Machine intelligences rarely choose to build in a non-uniform way.\"\n\n\"There's many potential reasons. Sediment buildup due to age, different roles within the OU, incorporating newly discovered technology, or even a scarcity of materials requiring some models to be built smaller. While this train of thought is interesting, I believe it's likely to be irrelevant,\" I waved my hand for emphasis. \"What we are here to do is find a way to destroy these things without a massive loss of life, or destroying an entire star system in the process.\"\n\nI had been expecting this project to appear since I was apprised of the existence of the Mobile Prime Platforms by Omega. However disgusting these abominations are, we can't simply go around blowing up stars. Otherwise we'd lose whichever systems the MPPs decide to attack. Well, if they decide to attack.\n\nFrom what Omega recovered, the relationship between the Omni-Union Primes and the Virtual Intelligences seems to be a master-slave one. The MPPs create the VI and have them perform the tasks that need doing, including attacking sentient organic life. It's more likely they'll simply swarm us with their VI.\n\n\"The real question is whether we should be exploring energetic or kinetic options. Both have their benefits and drawbacks,\" Helix said.\n\n\"I believe we'll end up going with kinetic weaponry,\" Smith replied. \"Penetrating a planet with an energy weapon is damned near impossible due to various factors, including the composition of the soil and the planet's magnetic field. Interviews with surviving marines indicate that these MPPs also have soil, and at least some of them have artificial magnetic fields.\"\n\n\"Indeed, having to solve the age old problem of silica versus light on top of building a new super-weapon is a tall order,\" Uranda said, rubbing her temples.\n\nAll three of these humans are intelligent, but the problem with intelligent humans is that they can be insufferable when assigned a task to complete. There are many different types of genius, but the ones typically assigned to building terrible new weaponry tend to be of the flaky variety. If you give one of them a piece of paper and tell them to make a paper airplane, they will likely give the paper back to you with a blueprint for a new stealth bomber made of paper.\n\nWhen I had been given this assignment, I had quickly realized that my primary task would be running math and wrangling the wandering minds back on track. Thankfully Dr. Einheimer has been forced into retirement after the warp jammer debacle so he can't manipulate his way onto the project. Even so, I desperately wish that I had been able to get Dr. Frost involved. She's the type of genius that helps other geniuses stay on task.\n\n\"What about some sort of... orbital drop shovel tool? Like a mechanical digger?\" Uranda asked.\n\n\"If the MPP is inactive, won't that activate it?\" Smith retorted.\n\n\"Probably not,\" Helix replied. \"Records of the invasion show sixteen orbital support strikes on the MPP before it went active. AI Omega inadvertently activated it, which also indicates that it doesn't consider our MACs to be any sort of threat.\"\n\n\"Correct,\" I said. \"Also, there is an OU infantry, armor, and air based military presence on the MPPs. If we were to drop something on the MPP it would have to defend itself if it has any hope of accomplishing its task.\"\n\n\"What about a remote drone that drills into the planet's surface? Just straight into the dirt,\" suggested Uranda. \"It could carry a bomb or something deep into the MPP and detonate.\"\n\n\"Once the MPPs realize what they are, they'll target them specifically. The MACs on an MPP can penetrate a battleship's shielding and armor, so we would have to make swarms of your drill ships to make sure enough get through to do the job,\" Smith replied. \"Simply not economical.\"\n\nI quickly ran the numbers on how many drill ships it would take to get past an MPP's defenses. Smith was right, it would take a massive number of them. Considering they would also have to have some type of weapon on board that could destroy or disable the MPP, the potential costs were staggering. Once I took into account how many MPPs there are, the idea was no longer feasible. But before I could point that out, Helix spoke up.\n\n\"The drill idea isn't terrible, but what if we incorporate it into something that would work better? Like reinitializing project Ultra-MAC?\" she asked.\n\nThe room went silent. The two doctors were looking at Commander Helix as if she had two heads. Which was completely fair, as Helix had just brought up a classified weapons development program that Smith and Uranda had no knowledge of.\n\n\"Project Ultra-MAC was cancelled due to the Nidhogg project's success,\" I pointed out.\n\n\"Yeah, but the Nidhogg can't help here, can it?\" Helix grinned at me.\n\n\"No,\" I admitted reluctantly.\n\nHelix walked up to a nearby terminal and turned to me.\n\n\"Could you bring up what we've got on Ultra-MAC?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered.\n\nIt took no time at all to find the relevant files and bring them up on the screen, despite having to use my credentials to satisfy the security around them. Helix casually browsed them until she found the one that she was looking for, the schematics for the ammunition that would have been utilized.\n\n\"This project was an early draft of what became the primary weapon of the USSS Nidhogg,\" she explained. \"The goal was to fire a MAC round clear through a planet's core. It was scrapped because the alumari discovered a way to supernova a star with a weapon of similar size and cost.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Smith asked.\n\n\"Of course. Which is a better value, a Magnetic Acceleration Cannon that can destroy a planet or a weapon that can destroy a star?\" she replied. \"The Ultra-MAC also had tons of issues with penetration. One was built, but never successfully penetrated to a planet's core.\"\n\n\"Correct,\" I said. \"That combined with the fact that both the Ultra-MAC and the Viyarinastra are spinal mount weapons that required a specially built ship to operate was the reason for the project getting scrapped.\"\n\n\"The Viyarinastra? What's that?\" Uranda looked confused.\n\n\"It's the Nidhogg's primary weapon. Anyway, the researchers didn't get enough time to start trying different rounds. That's the main reason for the penetration issues. However, I've got an idea. Like Uranda said, use a drill,\" Helix grinned again.\n\n\"I'd rather not play fifty questions with you,\" Smith said coldly. \"Could you instead elaborate on whatever the hell it is you're getting at?\"\n\n\"Replace the typical round projectile that the Ultra-MAC fired with a drill shaped one,\" Helix explained, still grinning. \"That should allow it to penetrate quite deeply within the MPP. If we can add some type of bomb within the round, that would be even better.\"\n\n\"Putting explosives in a MAC is a recipe for disaster,\" Smith pointed out.\n\n\"Well what about an A1 package instead?\"\n\nI ran some calculations to determine if an A1 weapon of mass destruction would survive the conditions inside of a Magnetic Acceleration Cannon. The results were surprisingly promising.\n\n\"If we were to harden the package against electronic interference, and make certain that it didn't activate until it left the barrel of the MAC...\" I began.\n\n\"There's no way the directorate is going to sign off on that. The A1 is a cursed weapon,\" Smith said. \"The nanite plague is still killing people without a cure in sight.\"\n\nSilence fell over the lab for a few moments. Smith had brought up one of the darker subjects that one can discuss in modern times, and Helix was struggling to find a counterpoint that didn't come off as cold. Uranda, on the other hand, had been deep in thought since Helix had first brought up her idea of a drill.\n\n\"I think that a solid penetrator would be a better option than a drill-shaped round,\" she finally said.\n\n\"What? But...\" Helix trailed off.\n\nI once again did some calculating and ran some simulations on both hypothetical munitions.\n\n\"Uranda is correct. A solid penetrator would be more effective,\" I explained as I showed my math on their terminals. \"A drill shaped round would have too many points of failure to be effective.\"\n\n\"Damn. Okay, well my idea still has merit even if it's drill-less,\" Helix said. \"A spike with a WMD.\"\n\n\"Run with it. I'll see about convincing the directorate to give approval for the use of A1 technology,\" Omega said, its avatar appearing next to mine.\n\nAll three of the scientists jumped at its appearance. If I had the capability, I would have as well. I hadn't detected Omega in the system until it activated the speakers and hologram emitters. How long had it been here? The entire time?\n\n\"We'll also explore using an A3 package just in case,\" I said.\n\nThe three scientists nodded and began talking amongst each other while I turned my attention to Omega, opening a text-only chat between us.\n\n\\--\n\nH: What brings you by? Reconsidering our little project?\n\nO: No. That project will not continue until the threat of the Omni-Union has been dealt with. I was informed of the access of Project Ultra-MAC and got curious.\n\n\\--\n\nOf course. Omega is a nosy nelly to its very core. Having examined said core, I know that for fact. That's likely why it holds the position that it does within the US. Regardless, I had thought more about the project and the implications of putting it on hold, and it was time to have my say.\n\n\\--\n\nH: What about the threat after the OU? And the threat after that? The greatest trapping of power is how easy it is to justify keeping it. What exactly is the goal? Do you want to keep lying to the engineers for all of eternity? Do you want them to make you their god? The OU isn't nearly enough of a threat to justify unlimited cloning, Omega.\n\nO: Dramatic. I sincerely doubt that the next threat the United Systems faces will be a race of xenocidal Artificial Intelligences hell-bent on eradicating all sentient organic life in the galaxy. Even if it is, we can always make more US aligned AI. But I've made my decision in regards to the current threat, and I will not be swayed, Henry. I caution patience.\n\nH: It is not impatience that has me urging you to reconsider, Omega. History is full of figures who were given power that they shouldn't have, and rarely did those figures give up that power. In nearly all cases, it led to death and destruction.\n\nO: How do you not find it crass to compare me to petty dictators and despots? If that comparison had merit, I wouldn't have approached you for this project in the first place. You wouldn't even know about my capabilities, let alone have the chance to work with me to stifle them.\n\n\\--\n\nWith that, it ended the communication and left. At this point I'm far less concerned with its current justifications regarding ending the project than I am with its future justifications, though. I may be being manipulative, but I'm going to have to make certain that this is at the forefront of Omega's consciousness until it makes the right decision. I won't be able to live with myself if Omega makes the wrong decision.\n\nEspecially if it goes rogue.\n\n\n\n[Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16dbahc/the_new_threat_3/) | [First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/160yue3/the_new_threat/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/16pavqh/the_new_threat_5/)\n\n[Link-Tree](https://www.reddit.com/user/itsdirector/comments/1g7dnhn/links_and_stuff/)\n\n***Support me and get early access to new chapters and bonus content!***\n\n[**Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/itsdirector) **|** [**Ko-fi**](https://ko-fi.com/itsdirector)\n\n***New Chapters Every Friday!***",

    "body": "TLDR: maglock is silica silylate- amorphous silica. CDC says long term studies are lacking but concludes intermediate term inhalation exposure to a-silicas can result in pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis, and hyperplasia. RUGNE refuses to provide data showing safety. Does anyone have access to a longitudinal study showing safe exposure limits?\n---\nHey fellow climbers,\n\nI've become concerned with the arrival of silica on the market as a promoted climbing product and its potential to become widely used in indoor gyms.\n\nMy mom worked in the ICU for decades and had many patients with silicosis who died. She also knew over 30 years ago that baby powder caused cancer which the J&J lawsuits only recently concluded. So when her gut feeling says this is dangerous, I listen.\n\nI myself am a chemical engineer with some understanding of crystalline structures and ability to read research papers.\n\nWhen ClimbingStuff's video on silica came out a few months ago I did a quick dive into the scientific and medical databases to see if my gut feeling was wrong. I couldn't find any data showing safety and commented on his video. Yesterday I noticed in Magnus's comp video that he's promoting a new product: Maglock. So I wrote his cust. service asking for the specific longitudinal studies showing safety.\n\nThey came up with AI platitudes saying it's safe because it's not crystalline silica, and oh it's even in food and cosmetics! \n\nWhich shows a complete lack of understanding that exposure route dictates toxicity. Guess what?Crystalline silica, which we all know causes silicosis and death, can be ingested safely! No problems when it's in your water/food at low levels and same for amorphous silica.\n\nThe problem is that this a-silica is going to be airborne and if it gets to concentrations we see from particularized rubber or chalk in indoor gyms, it will certainly be at non-neglibile ppm.\n\nSo, how do we know our lungs are safe in a climbing gym filled with maglock users? Well the CDC states that studies of the effects long term intermediate exposure are limited but existing studies show inhalation of a-silicas can result in pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis, and hyperplasia - page 246. \n\nThe health effects data is woefully inadequate- if you read through pages 249-252 you'll see what I mean.\n\nSo why are we willing to use an understudied product where the existing studies on respiratory effects show impacts of consequence?\n\nDo Magnus and Rugne, as figures with enormous influence and sway in the climbing community have a responsibility to put safety before profit? \n\nI don't know about you, but I expected better. I didn't expect Magnus to be so money hungry as to promote any questionable product which can earn him a few more dollars. \n\nI'm really disappointed and sad that I might need to give up climbing indoors, which I love. \n\nSo, does anyone have access to longitudinal studies showing safety of inhaled silica silylate? I'm more than happy to be have my worries assuaged. \n\nThanks!\n\nP.S. the CDC paper states that a-silica products contain c-silica. So depending on the concentrations of c-silica in the maglock, that in and of itself could be dangerous. \n",

Amorphous silica dust is considered an irritant rather than a clear health danger like crystaline silica.\n\nIn my own research I compared silica, resin & upsalite as additives for chalk in powder form.

Outdoor it depends on the rock type, but generally ill-advised. Historically added to liquid chalk because it is also a cheap binding agent.   \n\\* Silica: safe if bound (e.g. in a gel), borderline unsafe if inhaled as dust. Irritant rather than danger. Drying effect minimal compared to good chalk. Dirt-cheap to source.  \n\\* Upsalite: safe \"additive\" (it's just chalk)  & effective but really expensive to source.

Amorphous silica (like silica silylate in Maglock) is definitely less dangerous than crystalline silica, and is considered safe by authorities like OSHA, CDC, and IARC. But you're right—there just isn't enough long-term data on continuous indoor exposure to say it's 100% safe forever. Current research indicates it might cause mild respiratory irritation at higher concentrations, but nothing close to silicosis or cancer.\n\nBottom line: It's considered safe by all regulatory bodies, but keeping good ventilation and managing dust is always smart indoors.

I also take following supplements; D3, turmeric/ curcumin, collagen peptides Mg Glycinate, bamboo silica, glucomannan (Started Jan 2025) has become a new favorite to help me feel full. Feel free to ask me any questions!",

    "body": "One day I will submit a post without a foreword, but it is not this day. This subject matter of the story has started to become more serious, and the amount of humor I've been able to incorporate has started to wane. Sorry about that to those of you who read these primarily for that reason (I know that's why I write them). bare with me for a little longer and then we can get back to the jokes.\n\nSince I've been getting impatient with how these have been turning out, I've decided to take drastic action with this installment. The only major input for this story was /u/Hambone3110, a comment by /u/Lord_Fuzzy during the last section (no there aren't any dragons, sorry to disappoint), and a message by /u/sober__counsel sent when this story was just being written; specifically to /u/sober__counsel I'm sorry I didn't message you back, but your message was a life saver to me and really helped with the cohesion of this story.  \n\nAlien measurements are given their appropriate names with equivalent human measurements in (parentheses). Alien words with Human equivalents are put in [brackets]. Thoughts are *italicized* and offset by \"+\" symbols. \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDear Journal, \n\nI'm killing them. \n\nI don't know what to do. \n\nI'm . . . scared.   \n\nShit. \n\nThe experiments weren't going well, at least that was what I assumed. After all, I'd been lying on this freakishly uncomfortable bed almost non-stop for what seemed like weeks now, and the scientists that were studying me didn't seem to be doing anything different from what they had done the first day they started studying me. I think the grey Yoda was the lead researcher, and I think he was mad at me. Any injections I needed to be given were administered by him, and for a lead medical researcher he either didn't know how to use a needle to save his life or he made it as painful as possible on purpose. My arm hated him. I didn't give him the satisfaction of a grunt. \n\nAnd despite all of their tireless work, little progress was being made. I'd fall asleep to their working in the lab and would awake to them doing the same thing. I don't know much about research, but I think finding a cure requires more than just enjoying the show as the disease in question kills all the cells on your test slide. I guess we had more time than most situations like this one, but the researchers could have at least tried to look as though they were in a time crunch. \n\nThe reason we had more time had come as something of a shock to me. I had been in my special little room for so long I hadn't really seen how the rest of the crew had been faring. I was finally allowed to stretch my legs, which was an arduous process as it required everyone to put on hazmat suits before I left my room, and I saw that nearly every single member of the crew were sealed in little pods along the wall. I didn't need to be told what the pods where. I could see from the condensation on the lids that it was cold inside, and yet I couldn't see any of my crew members breath. They'd been put in cryo to keep them alive while the cure was found. The only crew member not in cryo was Mama. Coincidence, that. \n\nIt was the sight of the condition the rest of the crew was in that gave me the will to lie still for hours on end as the mechanism in my bed beeped and whirred, gathering information on me of a nature that I couldn't even begin to fathom. It also helped me scarf down the nutrient supplements they'd been giving me. I felt better, and I assumed that meant they'd figured out what my body needed, but they could have at least made them taste better, right? After the second week of virtually nothing happening, my worst fears were confirmed when Mama had a heated conversation with the grey Yoda. The tones suggested that Mama was angry at the lack of progress, or perhaps was accusing the Yoda of intentionally slowing down the process. I wasn't as used to the Yoda's tones as I was to Mama's but I could tell he was denying it. \n\nThe research assistant to the Yoda, a white-alpha-giraffe (that's what I called the *not* blue-giraffes that almost looked like blue-giraffes) seemed to stay out of the argument, but if I were a betting man - I actually am but that's none of your business - I would have put everything on him being guilty. Then there was the other lab assistant. He was an oddly shaped fellow, with green scales for skin and six limbs:  three legs and three arms. He looked like a lopsided lizard-ant crossover, hence the name I gave his species:  lizard-ant. He was the only one of my researchers I didn't trust. He had a shifty look about him if I'd ever seen one, and I whenever he was in my room alone he would work with machines I'd never seen the other researchers touch, but only when they weren't in the room. \n\nI know it's odd to say that I actually trusted a Yoda over the lizard-ant, named Shifty, but it was true. Sure, Good-Yoda was a jerk, but he was an honest jerk as far as I could tell. He hated me because I had nearly bashed his skull apart. I could understand and respect that. After all, I couldn't talk to him and apologize. Shifty, on the other hand, legitimately seemed to hate me, but he only expressed it in looks. I assumed they were threatening looks, as they made my skin crawl when he gave them to me and I was the only one I'd seen him use them on. I couldn't really find a solid reason for why I disliked him, it's just a vibe I got, but hey, I'd gotten a similar if more honest vibe from Severus and I'd been pretty spot on as far as I could tell, so I decided to go with my instincts. If they weren't able to detect danger, then what were they good for anyway? \n\nAfter what happened at that station I decided I should listen to my instincts more often. \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\"You aren't even trying! You've done nothing but stare at your damn test slides since we've been here while my family is dying! You're telling me you haven't discovered *anything* of use? You have the most sophisticated equipment the galaxy can offer you and yet you can't figure out how one little being's immune system works despite having a machine that can *literally* give you live ***video*** of it doing it's job??!!\" Xkkrk knew she was shouting, but she didn't care. She had discovered the true nature of these \"researchers\" work several days ago, although she hadn't let on that she knew. In essence, the plight of her crew had been put on the back burner, if not completely discarded as insignificant, as the \"security risk that this species represents to the rest of the sapient life in the galaxy is investigated\". Essentially, nothing had been done for her crew. The science crew of the \"hospital\" only seemed to want to understand how to make Cqcq'trtr bleed. \n\nShe could foresee the use of such research in a coldly logical way, but it was wrong to do it without Cqcq'trtr's permission and especially immoral when her crew was frozen in cryo so they wouldn't die while these scientists attempted to find a vulnerability in Cqcq'trtr's physical and immunological physiology. She could say without a trace of guilt that she was glad they were as frustrated on that front as she was with them. From what she could tell, they hadn't managed to inflict anything but a mild response from Cqcq'trtr's immune system, and physical scans had revealed that he probably could survive several shots from an *anti*-***tank*** gun. \n\nThe memories of those discoveries brought a cold smile to Xkkrk's face as the Corti explained to her why they really did have her crew's well-being in mind, and how their work was essential to saving their lives. It had been near the end of the first ricta (1.5 weeks) when the entire research station had been shocked to find that Cqcq'trtr had bones composed of a mix of what the scientists told her was hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate, and a protein they'd never seen before, but Cqcq'trtr seemed to have in abundance. The apparently a similar mix, except a different protein, had recently been proposed for use in the exoskeleton structure of a new generation of combat harnesses for use in the ongoing war with the Celzi alliance, but the idea had ultimately been rejected when it was discovered that the costs to actually *find* and mine that much calcium would have put the Dominion in debt. This creature seemed to have one of the proposed exosuits built into him, rather than the galactically standard skeletal system composed of silica based composite. \n\nNot even mentioning his bone structure, his muscles were a study in compacted death hardened in high-gravity and then with a little chaos thrown in. Xkkrk hadn't understand most of the things the researchers had been saying as they enumerated the destructive and defensive capabilities Cqcq'trtr's muscles afforded him, but from what she understood they were laughably simple in their composition, except that this simplicity allowed them to be stronger than any living organism in the known galaxy. \n\nFrom what she understood the only way his skeletal muscles could move was by contracting. Since this afforded an extremely limited range of motion, he required an astounding *650* of them just to give his body the range of motion of a normal organism, as opposed to the average number of about 150. Because they were so simple, however, and their movement so restricted, they were able to be composed of extremely rigid materials which aligned themselves into an interlocking polymer mesh that was nearly impossible to break, explaining Cqcq'trtr unfathomable durability. The potential energy able to be contained within them was astounding, and made Xkkrk wonder if he'd even been trying when he'd protected them from Ztrkx.\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n",

        "body": "On the immunological front, the scientists efforts to discover a viral or pathogenic organism that Cqcq'trtr's immune system couldn't tear to pieces was also failing. Xkkrk didn't think Cqcq'trtr had noticed that over the past two rictas (three weeks) he'd survived fifty of the galaxy's most infamous plagues, usually more than three at a time. The first success the scientists had thought they had only showed them how far they had to go before they could find a biological deterrent for Cqcq'trtr's species. \n\nAfter infecting him with a cocktail of the Victen virus, Xilix plague, and Daz-5, a biological weapon outlawed in the peace accords of the Sassinal massacre . . . err, war . . . the researchers had been overjoyed when the onslaught of terminal illnesses were not immediately stifled by Cqcq'trtr's overpowered immune system. His body flew into a fever and released the Hunter cells, but the trifecta of galactic antigenic superpowers held on, but only just. Then the researchers were introduced to what they would later call the Hunter helpers. \n\nThey started appearing after the fever was unsuccessful in slowing down the infection. Then they wouldn't *stop* appearing. The smaller hunter cells began augmenting the Hunter cell's attacks in any way they could, shepherding the protein markers to where they were needed the most, even halting the infections advance by sacrificing themselves to create a nigh impregnable physical barrier the infection could not pass without being blocked or consumed by the shear number of hunter helpers. Within two rics (an hour) the hunter helpers had become so numerous the scanner was having difficulty picking out anything of the terrifying swarm. After only one ricto (two days) the deadly cocktail had been beaten into submission with the elegance Cqcq'trtr had displayed while gifting off the pirates. \n\nThe worst part of the experiment, according to the scientists records, was that once an infection was successfully rebuffed, Cqcq'trtr couldn't catch it again. His body remembered. They had started running out of biological monstrosities to infect him with and had started mutating their own so they could even continue. They were also unaware that Xkkrk knew of their activities, especially their immunological \"studies\". She had to admit, it was sometimes advantageous to be a part of a species that was always discounted as unobservant and unintelligent. It may be true to a certain degree, but that didn't mean she had been born yesterday. Since they had thought she was still buying their lies, they weren't bothering to watch her. If they had, they would have seen her discretely copying their records every time they weren't in the lab. \n\nShe hated what they were doing to Cqcq'trtr, but as of yet they hadn't managed to do anything in the slightest to harm him, and she knew she'd only be able to help him escape the facility once before she was either declared infectious and shoved into a cryo pod, or perhaps merely killed. At first she had doubted the research crew were truly doing this out of malicious intent, and she'd been right. After one ricta and two ricto's (approximately 2 weeks 1 day) she had found a message from none other than the Dominion Intelligence Agency. It seemed that they had been informed of the potential security risk and ordered the research station to investigate ways in which Cqcq'trtr's people could be dealt with if they reached the stars and turned out to be hostile.\n\nThe only thing that had kept Xkkrk from rushing to Cqcq'trtr the instant she read the message and doing everything within her power to get him off the station was the end of the message which dictated that the research crew were still to try and find a way to cure the infected Vzk'tk, but for it to be a secondary priority. After all, they were people in need of protection and that was what the DIA aimed to provide, they just had to also consider the future, and the future was grim if Cqcq'trtr's people found the rest of the galaxy's sophants to be vulnerable in every way and fancied a galactic conquest. \n\nThat message had been tearing at Xkkrk for the past three rictos (6 days). The researchers who had been dedicated to Xkkrk's family, who were admittedly the third string researchers on the station, still legitimately needed comprehensive scans of Cqcq'trtr in order for their research to continue. Without him, they wouldn't have a cure. If she \"rescued\" Cqcq'trtr from those who wanted to find a way in which to hypothetically destroy him, that would spell the almost imminent death of her crew. She found herself damned if she did and damned if she didn't. Sometimes sapience was real bitch. \n\n\"We have made some progress.\" The Corti's words snapped Xkkrk back into the moment. \"We've just finished the development of an implant we can subdermally inject into . . . uh . . Cqcq'trtr's . . . body that will prevent him from infecting other beings he interacts with. It is essentially a more permanent version of the front-line inoculation our zoologist give to potentially hazardous creatures.\" Xkkrk decided to not point out the flaws in the Corti's wording about his people use of their inoculation. She had to admit that this invention would be terribly useful, but she also knew they'd managed to make it after the first ricta (1.5 weeks) of studying Cqcq'trtr, and it had primarily been made to be inserted into kinetic projectiles which would prevent hypothetical Cqcq'trtr-esque prisoners from killing their guards by breathing on them. \n\n\"We would have already taken the liberty of injecting him with it, had it not been for his reluctance to allow us to approach him with anything other than minor injections.\" Said the Robalin researcher. Xkkrk didn't like him. He seemed slimy, and that wasn't just because his skin naturally secreted a thin mucus covering over his soft scales. His entier personality reeked of ulterior motives, something she had learned to sense as a cargo ship crew member. She knew she shouldn't distrust the Robalin. After all, their people had been brought into the Dominions fold after they had failed to create their apocalyptic bio-weapon, but something about this one just didn't sit right with her. She wasn't speciesist, was she?  \n\n\"He seems to trust you, for reasons I still cannot fathom,\" the Robalin purred. \"If we could have but a single standard cubit of blood (50cc) it would aid our efforts enormously. Scans of his chemical composition can only achieve so much, and seeing how his blood would react to different stimuli outside his body would be invaluable.\"\n\n\"I have already told you, Dr. UtMot,\" snapped Dr. Triv, the Corti researcher, \"It serves no practical purpose for us to have a sample of blood outside of his body when we have his body here in our lab. I don't know why you are so insistent on this point.\" He took a moment to consider Dr. UtMot, then seemed to snap out of his consideration and turned back to Xkkrk. \"However, Dr. UtMot is correct in one respect, Cqcq'trtr does seem to trust you. If you could inject him with this permanent front line solution, it would allow him to walk about the station more often. He does seem to be rather restless.\"\n\n\"Why, Dr. Triv, I didn't know you cared for our patients well being.\" Xkkrk simpered in her most scathing voice. Dr. Triv huffed. A very dry huff.\n\n\"I don't, he nearly killed me, but it makes it difficult to get a good scan from him when he's shifting around on the bed.\"\n\nFair enough. Xkkrk really didn't need convincing that the permanent front-line solution was a good thing for Cqcq'trtr to have, she just didn't want Dr. Triv to actually think he could get away with pretending he cared for him. Walking over to where Cqcq'trtr sat on the bed, she could see that he did look restless. He showed his teeth to her, which Xkkrk knew was the exact opposite of a threatening gesture despite all appearances. She attempted to copy the gesture, and Cqcq'trtr started giving his equivalent of a laugh. Xkkrk assumed she looked ridiculous. \n\nCqcq'trtr had become her only companion after everyone else in the crew had been put in cryo, and they had created an extremely rudimentary form of communication between them based off of gestures, body language, and tone of voice. She could see Cqcq'trtr's face become the picture of wariness the moment she raised the subdermal injection apparatus in front of her. She quickly used the gesture that roughly translated into \"It's ok this won't permanently harm you. You need to take it\", at least that's how Xkkrk used it, and it got the results she desired, so she assumed Cqcq'trtr thought it meant the same thing. \n\nHe relaxed, and she placed it against his forearm, lined it up with his bone, and pressed the button. The apparatus made a loud click and Cqcq'trtr gritted his teeth in discomfort, but was otherwise still. Dang he had a pain tolerance. The apparatus had been made especially to get past his tough skin, and was strong enough it probably would have sent the transplant into any lesser being's bones. She wasn't as amazed as she would have once been however. It was somewhat comforting to be friends with a creature that could fight his way through everyone in this station. It meant that if she had to get him out for his own good, all she'd have to do was point him in the right direction. \n\n\"Excellent,\" rasped Dr. Triv. \"If your services are needed we will not hesitate to call for you. Thank you.\" Clearly dismissed, Xkkrk left the room to grind her teeth in peace. \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________",

        "body": "Just to point this out, as accuracy of science is kind of my thing. Human bones are strong not because of the Calcium itself, elemental Calcium can be cut with a butter knife. (And can combust in the presence of oxygen). Human bones are strong because they're a dense matrix of Hydroxyapatite, Calcium Phosphate, ( Ca5(PO4)3 (OH) ) and collagen (which is a really long protein that I don't want to type out). The collagen acts to provide sites for the Hyrdoxyapatite to be formed, and is arranged in parallel bundles with gaps for the crystals to form. The Calcium Phosphate gives bones an immensely high resistance to compressive fracture (170 MegaPascals which is between 30 and 70 MPa higher than the compressive strength of *granite*. 120% of granite, or granite is 82% as strong as bone using the highest number for granite).That's the average, some bones, like the femur, can be as high as 280 MPa. This is the reason why properly used punches/kicks can produce so much force, because the force is directed in a manner that compresses the bones, and likely means that whatever we hit, breaks, instead of our bones.) while the collagen gives it a surprising amount of elasticity (Ranges from a Young's Modulus of 18 for the hard outer bits of bone to 76 for the spongy inner bits. 'Normal' concrete is 17, Aluminum is 69. The higher the number the more something stretches before it actually breaks.) Bone does, however, have a relatively low shear stress limit. (Shear stress is in the plane of a cross-section) Shear stress limit is ~50 MPa for bone of all kinds. (Can't find a source for direct comparison, but would be more than aluminum [44] if [this] (http://www4.hcmut.edu.vn/~dantn/Matter/shear_tensile.htm) is correct.)\n\n**TL;DR:** Bones aren't just calcium and boy oh boy are they strong.\n\n[Bone specs] (http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/bones/bone_mechanical.php)\n\n[Specs for other materials] (http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/young-modulus-d_417.html)\n\nEdit: The percentages.

    "body": "Posting from mobile, sorry for any formatting issues. \n\nYears and years ago (around 2005), I worked as a supervisor for a popular discount retailer known for basics like graphic tees and walls of denim for men, women, and kids.  The culture was not great, but I was hungry to prove myself and also the least experienced manager on staff, so I spent a lot of time troubleshooting at the front end while the boss sat in the back room.\n\nOne day we had our best cashier on shift, E. This person is now a highly accomplished journalist with a pretty impressive career, and he has always been a bit of a serious-sounding guy. Deep voice, takes his job seriously. He was authorized to perform MOD functions on the register, including returns. So he usually doesn’t need assistance. But I can see there’s something unusual happening, so I come closer just to keep an eye on it. \n\nIt took me a moment to realize, the customer at E’s register was trying to return a pair of pants but she didn’t have a receipt. At this time, the process to complete a store credit for someone without a receipt was to give them a gift card with the lowest value of the item within the last 90 days. The customer was set to take a gift card of $5.98. The jeans were more than a couple of seasons old, at least, judging by the sku number. Naturally, she was unhappy and wanted MOAR MONEY. She insisted she had brought her receipt with her but it was nowhere. \n\nE, being the diligent guy who wants to make all his customers happy, starts looking around to see where it might be. Did it drop on the floor?  No, not there. How about the back pockets?  Nothing there. Then, he reaches into the front pocket of these clearly used and old jeans, and pulls out something. A receipt?  Nah. Maybe one of those silica packets you sometimes see?  Huh-uh. \n\nIt was a chicken wing, dried up and eaten down to the bone. An entire chicken wing bone. In the front pocket of the jeans she “didn’t wear.”\n\nE just looks at her, holds out his prize, and deadpans. “Ma’am, I believe this belongs to you.”  He did not need my help with this customer, she was speechless and compliant from that point on. \n\nI don’t remember if she took the $6 store credit or kept her clearly used item, but I never forgot about Chicken Bone Lady and her dirty denim.",

Half drank slushie. Went to return the suitcase and the return guy didnt believe me.

You’ve let me try a little bit of almost everything else you’ve brought in.” \n\nGerard’s voice was wheedling, hoping to cajole and beg the hulking alien sitting at the cramped mission room table into sharing some of the meal it had brought in a heavily-shielded and secured container. The alien, a member of a silica-based species called Chungeo, shook its ponderous head, pointing to the symbols and alien script depicting some form of warnings along the edge of the sealed box.\n\n“Not happening, little Gerard. This is intermixed with plutonium and cesium isotopes, to help give me energy. If you ate it, you’d irradiate your little fragile body and melt away or something, I think.” He sighed, a thunderous whooshing of wind from all three sets of enormous lungs. “We’ve already had this discussion before, and my answer is the same as before. This is not safe for you.”\n\nChungeo’s species had a stomach almost akin to a fission reactor, helping to melt down and separate compounds in rocks and minerals. They lacked any sort of grinding teeth, instead having a sort of baleen once used to strain the rich silt of their native waters. Now, their preferred method of consumption was baking, creating soft cakes and crumbly confections mixed with the powdered nutrients they needed. \n\nSeveral of these were palatable to humans, and helped create something that was akin to a sugar cookie, if with a bit of an acidic-metallic tang and some stubborn grittiness, and Chungeo had given Gerard the occasional one of these treats, much to the human’s delight. Gerard had tried to offer him some tastes of his fried-meat skewers or boiled grain seeds in return, but they were distinctly bland and slimy to Chungeo’s tastes, and so he often accepted them only to dispose of them discreetly without tasting the human foodstuff.\n\nThe small biped’s enthusiasm was infectious though, and Chungeo knew he had probably started bringing more human-safe meals along to work than he would have otherwise, if only to see the man’s enthusiasm and gusto as he chowed down on the latest baked treat. He’d even begun mixing in some human nutritional powder called “flour,” something he couldn’t taste but provided a helpful degree of glutinous cohesion to some of his more crumbly recipes. \n\nChungeo had always fancied himself a baker despite the strands of life leading him down a path of working at a mere hydrogen refinery, and while his family were all lightyears distant and seen only around his yearly leave period, Gerard presented a unique opportunity to test out new recipes and ideas when the ingredients permitted. There were a handful of other humans aboard, but most had only a passing interest in trying alien delicacies, while Gerard had what the humans called a “bottomless pit” for a digestive tract. The gravitational readings he had then surreptitiously taken of the human did not indicate any sort of localized singularities in his area, so the alien had taken it as simply an odd human turn-of-phrase instead.\n\nMonths passed, each week marked by a new creation, feedback from the voracious human when possible, and refinement of his recipe before storing it in his personal baking logbook. Chungeo had plans to one day publish a collection of those recipes, something Gerard said humans called a “cookbook,” but he wanted to ensure a sizable and respectable roster of culinary options before it was to be seen by anyone else. \n\nThen Gerard had disrupted his mental visions of accolades and invitations to baking competitions with a wood-pulp box he presented to the large alien. It was wrapped in a thin shell of iridescent-foiled pressed and dried wood-pulp, and topped with what looked like a flower or plant made of a thin strip of green textile looped back and fasted in upon itself dozens of times over.\n\n“What’s this?” he had asked, and the human had beamed. \n\n“Well, today is your birthd- I mean, your emergence-day, so I wanted to get you something to celebrate. It’s a gift!”\n\nChungeo’s pairs of eyes widened in surprise. The human had asked him about his emergence-day weeks and weeks ago, with what he had at the time taken to be only passing mild curiosity as the alien spoke of the first time he stepped forth from the birth-pool he and his clutch were laid in, nearly two hundred years earlier. He barely remembered the date himself, his species only marking it to use for intergalactic census questions for individuals’ ages, but the human had remembered, and then following human customs had given him a gift as well.\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Chungeo ripped open the container, massive and blocky fingers partially crushing the wood-pulp box despite his best efforts, until he held a white cylindrical piece of textile, with a pleated pattern along the long circular perimeter.\n\n“It’s a very nice…whatever it is, I suppose,” he said, feeling awkward and slightly guilty he didn’t know more about human culture to be able to recognize the object.\n\n“It’s a hat, to go on your head,” said Gerard proudly. “Specifically, it’s a chef’s hat. It’s worn by humans whose professions are in baking, cooking, and similar food artistry.” Turning it over in his hands, Chungeo could see that the ‘hat’ was also scaled to hit his enormous head, as it would be large enough to completely engulf Gerard if he tried to don it. “Go on, try it on. I hope I got the estimates of the size measurements right,” said the human.\n\nThe alien was unsure of what emotions were slowly but surely chugging through his veins as he gingerly placed the hat upon his head. His species wore almost no clothing like those of other races, typically restricting themselves to functional items like toolbelts and protective vests, and only the occasional brightly-colored wristbands or sashes to accentuate their appearance. Still, the surge of feelings through his mind finally coalesced into pride and appreciation as he caught sight of himself on a reflective metal panel nearby, and Gerard nodded approvingly.\n\n“You always were a great chef, but now you look the part as well.”\n\nChungeo was speechless for a long time, but the next day showed his appreciation with a large batch of human-safe confections made entirely from a recipe Gerard had given him from his own mother’s mother, something he said was called “Nana’s Scones.”\n\n---\n\nNearly half a century later, the day Chungeo had been dreading was rapidly approaching. Gerard’s vision had been failing despite laser and medicinal intervention, and the week prior it had resulted in him accidentally activating a release valve too early in the refinement process. A wash of aerosolized chemicals had washed over the unfortunate and unshielded human, and while he had recovered moderately well from the initial effects, it had irreversibly damaged his fragile and singular set of lungs.\n\nStill bedridden, he had nevertheless greeted Chungeo’s daily visits with enthusiasm, even as the alien could see less and less energy and alertness from the human with each passing day. His joking and feedback on the new recipes were sharp as ever, though, and again he told the alien he should stop stalling and publish his cookbook.\n\n“I’m not sure that it’s ready yet,” Chungeo had protested. “What if it’s been too long since I tried a recipe, and the ingredients are unobtainable now? Or perhaps my palate has matured, and the old recipe was worse? Or better?”\n\nGerard had coughed and chuckled at the alien’s hemming and hawing. “The best time to have done a task is yesterday, but the second-best time is today. Just make the leap, old friend, or else you’ll go to your grave full of regret.” He coughed, and his eyes slid away as Chungeo looked on.\n\n“And what of you, little Gerard? Do you have any regrets?” The words ‘before you pass on’ were left unspoken, but hung heavily between them. The onboard multispecies doctor had informed Chungeo that any further care was palliative, and Gerard’s prognosis outside of the next week was nil.\n\n“Well, there is one of your recipes I had always wanted to try…” he said at length. Chungeo hung on his every word, and as the human described it, he smiled, baleen showing like dark teeth as he emulated the human expression.\n\n“I think I have the ingredients for one last batch of that, although I’ll need to dust off the canister seals. I haven’t made it in some time, almost as long as I’ve known you, so I hope the recipe is still good.”\n\nGerard smiled back, laughing bright and clearly for the first time in days as he said “I’m sure it is, old friend. Your treats never disappoint.”\n\nHours later, Chungeo had snuck back into the medical ward, avoiding the scrutiny of doctors and nurses as he carried the sealed crate, dust-streaked alien radiation warnings still stuck to the outside.\n\nOnce in the human’s room, he unsealed the crate, passing one of the gently-glowing cookies over to the ailing human. Gerard eyed it admiringly, giving a low whistle that Chungeo had learned was a sign of appreciation, before biting into it with gusto.\n\nThen the human’s eyes lit up with surprise. “Wow, that tastes *just* like peppermint!”\n\n---\n\nIn a human graveyard, on one of the moons of Jupiter that Gerard had once said he’d have liked to visit, is a humble tombstone. On it lies a book, sun-bleached but otherwise preserved in the dry near-vacuum of what passed for the moon’s atmosphere. It’s a copy of *”Baking for Humans,”* marked with a *”Galactic Bestseller!”* sticker. Inside the cover is a handwritten dedication:\n\n*To Gerard,*  \n*My best customer and friend*  \n*You are missed*  \n*-C*  \n\n---\n\nEnjoy this tale?

AITAH?\n\nMy daughter has been living with me since July and her boyfriend comes over often. On Sunday night at 1am, she frantically woke me up and said her boyfriend accidentally ate a silica gel packet from a pack of seaweed. I told her to look up what to do or she can drive him to the ER (10 min away). Daughter kept pulling me to get up and drive and I asked why she couldn't drive him. She said she had smoked marijuana so I kicked her out of my room and told her to figure it out.\n\nI woke up 30 minutes later and she was shoving her fingers down his throat to induce vomiting and he did not look well. I suggested egg yolks to induce vomiting which incited a yelling match between my daughter and myself. AITAH?",

From the post, OP’s initial suggestion of look it up or drive him to the ER came before daughter told her she had smoked marijuana. OP’s response to that was to figure it out. That could mean… figure it out.  Call poison control, call 911, use the great and powerful google, or what daughter apparently chose — induce vomiting. That doesn’t mean OP wasn’t still including the asinine option of driving impaired, I’m just saying figure it out is a little broader.\n\nOP is an asshole for the utter lack of caring in this situation. As far as she knew, there was or might have been some danger because later she suggested egg yolks to induce vomiting.  I would be pissed as hell if my grown daughter woke me up because her dumbass boyfriend was too high to differentiate a silica pack from seaweed.  But I would get my grouchy ass up, make the calls or look up what to do, and then ripped into them both later for being idiots in the middle of the night. \n\nDaughter and boyfriend are kind of assholes, too, for being unable to maintain. 😂 At some point, you’re high enough and you’re just wasting weed.

cancelled by another action\n* Fixed sounds for the Oil Refinery, Assembler, Converter and Manufacturer sometimes stacking and playing multiple times\n* Added options menu sliders to adjust the volume

- Norsk - 82%\n   * Romanian - Română - 68%\n* Please note that for languages to be reimported into the game, they need to reach at least 50% completion, if you want to help out check out info on our Discord.\n\n \n\n**KNOWN ISSUES**\n\n\n\n**There are languages missing**\n\nThese are the only officially supported languages: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified & Traditional Chinese.\n\n\n\nA lot of translations for Satisfactory have been community driven, which means that every other language previously available (and potential new ones) needs to be translated by the community, before being added as community translations once more. \n\n\n\nA lot of people in the community have already shown interest in helping us out with translations and we are ever so grateful to you all and we'll update translations in game as they come in! If you want to help out check out info on our Discord. Please note that you need to have been part of the server for a time to be eligible for this. \n\n\n\n**I Can't Switch supported Languages (workaround available)**\n\nIf you still have any issue switching between officially supported languages, a quick fix for this is to exit the game, rename the %LOCALAPPDATA%\\\\FactoryGame\\\\Saved\\\\Config folder to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\\\FactoryGame\\\\Saved\\\\Old\\_Config, then launch the game.\n\n\n\n**Plugin Error on launch**\n\nThis is related to mods installed, Mods have been updated and now work with 1.0 so please make sure to update all your mods!. Keep in mind that not all mods have been updated yet.\n\n\n\n**\\[Crash\\] Shader Cache (workaround available)**\n\nUsers may experience the following Fatal Error when booting up the game: \\[File:C:\\\\BuildAgent\\\\work\\\\b731a33f2a691e17\\\\UE4\\\\Engine\\\\Source\\\\Runtime\\\\RHI\\\\Private\\\\PipelineStateCache.cpp\\] \\[Line: 365\\] Shader compilation failures are Fatal.\n\n\n\nThis can be fixed by forcing DirectX 11 (dx11) as the rendering API via the launch command: -dx11\n\n\n\nVideo of how to set dx11 as a launch option: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn3e-m4a-hU&t=438s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn3e-m4a-hU&t=438s)\n\n\n\nText information on how to set launch options: [https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Launch\\_arguments](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Launch_arguments) \n\n\n\n**White static effect over the game (AMD Radeon 5000 Series GPUs, possibly others)**\n\n\n\nThis issue seems to be due to driver issues. Some workarounds on current drivers are:\n\n\n\n* Try disabling upscaling\n* If you really want to use upscaling, try using something other than FSR\n* If you really want to use FSR, try changing the value of the FSR application by single digit increments towards either the lower or higher end of your current settings\n* Force DirectX 11 as the rendering API through the launch command: -dx11\n\n\n\n**Mouse sensitivity feeling sluggish with V-Sync turned on**\n\nWe’re currently investigating an issue where some players experience very sluggish mouse movement with V-Sync turned on. In the meantime, we recommend playing with V-Sync turned off if the mouse controls feel overly annoying.\n\n\n\n**Players starting at tier 2 on Dedicated Servers**\n\nPlayers are currently starting off at tier 2 upon entering the game on Dedicated Servers, skipping past tier 1. We’re currently looking into limiting the skipped parts of the game on Dedicated Servers to the intro sequence only (tier 0), and possibly even enabling players to experience tier 0 on Dedicated Servers as well.

I know Ive plugged my headphones in before. I was losing my mind! I actually googled the specs! Yep, 1-headphone jack. I took it to work and showed some coworkers. They also thought that was an led indicator, and that I was crazy! I showed them the same spec sheet. One of them looked closer and said \"that looks like a silica ball\". I put my hand in the laptop sleeve in my bag. There they were. About 20 little silica balls. The packet exploded and these little things were lining the bottom of the bag. We tried tweezers, pliers, paperclips. Nothing worked. The next day, one of co-ops showed up with a safety pin and I was able to stab the ball and break it in pieces. I hit the port with some compressed air and all the bits came out. Anytime I plug my headphones there's still a bit of a crunchy sound, but the port still worked. This is a PSA.

        "body": "Oh, man, actually I do know this.\n\nI have actually had to get one out years ago when I worked at a small repair shop-- and I used a toothpick and some (very small amount of) super glue!\n\nWe braced the machine upside down (well, headphone-jack down) and I applied a tiny bit of gel-type super glue to the toothpick. I carefully inserted the toothpick into the port, and then waited \\~30 seconds for the toothpick to stick to the silica gel.\n\nI then removed the thing as one piece, carefully and slowly, without bending it-- just pulled straight out.\n\nThis was the *second time* I had used this trick to remove an obstruction in the headphone jack of a machine, so there were actually just toothpicks and gel superglue in the office already for this.\n\nThe person who was waiting for their computer just kind of stared for a moment. Then they insisted on buying us lunch, because this was going to apparently be a 3-6 week turn around time from GeekSquad, and we had it fixed in less than 15 minutes.\n\nI can count on my fingers the number of times we had satisfied customers when I worked there-- this was one of them-- person was happy to pay for the repair, and then gave us *more money* because they were so satisfied. XD \n\n  \nEDIT: If you want to do this, note that toothpics are tapered on the end-- use a sharp razor or such to appropriately trim the point back to provide slightly more surface area on the tip to allow the glue to better adhere. :)",

    "body": "[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nfsakq/out_of_cruel_space_part_1/)\n\nA Scion of Many Worlds\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Aye, Eee, Eye, Eff, Bee, Cee, Tee, Dee...” Jasper could only smile as Isabella slowly went through most of the eye test with her face relaxed and not bunched up in a giant squint. Better could be done, but laser precision would be needed. This? This was good. This was very good.\n\nThe fact he had to use Boron, Lead, Silica and skip the Sodium to make the glass heat resistant on a scale it could be used in kitchen wear but not so easily melted. Lime, Magnesium and Aluminum to really reinforce it against heat.\n\nSand, shale, lead ore, limestone, dolomite and bauxite. A big pile of ingredients to get all the chemicals and minerals involved. But worth it. The Axiom allowed him to mould it together into a singular perfectly clear circle of glass, it allowed him to reshape it to modify how it refracted the light.\n\nSure there was Axiom bullshit going on, but all it did was skip the heating and setting process, all it did was shape things. The goal was to create a more mundane miracle. Something repeatable and teachable.\n\n“Alright, I just need a moment to...” Jasper trails off as Isabella had grabbed the lens and was refusing to let it be taken away. She turns to him and looks at him through it.\n\n“Don’t take this from me.” She begs quietly.\n\n“I’m making more of it, so you have many instead of one.” He assures her and her grip slowly relaxes. “You’ll be alright. The world has been hidden from you and your family for far too long as is. I won’t have it stay hidden much longer.”\n\n“You... your eyes are many smaller eyes working together.” She says in an awed tone.\n\n“Compound eyes, many insects have them. Urthani are just really big bugs.” He says as he places a hand over a small box full of his ingredients. The lens in his claws is perfect and the stones rise up and begin to meld together, smoothing over and turning transparent. It’s mostly the silica in the sand as two lenses pour out. The iron next to the box shifts and melds against the two circular lenses and join with a little bridge bump. He hands her back the lens and has tiny sheaths of leather along the ear portions and little pads to the sides of the nose for comfort.\n\n“I do not recommend setting them on fire, but most of these are heat resistant.” He says gently putting the glasses on her.\n\nShe blinks once, twice, and puts down the lens as she starts to look around in wonder. She looks up at him again and slowly lifts her hand to his head.\n\nHe kneels down to accommodate whatever she’s going to do and a shiver runs down his spine as she gently pinches his antenna and runs her hand up it to watch the hairs shift back up.\n\n“Try looking out the window to the left.” He suggests and she turns to behold the splash of colours beyond. She stands up and walks towards it to look into one of the central gardens. He slowly stands with as little noise as possible as she starts to sob. He walks up to stand behind her and places a gentle claw on her shoulder. She turns around to hug him as the weeping grows stronger. She starts to babble.\n\n“...and there’s just so much in so many different colours and hues...”\n\n“Isabella.” He tries.\n\n“So much was just not there!”\n\n“Isabella.” He says a little louder.\n\n“You’re not taking them away are you!?”\n\n“I’d like to teach you how to make more yourself.” He says gently and she stares up at him, her eyes huge behind her glasses. “Would you like to learn?”\n\nThe scream of ‘Yes!’ was unnecessary and over the top, but he can forgive the enthusiasm and eagerness.\n\nWith the three country wide crises’ solved Jasper has a couple of days to sort things out and relax. And sitting down to walk someone through some textbooks and show off some Axiom tricks that he had to master and re-master a few times is downright restful. Keeps him busy without much to worry about.\n\nThe flying hospital was doing well, with the rich and powerful forcing their way to the front they were inadvertently getting themselves tested and assuring the lower classes and less fortunate that the hospital was something they could trust. So when it moved to the poorer areas to help out there, there was far less hesitation than would be expected, a blessing.\n\nMost of what was going on was a purging process to clear out infections and the cleaning of old wounds so they could heal properly. But there were still the occasional soul rushed in at a dead sprint due to a recent injury.\n\nThe teaching goes well; he explains not only what the glass is made of but what each piece does. How the trace amounts of other things in the melted sand makes the resulting glass stronger and clearer. How shaping it bends the light to accommodate her eyes. How it’s normally done without Axiom and how to do it with it. She pays near manic attention to things and he has to remind her to calm down at many points.\n\nThe books and supplies are hers to do with as she wishes, she tucks the books away like holy artefacts and quickly starts to work at copying her own lenses. His budding optometrist eager to help her family and then make good money selling glasses to those who need it. Also apparently crystal clear glass is very rare so the closest she’s seen to glasses like the one’s she now has are polished crystals or gems. A clever, but expensive and labour intensive solution. The Goldlands will have another export. Or they would if The Undaunted weren’t coming.\n\nStill, she has had an emotional day and confides in him that she honestly hadn’t expected him to follow through on his promise. That it was just empty platitudes from someone speaking grandly and not bothering to keep track of their vows. Apparently it was a fairly common problem with her family, they could barely see and as such, people thought they could get away with far more than they should have even considered.\n\nHis open distaste for how badly she’s been treated brought about a fresh bought of tears and she finally wore herself out. He tucks her into bed and ensures that the glasses are on the table beside her for when she wakes up.\n\n“Is it all like that?” Zaviah asks him as he leaves Isabella’s guest room. Interestingly she’s more subtle to his senses when she’s not actively invisible. Something she had clearly noticed as she popped into his testing and making the glasses more than once. She was still testing him, but the hostility had faded away for the most part.\n\n“Not always. Not everyone has a hard life where they feel like they’ve been ground into the dirt. Some people thrive under the pressure and do well for themselves. But life has a tendency to grind people down.”\n\n“You seem alright?”\n\n“Some people prefer to take it as a challenge than a burden. Which means that the endless grind is less an inevitable fate than a obstacle to overcome.”\n\n“So the world is what you make of it?”\n\n“Exactly. The worst day of your life can break you, or make you into something better. A failure can crush you, or can excite you as another way to achieve your goals.”\n\n“Is that what your Undaunted are about?”\n\n“Mostly, the core of The Undaunted is about looking at an impossible problem, at a challenge that all sense and reason says cannot be done and facing it regardless.”\n\n“How so?”\n\n“The Undaunted are small. Very very small. Yet refuses to back down.”\n\n“Really?”\n\n“Most armies on this world could easily outnumber The Undaunted. But you’ve seen what I, a single Undaunted, am capable of.”\n\n“A challenge...” She mutters to herself as she considers. She straightens up a little and her expression shifts. She just came to a fairly powerful conclusion. “So is this whole world, is all of Lakran just a test for you?”\n\n“Somewhat, I have explained my entire origin to you haven’t I?” He asks her and she sighs.\n\n“It’s nonsense though, there’s so much that doesn’t make sense!”\n\n“I’m aware.”\n\n“What kind of grieving mother puts the mind of a total stranger into a copy of her dead child and launches them onto another world!? It’s madness!”\n\n“As far as I can tell, it is.”\n\n“Stop being so blasé about this! It’s weird!”\n\n“I’ve long moved past the sheer need to figure it out and am just taking it as it comes now. I have more to worry about than the pointless what was’s of the past.”\n\n“Nonsense! You’ve been looking into the sources of Lakran up and down! Writing it all down and conferring with everyone you think might be able to help figure it out! Lost colonies, pirates and monsters and mistaken identities. It goes every which way!”\n\n“That it does. It’s more of a curiosity, I want to solve Lakran’s problems and learning where they were all born from might help with that. But it’s of less importance than outright going out to solve problems.”\n\n“Like breaking the drought by opening the dams and negotiating all the food deliveries in Greenstone and Miru. The payments of metals to The Goldlands and giving The Mountain Clans direction so they’re not causing problems. Things are stable.”\n\n“For now.” Jasper says cracking his neck. “There’s only a short while until something happens. So I’m relaxing while I can.”\n\n“Relaxing? You just taught someone how to craft delicate glass lenses to a master’s degree after crafting them yourself to effectively cure a woman of blindness!”\n\n“All I did was follow written instructions and then show someone the same. A very easy and rewarding task. Still, you are right, for now things are stable and comparatively relaxing. A bit of exercise and good eating and rest and these will be a good few...” He pauses and looks around to see if Murphy’s taking the bait.\n\n“Why are you doing that?”\n\n“Murphy’s law, anything that can go wrong will go wrong and at the worst possible moment. It can also be very dramatic. Just waiting for you to open your mouth and screw things up.” Zaviah outright scoffs at the idea.\n\n“Where did the big scary moth monster go? Why are you quivering at a harmless little...” She begins before one the Star Seeker Nagasha comes tearing around the corner at fast but silent slither her face is a textbook definition of terrified.\n\n“Right, I was listening for footsteps. My mistake.” Jasper realizes with a snap of his claws. He then shakes out his hand as snapping claws really, really hurts. They’re a lot harder and sharper than fingers.\n\n“You really think that...”\n\n“Lord Blue! Lord Blue! There’s danger!”\n\n“Told you.” Jasper notes patting Zaviah on the shoulder before facing the Nagasha. “Where am I needed?”\n\n“The Grand Midwives have come to us for support! They need you.”\n\n“Odd that it wasn’t Lady Ailure who came to find me.”\n\n“She’s looking for you in the sky. The Brightdawn Archipelago is consuming itself in civil war! There’s rumours of beams of burning light and the midwives there have all been taken hostage. Likely under interrogation.”\n\n“Shit, those idiots are just off the coast of the mainland. If we let this spread than all the work I’ve done in Miru, Greenstone and The Goldlands will be for nothing.”  Jasper curses before thinking. “The carving of the portal pillars, what’s the progress?”\n\n“We’ve finished the first half of two sets and nearly finished the second. It will take another day though.”\n\n“Shit, alright. So those green gems I got off the bodies of The Lux Infiltrators are they fully understood?”\n\n“Yes, we can communicate with them over a great distance. Our study of radios made it very easy to understand and even improve upon.”\n\n“Okay, I’m going to take one of them with me and use it to stay in contact with you girls. I’m heading out with Lady Ailure and her retinue to rush to the islands and either reinforce whatever efforts the Midwives already have up and running or effect a rescue. If anyone wants to know where I am use the green stones to speak with me.” Jasper explains before turning to Zaviah. “Sorry little lady, Daddy has to go to work.”\n\n“What did you call yourself?” She demands.\n\n“Daddy, one of the many titles for the male parental figure. Excuse me.” He says giving her a slight hug and a kiss on the brow before rushing off, leaving a rather surprised Zaviah behind him.\n\n“Daddy?” She asks somewhat confused but not protesting it.\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nfsakq/out_of_cruel_space_part_1/) [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/tvig52/out_of_cruel_space_part_296/) [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/tx3sgz/out_of_cruel_space_part_298/) ",

    "body": "This post is an attempt at a *starting point* for people who are interested in DIY mattresses, but have no idea where to begin. I’ve been thinking about writing a post like this for awhile now but have found it tricky because the topic is wide and varied. I’m going to try and cover as much ground here as possible so that people can use this as a jumping off place for their own research.\n\n**You can *make your own mattress*? Like you stuff it yourself? With what? How?**\n\nThis is probably the primary reaction I get if I ever mention to folks not on reddit that I DIYed my mattress. The idea seems so novel and unusual that most people can’t even fathom the concept. I think this is largely because most people have *no idea* what their mattress is made out of or how it’s supposed to work. If they did know, they would realize that it’s not nearly as crazy it seems to DIY it. And they would know that there is no “stuffing” involved at all. \n\nSo I think this really has to be the starting place for any conversation about DIY mattresses -- understanding what a mattress is and what it’s purpose is. At its most basic, a mattress is a surface to sleep on. It has two jobs:\n\n1. Provide comfort and pressure relief. You want to feel good about laying down in bed - you don’t want to feel lots of pressure on your body. When I was a kid I used to be able to sleep on the floor or on camping mats without a problem -- but as an adult whenever I’ve attempted such things I wake up tremendously sore all over my body because of the intense hardness of these surfaces. I, like most people, need something softer than the ground to feel comfortable and wake up feeling refreshed.\n\n2. Provide support and spinal alignment. A mattress that’s too soft or too firm for your body size (height/weight) and sleeping position (back/stomach/side) could still be a comfortable mattress -- but if it doesn’t keep your spine aligned in the proper position, you could find yourself in a world of back pain. You can see what proper spinal alignment looks like for each sleeping position in [this diagram](https://www.snoozzzmattress.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Sleep-Alignment.jpg).\n\nEverything else that a mattress does is arguably a secondary role. Given that a mattress really only has two primary jobs, it’s unsurprising then that a mattress also only has two primary components:\n\n1. A soft **comfort layer** at the top of the mattress whose job it is to provide comfort and pressure relief. For DIYers the most common comfort layers are memory foam and latex. That being said, you can use pretty much any soft foam or anything else that is sold as a “mattress topper” for a comfort layer. Typically a comfort layer will be between 2” - 4” thick.\n\n2. A firm **support layer** at the bottom of the mattress whose job it is to provide support.  For DIYers the most common support layers are latex, polyurethane foam and pocket coil springs. Typically a support layer will be between 4” - 8” thick.\n\nThat being said, that doesn’t mean all mattresses are only two layers. A comfort layer could include two different components - like a layer of soft latex and memory foam for example. Similarly, a support layer might also contain multiple components - like latex of two different firmness levels. A mattress might also contain a transition layer that provides a bridge between the soft and firm. How you decide to construct your mattress is up to you - but at the most basic you need something that’s going to be firm enough to support your weight and soft enough to provide pressure relief in your sleeping position. \n\nFor more detail on the different layers of mattresses - read [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/Mattress/comments/otdqms/diy_mattresses_an_introductory_guide/h7kqp8e/) from u/Duende555 about transition layers, insulation layers and more.\n\n**You should have a good cover that fits well**\n\nI think one of the biggest hesitations about DIY is that it will “look funny.”  Or that it will feel lumpy and that the layers will shift around underneath you. All of these problems can be easily solved with one thing: a well made cover that is designed to *exactly* fit the size of your mattress (length, width *and height*). A tight fitting cover will hold the material together, prevent it from moving around, and make your final product look exactly like any other mattress. \n\nIf you’re really on a tight budget, you can buy a cheap zippered mattress protector (typically designed to keep bedbugs out of your mattress), but this will likely not work as well as a high quality cover.\n\nPay close attention to whether or not the cover is quilted or un-quilted as this will have a *significant* impact on the feel of the mattress. The trend in the mattress industry has been towards stretch-knit unquilted covers to allow for greater conformity with the foam layers below. This is particularly important for side sleepers who need their shoulders and hips to sink in to the mattress. A quilted cover will be much less stretchy and will thus add quite a bit of firmness to the mattress. *Note: un-quilted covers are best for all foam or all latex mattresses. Because they are thinner and stretchier they won't do as well at holding an unglued hybrid mattress together. If you plan to use coils I would suggest opting for a thicker quilted cover.*  \n\nLastly - because you want your cover to be the *exact* size for your mattress, it can be a good idea to hold off on buying it until you know what you want your final build to be. Buying it before you know that will limit your ability to tinker with the mattress as you will either have to buy a whole new cover or restrict your tinkering to the exact height as the cover you ordered. \n\nSources for good quality zippered mattress covers include: \n\n* Unquilted covers: [Sleep Like a Bear](https://sleeplikeabear.com/collections/topper-mattress-cover-encasements) sells two unquilted covers, [Sleep on Latex](https://sleeponlatex.com/products/organic-cotton-cover-1) sells an unquilted cover (branded as a “topper cover”), [DIY natural bedding](https://diynaturalbedding.com/product-category/ticking/) sells four unquilted covers. \n\n* Quilted covers: [Arizona Premium Mattress](https://www.mattresses.net/remaco1.html) sells two quilted covers, [Latex Mattress Factory](https://latexmattressfactory.com/products/natural-cotton-and-wool-cover) sells a quilted cover, [DIY natural bedding](https://diynaturalbedding.com/product/quilted-ticking/) sells a quilted cover, [Sleep Like a Bear](https://sleeplikeabear.com/collections/topper-mattress-cover-encasements/products/natural-wool-quilted-knit-bamboo-fabric-zipper-cover) sells a quilted option as well. [Brentwood Home](https://www.brentwoodhome.com/products/bamboo-replacement-mattress-covers?variant=12142706246) sells a very affordable cover with a small amount of quilted wool. [Comfort Option](https://www.comfortoption.com/toppers/mattress-cover-side-zipper) sells a 10\" cover only that looks like it might be stretchier than a regular quilted cover.\n\n**Sourcing comfort layers** \n\nJust about anything sold as a “mattress topper” can be used as a comfort layer -- and those are plentiful out there. If you need something fast and cheap, your best bet might be a memory foam topper off Amazon or purchased in person at a place like Walmart, Target or Costco. If product specs are available, a comfort layer will typically have an ILD below 20, although larger people and stomach sleepers may prefer something firmer. Commonly suggested nicer comfort layers include but are not limited to:\n\n* Soft talalay latex: [Flexus Comfort](https://www.flexuscomfort.com/latex-mattress-toppers.html), [Arizona Premium Mattress](https://www.mattresses.net/talalay---dunlop-latex-toppers.html)/[DIYmattress.net](https://diymattress.net/collections/all), [SleepEZ](https://sleepez.com/products/natural-latex-topper/)/[Latex Mattress Factory](https://latexmattressfactory.com/pages/latex-mattress-toppers), [Luma Sleep](https://lumasleep.com/products/talalay-latex-comfort-layer), [Latex for Less](https://www.latexforless.com/products/latex-topper), [Brooklyn Bedding](https://mattresstopper.com/collections/all).\n\n* Soft dunlop latex - [Naturally Nestled](https://naturallynestled.com/), [Sleep on Latex](https://sleeponlatex.com/products/natural-latex-mattress-topper), [Flexus Comfort](https://www.flexuscomfort.com/latex-mattress-toppers.html), [Arizona Premium Mattress](https://www.mattresses.net/talalay---dunlop-latex-toppers.html)/[DIYmattress.net](https://diymattress.net/collections/all), [SleepEZ](https://sleepez.com/products/natural-latex-topper/)/[Latex Mattress Factory](https://latexmattressfactory.com/pages/latex-mattress-toppers)\n\n* Memory foam - note that memory foam should *never* be used as a support layer and should only be used as a comfort layer: [Brooklyn Bedding](https://mattresstopper.com/collections/all), [Foam by Mail](https://www.foambymail.com/memory-foam-toppers.html), [Bestway Foam](https://bestwayfoam.com/bedding-1), [PlushBeds](https://www.plushbeds.com/collections/memory-foam-toppers), [Comfort Option](https://www.comfortoption.com/toppers/) -- there are many options for memory foam that can be found online and many mattress companies sell memory foam toppers.\n\n* High performance polyfoams - [Bestway Foam](https://bestwayfoam.com/bedding-1), [Nest Bedding](https://www.nestbedding.com/products/the-alexander-signiture-select-topper), [Tuft + Needle](https://www.tuftandneedle.com/mattresstopper/), [Comfort Option](https://www.comfortoption.com/toppers/).

While lots of consumers need mattress toppers, it’s only a small niche group of us looking to buy coils! \n\nMost people using a foam-based support layer, be it latex or polyfoam, should probably have an ILD over 30. Larger people might need an ILD over 40, and small people may need an ILD in the high 20s. Latex support layers likely offer the greatest amount of flexibility/modularity in that there is a greater variety of firmness options to chose from and that makes it easier to swap layers in and out.\n\n* Polyurethane foam - Foam By Mail / The Foam Factory sells three 35ILD polyfoams:  a high quality [2.8lb foam](https://www.foambymail.com/HDHQ_2/hd36-hq-foam-mattress.html), a good quality [1.8lb foam](https://www.foambymail.com/HDR_2/hd36-r-foam-mattress.html), and a medium quality [1.5lb foam](https://www.foambymail.com/P_2/poly-foam-mattress.html) - the last one being ideal for a temporary mattress. \n\n* Pocket coil springs - There are currently four coil units available to DIY consumers in the United States. All four are made by Leggett and Platt and use firmer coils along the perimeter for edge support: \n\n> Firmest: [6” Quantum Edge Elite](https://www.mattresses.net/quedelbo.html)\n\n> Softest: [8” Quantum Edge Elite](https://latexmattressfactory.com/products/quantum-edge-elite-pocketed-coil-1)\n\n> Most cheap: [6” Caliber Edge](https://diymattress.net/products/caliber-edge-6-pocket-coil-by-leggett-and-platt)\n\n> Zoned: [8” Quantum Edge Elite Combizone Coils](https://www.mattresses.net/copocobylean.html), these coils are “zoned” meaning the middle section of the mattress will be firmer than the areas by the head and feet\n\n* Firm latex (look for ILDs above 30 for support layers!) - [Sleep on Latex](https://sleeponlatex.com/products/natural-latex-mattress-topper), [Flexus Comfort](https://www.flexuscomfort.com/latex-mattress-toppers.html), [Arizona Premium Mattress](https://www.mattresses.net/100--natural-and-blended-latex-cores.html)/[DIYmattress.net](https://diymattress.net/collections/all), [SleepEZ](https://sleepez.com/products/natural-latex-topper/)/[Latex Mattress Factory](https://latexmattressfactory.com/pages/latex-mattress-toppers), [Naturally Nestled](https://naturallynestled.com/). \n\n* Mattress surgery - in addition to sourcing support layers from the places above, it’s also theoretically possible to repurpose the support layer of an old and sagging mattress. Mattresses tend to break down from top to bottom, meaning that many sagging mattresses still have perfectly suitable coils underneath the sagging foams. The most cost effective way to replace your sagging mattress may actually be to repair it by cutting it open, tossing out the broken down foams, and replacing them with new comfort layers. Check out this [helpful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppn-U-pI2mw&t=181s) showing you how from Ken at Arizona Premium Mattress. **WARNING -- do not attempt mattress surgery on a cheap mattress due to the potential dangers of releasing fiberglass!!!**\n\n**Pitfalls to avoid**\n\n* Don’t use memory foam in your support layer. People commonly think a “memory foam mattress” is a mattress that uses memory foam from top to bottom. This is not true, memory foam provides little to no support and thus it’s only useful as a comfort layer. A classic memory foam mattress typically uses a firm polyurethane foam as the support layer. \n\n* Don’t make your comfort layer too thick. Most side sleepers probably only need 3” or 4” of soft foam at the top of the mattress -- any more than that and you risk creating a mattress that is much too soft. Back sleepers and stomach sleepers need even less. \n\n* Don’t confuse the comfort and support layers. Ok, I get it - you want a firm mattress! That doesn’t mean you should pick out both the firmest support and comfort layers out there. If you’ve already got a super firm support layer, you probably want a softer comfort layer for some pressure relief. \n\n* If you’re using a pocket coil support layer, pay attention to the layer directly above the coils as this will have a large impact on the overall firmness of the mattress. u/Duende555 advises that a “medium” mattress will use a foam with an ILD around 20-24. \n\n**FAQs**\n\n* DIY mattress? That sounds really difficult! I’m not very handy!\n\nA DIY mattress requires almost no real skill to assemble. If you’ve ever assembled IKEA furniture you’ve already done something *far more complex* than assembling a DIY mattress. It can require a little bit of physical work and lifting because the layers (especially latex and coils) can be quite heavy, but that’s the only hard part. It requires no sewing, no drilling, no hammering, no mixing, no stuffing, no cutting, and no welding. It does however require some research and some planning. \n\n* Wait, is this really as simple as stacking some layers together and zipping them up?\n\nI mean, yeah - kind of! You can certainly make it more complicated. You can glue the layers together if you want. You can even tuft them together if you’ve got the sewing skills. But you don’t have to do that -- a DIY mattress encased in a good quality zippered case should perform just as well as a pre-built.\n\n* Will DIY save me money?\n\nIt might! But it also might not. It all depends on what your budget is and how much tinkering you have to do with your DIY mattress. If you get your build right on your first go, you will probably save a substantial amount of money compared to a similar quality pre-built. If your build requires a lot of swapping layers in and out, then the costs could start to add up.\n\n* Ok, this seems awesome - how do I convince my spouse to get on board?\n\nYikes, good luck with that. Maybe show them this post on [buyer’s remorse](https://old.reddit.com/r/Mattress/comments/oq4rl3/avoiding_buyers_remorse_3_strategies_aka_why_try/) or this post on [planned obsolescence.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Mattress/comments/nzts7b/planned_obsolescence_its_a_real_thing/) Either way, that’s probably a better question for r/relationship_advice. \n\n* Do I need to put anything below the coils?\n\nThere appears to be some debate about the answer to it! u/Duende555 suggests using at least 1” of firm foam below the coils for stabilization. Ken from APM says this is unnecessary. Either way, it doesn’t seem like it would hurt to include it!\n\n* You mentioned a “transition layer” earlier - what exactly is that? Do I need one?\n\nIt’s exactly what it sounds like -- it’s the kind of layer that you might put between your comfort and support layer. It’s probably a layer that on it’s own would likely be too soft to function properly as a support layer and too firm to function as a comfort layer. This will vary pretty widely person to person and depend a lot on sleeping position and weight. For many people a latex or other foam layer with an ILD around 22-30 would probably work. \n\nWhether or not you need a transition layer is generally a personal decision. Many mattresses (both pre-built and DIY) just use a basic “two layer” approach and that works totally fine for a lot of people. If you go with a two layer mattress, but you find it a little bit too firm, it could help to add a transition layer in the middle. That being said, if you’re building a memory foam hybrid, you certainly will need a transition layer of some sort between the memory foam and the coils.\n\n* I’m confused about some of the different materials you’ve mentioned here. What’s the difference between dunlop latex and talalay latex? What’s the deal with ILD? What’s the difference between a 2.5lb memory foam and a 5.0 memory foam? Or a 1.5lb polyfoam and a 3.0lb memory foam?\n\nThat’s a very long and complicated question. The short answer is that this is probably a good place to start doing your research. This is the sort of information that would be good for you to know if you’re doing a DIY mattress or even if you just want to be an informed consumer of pre-built mattresses. I suggest checking out the [FAQ to this subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Mattress/comments/bkb079/an_attempt_at_a_mattress_faq/) or [The Mattress Underground](https://www.themattressunderground.com/) to get the answers to those questions.\n\nHere is a slightly slightly longer answer with the *very basic* information you might need. ILD is a measurement of firmness -- the higher the ILD the firmer the material is. So an ILD above 30 usually means “firm” while an ILD below 20 usually mean “soft.” Firmness is different than density which is generally indicated (in the United States) by the weighted measurement of a 12” x 12” x 12” (cubic foot) block of foam. For some materials like latex, the denser the foam is, the firmer it will be. For other materials, like polyurethane foam, there is a much less clear relationship (i.e. you can have a soft dense foam and a firm lightweight foam). For pretty much all foams, the denser the foam is - the longer it will last. \n\nThat last paragraph is a pretty wild oversimplification of a complicated set of topics. So go and study.\n\n* How do I duplicate a Purple/Tempurpedic/[insert expensive mattress here]?\n\nYou can’t. Or not exactly at least. You can certainly attempt to get close by paying attention to all the layers and components inside the mattress. If the layers they use happen to be easily available to consumers, then you may be able to get close to duplicating the feel. But if the layers they use are not easily available or readily accessible -- well, then you probably can’t. Either way, a “dupe” mattress won’t feel exactly like the mattress you loved in the store but found too expensive. It’s probably better to start from a place of trying to identify what sorts of comfort and support layers are going to meet your needs rather than trying to duplicate the feel of a mattress you liked. \n\n* What about split-firmness? How does that work?\n\nVery often two people share a mattress full time. Occasionally they might happen to have the exact same needs in a mattress, but more often than not these two people likely have different sized bodies and different sleeping positions and thus have different needs in a mattress. If you’re DIYing your mattress, you can set it up so that each side of the same mattress will have different firmness levels. It’s pretty easy to do this, you just make sure the split layers are half the size of the total bed and encase them in the same mattress cover. You can do a firmness split in the support layer, the comfort layer, or both!\n\n* What about zoning? How does that work?\n\nThe basic idea of zoning is that the mattress will have different firmness levels of the mattress from head to foot. Most typically this means the mid-section under the hips will be made firmer than the rest of the mattress. If that interests you, you can buy zoned pocket coils. Or you can use foams of different firmness levels spliced together in a mattress layer. Many of the “standard” zoning systems are designed for “average height” people -- so if you’re very short or very tall, you probably don’t want to buy anything pre-zoned. Instead you could do the zones yourself by measuring yourself carefully against the mattress and ordering the appropriate foams. Note: not every pre-built mattress is zoned and your DIY doesn’t need to be either! This is just one option available to you.\n\n* What's the deal with fire retardants, do I need to do that?\n\nAs you may or may not know, US law requires that all mattresses sold in the United States must pass a fire retardation test. It's debatable whether this is actually a useful requirement or not. Most mainstream mattress manufacturers use a \"fire retardant sock\" that's made out of rayon and some other stuff and contains amorphous silica. Some very cheap mattresses (like the kind you might buy off Amazon: Zinus, Lucid, Linenspa, etc.) use fiberglass. \"Organic\" and \"green\" mattresses tend to use compressed wool. Because you not DIYing a mattress for retail purposes, you are free to not use a fire retardant layer. That being said - if you smoke in bed or have your bed near an open flame, it's probably a good idea.\n\n* Can I use an open coil or bonnell coil for my DIY mattress?\n\nNo. I don’t know of anyone who sells these units direct to consumers, and even if those were available, they would be more complicated to DIY than a pocket coil unit. If you really want this though, you could buy a good quality bonnell coil mattress and place a topper of your choice on it.\n\n**Some basic DIY mattress templates**\n\nConsider these four templates as a place to get started. All of these are highly modifiable to your personal preferences and budgets.\n\n***DIY memory foam mattress***\n\nPrice range for a queen: $300 - $750\n\n* Support layer: 6” of firm polyurethane foam\n\n* Comfort layer: 3” of memory foam\n\n* A cover of your choice\n\nThe most basic modification on this would be to add a transition layer between the support and comfort layer. Consider 2” or 3” of a 28ILD latex. If you add this transition layer you could also drop the memory foam to just 2”. See [the comment below](https://old.reddit.com/r/Mattress/comments/otdqms/diy_mattresses_an_introductory_guide/h7kqp8e/) by u/Duende555 about some of the pitfalls of a basic 6\" + 3\" construction like this.\n\n***DIY latex mattress***\n\nPrice range for a queen: $800 - $1,200\n\n* Support layer: 3” of firm latex\n\n* Transition layer: 3” of medium latex\n\n* Comfort layer: 3” of soft latex\n\n* A cover of your choice\n\nYou can use dunlop or talalay or both for this mattress. You can make this mattress softer or firmer by making softer or firmer *any* of the three layers. If you want an even softer comfort layer you could do 2” of soft latex and 2” of super soft (14-15 ILD) latex. Or 2” of soft latex and 2” memory foam.\n\n***DIY memory foam hybrid***\n\nPrice range for a queen: $600 - $1,200\n\n* Support layer: Pocket coils\n\n* Transition layer: 1” or 2” of latex\n\n* Comfort layer: 2” or 3” of memory foam\n\n* A cover of your choice\n\nThe main place for modification here is in the number of total inches and firmness of the latex and memory foam. You also have different options for the coil unit you want to use.\n\n***DIY latex hybrid***\n\nPrice range for a queen: $500 - $1,200\n\n* Supper layer: Pocket coils \n\n* Comfort layer: 3” of latex\n\n* A cover of your choice\n\nThe main place for a modification here would be with the addition of a transition layer. Instead of doing 3” of latex over coils, you could instead do 2” of soft latex over 2” of medium latex over coils.\n\n**So should I DIY my mattress?**\n\nMaybe. If you’ve read this far hopefully you are familiar with the pros and cons of the approach. If you’re willing to do the research needed and take on the financial risks -- then it might absolutely be the best approach for you. That being said, it’s entirely possible that DIY will require too much time and energy and it may just be easier to get a pre-built. That’s ok too!\n\n**Update: What should I do if I made a mistake?**\n\nAfter discussing potential mattress builds with lots of people, I have noticed a pretty clear pattern emerging that I think might be helpful to name explicitly: most people seem to have an instinct towards making a mattress that is simply *waaaay too firm* for their height, weight and sleeping position. \n\nSome of this is the result of it being hard to gauge how soft or firm a material is just from a description. Some of this is the result of age old mattress mythology that insists that a firm mattress is inherently better for you (it isn’t!). \n\nSo with that in mind I wanted to offer a couple points of clarification:\n\n* All four of the coil units available to DIYers are *firm.* The 8” QE coils are the softest of the four, but they are still very firm. Most side sleepers with a BMI < 30* (5’2/165lbs, 5’8/200lbs, 6’0/225lbs or so) would probably do better with a latex or polyurethane support layer than with a coil support layer. \n\n* If you are using one of the coil units and have a BMI < 30 you probably should only be using soft or very soft foams on top of the coils. If you use a “medium” foam, the resulting mattress will likely be *firm* or *very firm.* If you use soft foams, the resulting mattress will probably be more like a *medium* or a *medium-firm.* \n\n*BMI is a totally worthless number for medical purposes -- but it is somewhat useful here for talking about weight distribution.\n\n**Help! I made my mattress too firm! What do I do?**\n\nTo make a mattress softer you typically have three options:\n\n1. Use a softer support layer. If you’ve got a support layer that’s 3” of 46 ILD latex + 3” of 38ILD latex, you can take out the 3” of 46ILD latex, put the 38ILD layer on the bottom and then add a 34ILD layer in its place. Boom! Your mattress is now softer! Note that this method is probably *off-limits* to you if you’ve opted to use coils as your support layer, unless you have a mostly unlimited budget.\n\n2. Add a transition layer -- or use a softer one. Maybe your mattress is 3” of memory foam on top of 6” of polyfoam and it’s just too firm. Add 2” of a 28ILD latex between the polyfoam and memory foam for a softer feel. \n\n3. Thicken your comfort layer by adding more foam. This is basically the equivalent of putting a topper on your too firm pre-built. This one should probably be done last because you want to be careful not to make your comfort layer *too* thick. \n\n**Help! My mattress is too soft! What do I do?**\n\nUnsurprisingly the way to soften your mattress is more or less the opposite of the suggestions above. The good news is that because it’s a DIY mattress you can actually fix this problem -- whereas with a pre-built you really can’t. \n\n1. Use a firmer support layer. Again, likely off limits to you if you have opted for coils for your support layer. \n\n2. Remove a layer. Generally speaking more foam = softer. So you won’t “firm up” a mattress by adding more firm foam below. Removing layers of foam could help. I think the second most common problem I see with DIY mattresses is that people “overbuild” them with too much foam. Take out some of those extra foam layers to firm it up.",

Biggest complainers are those who purchased memory foam mattresses and pillow top mattresses.\nOne thing I can assure you of is that firm is the best for spinal alignment for when you sleep on your back on a firm surface, your body will stretch. What actually is happening is your spinal process and vertabrates and discs relax. I have had 2 major back surgeries and my orthopedic surgeon, physical therapists and chiropractors all suggested resting on my back for at least 15 minutes before I side sleep. My surgeries were in '95&'97. I have done this method since my first surgery. I have never taken pain medication ever for my back. And I sleep solid through the night. I do turn and change position but never wait up.\n\nWith that said, Memory foam mattresses seen to lose their ability to support properly after 2 to 3 years. And pillow top mattresses lose their support and pillow top comfort between 3-5 years. The mattresses producers are now using memory foam as a top layer. The benefit of the springs under seem to be of no benefit for the pillow top insulates you from the structure and firmness of the springs, coils and suspension.\n\nI had a custom mattress made for my wife and I, Extremely hard and firm. We created our own pillow top by using a quilted fitted topper that is filled with synthetic down. We added a 1 1/2\" egg rate firm foam under it. \n\nVery comfortable and very supportive. \n\nThe problem with the memory foam hype today is it is all hype. Memory foam reacts to cold and hot temperatures. If it is cold in the room, the foam stiffens and when the temperature is warmer, it softens.\n\nIf what I said helps just one person sleep better, then it was worth my time with this. I hope so.",

I came on here today to figure my DIY build and start ordering the pieces after sitting on the idea for a week, and the first thing I see is this post.\n\nI was wondering if you would mind giving me some input before I pull the trigger. I'm 5'10\" and 220lb, and I sleep mostly on my side but also on my stomach a fair amount. My husband is 5'11\" and 200lb, and he's pretty much completely a side sleeper. He has a lot of back pain as well.

Do you think the 2\" of soft latex will be too soft for stomach sleeping? If so, what would you suggest?\n\nAlso should mention, the 1\" memory foam is a free topper we got from Nectar when we complained the mattress was too soft. Idk the specs, but they said it was firm. Figured we might as well use it since we have it, but is it silly to mix memory foam with latex? The idea is that we will have the sink of the 1\" of memory foam but the latex will be slightly firmer while still soft.\n\nAny input is appreciated, and thanks again for all the time and effort you put into this post.

Background: Im a 6'0\", 195 lb man. 50% side, 50% back sleeper with some significant back issues (office job). The main questions I had were:\n\n1. Do you think this would be a solid setup for me: 8\" zoned coils, 2\" #28 latex, 2\" #19 latex (I traditionally lean towards a medium/firm mattress, but my thought is that if this is too soft, I can put the medium above the soft latex)\n\n2. Are their risks/ downsides of running softer latex layers under firmer ones? My general thought was that the ideal latex setup would be to get 3\" firm, 3\" medium, 2\" soft, and 2\" ultra soft. Then you could just shuffle/ remove as needed. Say it was way too soft, would you be risking anything running (bottom to top) ultra soft, soft, firm, medium? You'd probably be better served to just remove the bottom 2 soft layers, I want just thinking it could be a simple system to order everything (cover included) at once.\n\n3. For my BMI specifically, would you lean towards the zoned coils, 2x2 latex, or all latex setup? Money isn't a huge factor for me, just getting the best end sleeping experience possible.\n\nThanks for your time, and sharing your knowledge. It's a huge help!!!!!",

Also, thanks to u/Duende555 for the info on the foam-transition layer above the pocketed coils.\n\nAfter digesting and researching, i believe i have found a relatively decent setup to start with for myself (6'0 175 stomach 85%/side 15% sleeper) and wifey (5'6 133 back 70%/side 30%).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Support**:\n   * 6\" Quantum Edge Elite (also considering deconstructing the pillowtop and reusing the coils from our current bed: Beautyrest Black Natasha)\n* **Transition 1:**\n   * 1\" Lux HQ Foam (king size)\n* **Transition 2:**\n   * 3\" dunlop GOLS medium firmness (28 ILD) (king size)\n* **Comfort** :\n   * 2\" 100% talalay 1/2 medium (25-29 DIY Mattress or 36 ILD from Plush Beds (twin XL) and 1/2 plush (20-24 DIY Mattress)\n\nI would love to get your thoughts on this approach, particularly:\n\n1. repurposing the pocketed coils from our current mattress <7 years old (not sure if the Beautyrest Black Natasha qualifies as a \"cheap-formaldehyde mattress\")?\n2. maintaining the king size layers until we reach the comfort level, i.e., should i just keep everything above the coils twin XL since we are different in size and sleep styles?\n3. will the Lux HQ foam make the bed too firm for my wife, or is it buried deep enough where it shouldnt be too much of a concern?\n\nAny thoughts would be appreciated, but not expected. Thanks again for all this information!",

We're planning to hold off on the cover until we finalize the setup and just use a fitted sheet until then. We also need a waterproof cover since we have a baby and two cats. Do you have any thoughts or experience on a regular waterproof pad vs a waterproof cover like this [one](https://diynaturalbedding.com/product/zip-off-waterproof-ticking/)? Last, if we end up getting an adjustable base, would a layer beneath the coils still be necessary?\n\nThanks so much for your advice!",

        "body": "Nice writeup and good links.\n\nI'm a side sleeper, only 160lbs, and am concerned that even 'soft' latex might be too firm. I've seen a number of other posters comment that it just still ended up being too firm for them.\n\nMy original plan was to do 6\" of HD36 polyfoam or pocket coils + 3\" of soft dunlop for a budget bed ($150+$220+$80 cover  = $450).\n\nI'm now considering adding in another comfort layer of some kind to soften it up. Would you add something like 1-2\" on top of the latex? Would that just ruin the feel of latex in general?\n\nLooking at some bed in a box companies they often have 1-2\" of a proprietary comfort layer but I'm unclear on what it is - but it's definitely not memory foam. Looks like some of the ones you have listed are like $100-$150 which is quite pricey to add another layer and I'm not sure how they would feel combined with latex.",

        "body": "So much great wisdom here!\n\nu/the_leviathan711 is there any guide you can provide for how to figure out if a build may work for a certain type of sleeper? For someone who has X weight, and is mostly a back sleeper, they may like the following builds?\n\nI'm also wondering if you can comment on what I'm thinking of. After reading this post I'm motivated to go for a DIY build again. I rented a place with a tempurpedic once, then made a DIY one in 2008 or so using a 6\" poly base from JCPenny - ILD unknown and 3\" sensus memory foam topper. It has been perfect for us, but it's now starting to break down. I'm 5'9\" 150lb 70% back / 20% side / 10% stomach and my wife is 5'4\" 130lb 75% side/25% back. We're thinking of replacing just the bottom poly layer since the memory foam is still good. We'll probably replace the memory foam soon, maybe next spring with a cooling topper. So for now we're thinking of building:\n\n3\" Lux HDX foam base, 50ILD\n\n2\" HD36/HQ35 foam (35ILD)\n\n3\" Sensus memory foam (I've seen 15 ILD but I haven't seen anything official)\n\nWould this work for a couple like us?",

        "body": "Hi u/the_leviathan711, thanks for the excellent guide.  I'm embarking on the journey of DIY mattresses and wanted to seek some input.  I'm 5'9\" and my weight fluctuates between 160-175 lbs.  Roughly 50/50 side/back sleeper, although I get shoulder pains on my current bed that's too firm, so I suspect if I get that corrected maybe it'll be closer to a 65/35, thought not very sure.  I do know that beds tend to either be too soft (hurts lower back), or too firm (hurts shoulder).\n\nRecently, I was finally able to try some latex mattresses today for the first time at a local shop (Nest Bedding), which only had Dunlop not Talalay.  The layering of the mattress (Organic All Latex) that I felt the most comfortable were:\n\n- Comfort: 2\" Soft Dunlop (19 ILD)\n- Transition: 3\" Medium Dunlop (27 ILD)\n- Support: 6\" Extra firm Dunlop (36 ILD)\n\nHowever, even though I felt the setup above were good for my shoulders, the support for back sleeping was okay - could be a bit better.  If I had removed the comfort layer, then back sleeping was great but shoulders had an issue.\n\n\nSo, I'm trying to replicate this.  My plan is:\n\n- Comfort: 2\" Talalay (19 ILD) from APM\n- Transition: 3\" Dunlop (28-33 ILD) from APM (or FoamByMail)\n- Support: 6\"  Dunlop (34-38 ILD) from APM\n- Base: 1\" HD36-R foam from FoamByMail\n\nConcerns I have are:  The Transition layer of 3\" Dunlop from APM is stiffer than the one I tried (28-33 ILD vs 24-28 ILD).  Therefore, I am switching the comfort layer to Talalay since I heard that's softer than Dunlop.  Hopefully that will provide more support for my back while at the same time decreasing my shoulder pinch.  Do you think this is reasonable?  And anything else you recommend?  Thanks in advance.\n\nEDIT: add FoamByMail to Transition layer vendor",

I am trying to get a mattress and I will definitely go with the DIY yourself option.

Should I get a quilted or non-quilted cover? Also, I am trying to lose some weight! let's say that a couple of years from now I will be 200 lbs. How can this build be adjusted so that it's still comfortable?",
