Personally, having a moderate amount of healthy carbs in my diet improves my hair shedding. I shed so much hair when I was on a low carb diet. My detailed hair growth routine is here:*** [***https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how\\_i\\_have\\_successfully\\_grown\\_my\\_hair\\_back/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how_i_have_successfully_grown_my_hair_back/)\n* **Scalp conditions: healthy white scalp, no itchiness, no flakes**\n* **Shampoo routine: shampooing every other day, using Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every  7-10 days, Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week.**\n* **Diet and Lifestyle: Mediterranean diet; go to bed before 12; 7-8 hours of sleep everyday;**\n* **Stress management: don't give a shit about things that used to bother me, overall better mood**\n\nHi there, I've benefitted a lot from this community, so I'd like to make some contributions. I was losing an average of 200-300 hairs everyday at the onset of my sebderm. After two months, I'm now only shedding about 90 hairs daily, which is within the normal range. I know that clinically speaking there is no cure to sebderm and it may come back later, but I'm just happy that it's at least under control now. So I want to share this as my SOS protocol. As for long-term maintenance, I'm still learning so much about it from this community.\n\nBackground:\n\n\\- suffered from dry dandruff (large and white flakes) for more than 12 years but never experienced any hair loss\n\n\\- Because of COVID, I developed a bad habit of only shampooing 1-2 times a week (I have an oily scalp and straight hair). On non-wash days, I used a lot of hair products to keep my scalp feeling clean, e.g. scalp serum and dry shampoo. I only found out later that they contained denatured alcohol, which can destroy our skin barrier.\n\n\\- In late Aug, I experienced increased hair shedding of a daily average of 200-300 strands when I usually only shed a maximum of 30-60 strands a day. At the worst point, I was losing 500 hairs when I was shampooing one day. And I almost passed out.\n\n\\- My scalp was tingling, burning, and sore.\n\n\\- I went to a dermatologist in early Sept. He diagnosed me with severe sebderm and folliculitis on my scalp. He said I needed to get my sebderm under control before he could treat my hair loss\n\n\\- My before and after pics (warning: my sebderm was really bad on my scalp): [https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i](https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSebderm and hair loss:\n\n\\- I was very anxious and depressed about my hair loss because I've always had thick and healthy hair. People always give me compliments on how my hair looks. The point is that I was feeling so much pain mentally.\n\n\\- I consulted other dermatologists. Some said sebderm could cause telogen effluvium because my condition was so severe that it shocked my hair. Some said even though sebderm could cause increased hair shedding, mine was too serious to be caused by sebderm alone. There might be other causes.\n\n\\- But from Dr. Donovan's blog, there is a study that revealed that the more seborrheic dermaitits a person has, the more shedding (telogen effluvium) a person will experience. This tells us that individuals with severe seborrheic dermatitis are likely to have a severe telogen effluvium.\n\n\\- I still went to my family doctor and a naturopath to get blood tests done just to be sure what we're dealing with here. Everything was normal, so I focused on getting my sebderm under control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I got the situation under control:\n\n\\- My dermatologist prescribed me with clobetasol solution and ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo.\n\n\\- At first, I was reluctant to use steroid. However, the longer my scalp stays inflamed, the more possible damage will be caused to my hair follicles, so I followed my derm's instructions and applied clobetasol to the affected areas daily for 21 days. My scalp was less red but I was still shedding 150-200 hairs a day.\n\n\\- Using the ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo (every other day for 8 weeks, as instructed by my dermatologist) was not very helpful. After much research, I came up with my own protocol that has really helped me get my sebderm under control.\n\n**- What I found is key is that the protocol needs to consist of three components: 1) destroy the biofilm, 2) kill malassezia, and 3) rebuild skin barrier. For each component, there are numerous ingredients/products available.**\n\n**- You can do all three components on a particular day or scatter them around throughout the week, depending on whatever suits your schedule and skin needs. Experiment and observe what suits your skin the best.**\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **on a given shampoo day**: 5% xylitol solution on the affected areas to be left on for at least an hour --> wash it off with an antifungal shampoo --> apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **in a particular week** (this is what I'm doing now): biofilm shampoo on day 1 and day 3 of the week followed by ciclopirox shampoo on day 5 and day 7. Each time after shampooing, apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 1) destroying the biofilm: xylitol, ACV, and selenium sulfide, MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 2) killing malassezia: ciclopirox, ketoconazole, coal tar, zinc pyrithione, and MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 3) rebuilding skin barrier: panthenol (vitamin B5), niacinamide (vitamin B3), glycerin, and aloe vera\n\n\\- Salicylic acid is not anti fungal per se, but it's great at removing the scales, regulating sebum production, and calming down inflammation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy detailed protocol:\n\n**-  I shampoo four times a week: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide --> Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide OR T/Sal --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo --> T/Sal (I only use Selsun Blue twice a week for 2 weeks when things are bad because it is very strong)**\n\n**- This protocol is for short-term ONLY, e.g. 2-6 weeks! To get things under control first.**\n\n**- (updated on 4 Jan 2022) As my sebderm is getting much better, I have switched to this gentler protocol, which again incorporates all the essential components, for long-term maintenance. I'm rotating three different shampoos: Neutrogena T/Sal, DermaKB Scalp Detoxifier (biofilm disrupter), and Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Shampoo (contains an antifungal Piroctone Olamine). To hydrate my scalp, I've been using a DIY niacinamide and panthenol spray.**\n\n\\- Selenium Sulfide 2.5% is a game changer for me!! The dandruff/biofilm was finally coming off after 1-2 uses. Antifungals cannot get to the malassezia to do their job if the biofilm is present.\n\n\\- After shampooing, ~~I apply a DIY 3% panthenol aloe vera gel to my scalp.~~ I'm now using this DIY 2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in water spray.\n\n\\- Avoid ANY ingredient that may feed malassezia (I use a website called Sezia. Simple Skincare Science is also a very good source).\n\n\\- Even though I don't suffer sebderm on any other area, I switch all of my skincare products to seb-derm safe products because my skincare may transfer to my pillow.\n\n\\- I use a silk pillow case to reduce the friction (I can't afford to lose even one more hair).\n\n\\- I change my pillow case every 2-3 days and wash my pillow every week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct recommendations:\n\n\\- What is weird is that a lot of the products that are supposed to be formulated for people with sebderm are not sebderm friendly. They contain ingredients that feed malassezia. There is a useful website called Sezia that I use to check whether a product is safe (not affiliated). This is also the reason I need to DIY the panthenol and aloe scalp treatment.\n\n\\- Products that I like: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide Shampoo, Neutrogena T/Sal, Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp, dermaKB Biofilm Scalp Detoxifier, Philosophy B5 powder, the Ordinary 100% niacinamide powder,\n\n\\- Products that made my situation worse: Head and Shoulders Royal Oils Scalp Elixir, Inkey List Salicylic Acid Scalp Treatment, Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength 1% Selenium Sulfide\n\n~~- I will be experimenting with a DIY niacinamide and panthenol toner (for rebuilding skin barrier and calming inflammation) and 5% xylitol solution (for destroying the biofilm) and will keep this community updated of my results.~~ After much trial and error, I settle on this DIY scalp toner (2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in distilled water, which I think is really helpful for calming my scalp.\n\n**- Neutrogena T/Sal shampoo may be too harsh for people with a dry/sensitive scalp, but my oily scalp loves it!!! It helps get rid of the oily buildup and flakes on my scalp while also regulating my sebum production. My scalp is definitely less oily. And malassezia loves an oily scalp because they also feed on our natural sebum.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiet and supplements (Please see here for a detailed wholistic approach to tacking sebderm: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a\\_novelwholistic\\_evidenceinspired\\_approach\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a_novelwholistic_evidenceinspired_approach_to/)):\n\n\\- Daily: Vitamin D3+K2, cod liver oil, ~~reishi, homemade kefir~~, nutritional yeast, ~~MCT oil~~\n\n\\- 2-3 times a week: zinc, magnesium glycinate, and collagen powder\n\n**- What I would recommend for almost everyone: vitamin D3+K2, magnesium, and fish oil.**\n\n\\- Around 60-70% of people in North America are deficient in vitamin D. There are also studies that point to an association between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory skin conditions such as sebderm. Although this does not mean a causal relationship, taking vitamin D3 overall can help regulate our hormones and immune system. Magnesium and vitamin K2 should be supplemented with vitamin D3. This combo also help me better deal with stress, which is also a trigger of sebderm.\n\n\\- Fish oil supplement helps the body repair the skin barrier. It is also highly anti-inflammatory. But remember to choose a reliable brand. Many of the fish oil supplements on the market are contaminated. Brands I love that are also third-party tested: Nordic Naturals, Natural Factors Pharmaceutical Grade Fish Oil, and InnovixLab.\n\n\\- Probiotics that I've tried and quite like: Garden of Life Dr Formulated, Seed, and Visbiome (not affiliated in any sense; purchased all products with my own money)\n\n\\- Garlic powder supplement and oregano oil capsules daily for 1 week for killing the bad bacteria in my gut\n\n\\- Homemade bone broth for repairing my gut\n\n\\- Gluten-free\n\n\\- No refined carbs at all\n\n\\- No sugar\n\n\\- No dairy ~~except kefir~~\n\n\\- Lots of greens with some meat each meal\n\n\\- Berries everyday (there is a study that revealed a correlation between low fruit intake and sebderm in women). Plus, berries are anti-inflammatory\n\n\\- Avoid using vegetable oil in cooking. Opt for more heat-stable oils that are also low in omega-6s, e.g. extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, ghee, and butter.\n\n\\- To sum up, the key is to incorporate as much anti-inflammatory food as possible. Some further examples are turmeric and ginger.\n\n\\- What I usually eat: [https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne](https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary of helpful resources/research:\n\n\\- Simple Skincare Science website\n\n\\- Sezia Website\n\n\\- Dandruff Deconstructed Website\n\n\\- Dr. Donovan's blog (He has recently published quite a number of articles on sebderm)\n\n\\- Ceramide insufficiency in sebderm patients ( [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles)) ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/))\n\n\\- Niacinamide increases ceramide production ([http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis\\_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf](http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf))\n\n\\- Caprylic and Polygalacturonic Acid Combinations for Eradication of Microbial Organisms Embedded in Biofilm ([https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full))\n\n\\- Topical nicotinamide \\[i.e. niacinamide\\] for seborrheic dermatitis: an open randomized study ([https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf))\n\n\\- Skin moisturizing effects of panthenol-based formulations ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/))\n\nFinally, I want to say that there is still hope. Don't give up. I will pray for everyone in this community to regain their health soon!\n\nEdit: I will continue to edit this and add on to it based on my ongoing research and trial and error. And also to add the things that I forgot to mentionEdit: Added some before and after pics and meal idea pics.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions\n\nEdit on 19 Jan 2022: Now my scalp is free from dandruff with very mild redness, itch is very neglectable like only very mild itch every 5-6 days, and I'm shedding an average of 70 strands of hair daily, which is within the normal range of 50-100 hairs daily as advised by most dermatologists. This is my latest weekly routine (I shampoo four times a week): Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo --> Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp (start with as little shampoo as possible because it lathers very well; too much lather can be irritating to the scalp) --> Phillip Adam Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo (Fragrance Free) --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo (available by prescription only; alternatives are ketoconazole shampoo and selenium sulfide). ~~Each time after shampooing, I apply the DIY hydrating scalp spray containing 2% panthenol, 2% glycerin, and 4% niacinamide.~~ No longer using the toner as the shampoos I'm using now are very hydrating and gentle.\n\nEdit on 23 Jan 2022:  I've just stumbled across some substitutes for this DIY spray from a brand called COSRX. Although they are not hair products, the ingredient lists seem pretty good. This toner ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner)) contains panthenol and sodium hyaluronate, which are both good hydrating ingredients. This one ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid)) contains salicylic acid, niacinamide, and panthenol. I'm probably going to try these out soon as I sometimes don't have the time to make the DIY spray. BIG **DISCLAIMER: These are not products formulated for the scalp. Use at your own discretion.**\n\nUpdates on 15 Mar 2022: I'm now using a routine targeted at healing my skin barrier because my scalp is now flake-free but mildly red. Shampooing every other day: ciclopirox shampoo once a week and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo (if you have a really oily scalp, Briogeo Be Gentle Be Kind Matcha Shampoo may be a better alternative) for the rest of the week. Each time after shampooing, I apply some diluted niacinamide serum from The Ordinary because the original 10% may be too irritating. The study that suggested niacinamide as a potential treatment for sebderm used a concentration of 4%. I also added some panthenol powder to the mixture (at a concentration of about 1.5%), which is completely optional. I'm now shedding about 50 hairs daily.\n\nThe new HA hydrating serum by The Ordinary did not work for me. I tested it on my hairline, then the sebderm migrated to my hairline while my scalp, luckily, is still clear.\n\nUpdates on 12 May 2022: Shampooing every 2-3 days because my scalp is less oily and less itchy. Not using any topical hydrating product because I think my skin has healed so much. Now I'm using ciclopirox shampoo (by prescription only) once a week, and Bioderma Node A Shampoo for the rest of the days\n\nUpdates on 7 July 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair once a week and Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for sensitive scalp for the rest of the week; taking anti-inflammatory herbs prescribed by a licensed Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner (TCM); shedding 40-50 hairs daily; scalp pretty healthy; incorporated more carbs in my diet because realized a low-carb diet makes me shed more hair\n\nUpdates on 28 Aug 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every 10 days and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week; been taking the herbs for almost 2 months now. Noticed my scalp is less oily, zero itch now, no flakes, and redness almost gone. There are some days where I'm shedding only 20-30 hairs daily, which is my pre-sebderm level. But I DON'T recommend visiting a TCM practitioner in western countries. Most of them have no idea what they're doing, and the herbs, if not prescribed properly, can cause damage to the liver and kidney. They are also not well-regulated under the law. My diet is lots of cooked vegetables, some berries, some carbs, and some meat. My TCM doctor told me to avoid seafood (except some fish) and beef.",

What really caught my attention was the piroctone olamine in the ingredients instead of the usual zinc pyrithione. Piroctone olamine is a gentle anti-dandruff ingredient that's much milder than zinc pyrithione, making it a great option if you want something effective but less harsh on the scalp. \n\nFor context, I don't get dandruff anymore, but I still use Head & Shoulders a few times a week to control oil production. My go-to is the Old Spice variant because of its scent. I also wash my hair daily since I hit the gym often and sweat a lot. \n\nMy Thoughts: \n\n● Less Drying - Compared to my usual H&S, this one doesn't leave my hair feeling as dry. \n\n● Smooth and moisturized - It makes my hair feel soft and refreshed but not heavy. \n\n● Great scent - It has a spa-like fragrance that I really like. \n\n● Gentler formula - Since it uses piroctone olamine, it's less harsh than other Head & Shoulders shampoos but still keeps my scalp fresh. \n\n● Helps control oil - Even though it's milder, it still does a great job at keeping my scalp from geting greasy without over-drying. \n\nI honestly just bought this to try, but I love it! If you're looking for a milder anti-dandruff shampoo that still works and helps with oil control, this is worth checking out :) \n\nP.S. They also have a treatment that pairs with this",

If ignored, it leads to visible scalp and low density.\n\n🛑 **Step 1: Block DHT**\n\n* **Finasteride 1 mg/day** (tablet or topical): Blocks DHT (main reason for male hair loss).\n* Recommended if hair loss is **Stage 2 or more** on Norwood scale.\n\n**💉 Step 2: Improve Blood Flow to Hair Roots**\n\n* **Minoxidil 5%**: Increases blood supply to hair follicles, delivering more nutrients.\n* Apply once or twice daily.\n* For very early hair fall (Stage 1–2), some doctors prefer starting with **caffeine-based or peptide serums** first.\n\n**💊 Step 3: Provide Proper Nutrients**\n\nEven if blood supply increases, without the right nutrients, hair won’t grow strong. Include:\n\n|Supplement|Benefit|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Biotin**|Strengthens hair strands|\n|**Multivitamin (with Zinc, Vitamin D, and B-complex)**|Fixes hidden deficiencies|\n|**Omega-3 or Fish Oil**|Reduces inflammation, nourishes follicles|\n\n**🧪 Step 4: Peptide-Based Serums (for Root Stimulation)**\n\nThese serums contain **plant-based peptides and natural growth factors** that help activate weak or resting follicles without the side effects of stronger medications.\n\n|Serum|Key Ingredients|Benefits|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Redensyl**|DHQG + EGCG2|Activates hair stem cells, reduces hair fall|\n|**Capixyl**|Biomimetic peptide + red clover|Strengthens follicles, reduces inflammation|\n|**Anagain**|Pea sprout extract|Extends hair growth phase (anagen)|\n|**The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Hair Serum**|Blend of multiple peptides|Boosts density, nourishes scalp|\n\n✅ Best used **once daily** on a dry scalp. Can be combined with microneedling (1–2x/week) for better absorption.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 💇‍♀️ 3. Hair Strand Care – Improve Hair Texture, Strength & Shine\n\nThis is the visible part of hair above the scalp. You need to:\n\n**🧴 Use Hair Oil (Carefully)**\n\n* Oil gives moisture and reduces breakage.\n* But **avoid putting oil on the scalp** too often — it can cause dandruff or feed fungus.\n* Apply oil **only on the hair length**, 1–2 times a week, and **wash off properly**.\n\n**🧼 Use Conditioner (Not on Scalp)**\n\n* After shampoo, apply conditioner **only on hair strands** to reduce dryness and tangles.\n\n**💆 Use Hair Mask (Deep Conditioning Treatment)**\n\nHair masks are like super-conditioners. Use them 1–2 times a week to:\n\n* Deeply moisturize dry hair\n* Make hair soft, smooth, and shiny\n* Reduce frizz and split ends\n\n🧴 Choose masks with ingredients like coconut oil, argan oil, shea butter, keratin, or aloe vera.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧴 4.

Hard Water vs Soft Water\n\n# 🔹 Hard Water (contains high levels of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Leaves behind mineral deposits on hair strands.\n   * Causes **dry, rough, dull, and brittle hair**.\n   * Can lead to **more hair breakage and tangling**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * **Clogs scalp pores**, leading to dandruff or scalp acne.\n   * May cause **itching or irritation**.\n   * Reduces the effectiveness of shampoo and conditioner (hair doesn’t feel clean).\n\n# 🔹 Soft Water (low mineral content):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Makes hair feel **softer and smoother**.\n   * Helps shampoos and conditioners work better.\n   * Prevents mineral buildup, making hair **shinier and more manageable**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * Gentle on the scalp.\n   * Helps maintain **natural oil balance**.\n\n# 🌡️ 2. Water Temperature\n\n* **Hot Water:**\n   * Strips natural oils from hair and scalp.\n   * Can cause **dryness, itching, and frizz**.\n   * May weaken hair roots over time.\n* **Cold or Lukewarm Water:**\n   * Retains natural oils.\n   * Helps **seal the hair cuticle**, making hair shinier and smoother.\n   * Best for the final rinse.\n\n# 🧪 3. Chlorinated Water (Swimming Pools)\n\n* Damages the hair shaft.\n* Causes **dryness, discoloration (especially in colored hair), and split ends**.\n* Irritates the scalp and worsens **scalp sensitivity or dandruff**.\n\n# ✅ Solutions if You Have Hard Water\n\n* Install a **shower filter** that removes minerals and chlorine. (or use filtered water from water purifier only for hair wash)\n* Use **chelating or clarifying shampoos** once a week (they remove mineral buildup).\n* Rinse with **apple cider vinegar + water (1:4 ratio)** to remove residue.\n* Apply **deep conditioning masks** to restore moisture.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# # Is Finasteride Safe? Can You Take It Without Doctor Consultation?\n\n**Finasteride** (commonly used for male pattern baldness at **1 mg/day**) is generally **effective and relatively safe** when taken correctly - but **it should NOT be taken without a doctor’s consultation**, especially for long-term use.\n\n# 🔍 Why You Need Doctor Consultation\n\nFinasteride changes your **hormone levels** by reducing DHT (dihydrotestosterone), the hormone responsible for hair loss. Since it alters your body's chemistry, a doctor should:\n\n* Assess if it’s safe based on your medical history\n* Decide the right **dose** and **form** (oral vs. topical)\n* Monitor side effects and hormone balance\n\n# ✅ Is Low-Dose Finasteride (1 mg/day) Safe?\n\nYes, **low-dose Finasteride (1 mg/day)** is considered **relatively safe for most healthy adult men**, especially under medical guidance. In fact, this is the **standard dose** used to treat androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness).\n\nBut even low doses **can have side effects**—though not everyone experiences them.\n\n# ⚠️ Common Side Effects (in 1–10% of users)\n\n* Low libido (reduced sexual desire)\n* Erectile dysfunction\n* Reduced semen volume\n* Breast tenderness or enlargement\n* Depression or mood changes\n\nThese are often **mild and reversible** if the drug is stopped.\n\n# ⚠️ Rare but Serious Risks\n\n* **Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS)** – Persistent sexual, neurological, or psychological symptoms after stopping (very rare, still debated)\n* Gynecomastia (male breast growth)\n* Severe depression or anxiety (in rare cases)\n\n# 👨‍⚕️ Who Should Avoid Finasteride Without Supervision\n\n* People with **liver issues**\n* History of **depression or sexual dysfunction**\n* **Those planning to conceive soon** (Finasteride may affect sperm in rare cases)\n* **Women and children** (especially pregnant women)\n\n# 🔍 Monitoring Required If You Take It\n\n* **DHT levels** (optional, but helpful)\n* **Liver function tests**\n* **Prostate exam** (PSA levels can be falsely lowered)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#

        "body": "Please for the love of Hairs, stop asking GPT and Reddit on hair care routine. It never ends well. Consult a proper Dermat (not someone who says to rub oil) and monitor your scalp condition. \n\nWhat has worked for me : \n1. 1mg finasteride orally per day keeps the hair transplant doctor away. ( Only Finasteride/Dutasteride will cure your hairfall issue which is caused by DHT- a useless harmone in adults (useful until puberty passes). \n\n2. Ketoconazole %1 shampoo (%1 is already most effective and strong. Using 2% is overkill unless you suffer from severe case of seborrheic dermatitis. I use it once or twice a week.\n\n3. Never needed topical Minoxidil but it helps only in compliment with Finasteride. Never used minoxidil alone as it does not solve the hairloss issue.\n\n4. I use Tresemme sulphate free shampoo + conditioner for regular use. \n\n5. When I don't use conditioner, I use Kraves wax for styling along with a cold air blower.(Only occasionally)\n\n6. I don't use any oils because my scalp is oily. Applying more will worsen the dandruff problem. \n\n\nThings to Note : \n1. No other serum works unless it does have proper clinical trials and meta analysis studies on it.\n\n2. Never fall for all natural and organic scams. They do not work. be skeptical. Never be blinded by a brand and Fake doctors who claim ridiculous 'CURES'. They do so because people fear drugs and they don't have any evidence or proof of the efficacy. \n\n3. Depending on food and diet as your only way to fight the Slap head curse is a bad idea. Food is food not a medicine. Just because our ancestors used it, does not mean it's good. Our ancestors did not have knowledge nor the protocols for developing cures and conducting clinical trials. \nThe most heinous diseases like TB black death, Hairloss etc have been cured by Pharmaceuticals. So don't fear drugs.\n\n4. DON'T use microneedling. It will cause scar tissue in your scalp which will permanently remove any chance of you growing new hair in that area.\n\n5. Exercise is a must. Never skip a leg day.",

Allow me to correct it from using what is proven and in accordance with my knowledge. \n\nA) In section 1. Types of Hair problems. The root cause of both hairloss, hair thinning, breakage and Density is all causes by DHT. DHT is a useless harmone in adults which is converted from testosterone (good harmone) with an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase (5AR). So all those problems are solved by Finasteride which is 5AR1 inhibitor.\nRegarding scalp with dandruff and flaking problem - 1% ketoconazole is enough. \nAnd that is all \n\nReferences:\n\n1) Shin J, Chung E, Kim M, Kim T, Kim W, Huh C.

This is all you need to solve all the problems mentioned in section 1. \n\nB) Bloodflow Theory - This theory stated a century ago that bludflow restriction caused by wearing tight hats and creating tension in scalp is the reason for male pattern baldness. this theory has been overused till this day to sell Nonsense products. This theory has been debunked over century ago (1916) by Dorothy Osborn. \n\nReferences : \n1) Osborn D. INHERITANCE OF BALDNESS.

When it is not FDA approved, companies can put anything in it without having to disclose the proper composition. So it's best to avoid them or take FDA approved vitamins. Imo just finasteride is enough to solve all hairloss problems. \n\nD) Microneedling does not work as a standalone treatment nor is it safe as a long term usage. it is observed in 3 studies that Microneedling combined with  topical 5%minoxidil has more efficacy than just standalone microneedling and topical minoxidil. This is because the efficacy of minoxidil increases due to channels in epidermis caused by microneedling. \nThere is no standardized protocol for microneedling, so anyone can just dismiss the ineffectiveness of microneedling using No-true Scotsman falacy even when there is compelling evidence to prove otherwise. \nBasically Microneedling is causing inflammation in the scalp and in long term it will become chronic inflammation. Ultimately creating Scar tissue in scalp resulting in a similar situation to what androgenetic alopecia does to scalp. \nI.e back to square one.\nApplying Tretinoin is better than microneedling along with minoxidil to give maximum benefits to hair growth.\n\nReferences: \n1) Chronic inflammation in the etiology of disease across the life span\nDavid Furman et al.

    "body": "\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis article presents a comprehensive, patient-driven investigation into the efficacy of various topical agents in managing scalp psoriasis symptoms over a three-year period. Unlike traditional brand comparisons, the analysis isolates specific active ingredients found in over-the-counter and clinical treatments, assessing their impact through systematic self-experimentation. Key compounds evaluated include salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione, coal tar, selenium sulfide, piroctone olamine, tea tree oil, pine tar, bisabolol, and ketoconazole. The findings suggest that while many mainstream treatments offer limited or purely symptomatic relief, a combination of 1% salicylic acid and 1% selenium sulfide provided a near-complete remission without adverse effects. The study also highlights the efficacy of zinc pyrithione and salicylic acid—despite their underrepresentation in psoriasis-specific treatment literature—and raises questions about overlooked ingredients that may offer genuine therapeutic benefit.\n\n\n\nIntroduction:\n\nI am a guy who has suffered from scalp psoriasis since my teenage years. For most of that time, I relied on coal tar shampoo, but in the past two to three years, I’ve conducted extensive self-experimentation driven by personal frustration and informed by scientific literature. I undertook this journey with a goal: to isolate which specific chemicals—not brands—actually alleviate symptoms of psoriasis. Having read many peer-reviewed articles and product studies over the years, I focused strictly on ingredients featured in scientific research, avoiding anecdotal claims and brand biases. This self-experimentation was documented carefully to avoid confounding variables, aiming to provide clarity for others who may feel unheard or misinformed about their treatment options.\n\n\n\nMethodology:\n\nEach treatment was tested in chronological order. I maintained consistent hair care routines and avoided introducing multiple new ingredients simultaneously, ensuring any effects could be attributed to the active compound in question. Products were selected based on scientific literature or suggested efficacy in treating similar dermatological conditions like seborrheic dermatitis. Observations were made over a period of several weeks per compound, and effects were noted regarding itch relief, flake reduction, hair/scalp health, and need for adjunctive care like conditioner.\n\n\n\nFindings and Analysis:\n\n-2% Ketoconazole: Provided no noticeable improvement in symptoms.\n\n-0.5% to 1% Coal Tar: Relieved painful itching and significantly reduced dandruff and flaking, but some remained.\n\n-3% Salicylic Acid: Eliminated flakes and fully cleared symptoms.\n\n-1% Zinc Pyrithione: Cleared all symptoms and left hair smooth, but caused hair thinning.\n\n-Tea Tree Oil (approx. % unknown): Reduced flakes and psoriasis, but damaged follicles and increased itch without conditioner.\n\n-1% Selenium Sulfide: Marginally reduced symptoms but did not eliminate pain, itch, or flaking.\n\n-1% Piroctone Olamine: Slightly more effective than selenium sulfide but also mostly symptomatic.\n\n-1% Salicylic Acid + 1% Selenium Sulfide Combo: Fully effective; no symptoms, no hair damage, and no need for conditioner. This combination was found specifically in the Vichy Dercos Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, which also contains several other compounds that may have contributed to its superior effectiveness. Among them is tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E), a known antioxidant which may also contribute anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, menthol is included, which I also noted helps prevent itchiness. The synergy of these ingredients may enhance its therapeutic profile.\n\n-Pine Tar (with Tea Tree Oil): Moderately effective, slightly better than tea tree oil alone, but difficult to isolate effects.\n\nSpecial Mentions:\n\n-Menthol: Provides significant itch relief and improves comfort.\n\n-Conditioner: Helps prevent scalp dryness, which can reduce flaking and itching when used with active treatments.\n\n-Vitamin E (Tocopheryl Acetate): Acts as an antioxidant that protects scalp cells from oxidative stress and may offer additional anti-inflammatory support, potentially enhancing treatment effectiveness.\n\nPromising Untested Compounds:\n\n-Bisabolol: Not formally tested in this self-experimentation, but theorized to have potential due to its anti-inflammatory properties and scientific support in dermatological contexts.\n\n-Urea: Also untested directly in this study, but research shows highly promising effects in reducing scaling and inflammation in psoriasis, making it a strong candidate for future trials.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe results show a pattern of strong efficacy from salicylic acid and zinc pyrithione—both of which are rarely promoted as psoriasis treatments compared to coal tar. Coal tar and pine tar, although effective for itch, were less helpful in controlling flaking. Selenium sulfide and piroctone olamine offered symptomatic relief but no long-term benefit, suggesting their mechanism is more palliative than curative. Tea tree oil offered temporary improvements but presented drawbacks in hair follicle health. The combination of 1% salicylic acid with 1% selenium sulfide emerged as the most balanced and complete solution. Interestingly, ketoconazole, though widely recommended for scalp issues, had no effect on psoriasis, aligning with clinical skepticism about its use beyond fungal conditions. This study underscores the need for more ingredient-focused guidance in over-the-counter psoriasis treatments and suggests that compounds like salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione, and possibly bisabolol, urea, and pine tar deserve more clinical attention.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThrough persistent, controlled self-experimentation over three years, I found that the most effective treatments for scalp psoriasis were not always the ones most commonly advertised. The best results came from 3% salicylic acid and 1% zinc pyrithione individually, and even more so from a combined 1% salicylic acid and 1% selenium sulfide formula. This formula, found in Vichy Dercos, also contained tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E) and menthol, which likely contributed to its effectiveness by reducing inflammation and itchiness. These findings could serve as the basis for future controlled studies and provide a roadmap for other sufferers navigating treatment options.\n\n\n\nScientific References:\n\nSalicylic Acid: Lebwohl, 1999\n\nZinc Pyrithione: Kruglova et al., 2024\n\nCoal Tar: Slutsky et al., 2010\n\nSelenium Sulfide: van de Kerkhof & Franssen, 2001\n\nPiroctone Olamine: Lodén & Wessman, 2000\n\nTea Tree Oil: Summary\n\nPine Tar: Rachev et al., 2003\n\nBisabolol: Search\n\nUrea: Rachev et al., 2003\n\nMenthol: Prunel et al., 2012\n\nVitamin E: Cruz, 2013\n\nKetoconazole: Alford et al., 1986",

Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

Was MRP 490 for 500 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years. I'm on my second tub\n\nConsistency: White cream.\n\nUsage: I take one big spoonful, add it to half a mug of water, swirl it around till it mixes with the water, dip my hair in and leave it. I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Plum has a 100 million sales throughout. You can get it for around 450ish.\n\nUsage Timeline: No clue. I'm on my third tub.\n\nConsistency: Thick white cream\n\nUsage: This works both ways. Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

    "body": "So I spotted the above-named product at the grocery store while meandering past the grooming section.  I picked it up and wondered if it was as good for a primer, as it's neighbor, Nivea Post Shave Balm, has been known to be.  I compared the two products' ingredient lists, and noticed some big differences.\n\n> **Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm**: Water, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tapioca Starch, Triceteareth-4 Phosphate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol , Piroctone Olamine, Fragrance.\n\n> **Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating+**: Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 MA Crosspolymer, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, DMDM Hydantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Stearic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Panthenol, Sodium Lactate, Triethanolamine, Sodium PCA, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 1\n\nThe first thing that jumped out at me was the inclusion of silicone compounds in the Dove shave balm.  It contains cyclopentasiloxane and dimethicone.  Silicones are absent from the Nivea balm.  This is a pro or a con, depending on your skin type and the base of your foundation.  \n\nThe second thing I noticed that I liked was the inclusion of ceramides in the Dove balm.  However, they're mostly on the tail end of the list, so it's hard to say how much is actually in the products, and if it is present enough to do any good.  Certainly can't hurt.\n\nThe Nivea balm has the benefit of having tapioca starch in it's formulation, which can be good for oil, and it has Witch Hazel extract.  Both balms have pretty good ingredients.  Neither contains drying alcohol.\n\nSo I purchased it.  When I got home, I washed my face, moisturized as normal, then put the Dove balm on the left side of my face and the Nivea balm on the right side.  I eschewed all other primers.  I dabbed a little Maybelline FitMe concealer under my eyes, and used a RT sponge to apply some L'Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte.  The foundation went on very smoothly and did not cake up or pill.  I set it with NYC loose powder.  I added some blush and bronzer for some depth, then I went about my day.\n\nSix hours later, I surveyed the first round of results.  Aside from my foundation being rubbed off of the tip and bottom of my nose (got the flu), both sides looked okay.  I did noticed, however, that the foundation on the right side of my face was more textured.  I could see my pores way clearer than the other side of my face.  Both sides were moderately oily.  The left side of my face was holding up somewhat better than the right side.  I noticed fewer flakes around the dry spots of my face on the left side.  At eight hours, all of these observations were more pronounced.  I noticed more oil on the right side, enough that my pores were \"shining\" with oil.  It was odd.  Neither side looked bad, however.  But for me, the left side (Dove) was winning out in the overall appearance category.  \n\nSo, for my initial testing, Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating did better than Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm, as a foundation primer.  Both have pretty good ingredients, both are alcohol free, and each can serve certain skin types better than the other.  Cheers! ",

    "body": "**MPB isn't a singular event but a culmination of several contributing factors**\n\n1. **Chronic Inflammation and Stress in the body:**\n\n**Cause:** **Stress depletes magnesium**, a vital mineral which increases Nitric oxide for ***blood vessel*** relaxation and nutrient delivery to follicles. Additionally, stress blocks vitamin D3 receptors and GAS6 protein, both crucial for hair growth. Mg also blocks calcium ion channels. Increased calcium ion channels causes death of hair follicle (palmitic acid, oxidative stress, and genetics)\n\n**Cures:**\n\na. Magnesium-rich foods\n\nb. sunshine exposure\n\nc. stress-management techniques like yoga or meditation,\n\nd. Vitamin D3 supplements\n\ne. Anu taila through nose\n\nf. Topical Rice bran oil (RBO) increases NO secretion\n\ng. Ashwagandha Oral reduces cortisol\n\nh. Sulphur in MSM etc enhances blood flow\n\ni. β-sitosterol\n\nj.\n\n**2.** **3α-HSD Deficiency:**\n\n**Cause:**  This enzyme converts the DHT hormone into a beneficial byproduct called androstanol. Zinc and B6 deficiencies involved in the biosynthesis and activity of 3α-HSD. Obesity, metabolic syndrome and severe infections can cause a systemic inflammatory response, all of which lead to **3α-HSD Deficiency. Depletion of type 1 3α-HSD in the liver can lead to cortisol resistance (which ultimately impacts hair as well), while depletion of type 5 3α-HSD in the skin can cause steroid hormone imbalances and affect hair growth.**\n\n**Cure:**\n\n1. zinc, B6, procyanidin B2 and sulforaphane to boost 3α-HSD activity.\n2. Topical Procyanidin B-2 1% has growth-promoting effects on hair epithelial cells that follow MEK activation and their protective action on TGF-beta(1)- or TGF-beta(2)-induced apoptosis that is assumed to trigger catagen induction in the hair cycle\n3. Procyanidin B-2 Ignite Keratin production in hair follicles by inhibiting the pentose phosphate pathway and amino acid oxidation\n4. **Energy Mismanagement:**\n\n**Cause:** Hair growth is a hungry beast, and calorie restriction puts it on a starvation diet. Prioritize **protein intake for healthy follicles**, remember that hair is not essential for survival, so it gets the leftovers during stress. **Any type of stress first effects hair, nails and skin**\n\n**Cure:** Ensure decent protein intake. Protein is needed for iodination reaction of thyroid gland. Iodine and thyroxine combine to form thyroid hormones. If iodine/protein deficiency is there it will lead to hair fall.\n\n4. **Vitamin D3 Receptor Blockade:**\n\n**Cause:** 4. Vitamin D receptors are located on every cell of body. If you do not have enough Vitamin D receptors you will lose hair. These vital receptors are like locks, and if blocked by obesity, medications, or high cortisol, hair growth stalls.\n\nD3 is important for differentiation and initiation of anagen phase of hair cycle. VDR is a key component that influences hair follicle health and growth. Activated VDR leads to thicker, faster-growing hair. Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, activates VDR.A lowered capacity for vitamin D activation could lead to less circulating calcitriol and lower VDR activation. This theory connects low magnesium levels, responsible for efficient calcitriol activation, to hair loss.\n\n**Cures:**\n\n1. Sunshine\n2. Liver health is very important. Liver secretes Bile, bile is important to stimulate vitamin D receptors. Eat sulphur rich food (like MSM) and taurine to make liver healthy\n3. If vitamin D3 is not correcting your D3 levels, you need B12, Magnesium, Boron, Quercetin, flavonoids, Gamma tocopherol (sub unit of vitamin E), Curcumin and Ginger, Green tea, intensive exercise\n4. **Leaky Gut, Gut Microbiome, and Sebum Overload:**\n\n**Cause:** Sebum acts as hydrolipid layer (waterproofing), and prevents loss of nutrients, natural oils, and protects against pollutants. A leaky gut allows toxins to infiltrate the bloodstream, leading to *altered host response*, and triggering sebaceous gland overproduction. This excess sebum clogs follicles, suffocating hair growth, prevents nutrients from reaching hair follicle andcCuts oxygen supply to hair follicle. It’s also called epidermal plaque. Gut is connected to liver via portal vein, and so an unhealthy gut also implies an unhealthy liver. If liver is unhealthy, chances of metabolic syndrome is high. It is seen that people with metabolic syndrome have extreme active sebaceous glands. High Sebum is also correlated with high DHT. Elevated Propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes) has been seen in bald scalp areas, which is also linked to gut issues.\n\n*Anecdotes on Faecal Matter Transplant (FMT) curing MPB, you can’t have a double blind placebo controlled study on this one*\n\n**Cures:**\n\n1. Heal the gut with stress reduction,\n2. Remove gluten and dairy,\n3. Embrace fermented foods.\n4. Topically, use Topical Ketoconzole + zinc shampoos and apple cider vinegar to dissolve sebum.\n5. Probiotics and Prebiotics\n6. Oral Shatavari Root contains quercetin, naringenin, and p-coumaric acid, and reduces steroid 5-alpha reductase gene (SRD5A) expression and lowers sebum production.\n7. Frankincense oral reduces bacteria / fungi and inflammation\n8. Vitamin K2\n9. Nattokinase , kimchi\n10. &#x200B;\n11. **Fibrosis and Calcification of Arteries:**\n\n**Cause:**  Perifollicular fibrosis (or scar tissue) OR excessive cross-linkage of collagen leads to **tight scalp**, and calcium deposits restrict blood flow, both hindering hair growth. Fibrosis is caused by Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEP), which is causes by insulin insensitivity. Zinc deficiency can lead to increased leucine and hydroxyl l-leucine, which are part of amino acid lysine which takes part in collagen formation. Increased leucine and hydroxyl l-leucine can lead to fibrosis\n\n**Cures:**\n\na. Combat with micro-needling (also increases SULT1 sulfotransferase which is a stimulant), improved insulin sensitivity through diet and exercise\n\nb. Insulin sensitivity can be cured with Baikal skullcap\n\nc. Minerals like zinc to decrease lysine and magnesium to boost blood flow and address calcification.\n\nd. Anti-fibrotic agents like taurine, serrapeptase and pirfenidone\n\ne. Fat grafting is also another proven method to grow hair\n\nf. Topical Sildenafil (Viagra) for blood vessels\n\ng. Botox Injections to scalp for fibrosis\n\nh. Topical Rosemary Oil for blood vessels\n\ni. Topical Sildenafil (Viagra) increases blood flow to scalp\n\nj. Topical Adenosine dilates blood vessels, increasing blood flow.\n\nk. Topical Caffeine for blood vessels\n\nl. PLATELET-RICH PLASMA (PRP) works by improving follicle vascularization\n\nm. Hyaluronic acid provides moisture to the skin from inside\n\nn. **Dexpanthenol** (**oral** and **topical**) is a precursor of vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It works as a moisturizer, improving skin hydration and elasticity. It also activates fibroblast proliferation, which is important in wound healing. It also increases vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression in dermal papilla cells. It also increases SULT1A1 (sulfotransferase, which is like a stimulant)\n\n7. **Nutritional Deficiencies:**\n\n**Causes:** Selenium, zinc, vitamin C, and iron are hair's essential allies. Selenium fuels antioxidant defences, zinc regulates oil production and inhibits 5α-reductase, vitamin C aids iron absorption, scalp circulation, and in formation of VEGF, and iron nourishes hair follicles. Iron is a cofactor for RNR, which is important for cell growth. Also hair follicle acts as site of storage of iron in the form of ferritin. Hair growth will be compromised in iron deficiency, and you won’t see iron deficiency. But iron supplementation is dangerous. So take iron through vegan foods only, like Moringa. Vitamin C and Vitamin A enhance absorption of iron. Need highly acidic stomach to absorb iron better, so consume ACV before each meal.\n\nHistidine deficiency was observed in > 90% of AGA,\n\nLeucine deficiency in 100% of AGA\n\nAlanine deficiency in 91.18% of AGA\n\n**Cures:** Fill your plate with diverse fruits, vegetables, and supplements of copper, iron, zinc, B vitamins, D, selenium\n\n8. **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease:**\n\n**Causes:** Excess histamine aka allergic history aka rhinitis aka sinusitis likely means liver issues. This silent enemy disrupts hormone balance and metabolism, impacting hair growth. Address histamine imbalances through diet and consider supporting liver health. The liver removes hormones and toxins from our bodies including free testosterone and DHT. If it starts to underperform, levels of these hormones rise\n\n**Cures:**\n\n1. Silymarin (milk thistle), kutki\n2. If lot of mucus is accompanying hair loss take NAC to loosen the mucous and Anu taila through nose to aid the liver\n3. Oral Aloe vera is great for liver\n4. &#x200B;\n5. **Hormonal Imbalances:**\n\n**Causes:**\n\na. DHT binds to androgen receptors in hair follicles, causing them to shrink\n\nb. The oil glands (sebaceous glands) are like little workshops that can make both estrogen (E2) and androgens (like T and DHT). They do this using a special enzyme called aromatase. The aromatase enzyme converts androgens into E2, boosting its levels in the area. E2 binds to its receptors on the hair follicles, and extend the anagen (growth) phase. E2 can lower the production of DHT, and also increase its own production by ramping up aromatase activity. The hair follicles are like the control centers. They have receptors that listen to signals from both E2 and androgens. If E2 signalling is more potent it remain in anagen phase and if androgens are more in the microenvironment then it enters thinning and shedding.\n\nc. Thyroid hormone (T3 n T4) imbalances can cause alterations in the hair growth cycle.\n\nd. Increased cortisol levels can cause hair follicles to enter the telogen (resting) phase\n\ne. The liver removes hormones and toxins from our bodies including free testosterone and DHT. If it starts to underperform, levels of these hormones rise\n\nf. ***Insulin resistance:*** Hormonal profile of men with AGA and that of women with PCOS is very similar. Major cause of PCOS is insulin resistance\n\ng. Decreased dopamine levels lead to increased GnRH secretion,\n\nh. Deficiencies in iron, vitamins like B6 and B12, and certain amino acids, **chronic stress**, oxidative stress can all lead to decrease in dopamine synthesis by the hypothalamus, Dopamine directly inhibits prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland. When dopamine levels decline, this inhibitory effect weakens, leading to increased prolactin.\n\nWhy do so many people who are addicted to masturbation also see hair loss? People who are depressed have really low levels of dopamine, and these people masturbate a lot (binge eat, eat high sugar foods), to get the experience of dopamine surge for momentary relief from the depression. The excess masturbation does not in itself cause the hair loss, but does lead to Zinc deficiency, and also increased prolactin – both of which cause hair loss. Plus, as one loses hair he gets more depressed and the vicious cycle repeats itself.\n\n**Cures:**\n\na. **Ashwagandha**, meditation, and **L-ornithine** can help manage cortisol\n\nb. **Shatavri** to increase estrogen in males\n\nc. Consume sprouted **fenugreek** to safely increase estrogen in the body\n\nd.\n\n10. **Oxidative Stress:**\n\n**Causes:** Free radicals, the villains in this story, damage hair follicles. Increased ROS causes increase in TGFβ-1, leading to fibrosis, and also inhibits hair follicle function. ROS also leads to Altered immune response.\n\n**Cures:**\n\n1. Boost level of intrinsic antioxidants like – Glutathione peroxidase which depends on **selenium (Brazil nuts)**, and Catalase and Superoxide dismutase depends of **copper and zinc.**\n2. Antioxidants like vitamin D3, omega-3 oils\n3. Red light therapy\n4. Topical melatonin\n5. Remove pollutants, smoking etc., which cause ROS\n6. Astaxanthin\n7. Oral Tocotrienol / Vitamin E complex acts as an antioxidant\n8. Guava leaf extract acts as antioxidant and blocks DHT\n9. Resveratrol\n10. **Genetics:**\n\n**Causes:** The enzyme 5α-reductase converts testosterone and some DHEA (adrenal steroid) to DHT. High levels of 5α-reductase and high levels of free testosterone lead to increased DHT. Interestingly, MPB patients also have **low total testosterone but high free testosterone. In regular people, most testosterone is bound to SHBG (sex hormone-binding globulin) and some to albumin, leaving only a small portion as free testosterone.**\n\n**The ideal approach to prevent hair loss would be to increase bound testosterone by raising SHBG and albumin levels. Albumin is linked to liver health and thyroid health**. High free testosterone increases TGF Beta 2, leading to hair follicle shrinkage and hair loss. DHT also triggers\n\nhair follicle cell death and regression through DKK-1.\n\nThyroid disorders, liver diseases, or insulin resistance lower SHBG production. Estrogen increases SHBG synthesis.\n\n**Cures:**\n\n1. Eat fiber and reduce sugar to raise SHBG.\n2. High sugar and dairy intake might increase 5α-reductase activity.\n3. DHT blockers like saw palmetto and pumpkin seed oil,\n4. Maintaining a healthy omega-3 to omega-6 ratio,\n5. Avoiding trans-fats\n6. Liver health\n7. Spironolactone acts as a competitive inhibitor of androgen receptors, particularly for DHT, it also inhibits the enzyme 5α-reductase\n8. Topical **ALFATRADIOL** aka estrogen/indirect anti androgen. Alfatradiol acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme 5α-reductase. Approved for female pattern hair loss\n9. Topical FLURIDIL 2% blocks AR receptors\n10. Topical Rice bran oil (RBO) blocks 5α-reductase\n11. Pygeum africanum  contains compounds ike atraric acid and N-butylbenzene-sulfonamide which act as antagonists (cling to) of the human AR receptors\n12. Astaxanthin also lowers DHT\n13. Topical and Oral Mango leaf Juice which lowers DKK1 which reduces DHT\n14. Onion Extract / Black Seed Oil block DHT\n15. &#x200B;\n16. Growth Stimulants: These are items which stimulate hair growth by promoting differentiation and initiation of anagen phase and/or increasing the activity of hair follicle stem cells.\n17. Vitamin D3\n18. Topical REDENSYL\n19. Topical Stemoxydine\n20. 12 grams MSM per day along with 3 grams of vitamin c as it helps absorption of MSM. MSM is thought to either promote the conversion of telogen to anagen or lengthen anagen, mainly due to the deliverance of sulphur to the middle layer of the hair\n21. &#x200B;\n\n**Final Downstream Micro level Cause of Hair Fall which is caused by a combination of all or some of the factors above**\n\n**Micro-inflammation** at the dermal papilla of hair follicle – increased IL-1Alpha and IL-1Beta. At a micro level inflammation leads to decreased PGE2 and increased PGD2. Hallmarks of inflammation include decreased blood supply at the root of hair follicle and cut-off of nutrient and oxygen supply.\n\n**Cures:**\n\na. Colourful fruits and vegetables rich in quercetin and kaempferol\n\nb. Green tea's EGCG\n\nc. Topical Diclofenac\n\nd. Topical CBD - Hemp Extract\n\ne. Topical Turmeric oil\n\nf. **Topical Cetirizine** is a well-tolerated antihistamine with anti-inflammatory effect, reduces PGD2 that inhibits hair growth and increases PGE2 that promotes it\n\ng. Topical Adenosine suppresses inflammation\n\nh. Topical Stemoxydine reduces PGD2\n\ni. Hair follicles express specific receptors for PGF2α (prostaglandin), called FP receptors. PGF2α attaches to these receptors and promotes inflammation around the hair follicle. **Latanoprost** and **Bimatoprost** are a prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) analogues, meaning it mimics the structure of PGF2α and binds to FP receptors and leads to Increased nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) production which increase blood flow to follicle. PGF2α and its analogs plays the same role, just that Latanoprost and Bimatoprost are more potent in doing the job. But Latanoprost and Bimatoprost are needed in high concentration and cost is prohibitive.\n\nj. Topical Methyl Vanillate activates the WNT/β-catenin pathway aka reduces inflammation in scalp\n\nk. VPA inhibits an enzyme called GSK-3β, which in turn triggers the Wnt/β-catenin pathway\n\nl. Alantolactone suppresses inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress\n\nm. Oral Tocotrienol / Vitamin E complex acts as an anti-inflammatory\n\nn. Topical Fresh Aloe Vera (with or without skin) accelerates wound healing and has shown great results anecdotally. Potential inflammation killer.\n\no. Ecklonia Cava regulates both antioxidative and anti-inflammatory processes\n\n**Liquorice Tea -- Herb with multiple impact** : As an adrenal tonic, it improves energy & stress tolerance. It aids wound healing, is anti-inflammatory, and builds moisture. It is estrogenic, anti-testosterone, anti-oxytocic & anti-prolactin.\n\nThere are many more such herbs.. please add guys!\n\n**Remember, Patience is Key:** Hair growth is a marathon, not a sprint.

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Avène Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I could barely open them in broad daylight, and I had to go back home and wash my face to get it off. Do not, under any circumstances apply this close to your eyes.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn’t that bad of a sunscreen, but it’s also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn’t enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me. It might not have worked for my face, but it’s still a good sunscreen for the rest of the body.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Skinnies Sungel SPF30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, broad spectrum, PA++++ (PPD 16+)**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you’re pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick.

These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl. OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **Sweden**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** Aqua. Butane. Octocrylene. Propylene glycol. Palmitic acid. Diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate. Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane. VP / Hexadecene copolymer. Stearic acid. Isobutane. Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine. PVP. Ethylhexyl Triazone. Polysorbate 20. Triethanolamine. Hydrolyzed silk. Hydrolyzed Collagen. Tocopheryl acetate. Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate Glycerin. Dimethicone. Propane.\n* \\- **UV filters (organic):** Octocrylene (UVB, short wave UVA), Uvinul A Plus (UVA), Avobenzone (UVA), Tinosorb S (UVB and UVA), Uvinul T 150 (UVB)\n* \\- **Pros:** Excellent UV protection, 5 Boots stars, very water resistant, hydrating texture, antioxidants\n* \\- **Cons:** Difficult to measure amount of sunscreen, some stickiness when overapplied\n* \\- **Review:** This is my Holy grail sunscreen. I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants. I’m already on my third bottle of EVY, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5\n\nSome sunscreens I’ve heard good things about and might want to try one day: Anessa sunscreens, Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++, Ultrasun sunscreens, Bioderma Photoderm Max Cream SPF50+.",

UVA rating so the PPA / PPD factor should be around 27.. which is higher than most SPF50s, I'm sure!

    "body": "Hi y'all! I just wanted to share two tips that have worked for me that could work for more people!\n\nFirst of all, avoid hot water at all costs! Hot water disrupts the skin barrier and leads to water loss from deeper layers in the skin. This is called transepidermal water loss and it happens because hot water increases the speed of water evaporation from the skin. The hotter the water the more you lose. When the scalp is not hydrated, the barrier becames compromised with cracks and gaps that allow for the metabolites of Malassezia to penetrate the skin and cause inflamation (and therefore flackling of the skin). Hot water can also alter the microbiome of the scalp and lead to a higher proportion of Malassezia. \n\n\nMy second tip is a product, Neutrogena T gel fort (the orange one and not the transparent). It has piroctone olamine and salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is a chemical exfoliant and gets rid of all the flakes. Piroctone olamine has antifungal and antiinflammatory properties.\n\n\nHope these tips help you guys as much as they've helped me!! Good luck! \n\nAlso, I'm not native in English so I apologise in advance for any mistakes. ",

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30974011/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30974011/)\n\nii. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17902730/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17902730/)\n\niii. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3771854/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3771854/)\n\n  d. Pro’s:\n\ni. Relatively inexpensive and safe prescription product commonly prescribed by doctors\n\nii. May enhance sulfotransferase enzymes to convert minoxidil to minoxidil sulphate in scalp\n\niii. Can be commonly compounded into topical minoxidil preparations by pharmacies\n\n  e. Con’s:\n\ni. Can be irritating to the skin, but usually the irritation goes away with continued use\n\nii. Daytime use could cause scalp redness because of increased sensitivity to the sun\n\niii. Does this cause long term fibrosis of hair follicles, or could it cause hair loss in some people?\n\n7.) Latanoprost\n\n  a. Prostaglandin F2 alpha upregulator\n\n  b. Glaucoma medication that can be concentrated to higher concentrations by compounding   \n  pharmacies in the U.S.\n\n  c. Research:\n\ni. [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(11)00601-3/fulltext](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(11)00601-3/fulltext)\n\nii. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20028444/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20028444/)\n\n  d. Pro’s:\n\ni. FDA approved drug (Xalatan) for glaucoma; off label use for hair loss\n\nii. Xalatan (0.005%) grows eyelashes in most glaucoma patients\n\niii. Personal experience shows it works on scalp when concentrated at 0.1% (20 times Xalatan). I had   \na major “dread shed”.\n\niv. Patents have expired so some compounding pharmacies will make it\n\n  e. Con’s:\n\ni. Expensive\n\nii. Most pharmacies will not compound it\n\niii. No long term studies on safety and efficacy\n\n8.) Bimatoprost\n\n  a. Prostaglandin F2 alpha upregulator (similar to latanoprost)\n\n  b. Latisse FDA approved for eyelash growth (also works on eyebrows off label)\n\n  c. Some compounding pharmacies may be able to concentrate it enough where it works on the scalp,   \n  however there may be still some patents on the drug, prohibiting generic manufacturers from   \n  making the drug more affordable.\n\n  d. I used this personally on my hair line (0.03% generic Vistitan) for 3 months and it made no   \n  difference. Allergan’s studies showed that concentrations 10x – 30x were needed to get significant   \n  scalp hair growth.\n\n9.)  Adenosine\n\n  a. Brand name Adenogen by Shiseido sold (over the counter?) in Japan: [https://www.shiseido.co.jp/sw/c/products/SWFG070410.seam?shohin\\_pl\\_c\\_cd=681501&online\\_shohin\\_ctlg\\_kbn=1](https://www.shiseido.co.jp/sw/c/products/SWFG070410.seam?shohin_pl_c_cd=681501&online_shohin_ctlg_kbn=1)\n\n  b.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25925959/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25925959/)\n\niii. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26508659/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26508659/)\n\n  c. Pro’s:\n\ni. Multiple studies show efficacy in AGA for men and women; studies appear to be decent\n\nii. Alcohol based solution that dries quickly (based on personal use)\n\niii. Some generic brands may be available\n\niv. May be similar to Liposomal ATP, which is used by some well regarded hair transplant surgeons to   \nspeed up grafts growth post surgery\n\n  d. Cons:\n\ni. May be difficult to source outside Japan\n\nii. Relatively expensive\n\niii. Shiseido product has a mint type fragrance that may be unappealing to some people\n\niv. Shiseido product has a large bottle which makes application challenging\n\nv. I have tried getting pharmacies to compound this into minoxidil preparations without success.\n\n10.) Phenylephrine\n\n  a. Traction alopecia treatment; causes “goose bumps” (activates erector pili muscles) to prevent hair   \n  loss during washing, brushing or other traction\n\n  b. Sold as “INTACT” brand by Daniel Alain company: [https://www.danielalain.com/pages/retain](https://www.danielalain.com/pages/retain)\n\n  c. Research studies:\n\ni. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29193553/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29193553/)\n\nii. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26678522/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26678522/)\n\n  d. Pro’s:\n\ni. Good research behind it, with multiple studies; quality of researchers is excellent (i.e. hair loss dermatologists Dr. Jerry Shapiro and Dr. Rodney Sinclair)\n\nii. Only needs to be applied to scalp for ½ hour before activation occurs (can be washed out soon   \nafter)\n\niii. Reasonable cost\n\niv. Derived from natural ingredient (Seville orange extract); probably safe for long term use\n\nv. I have personally used this before getting a haircut and it definitely works as stated.\n\n  e. Con’s:\n\ni. May inhibit penetration of other topicals to the hair follicle so maybe only a good treatment before   \nhair cuts or styling (e.g. before hair piece application).\n\nii. Has propanediol (natural version of propylene glycol) so leaves hair with greasy texture\n\n11.) Methyl Vanillate\n\n  a. WNT pathway activator\n\n  b. Sold as WNT/Act and Deltacrin WNT brands\n\n  c. Research:\n\ni. Only one small study shows benefit in Female AGA: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27121450/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27121450/)\n\n  d. Potentially used by Dr. John Cole’s hair restoration clinic (Forhair). Dr. Cole is one of the pioneers in   \n  follicular unit excision (FUE) surgery: [https://www.forhair.com/news/wnt-act-forhair-s-new-patented-cell-activator-hair-spray/](https://www.forhair.com/news/wnt-act-forhair-s-new-patented-cell-activator-hair-spray/)\n\n  e. Pro’s:\n\ni. Derived from natural ingredients\n\nii. Potentially up to 7% increase in hair density\n\niii. Works differently than minoxidil and finasteride, so theoretically can be stacked with those   \ntreatments\n\n  f. Con’s:\n\ni. Relatively expensive\n\nii. May contain propylene glycol\n\n12.) Redensyl\n\n  a. Obscure Growth stimulant\n\n  b. Research is biased: [https://www.redenhair.com/en/content/15-redensyl?adtoken=f7d28ab47a96dd99a3aca6fcd3cff64b&ad=administra&id\\_employee=2](https://www.redenhair.com/en/content/15-redensyl?adtoken=f7d28ab47a96dd99a3aca6fcd3cff64b&ad=administra&id_employee=2)\n\n  c. I found an inexpensive version from The Ordinary for around $10 a bottle. The product is greasy.   \n  Even if it does not work, you will not be out of pocket much money.\n\n13.) GroMD Follicle Activator Spray\n\n  a. Appears to be a combination of natural ingredients formulated by Dr. Amir Yazdan, who is a   \n  legitimate hair restoration doctor in the U.S. [https://gro.md/collections/all/products/gromd-minoxidil-boost](https://gro.md/collections/all/products/gromd-minoxidil-boost)\n\n  b. “Endorsed” by Spencer Stevenson (Spexhair), one of few credible consumer information resources   \n  in androgenetic alopecia. [https://www.spexhair.com/products-for-hair-loss/](https://www.spexhair.com/products-for-hair-loss/)\n\n  c. Relatively expensive, contains propylene glycol\n\n  d. Some anecdotal claims, may help reduce grey hair\n\n  e. Not sure how much shampoo and conditioner would help, if at all\n\n14.) Minoxidil derivatives - Probably not worth looking into, as they appear similar to minoxidil, but weaker and with less evidence behind them.\n\n  a. Nanoxidil\n\n  b. Aminexil\n\n  c. Copexil?\n\n15.) Other topical products with some anti-hair loss claims, but with limited research and not detailed in this compendium:\n\n  a. Melatonin\n\n  b. Valproic Acid\n\n  c. Progesterone\n\n  d. Azelaic Acid\n\n  e. Piroctone Olamine (shampoo)\n\n  f. Spironalactone\n\n  g. Sandalore\n\n  h. Cetirizine\n\n  i. Castor Oil\n\n  j.

It was the only thing that helped defeat my scalp eczema until the EU stupidly forbid its usage in March 2022, even though not long before that they had deemed the it still safe for shampoo useage. For decades zinc pyrithione was used in shampoos that combat scalp eczema / seborrheic dermatitis / dandruff. After the ban, pretty much every manufacturer switched to Piroctone Olamine.\n\nPierre Fabre Ducray Kelual DS in its original formulation (white creamy version) was about the only thing that *instantly* helped and usually within three washes the scalp eczema was gone for weeks. But with the  switch to Piroctone Olamine instead of zinc pyrithione (clear formula) it completely stopped working, and in fact creates a thick layer of flaking instead, aggravating the scalp further.\n\nMy life quality is down the tubes as my scalp itches and flakes again. Does anyone know where I can still get a shampoo that contains 1-2% zinc pyrithione? Any advice where to order or even mix it myself is very welcome.",

I recall I was in the bathroom having a shower and was staring at the bottle of H&S and saw a small print on the front of the bottle label that said \"new improved formula\" and was like 'hang on a minute, could this be why I'm going through itchy scalp hell right now!'\n\nAfter a lot of reading around I found out about the EU zinc P regulation malarky and figured it all out. Back in 2020, the big UK supermarkets own brand anti-dandruff shampoos still had the Zinc P in them, so I bought those instead for a way cheaper price than H&S, and they worked just as good as the old formula H&S! (I recall cursing myself for wasting so much money on the brand name H&S over the past 2 decades haha)\n\nI then noticed that the supermarkets were also gradually changing their formula over to the Piroctone Olamine (which is worse than useless for seborrheic dermatitis, no matter what the so called studies claim).\n\nLuckily I found out that the Boots own brand version was still for sale with zinc P in it, and bought about 50 bottles of it from their website (no joke), as that's how bad it feels when you have seborrheic dermatitis but don't have the zinc P shampoo in play. As you said with your remark about reduced quality of life, seborrheic dermatitis left un-treated will very quickly make you wish that you were never born.\n\nI hope you found some ZP shampoo and have resolved that miserable, sleep stealing itch.",

It has very terrible anti dandruff efficacy. Right out of the shower the scalp would start flaking. This is horrendous. However, since I live in Vietnam and not Europe, there are many other Zinc pyrithione shampoo still hanging around. If you can smuggle those to your country, that will be great. Otherwise I think it's time to cozy up to medicated shampoo or Climbazole + PO , salicylic acid + PO combo. Things like garnier, nivea or eucerin have those combination.",

An inch or two shorter than classic length (Aka mid butt length hair), High Porosity\n* **Hair concerns:** Split ends, normal amount of hairfall, prone to frizz, can look dry and damaged if I don't take care of it.\n* **Scalp type:** Normal, I think. Gets oily 2nd day night or 3rd day morning after hairwash\n* **Scalp concerns:** I don't use any product on my scalp but I feel like it's prone to build up and if I don't use an anti-dandruff shampoo every few washes, I get CCs on my forehead. Whatever causes my CCs are particularly invisible but my then derm insisted it was dandruff and following her regimen did get rid of the CCs without any skincare topical or prescription.\n* **Age/age range** \\- 25 to 35\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Current Haircare routine:**\n\n1. Pre Shampoo - Some homemade oil concoction (I add a lot of tiny oil bottles, I needed to empty, so I just mixed them all together.) or Plum Avocado Hair Mask\n2. Anti dandruff - Scalpe pro (I got L'oreal pure clay a while ago, to see if that will work instead of this, but haven't fully tested it out yet)\n3. Scalp shampoo - Alpecin Double Effect\n4. Length of the hair - Dove hydrating shampoo for curly hair (early days, haven't formed any impression yet.)\n5. Protein conditioner - Plum Olive and Macadamia Hair Mask (as and when necessary)\n6. Conditioner - Garnier Hair Food Papaya variant or Banana variant ( I like Papaya way better than banana, but neither of them are worth full price and Im still mourning the discontinuation of Matrix biolage purple cap)\n\nI've reviewed quite a few of the products I use, including Alpecin [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/vqot48/my_current_haircare_routine_reviews_reequil/), but Alpecin deserves its own review.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Climatic conditions under which the product was tested:** All. Summer, What passes for winter in the south, Monsoon.\n* **Usage timeline:** 1.5 years atleast. Almost done with my second bottle. And I've purchased it in Mid-September, this bottle has lasted me 8 months.\n* **Ingredient List:** [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n* **Price:** MRP 699 for 200 ml. Never seen this on discount. :(\n* **Texture, Consistency details:** Normal shampoo consistency, A blueish grey colour, so definitely added colour. You can see a hit of the colour and consistency [here](https://imgur.com/CVTsVhO.jpg)\n* **Fragrance:** HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n* **Usage:** I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply **on scalp only (Never below nape)**. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp. If I've oiled twice, I shampoo twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Effect on hair issues and result of using the product:** Shiny frizz free hair, but definite loss of volume. If I had to use 1 word to describe it \"sleek\".\n* **Experience and thoughts in detail:**\n\n***Old Review, copied from my previous post and slightly edited***\n\nThis shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation.\n\nAlpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (obvious conflict of interests. I remember reading the study but can only find the [abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17396054/) now) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit this for it. Maybe it'll work for others but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Updated Review***\n\nBarely anything to update if I'm honest. I stand by everything I said above, and they still hold true.\n\nAbout hairfall, I definitely don't think it helps. SO still thinks it helps, but acknowledges that he likes the user experience of it so much that he may be biased. Don't trust him.\n\nIn 2018, the UK Advertising Standards Authority ruled that caffeine shampoo Alpecin must no longer advertise that it can \"help to reduce hair loss\" as there was no adequate evidence to support the claim.  ***I definitely don't recommend buying this hoping it'll cure your hairfall issues.***\n\nThe main reason, I wanted to re-review this, is to post [this video](https://imgur.com/pt98TCe)\n\nI took these too [Pic 1](https://imgur.com/Sb7u13B.jpg), [Pic 2](https://imgur.com/fZMkSHb.jpg), but even though they are from back cam, quality is super bad. The video is a decent representation of what it looks like.  I'll update this post with better pics when I'm able to take them.\n\n**Other things to add**\n\n* The whole time I used Alpecin, I also used Scalpe pro. ie I used scalpe pro every few washes most of the year, but peak summer and winter or if I see signs of CCs, I used it every single wash and followed it up with Alpecin.  So every wash I used Alpecin but every few washes I used Scalpe pro + Alpecin.\n* u/santa96 has commented below that it didn't work for them, so I was running over possibilities. And one theory is the AD shampoo was actually stripping than I thought (I have used it alone, only for experimenting / testing purposes.  I originally thought it wasn't as stripping as most other AD shampoos but still drying compared to regular shampoos. Which is why I followed it up with Alpecin. But it could be that continued usage, caused dryness and the protein in the Alpecin was immediate damage control and THAT's why I love it so much.\n* This is just a hypothesis and is of now, untested. But my scalpe pro is almost over and I should know in a couple of months if I right.\n* Anyone for now, I obviously need to test it out under more conditions. This review is moot. I mean I still love it, but it needs to have more information for anyone else to judge if it'll work for you and I currently don't have that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ETA on 10/02/24: \n\nI had previously tagged this as OP-ED because I wanted to test out the following.\n\na) If I use Alpecin with no stripping products will it cause protein overload\n\nAnswer: No. It doesn't. 9 months later I still use Alpecin every single wash.\n\n* I've used it with the following variables affecting it\n   * Oiled hair\n   * Oiled hair + Clarifying shampoo (Loreal Pure Clay)\n   * Oiled hair + Normal shampoo (Loreal Hyaluronic acid)\n   * Unoiled hair\n   * Unoiled hair + Normal shampoo (Loreal Hyaluronic acid)\n\nand no protein overload. In fact except for a couple of months in the middle where I damaged my hair in beach vacations, my hair is way way way more healthier now than it was before.\n\nb) If I use it with a garden variety clarifying shampoo instead of a stripping anti-dandruff shampoo, will I still rave about it.\n\nAnswer: Yes. I would and I am. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Anything that you think others might find a con:** Price probably\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Holy Grail, Forever repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "I couldn't find a previous post about this, so I wanted to share in case anyone else uses this moisturizer.  \n\nThe newer red-top version of this cream has a different ingredients list than the blue-top version. There are a lot of upset reviews on their website and Amazon specifically regarding the formula change. Also, make sure you read the ENTIRE ingredients list when you buy a product because roughly the first half of these two formulas are the same. When I noticed the different bottle, I expected a formula change, but I only compared about half the ingredients and thought I was buying the same product.  I should have known better but won't be making that mistake again!  \n\n**Older, blue-top formula:** Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Palmitate, Mineral Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Octyldodecanol, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Colloidal Oatmeal, Dimethicone, PEG-40 Stearate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, DMDM Hydantoin, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben  \n\n**Newer, red-top formula:** Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Palmitate, Mineral Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Octyldodecanol, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Colloidal Oatmeal, Dimethicone, Methylpropanediol, PEG-40 Stearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Piroctone Olamine, Carbomer, Benzyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Decylene Glycol  \n\nI bought the new version about a week ago and only just realized why my skin has gotten so upset lately. I have rosacea and relied on this as a HG moisturizer for body AND face for the last couple years. The new formula burns my skin and makes my face flaky and red all day. It essentially makes my rosacea worse. My biggest concern, though, is that it makes some parts of my body red...areas that have never caused me ANY sensitivity issues before. Weird. Some other reviews mentioned that it isn't moisturizing at all because it doesn't sink in and that it has a weird smell, both of which I can attest to as well.  \n\nI just wanted to throw this out there in case anyone else uses this product or was considering it. I still HIGHLY recommend the blue-top version if you happen to find it somewhere, but this new red version was awful for me and apparently many others. Also, read the entire ingredients lists when you're comparing formulas!",

    "body": "Hi guys, hope all is well. I have been reading this thread for a while and decided it was time for me to sign up and get involved as I know 1st hand how mentally scarring this disease can be. I'll try not to babble on too much but I'll give a brief description of my experience with seb derm, followed by what I feel works & what you should/shouldn't do.\n\nI am a 32 year old male that lives in Manchester, England. Ive never had the best skin but first started having an issue with Seb Derm when I was about 28. I put this down to 1 of 2 things - I had my 1st tattoo when I was 28 & was due to get married later that year. I dont see any reason why having a tattoo would bring on seb derm but find it strange that it seemed to occur at approximately the same time. Probably just purely a coincidence but I dont know. I'd imagine the stress of arranging a wedding was a more mitigating factor. \n\nI have been diagnosed off 3 separate doctors & dermatologists that I have Seb Derm & having done my own research I am 100% certain this is the condition I have. I have a few small patches on my scalp and on my ears/around my nose, but the worst is on my forehead/t zone.\n\nIve tried all the shampoos and creams you can think of. You name it I've tried it. It's been that bad at times that I've actually cried. In my case, the condition seems to flare up alot worse in winter. Why, I have no idea but this seems to be the case for most people. However for the last 6 weeks or so I would describe myself as having this condition completely under control - for the 1st time in a long time - whether this is because of the routine I am about to go through with you, or because of the slightly warmer weather we are now having remains to be seen.\n\nThe 1st piece of advice I will give is this :- HOT WATER IS AN ABSOLUTE NO GO. I still have hot showers but do not touch my face or head with hot water. To wash my hair/face I only use cold water. In my experience it doesnt have to be freezing, just as long as it is \"cold\". Also do not spend too long in a hot shower as steam will go on your face & have a similar effect to hot water! I am not a doctor so I dont know exactly why this makes things 10 times worse, but for me it does, so dont do it.\n\nWhile in the shower, i use 2 antifungal shampoos together, literally - i squirt a small amount from 2 separate bottles of shampoo, lather up & leave on for 5/10 minutes. The shampoos I use are Tesco's own brand containing Zinc Pyrithione, and the other is Bioderma Node P shampoo, which contains Climbazole (1 of the only shampoos that contain this active ingredient). It is possible 1 of the shampoos could be working on its own but together they seem to be doing the job so dont want to tempt fate & risk a flare up! The Bioderma also contains Piroctone Olamine & Salylictic acid which is only a positive in my eyes. The more active ingredients the better. I do this EVERY MORNING. The reason behind me mixing these 2 shampoos is because I read an article on dandruff deconstructed that stated zinc & climbazole had proved to be highly successful when used together. And thus far I havnt been able to find a shampoo that contains both together so i literally just use 2 separate shampoos with those ingredients. I would also like to add that Ketaconazole and and a few other antifungal shampoos made my condition worse.\n\nAfter getting out the shower I try to dry my face & hair (I have normal length hair for a bloke) relatively quickly, mostly with a towel but also with a hairdryer because as we all know fungus loves moist environments. I do not scrub or rub hard, just gently but efficiently (this pressure also applies to how I apply the shampoo).\n\nHere in the UK I managed to get a bottle of Apple Cider Vinegar that contains raw honey (2 things people have had reasonable success with). I bought a squirty bottle & mixed the ACV & honey with water with a ratio of about 2:5. I also added abit of salt to the water which isnt going to do any harm. I squirt a tiny bit of the mixture onto my finger and rub in gently to the affected areas and let it dry. My face feels a little bit sticky due to the honey but in general its barely noticable. I do this 3 times a day - once just after the morning shower, once mid afternoon/tea time & once before bed. Might sound like a pain in the arse but it really isnt, literally takes me 10 seconds a time to do.\n\nMay I also just take this moment to stress that it's important not to use ingredients that are too strong for your skin. I understand it can be tempting to buy super strong shampoos or use ACV neat to try & \"kill\" the fungus, but unless you have skin like a rhino this is more likely to do more harm than good. \n\nThen finally, 1 more thing I admit I need to use in my routine - steroid cream. Yeah I know what you're thinking, but bare with me. It appears everyone is scared to death (myself included) of using these creams on the face in fear of thinning skin. If you actually read up on steroid creams you will find it is highly unlikely to suffer thinning skin unless you go absolutely over the top with it. What I have found is that my routine seems to work for about 4/5 days (depending on the weather or if I've been on the piss), and then I feel certain areas of my face/scalp are starting to become a little bit itchy, or the ACV starts to sting abit more than usual. This is when I use steroid cream to \"keep it at bay\". I use eumovate on my face once (yes you can use this on your face) and a slightly stronger 1 (betacap) on my scalp. The way I see it, you're better off using steroid cream once a week to keep it at bay, than not at all and have a horrendous flare up and have to use it twice a day for a week/10 days straight. If you are currently going through a bad flare up, just use the damn steroid cream to get it down. I have accepted that this is a lifelong condition that will not go away and I simply have to manage it. If using steroid cream once a week enables me to do so then so be it.\n\nI also recommend sun exposure. I feel going on the sunbed once every 10 days - 2 weeks has benefitted me. I wouldnt go on anymore than that due to fears of skin cancer/ageing but I am completely comfortable going on 2/3 times a month. Everything in moderation & all that. Having a slight tan will also make any unwanted redness less noticable. \n\nI do not use any moisturizers of any sort. I feel moisturizers along with oils made my skin 10 times worse. It completely baffles me when people appear/claim to have had success with oils in particular.\n\nI have tried changing my diet with no success. As a lad who likes my grub I personally found it unrealistic trying to cut out dairy/gluten as some have suggested.\n\nI also take an anti-histamine everyday - this should definitely help with any itchiness. I also take a zinc & vitamin D tablet every morning - I'm not convinced they do much to be honest, but they are certainly not going to do any harm. \n\nQuick word on Vitamin D - i am of the opinion that Vitamin D does have some part to play in this horrible condition - otherwise why would it flare up worse in the colder months? Interesting topic of debate that i think has been discussed in here before.\n\nSo to sum up :-\n\nNO HOT WATER\n\nShampoo with zinc & climbazole\n\nDry well\n\nACV/honey/salt water mix\n\nSteroid cream once a week or so\n\nSunbed\n\nAnti-histamine/zinc/vit D tablets\n\nAvoid moisturizers & oils \n\nI'm sure this routine won't work for some. Im not entirely convinced myself yet that it isn't just a change in the weather that's helped my seb derm. But since I started doing it 6 weeks ago I've been practically seb derm free for the 1st time in God knows how long so I'm going to stick with it. I know how badly this horrible disease can affect your self esteem so if just 1 person can take a few positives from this post and be in a better position to deal with it then job done. \n\nHappy to answer any questions\n\nPeace out guys, cheers for reading",

You are aware that sebderm is lifelong, but at the same time you are still endorsing steroid? Lifelong, steroid. It is just not sustainable for something that is already lifelong and has so many variables to bring it back into inflammation. And before you accuse me of mere fearmongering, i do end up with thin skin just by using steroid the way my dr prescribed it to me (only one month and never again, but thin skin still haunts me until about a year later). I could live with only thin skin, but that came with the package of itchy atopic dermatitis and weeping episodes to the point i had to quit my job since life is impossible when your face and neck wont stop oozing smelly shit. And that is just topical aspect of the side effect. The least important effect. Unless you cover all the variables, you cant guarantee your use of steroid wont be \"that much\". Lifelong, again. Yes the search can be draining, but choosing steroid over your organs is like cutting off your nose to spite the face. As you said, you know you have to maintain a routine since this lifelong, so why not choose a routine that is sustainable? \n\nOn the rest of your lifestyle change, you seemed to have a vague idea of what's working, so if you are interested to read more, please have a look on Dr. Jack Kruse on leaky gut syndrome.

Basically he endorsed people to fix such problem by fixing our diet and embracing the sun (an obvious caveat is not to get sunburn). We are more prone to fungus attack (like itchiness and sebderm) when we have poor gut health and low vitamin d level. He also suggested the use of antioxidants such as glutathione and vitamin c for such problem, but i honestly didnt read that part since i end up already following eczema publications that also suggested the very same thing.",

I bought a tub of coal tar ointment and it basically cleared up my whole face overnight...it was nothing short of amazing!  I was scared to use it at first bc it is an ointment and looks similar to Vaseline. Any oils I had attempted to use in the past only made things worse. I was worried I would wake up with a very angry face, but I was thrilled!  It took 20 years, but I finally found something that works. I know everyone is different and what works for one may not work for another, but if you haven’t tried coal tar yet I would suggest it. I bought a tub of this:\n     *MG217 Psoriasis extra strength 2% coal tar formula. It’s a 4oz tub and costs about $5 at any drug store. There are coal tar shampoos, lotions, and ointments. I have the ointment bc I get my sebderm on my face...looks like an angry goatee when I have a flare up. The only downside is the smell...it doesn’t smell great. I think it smells like a mechanic’s shop, or an “industrial” smell. However, it is not so bad that it makes me gag or anything...and I don’t notice the smell after having it on for a bit. My husband doesn’t smell it when laying next to me either, so it’s not overwhelming by any means. Plus, if it means clear skin with no itch, pain, flaking, or oozing, I’m all in!  I hope this helps someone...sebderm is the absolute worst! Especially when you can’t find anything that helps. There were times when I didn’t want to leave the house bc it was so bad. I was so happy to finally find something that worked...just wish I could have found it sooner!",

I wanted to post for anyone else that might be looking that there is finally a really good looking option in Canada.\n\n**Flexitol Scalp Relief Shampoo + Conditioner** (I found it at Rexal)\n\n\\-no fragrance, contains Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour (skin soothing, like Aveeno), Allantoin (also soothing), and an interesting compound called Piroctone Olamine that treats fungal issues like SD and dandruff.\n\nFor managing scalp issues I also found:\n\n**Psoriasin**.

    "body": "It’s likely that the [basic haircare regimen provided on this sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1km6dx/basic_haircare_guide/) will improve the health of your hair. To get it looking its absolute best however may require some additional care depending on your hair type and preferred hairstyle.      \nYour hair type, which is largely genetic, includes the shaft thickness, level of curl, shaft shape, moisture tendency/porosity, and number of hairs per unit area of your scalp (Robbins). Shaft thickness is what it sounds like, the diameter of your hair shaft. Thicker hair will tend to stand up to breakage better. Level of curl depends on the amino acid chain structure in your hair's cortex. Straight hair comes from straight chains, while curly hair has kinks and bends in the chains. Shaft shape determines how much light is reflected off the surface of the shaft and thus how shiny the hair looks naturally. East Asian hair is the roundest and reflects the most light, while black hair is naturally flatter and reflects the least. Moisture tendency is how well your hair maintains moisture and resists damage, which is impacted by your level of oil production and the thickness of your cuticle. Related, porosity is the degree to which water and product molecules can penetrate the cuticle layer, thereby making it easier to gain/lose moisture. Finally, number of hairs is the density of hair follicles on your scalp. The following are common problems that are due to a combination of unhealthy hair and hair type, along with our recommendations to start your pursuit of solving these problems:\n\n**Flat and thin** – volume has to do with your shaft thickness and follicle density. Dry hair shrinks in size, so giving your hair plenty of moisture will help plump up the shaft a little bit (Mainkar and Jolly). There isn’t much you can do about the density of follicles on your head, but some people do experience significant hair loss. In this case, refer to our [article on hair growth](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1km6la/growing_healthy_hair/) or speak with your doctor if the loss is significant. And while this doesn't affect the *actual* volume of your hair, root boosters stimulate the follicle or use product to make the hair stand up more, giving the illusion of more volume. Just watch out for products with ingredients with high bacisity/pH above about 8. Bases swell the hair by weakening the protein bond strength in your cortex, so while this gives you more volume it also weakens your hair. \n\n**Breaking** – Breakage happens when shaft strength is compromised and damaging agents are able to sever the protein bonds in your cortex. Avoiding [sources of damage](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1km6fx/hair_damage_sources_and_how_to_prevent_it/) reduces the chance of breakage, and conditioning will protect the hair and limit moisture loss. Silicone products can help bind together split ends (Sandhu, Ramachandran, and Robbins), but the use of these products should be paired with a clarifying shampoo. Regular shampoo doesn’t unbind silicone from the hair, and a buildup of this product at the follicle can reduce hair growth. The best way to prevent split ends from splitting all the way up the length of your hair is to get regular trims. Protein treatments can also make the hair stronger if it stretches a lot or feels mushy while wet.\n\n**Frizzy** - Frizz is primarily attributed to cuticle uplift, which causes breakage, moisture loss, and friction (Bellare, Iyer, Mainkar, and Jolly). Treat breakage as explained above. To address the cuticles, smoothing products that include fatty alcohols and silicones can help smooth the cuticle and make it look less frayed. Avoiding sources of damage, especially heat and sulfates, is also very helpful. Other causes of uplift are hard water, shampoos that are more basic than a pH of 6.5, and our hair's natural structure (porosity). \n\n**No shine** – To improve upon our natural tendency for shine, we can encourage the cuticle to lay flat (Bellare, Iyer, Mainkar, and Jolly). Heat makes it rise, which can be helpful when you want oil and water to penetrate to the cortex, but frequent blow drying and showering in very hot water can leave these cuticles standing up all day, as well as excessive brushing. Conditioning products address this issue (Rebenfeld, Weighmann, and Dansizer). Silicone products will also reflect more light. \n\n**Rough or brittle feel** – This is also an issue of raised cuticles or uneven cuticle surfaces due to breakage. Again, conditioning and reducing breakage agents are a good starting place to improving softness. \n\n**Won't hold a curl** - Ability to hold a curl (whether through heat or no heat styling), is a function of hair's elasticity (Beyak, Kass, and Meyer). Healthy, stronger hair will hold a curl better than damaged and dry hair. Some people's hair is just naturally more resistant to curl, however, depending on the shape and density of the cortex cells. Many people report that no-heat curls hold better than heated curls, especially if prepped with a styling spray beforehand and/or sprayed with hairspray afterwards. \n\n**Dandruff** - Some people are naturally predisposed to dandruff, which is the flaking of scalp skin. For others it is a reaction to skin irritation. To combat this problem, make sure there are no products you are using or food that you're eating that may cause irritation. Beyond that, shampoos that are designed for dandruff control are largely effective, especially ones containing piroctone olamine, salicylic acid, and/or zinc pyrithone (Lodén). Adding essential oils to your hair like chamomile, cedarwood, sage, eucalyptus, patchouli, rosemary, or ylang ylang to your shampoo and condition can also calm the scalp (*Essential Oils*). \n\n**Oily hair** - Oily hair is most often a symptom of over-washing, when the scalp produces excess oil to keep up with what is lost. If you are washing every day or every other day, try cutting down on your frequency (this requires an adjustment period of a couple weeks). Check also other sources that may be drying out your hair and scalp and causing the sebaceous glands to work in overdrive - things like hard water, products with alcohol, heat styling, etc. If oily hair continues, then this is a function of abnormal activity in the sebaceous glands. Some people report that adding lemon, lemongrass, patchouli, rosemary, tea tree, or ylang ylang essential oil to their shampoos and conditioners soothes this behavior (*Essential Oils*). As a latch ditch effort, excess oil in hair can be absorbed by dry shampoo. \n\n**Static** - Staticy hair is the result of electron transfer from the hair strand to some other object, making the hair more positively charged. This charged hair is attracted to the negatively charged object at the same time it repels other positively charged strands, making it stand up and annoyingly stick to things. Friction is the main perpetrator of this electron transfer, so damaged hair will tend to get more static (*Unexpected Properties of Hair*), but use of heat tools also increases the tendency of the hair to lose its electrons (*Pyroelectricity*). One solution to this problem is to apply leave in conditioners. These reduce friction in the hair strand by smoothing the cuticle, as give the hair strand more weight so there is more gravitational force for electrostatic effects to fight against. Another solution is to hydrate the hair and protect it from dryness, as static electricity is lower in the presence of water. \n\n------\n\n*cited sources:*\n\nBellare J, Iyer R, Mainkar A, Jolly C.

Potentially works differently than minoxidil, so the two treatments could be stacked\n\niv. Sinclair Dermatology (Professor Rodney Sinclair’s clinic) has reported success with the Kerastase Densifique brand of this product:\n\n[https://www.sinclairdermatology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Brochure-Male-Pattern-Hair-  Loss.pdf](https://www.sinclairdermatology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Brochure-Male-Pattern-Hair-Loss.pdf)\n\n[https://www.sbs.com.au/language/english/audio/professor-rodney-sinclair-hair-loss-costs-us-economically-physically-and-emotionally](https://www.sbs.com.au/language/english/audio/professor-rodney-sinclair-hair-loss-costs-us-economically-physically-and-emotionally)\n\n  f. Con’s:\n\ni. Not the best choice if you live or work with people sensitive to fragrances; there is no unscented version\n\nii. Relatively expensive compared to minoxidil\n\n## 5.) Ketoconazole\n\n  a. Anti-inflammatory and weak anti-androgen\n\n  b. Notes here are on topical liquid, foam or cream, not the shampoo. The shampoo has some studies showing benefit.\n\n  c. Some limited evidence that topical ketoconazole in a 1% or 2% liquid/gel/foam/cream can provide some benefit\n\n  d. Research:\n\ni.

Tretinion (a.k.a. trans retinoic acid)\n\n  a. Commonly known as Retin-A; exfoliant treatment for acne and anti-aging\n\n  b. Weak evidence that it can work as a standalone; however better evidence that it can work to enhance response to topical minoxidil.\n\n  c. Research:\n\ni.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3771854/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3771854/)\n\n  d. Pro’s:\n\ni. Relatively inexpensive and safe prescription product commonly prescribed by doctors\n\nii. May enhance sulfotransferase enzymes to convert minoxidil to minoxidil sulphate in scalp\n\niii. Can be commonly compounded into topical minoxidil preparations by pharmacies\n\n  e. Con’s:\n\ni. Can be irritating to the skin, but usually the irritation goes away with continued use\n\nii. Daytime use could cause scalp redness because of increased sensitivity to the sun\n\niii. Does this cause long term fibrosis of hair follicles, or could it cause hair loss in some people?\n\n## 7.) Latanoprost\n\n  a. Prostaglandin F2 alpha upregulator\n\n  b. Glaucoma medication that can be concentrated to higher concentrations by compounding pharmacies in the U.S.\n\n  c. Research:\n\ni. [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(11)00601-3/fulltext](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(11)00601-3/fulltext)\n\nii. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20028444/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20028444/)\n\n  d. Pro’s:\n\ni. FDA approved drug (Xalatan) for glaucoma; off label use for hair loss\n\nii. Xalatan (0.005%) grows eyelashes in most glaucoma patients\n\niii. Personal experience shows it works on scalp when concentrated at 0.1% (20 times Xalatan). I had a major “dread shed”.\n\niv. Patents have expired so some compounding pharmacies will make it\n\n  e. Con’s:\n\ni. Expensive\n\nii. Most pharmacies will not compound it\n\niii. No long term studies on safety and efficacy\n\n## 8.) Bimatoprost\n\n  a. Prostaglandin F2 alpha upregulator (similar to latanoprost)\n\n  b. Latisse FDA approved for eyelash growth (also works on eyebrows off label)\n\n  c. Some compounding pharmacies may be able to concentrate it enough where it works on the scalp, however there may be still some patents on the drug, prohibiting generic manufacturers from making the drug more affordable.\n\n  d. I used this personally on my hair line (0.03% generic Vistitan) for 3 months and it made no   \ndifference. Allergan’s studies showed that concentrations 10x – 30x were needed to get significant scalp hair growth.\n\n## 9.)  Adenosine\n\n  a. Brand name Adenogen by Shiseido sold (over the counter?) in Japan: [https://www.shiseido.co.jp/sw/c/products/SWFG070410.seam?shohin\\_pl\\_c\\_cd=681501&amp;amp;online\\_shohin\\_ctlg\\_kbn=1](https://www.shiseido.co.jp/sw/c/products/SWFG070410.seam?shohin_pl_c_cd=681501&amp;amp;online_shohin_ctlg_kbn=1)\n\n  b.

Pro’s:\n\ni. Multiple studies show efficacy in AGA for men and women; studies appear to be decent\n\nii. Alcohol based solution that dries quickly (based on personal use)\n\niii. Some generic brands may be available\n\niv. May be similar to Liposomal ATP, which is used by some well regarded hair transplant surgeons to speed up grafts growth post surgery\n\n  d. Cons:\n\ni. May be difficult to source outside Japan\n\nii. Relatively expensive\n\niii. Shiseido product has a mint type fragrance that may be unappealing to some people\n\niv. Shiseido product has a large bottle which makes application challenging\n\nv. I have tried getting pharmacies to compound this into minoxidil preparations without success.\n\n## 10.) Phenylephrine\n\n  a. Traction alopecia treatment; causes “goose bumps” (activates erector pili muscles) to prevent hair loss during washing, brushing or other traction\n\n  b. Sold as “INTACT” brand by Daniel Alain company: [https://www.danielalain.com/pages/retain](https://www.danielalain.com/pages/retain)\n\n  c. Research studies:\n\ni. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29193553/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29193553/)\n\nii. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26678522/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26678522/)\n\n  d. Pro’s:\n\ni. Good research behind it, with multiple studies; quality of researchers is excellent (i.e. hair loss dermatologists Dr. Jerry Shapiro and Dr. Rodney Sinclair)\n\nii. Only needs to be applied to scalp for ½ hour before activation occurs (can be washed out soon after)\n\niii. Reasonable cost\n\niv. Derived from natural ingredient (Seville orange extract); probably safe for long term use\n\nv. I have personally used this before getting a haircut and it definitely works as stated.\n\n  e. Con’s:\n\ni. May inhibit penetration of other topicals to the hair follicle so maybe only a good treatment before hair cuts or styling (e.g. before hair piece application).\n\nii. Has propanediol (natural version of propylene glycol) so leaves hair with greasy texture\n\n## 11.) Methyl Vanillate\n\n  a. WNT pathway activator\n\n  b. Sold as WNT/Act and Deltacrin WNT brands\n\n  c. Research:\n\ni. Only one small study shows benefit in Female AGA: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27121450/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27121450/)\n\n  d. Potentially used by Dr. John Cole’s hair restoration clinic (Forhair). Dr. Cole is one of the pioneers in follicular unit excision (FUE) surgery: [https://www.forhair.com/news/wnt-act-forhair-s-new-patented-cell-activator-hair-spray/](https://www.forhair.com/news/wnt-act-forhair-s-new-patented-cell-activator-hair-spray/)\n\n  e. Pro’s:\n\ni. Derived from natural ingredients\n\nii. Potentially up to 7% increase in hair density\n\niii. Works differently than minoxidil and finasteride, so theoretically can be stacked with those treatments\n\n  f. Con’s:\n\ni. Relatively expensive\n\nii. May contain propylene glycol\n\n## 12.) Redensyl\n\n  a. Obscure Growth stimulant\n\n  b. Research is biased: [https://www.redenhair.com/en/content/15-redensyl?adtoken=f7d28ab47a96dd99a3aca6fcd3cff64b&amp;amp;ad=administra&amp;amp;id\\_employee=2](https://www.redenhair.com/en/content/15-redensyl?adtoken=f7d28ab47a96dd99a3aca6fcd3cff64b&amp;amp;ad=administra&amp;amp;id_employee=2)\n\n  c. I found an inexpensive version from The Ordinary for around $10 a bottle. The product is greasy.   \n  \nEven if it does not work, you will not be out of pocket much money.\n\n## 13.) GroMD Follicle Activator Spray\n\n  a. Appears to be a combination of natural ingredients formulated by Dr. Amir Yazdan, who is a legitimate hair restoration doctor in the U.S. [https://gro.md/collections/all/products/gromd-minoxidil-boost](https://gro.md/collections/all/products/gromd-minoxidil-boost)\n\n  b. “Endorsed” by Spencer Stevenson (Spexhair), one of few credible consumer information resources in androgenetic alopecia. [https://www.spexhair.com/products-for-hair-loss/](https://www.spexhair.com/products-for-hair-loss/)\n\n  c. Relatively expensive, contains propylene glycol\n\n  d. Some anecdotal claims, may help reduce grey hair\n\n  e. Not sure how much shampoo and conditioner would help, if at all\n\n## 14.) Minoxidil derivatives - Probably not worth looking into, as they appear similar to minoxidil, but weaker and with less evidence behind them.\n\n  a. Nanoxidil\n\n  b. Aminexil\n\n  c. Copexil?\n\n## 15.) Other topical products with some anti-hair loss claims, but with limited research and not detailed in this compendium:\n\n  a. Melatonin\n\n  b. Valproic Acid\n\n  c. Progesterone\n\n  d. Azelaic Acid\n\n  e. Piroctone Olamine (shampoo)\n\n  f. Spironalactone\n\n  g. Sandalore\n\n  h. Cetirizine\n\n  i. Castor Oil\n\n  j.

    "body": "Despite battling with seborrheic dermatitis for the past year, I have never posted on this subreddit. However, I feel the need to finally share with you how I finally defeated seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp!\n\nDisclaimer: Creating your own cosmetic product is always associated with some risk, and I strongly advise you to at least perform a patch test first. I’m not a chemist so take this advice with a grain of salt and always use your common sense first. Also, please note that English is not my first language :)\n\nTo start with a brief story, I am a 23yo male, who has been dealing with moderate seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp for the past year. I have tried some ketoconazole- and piroctone olamine-based shampoos that worked quite well, but the effect only lasted for a few days at most. So, I began to wonder what would happen if I applied the same actives to my scalp for a longer period and in higher concentration. After conducting research, I discovered that there are numerous online DIY beauty stores (I live in Europe) where you can purchase raw ingredients and create your own toners, serums, shampoos, etc.\n\nI decided to order:\n\n* 10g of piroctone olamine powder\n* 100ml of rosemary plant water with preservatives\n* 30ml of propanediol (to dissolve piroctone olamine as it is not soluble in water)\n\nThen, I mixed 5g of piroctone olamine powder with propanediol (which took some time) and combined it with the rosemary hydrolate, resulting in approximately 3.5% piroctone olamine product, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nFor three consecutive days, I sprayed it onto my scalp and massaged it in. That's it. All the seborrheic dermatitis symptoms were literally gone! The only downside was that the spray temporarily made my hair super greasy and tacky (luckily, I work from home, so that wasn't really an issue).\n\nNow, it has been over two months, and I am still free from seborrheic dermatitis! At this point, I am spraying it once a week as a preventative measure.\n\nI hope sharing my experience will be helpful to you all dealing with similar challenges. Wishing you all the best on your journey to fight this annoying disease 💙\n\n  \nEDIT: Spelling",

The ingredients are \\*Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Glycerin, Squalane, Cyclo- pentasiloxane, Pentylene Glycol, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Dimethicone, Piroctone Olamine, Tocopheryl Acetate, Biosaccharide Gum-2, Papain, Zinc Sulfate, Sodium Polyac- rylate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Proline, Alanine, Maltodextrin, Parfum (Fragrance), Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Calcium Pantothenate, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Urea, Magnesium Lactate, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Lactate, Magnesium Chloride, Serine, Sodium Citrate.\\*Is not completely fungal acne safe, but I find that it really soothes my skin if I'm having a flareup, if my skin is compromised in those areas this product will sting a little, and itch a tiny bit (nothing like finacea gel) as it is absorbed into the skin, but by the end of that same day is so much better! A little goes a long way, texture is like a gel cream, I don't find that it pills, and it doesn't flare my perioral dermatitis either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kly322wv04ra1.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=312c2610e7c4a186e4e0988ba58b258c90063992\n\nFor the body: **Lactovit** another spanish brand, this is super cheap for me they have a cream that has a 10% complex of urea, lactic acid and retinol. It always kinda seems that the packaging comes half empty, but the package is just bigger, it's like 10 usd for 400ml, I use this for the body. It absorbs fast, it has fragrance but it smells nice to me, kind of powdery. They have a shower cleanser too which I use that really helps with ingrown hairs and KP.\n\n[version for the mex market](https://preview.redd.it/m80yerhqhxqa1.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf8e228928a277467cbc0243e88294c486cd0489)\n\nTo protect: for spf I use the **Cetaphil liposomal lotion** which in the EU is the exact same as the Daylong Protect and Care spf 50+ (or Daylong extreme spf), I find this to be an excellent primer for makeup, it doesn't pill, it doesn't break me out, it doesn't have fragrance, it feels like it lasts all day, and also calms my skin.\n\nThat's it. For facial moisturizer I use a small American brand named Malezia, I absolutely swear by them but the shipping price can be hefty in international orders and so not sharing them here.\n\n\\*\\*I find several products of this routine to be quite affordable given the price they have in the Mexican market, I hope that's the same case for EU.\\*\\*  \nxx  \nedit: to add the correct lactovit cream  \nedit2: to remove the malezia link the only american brand i mentioned because it gave the main image to the post and seemed misleading.

This all while using ketoconazole 2 % (formula similar to nizoral) 2-4 Times a week. \n\n By accident my barber used a tonic containing piroctone olamine and climbazole which significantly reduced the flare up after one application. I then purchased a shampoo called Sachajuan scalp shampoo (possibly only available in sweden?) and after two application and some stress management it all went away by 80%. I personally believe piroctone olamine, climbazole and Lactic/salicylic acid are the main ingredients that helps and possibly menthol that had a cooling effect during a flare up.

I would also have extreme flare ups every month or so where I couldn't even face going outside. I would call into work sick on especially bad days. \n\nI saw on this sub a recommendation for a zinc to apply topically but unfortunately this has been banned in the UK. However, this did lead me to find Clever Soap who previously made a zinc based product. I thought on a whim I would try another one, just to see if it would work. It works incredibly well as a preventative for me. Using it once a day before I jump in the shower keeps it at bay 95% of the time. I have not had a bad flare up since I started using it 18 months ago. \n\nI would highly recommend giving it a try and using it consistently for a month if you haven't already tried it, and hopefully it works for you too. \n\n",

If we take a look at how many people experience a significant increase (more than 10%) of the hair diameter, this is 28% with Ketoconazole and as much as 34% with Piroctone olamine (10% larger diameter means that the hair became 20% heavier).\n\n[Read the Article](https://www.hgspecialist.com/blogs/ingredients/the-effect-of-ketoconazole-and-piroctone-olamine-on-hair-growth)",

After 15-30 min of contact between 1.5% ciclopirox olamine and Malassezia strains, a 2-log reduction of Malassezia counts was observed. \n\nThe 1.5% ciclopirox olamine/1% zinc pyrithione association was characterized by a steady fungicidal efficacy whereas the 2% ketoconazole solution did not express any fungicidal effect. \n\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates the in vitro inhibitory and fungicidal efficacy of the ciclopirox olamine/zinc pyrithione association against Malassezia species and underscores its potential interest in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n[Link to Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17146583/)",

    "body": "Hello,\n\nwas diagnosed with seb eczema two years ago.\n\nI suddenly had tons of dandruff, then yellow crusts on my scalp and forehead and reddish spots on my chest.\n\nI was prescribed all of the standard treatments like ketoconazole shampoos and creams, as well as various other aggressive shampoos and creams. None helped really. The dandruff caused a lot of hair loss and the shampoos did too.\n\nI'm still looking for a cure like everyone else but I was able to take it from terrible to manageable. That's why I want to share my tips to help others who suffer from it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#1: Change your diet. This by far had the biggest impact. Visible results and a drastic difference.Remove all sugary foods and snacks. Reduce your nutrition to a bare minimum without any exceptions but definitely experiment by adding and removing foods. Keep a food diary and write down how your symptoms were that day. It's much easier to have a very bare-bones diet and keep a diary than eating a variety of foods and trying to keep track of it. So definitely reduce the kinds of food you eat.\n\nPersonally I only eat meat (chicken, pig, beef), vegetables, potatoes, corncakes, bananas, pears and peanuts (peanuts **ARE** a symptom trigger for some people, for me it seems it's not! -> experiment by keeping a consistent diet and then adding peanuts). It is very monotonous, for me that is not much of a problem but it made my condition much better.\n\nAvoid seed oils when cooking and also foods that are made with them. You have to read the description on the packaging when you shop for groceries. There's no way around it. Don't just assume how something is made. Read the ingredient info on the label. I've been using coconut oil exclusively. Whether that is the best option I don't know but it is better for sure than any seed oil like sunflower oil.\n\n\\#2 Use tee trea oil instead of steroid creams. Tea tree all is very good for treating this. Definitely by a tea tree oil shampoo as well as tea tree oil pure. Don't apply the tea tree oil pure though, dilute it with a glass of water and dip a paper towel into it and wring it out lightly. Apply then on the affected areas. Whether it is safe to apply it on the scalp and leave it there I'm not sure. But as for applying it on the body I've tested it and it is safe and effective. Reserve steroid creams only for emergencies when you have something where you need to get quick results, like a wedding or event where you need to have it gone for sure that day. Use a mild steroid like hydrocortisone. I use a cream called Locacorten (0.2 mg Flumetason 21-pivalat, 30 mg Clioquinol) for my chest. I never use steroid creams on the head.\n\nI occasionally get the yellow crusts on my scalp again and the tea tree oil all seems to be weak against those crusts. When this happens I still keep a shampoo bottle of Vichy Anti-Dandruff Sensitive (Piroctone olamine is the active ingredient here). After 2 to 3 applications the crusts are gone again. So I only use this for the yellow cross when they appear. The ingredients seem to be harsh on the skin which is why I only use tea tree oil shampoo for regular use.\n\nTry the standard treamtents with the shampoos and creams to see if it works and stop if you see no progress. Then try alternative treatments.\n\n\\#3 This disease is very common but for some reason it is not understood. Some doctors act like it is very easy to treat and are completely unaware to the complexity of this disease. It is very tough to combat this disease for sure. I found that advice on the Internet was far more helpful than any doctor that I went to and I've been to many. So try various treatments online, take notes of treatments you've tried and the results. Don't lose hope. There's always someone that has it much worse than you. For example I have seb eczema and other skin issues that are not only aesthetically unpleasing but also cause pain.\n\nHope this helps some people. I used to wake up with a red face and scalp, flakes all over my head and face, skin peeling off of my face, thick crusts etc. It's still bad for me, ngl, still have a lot of problems with it but it was so much worse before I did the aforementioned things. So try what I said and you may be able to not cure it but have much better skin.\n\nGood luck!",

It is definitely a night time moisturizer because it leaves you greasy for a while, but it will eventually sink in. Oh and did I mention it doesn't have fatty alcohols? It does have lanolin alcohol, so be careful if you are sensitive to that but other than that the ingredient list is awesome, it's cheap, unscented, and hella moisturizing. I don't know how it has escaped me for this long!\n\nI know that a formula exists somewhere with Methylchloroisothiazolinone and  Methylisothiazolinone (which some people are wary of) but I have only came across the one formulated with PHENOXYETHANOL and PIROCTONE OLAMINE and I bought mine at Target.\n\nIngredients btw:WATER, PETROLATUM, MINERAL OIL, CERESIN, LANOLIN ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL ,PIROCTONE OLAMINE\n\n[CosDna Link](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_6ac3205350.html)\n\nEdit: Lanolin is a fatty alcohol, I meant cetearyl/cetyl alcohol free!",

        "body": "Commenting here since every post i made with description was removed by mods somehow for reasons unknown to me.\n\nI'm 27 y/o & this is my MPB experience.\n\nMy Long story :\n\nI  started gradually lossing my hair in mid 2018. At that time i was  clueless about MPB & its treatement. I always had a short haircut  & it masked the loss that had started at the time. My barber even  told me that my hair is getting thinner & i didn't gave it any  thought other than improving my haircare regime.\n\nFor  2 years i grew my hair long till i had around 20 inch long. Eventually i  cut it & for a good cause of donating to a cancer charity. The  thing is that i didn't grew my hair for donating it but rather i had  developed so much social anxiety that i coundn't think of going for a  haircut. I was severely depressed at that point of time in my life &  my whole personality changed from an extroverted jolly person to  introverted anti social person. During this 2 year period my long hair  made the hair loss look mild since i always pulled it back and created a  bun. i never bothered to look at the top of my hair & from the  front it looked ok to me (eventhough in reality it had recessed severely  and aside from the long strands of hair my scalp looked bald).\n\nin  mid 2021 i got covid & it fast tracked my hairloss & i finally  started noticing it. I researched everything about it & go to learn  about tressless through it. I learned about the treatement. at this time  i learned that all 3 brothers of my mom had gone top bald with sides in  their early 30s.\n\ni thought of  starting treatment But a year went by & i never acted on it. I was  again infected by covid after mid 2022 & this was a devastating one  as it literally made me go bald. i started losing patches of strong long  hair daily. Now i had become very self aware about my appearance. I  finally bought finasteride 1mg to start but i was afraid of the side  effects it may cause & also i never had consulted with a doctor  about it. So, i started using Onion hair Oil, Bringha hair oil &  expensive shampoos,conditioners in hopes of reducing the loss for the  most part. i kept doing this till june 2023. in july i moved to a city  & finally gathered the courage to go visit a doctor about it.\n\nThe  doctor prescribed me the two most proven treatment for this i.e.  Finasteride 1mg (night)+ Minoxidil 5% + Finasteride 0.1% topical  solution (night) & on top of that he gave me Vitamin D3 60k IU  weekly, Multivitamin (biotin 10mg,Soya isoflavone), Kera XL hair growth  serum (morning), procapil shampoo twice weekly. my vitamin d level was  low visible by dark circles near eyes so i get the reuirement. i have  done GFC (better prp) every month till now & he has suggested  increasing the gap from a month to 4 months to 8 months to every one  year for maintainance. He has also talked to me about a new way to stop  fin and minoxidil without losing the progress. i am skeptical but he has  published a few studies of his own in past. i also had talked about  using ketoconazole 2% with him & he suggested using  Climbazole+Piroctone Olamine shampoo as it is a better at everything  than ketoconazole while having lesser side effects like hair colour  change & dryness. So, i have used keto 2% for two months now once  weekly & have added Climbazole+Piroctone Olamine once weekly too.\n\nOne  more thing i want to say is that i have gained enough condidence to go  outside without wearing a cap & have joined Gym to improve on myself  & get over my anxiety by interacting socially.\n\nThis  community has helped me immensely in believing getting better by the  means available right now instead of going bald advice i see on a  particular youtube channel & bald subreddit. i am just 27 & i  looked like i was in my mid 40s & the bald head only looks good on  some people. i woud look like a baby face lesbian lol\n\nLastly  i want some advice for my receded temples. i have tried minoxidil 5%+  tritinoin 0.01% specially at that area for over 1.5 month but aside from  small hairs growing it has not given me good results.\n\ni am thinking of microneedling by derma roller,stamp or pen. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nalso i got my vitamin d levels checked & it was at 80ng/mL. after that i reduced it to D3 1000 IU daily.\n\nShould i also get my testosterone level check ?",

    "body": "I've struggled with seb derm for all of my adult life. It was bad and gross and I would keep it in check by washing and blowdrying every day and using anti-dandruff shampoos, which left my hair looking like straw. \n\nApp. 9 months ago, I started using a new co-wash / cleansing conditioner, and my seb derm is gone!! 100% completely gone. It's mad. Even if I go several days without washing, nothing happens (this used to lead to complete disaster). My scalp is calm and clear. \n\nNow, I've tried several other co-washes before and, although they were wonderful for my hair, they did nothing for seb derm. So it's not co-wash per se. However, the ladies who made this particular co-wash (it's a Danish product, so most of you won't be able to get it. If there's a fellow Dane reading this, it's called Vaskebalsam by Pudderdaaserne) just wrote a blog post about seb derm and explained that the co-wash contains a particular ingredient, which targets seb derm. Piroctone Olamine (PO).  \n\nAssuming you can't get what I'm using, you could try Purely Professional Shampoo 4, which also contains PO. I have not tried this, but these ladies recommend a treatment where you wash with this every day for 14 days and blow-dry.\n\nNB. Zero dietary changes during this period. I generally don’t eat meat (factory farming and the planet), but that’s always been my position. Other than that, I have no restrictions. And, in fact, my diet’s been unusually crappy the past six months. \n\nUPDATE: Some people are getting a bit worked up about this post. I can't edit the title, but I apologise for calling it magical as, from what I’m hearing, PO doesn’t work for everyone. I may just have been lucky. But it’s worth a try.\n\nUPDATE #2: HOW TO USE PIROCTONE OLAMINE (PO)\nIf PO shampoo isn't working for you, it may be because you are not using it correctly. I recently came across a blog post written by the people who produce the shampoo I use. According to them, if you struggle with seb derm, you need to take an entire week where you wash (with PO) and blowdry EVERY SINGLE DAY. It's a total bother (they admit that it's the most unpopular piece of advice they've ever given), but.. apparently, if 'normal use' isn't working, that's the way to do it.",

Minoxidil if you have Latanoprost absolutely not needed, plus to activate the MN you need a ton of alcohol which causes a lot of problems for many people.  Also LAtanoprost is ridiculously expensive and 1% is really, really high, most people wont need that much if the topical also include dutasteride.  Remember if the DT is helping stop the DHT at the scalp then you don't need as much push on the growing side.\n\nOh and there is already a company that is making a precision medicine topical through a compound pharmacy customized based on your individual biochemistry through lab tests.

Subjects also completed self-assessment questionnaires.\n\nResults: Statistically significant effects for functional ingredient-containing treatment regimen versus a placebo control shampoo formulation were observed for reduced hair shedding, increased total hair count, reduced TEWL and improvement in scalp biomarker values. Subjects also noticed these improvements assessed via self-assessment questionnaires.\n\nConclusions: These results establish that the use of functional antioxidant and barrier-enhancing agents to further improve scalp condition can enable a reduction in hair shedding and thus an increase in perceived hair fullness. The underlying improvements in scalp condition suggest the hair benefits were achieved as a result of improved scalp skin barrier and scalp condition leading to a viable preventative approach for hair thinning.\n\n[Link to Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34424558)",

Then once every other day for maintenance\n\n- Apply Ketoderm twice a day for 1 month (it's a 2% ketoconazole cream)\n\n- Locapred (corticoid cream) from the 3rd day of using Ketoderm, apply once a day on skin lessions for 10 days\n\n- Use Kelual DS crème as a daily moisturizer, twice a day\n\n- Take zinc supplements once a day for 3 months\n\nFor the head:\n\n- Wash with normal shampoo, then apply 2% ketoconazole gel, leave on for 10 min. Do this for a month\n\n- Use a solution made up by a pharmacy that contains: kelual emulsion, mycoster spray (1% ciclopirox olamine), skinosalic lotion. Use this once a day for a month, to spray on all my scalp, then once every other day for a month, then twice a week as maintenance\n\n- Kelual DS shampoo. This could be optional i think.

    "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nDue to being bombarded by constant messages about my topical spironolactone experience so far,  I have decided to make a post (even though I was planning on posting at the 1 year mark).\n\n***Background:*** Male, early 40s, balding since my mid 30s at a slow rate.\n\n***Drugs I've tried:*** Oral finasteride and topical finasteride (both stopped due to side effects of penile numbness, non-stop testicle pain). I was even at the tiny concentration of 0.005% topical finasteride but side effects eventually caught up to me after a few months (see my previous posts for my progress with topical fin). I have never used or will use minoxidil because I am a very hairy dude and I don't want to turn into an ape.\n\n**Current Regimen:**\n\n1. 2.5% spironolactone topical solution applied once daily at night time and washed off in the morning. I apply about 4-5 mL a day onto my scalp with a syringe and rub it in with gloves.\n2. Piroctone Olamine Shampoo (Sebamed) once daily (anti-dandruff)\n\nNothing else; NO minoxidil or microneedling. Ingredients per my compounding pharmacist are just micronized spironolactone and ethanol mixed together. This is prescribed through my dermatologist. The solution smells a bit like weed, but it is not offensive my any means. After it is washed off you can't smell it anymore.\n\n**Side Effects:** **Literally nothing.** This is expected as it is not absorbed systemically at all.\n\n**Shedding:** Massive shed at around day 30 that obliterated my crown area and left me with almost nothing on top (see second picture). Stopped around day 100. Now just shedding at my baseline.\n\n**Progress:** Personally I'm not seeing much, most of the shed hair grew back but I feel like I'm still at baseline. I plan to continue for at least 1 year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/62wkd3f6q7yb1.jpg?width=2835&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1dfe9c93c8978575c83aeea13f6a05c125b202b1",

That also coincided with COVID, and both the vaccine and getting COVID caused major flare ups for me. \n\nI use a mix of ketoconozole and elidel on my face and occasionally protopic. They help but none have been a game changer. But ketoconozol shampoo hasn't really made a difference for my scalp and I've tried all the others (zinc pyrithicone, selenium sulfide etc). \n\nI use a salicylic acid treatment (The Inkey List) and leave that on for an hour or so, then use a clarifying shampoo (just switched to Ouai Detox shampoo). I alternate that with coal tar (Neutrogena T Gel though I've found it's difficult to find outside the US). It doesn't smell amazing as people  have mentioned so I can't use it all the time, but it seems to be the only thing that has made any difference. I started putting it on before I shower and letting it sit for 30 min or so before I wash it out \n\nOne other thing worth checking might be the type of water you have in your city (hard vs soft). A water filter for your shower head may help a bit.",

But that is kind of unlikely. \n\n*Edit: I also wanted to add that I really recommend using conditioner every time you shower. If you can, only use shampoo as much as you have in the past. If you find your hair getting greasy/gross then use it a little more. Really the least amount of shampoo you can, and conditioner everytime.",

Through a lot of trial and error, I've managed to control it, apart from the occasional flake. \n\nMajor triggers for me are dairy and bell, cayenne and chili peppers. I had already stopped consuming dairy because it also gives me cystic acne. With many products containing derivatives such as milk powder and paprika, I try prepare my own food as much as possible. Especially in social settings, it's hard to avoid these foods altogether and it can cause a lot of stress, however it's worth the hassle. Last week I ate some chili, and within a day I felt extremely lethargic/depressed, followed by red patches on the back of my head. \n\nDuring a break out, I usually treat the spots with a mixture of water and white vinegar before shampooing with an SLS-free shampoo that contains piroctone olamine. I also never leave my hair wet and use a dryer after showering. Combined with paying attention to my diet, this has reduced my symptoms with 90-95% for the last few years.\n\nAlthough I know that the connection between diet and seb derm is sometimes disputed, and there's probably no one size fits all solution for managing seb derm, it was definitely the missing link for me. Curious to hear if others have similar experiences.",

The barcode sticker was blue inside when peeled off.\n\nSecond version started looking how it currently looks on the amazon product photos https://imgur.com/a/ivUQrfB and they removed expiration dates, having only batch numbers stamped in the top.\n\nNewest version with a new formulation looks exactly the same from the front, only the text on the back has changed, and expiration dates are back.

    "body": "**Introduction**  \nTom Busby is a guy over at the forum [rosaceagroup.org](https://rosaceagroup.org/). He has researched skin conditions, mainly seborrheic dermatitis and malasezzia related skin conditions, for years and he has cured his life long condition through his homemade lotions and cleansers. Through the years he has shared his recipes and research on the forums, mainly in his own thread where he goes over different treatments and his own experiences: [Link](https://rosaceagroup.org/The_Rosacea_Forum/showthread.php?28667-Seborrheic-Dermatitis-amp-Folliculitis-Review-of-OTC-Treatments-for-Malassezia) The whole thread is worth a read\n\nNow that he has years of experimenting and experience behind him he doesn't believe his formulas will change, and he has also started selling his products. You can contact him through email or wait until he sets up his own website to sell his products, which he said will happen in a couple of months.\n\nEach product cost 35$ + shipping. I've been using them for just over a week, not really long enough to write a proper review, so this is more of a first impressions post. I'll try to keep it pretty brief, so just ask questions below if you want to know anything.\n\n**The Lotion**  \nIngredients:  \nDistilled water, Caprylic/capric triglycerides, Niacinamide & dl-Panthenol (proVitamins), Glycerin, Olive Squalane oil, Cetearyl alcohol 30/70 NF (thickener), Sodium Hyaluronate, HMW, & Ceramide complex, (skin quality improve-ment), Ceteareth 20 & Glyceryl stearate (emulsifiers), Toco-phersolan & Retinyl palmitate (Vitamins E & A), Piroctone olamine (anti-demodectic), Climbazole (anti-fungal), Microcrystalline wax, OptiMSM, Isopropanol, Glyceryl caprylate, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic acid, & Dehydroacetic acid (preservatives). 5.5 pH\n\nA ton of great ingredients, climbazole working as an antifungal and piroctone olamine working as an antifungal and also against demodex. No oils which malasezzia can metabolize and also a ton of other great ingredients for general skin improvement.\n\nThe lotion is a bit runny, which makes it very easy to spread across the face. It's a bit oily at first,  but it soaks great into the skin and dries pretty matte. It has no perfume, it smells a bit of alcohol. It isn't as moisturizing as for example cerave cream or other rich moisturizer, but it works great for my skin. Thick moisturizer makes my skin all shiny and breaks me out, this leaves my skin feeling like I am wearing nothing. I've tried dozens of moisturizers over the years, and even without thinking about the antifungals, this is probably the best moisturizer I've tried. I just need a little bit to cover my entire face and because of the large bottle this will probably last for months.\n\n**The shampoo**  \nIngredients:  \nDistilled water, Decyl glucoside, Cocobetaine, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium lauryol lactylate, (surfactants), Niacinamide and dl-Panthenol (pro-Vitamins), Olive Squalane oil, Sodium hyaluronate, HMW, and Ceramide complex, (skin quality improvement), Tocophersolan and Retinyl palmitate (Vitamins E & A), Piroctone olamine (anti-demodectic), Acrylates C10-30 cross-polymer, Climbazole (anti-fungal), Citric acid, Di-PPG-2 myreth-10 adipate (solubilizer), OptiMSM, Isopropanol, Glyceryl caprylate, Methylene blue, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic acid, and Dehydroacetic acid (preservatives). 5.5 pH\n\nThis also contains a ton of great ingredients and no bad oils. I just use it as a foaming facial cleanser. It foams up pretty well, and it has a low pH. Because it is a foaming cleanser it is a bit drying, so using it without the moisturizer is probably a bad idea.\n\n**How to use and results**  \nReading Tom's posts at the forums he has some guidelines on how to use the products. Once a day I wet my face in the sink, then I foam up the cleanser and rub it into my face. Then i wait a few minutes and step into the shower and properly rinse it of. When i step out of the shower i tap-dry my face and apply the lotion on my face.\n\nFrom the first day my face started to shed dead skin. A lot of white flakes appeared on the center of my face and beard area. This might sound worrying, but according to Tom this is great. He is an older guy, so it took him over 5 months for his skin to return to normal, but because I am pretty young I should expect faster results. My skin seems to get less flaky every day, and i just rub the flakes of with my fingers and apply more moisturizer if they are visible.\n\nMy skin is less red and the products also seem to work well for my acne. It remains to be seen how the products work long term, but right now I am happy to have a solid routine that should kill of the fungus on my face causing my seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o0acvbn1a1721.jpg?width=3336&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d824cd13feea43386925fe49c5793cb62db4cb6c",

        "body": "Great thorough review SelectAge.\n\nI bought the lotion and shampoo at the same time as SelectAge (after SelectAges post here on /r/sebderm that Tom had started selling it) and have also been using it for a week. At first I noticed, just like SelectAge, my skin flaking but also my face turned red. But both of these symptoms are supposed to be good since it is a natural reaction for your skin as the skin is fighting the sebderm. After a couple of days my skin has gotten less and less red and flaky. \n\nI'm also pretty young (27) so I expect my skin to react faster than Tom's did. Also he added an ingredient since he used it that he thinks may make it 25% faster than it was for him.\n\nMy routine is just like SelectAge, I mostly use it for my face, but sometimes I use the shampoo for my hair/top body as well but I don't use it often enough to review how good it works on my scalp. It doesn't bug me as much as the sebderm on my face.\n\nAs SelectAge said, it is a good idea to use the shampoo as a cleanser before applying the moisturizer to thoroughly cleanse your skin before putting on the lotion.\n\nIt feels like I am just repeating everything SelectAge has said already, but I will also keep updating how it goes for me. Hopefully I will know for sure in just a month or two if it going in the right direction for me:)\n\nIf you are interested in this product I'd suggest you read up a lot on Tom's research and then contact Tom on either the forum or through his mail which I think is accessible through his post which is posted on 4th of december in the forum thread which SelectAge linked. He has a 'product information file' which he sent me so I'd suggest you ask Tom for it if you are interested. I don't want to share it here without asking Tom so I'd suggest you just ask Tom for it:)\n\nHopefully we'll both get better and better SelectAge *hopeful*",

When you start using an anti-fungal the immune system becomes aware of the fungal invaders and the symptoms flare up. After around 10 days of treatment the flaking is now very minimal, but redness, especially in the inner cheek region, which in first seemed to decrease, is now a bit worse. I have been kind of scrubbing the shampoo into my face, so I am going to try applying it a bit more gently in case the redness is just normal skin irritation.   \n\n\nI've experienced the same increase in redness when using antifungals like lotrimin ultra and terbinafine previously, so I am not really worried, and still optimistic about the treatment. The initial increase in flaking should be an indication that the product is working, an increase in redness is also to be expected. Curious to see if the redness will eventually fade.",

An approach to decrease hair shedding by reducing scalp stratum corneum oxidation via a combination of antioxidant and barrier-enhancing technologies has been previously demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of the individual antioxidant piroctone olamine in two different product forms (shampoo or leave-on product) for activity to improve hair retention.\n\nMETHODS\nFemale subjects with self-perceived hair thinning participated in an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical study to evaluate either a piroctone olamine (PO) containing shampoo or a PO containing leave on treatment, each relative to their corresponding placebo formulation Too many periods. Results for phototrichograms, TEWL, and biomarker analysis of scalp condition for the shampoo treatments are discussed. Phototrichogram results are shared for the assessment of the leave on treatment.\n\nRESULTS\nStatistically significant increases in hair amount were observed by phototrichogram after use of both PO-containing products versus placebo formulations. The PO shampoo treatment also significantly decreased oxidative stress on the hair and scalp, and improved scalp condition as assessed by TEWL and scalp biomarker values.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results illustrate the effectiveness of a cosmetic antioxidant to improve scalp condition thereby improving hair retention. The observed improvements in scalp condition are consistent with previous reports with other antioxidant technologies and suggest that the hair retention effect was achieved by preventing oxidative damage to the scalp.\n\n[Read the Study](https://ubmed.com/m/34424549)",

Excessive secretion of sebum, dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis are often linked with hair loss and hereditary hair loss. The 150 men received a shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole or 1% Piroctone olamine. They had to use this shampoo 2 to 3 times per week for a duration of six months.\n\nAll treatments showed a reduction in itching and dandruff after 2 to 6 weeks. If we take a look at the effect of the treatments on various hair growth parameters, we see the following figures (in percentages):\n\nThe severity of hair loss decreases (Ketoconazole: -17.3%, Piroctone olamine: -16.5%)\n\nThe percentage of hairs in the growth phase increases (Ketoconazole 4.9%, Piroctone olamine: 7.9%)\n\nThe effect on the hair diameter is increased by 5.4% with Ketoconazole and by 7.7% with Piroctone olamine.\n\nThus, the study shows that Piroctone olamine scores better in a number of areas in comparison to Ketoconazole**:\n\nCompared to Ketoconazole, Piroctone olamine ensures an increase in the number of hairs in the growth phase (anagen phase) by more than 10% in 33% of people.\n\nPiroctone olamine gives 88% of the people thicker hair, despite hereditary hair loss, whereby this is 78% with Ketoconazole.\nIf we take a look at how many people experience a significant increase (more than 10%) of the hair diameter, this is 28% with Ketoconazole and as much as 34% with Piroctone olamine (10% larger diameter means that the hair became 20% heavier).\n\n[Read the Article](https://www.hgspecialist.com/ingredients/the-effect-of-ketoconazole-and-piroctone-olamine-on-hair-growth)",

Hair shedding during shampoo was evaluated semiquantitatively. \n\nHair density on the vertex was evaluated on photographs using a Dermaphot. Trichograms were used for determining the anagen hair percentage and the mean proximal hair shaft diameter using computerized image analysis. The sebum excretion rate (SER, mug cm(-2) h(-1)) was also measured using a Sebumeter. \n\nThe three treatments cleared pruritus and dandruff rapidly. \n\nAt end point, hair density was unchanged, although hair shedding was decreased (KTZ: -17.3%, PTO: -16.5%, ZPT: -10.1%) and the anagen hair percentage was increased (KTZ: 4.9%, PTO: 7.9%, ZPT: 6.8%). \n\nThe effect on the mean hair shaft diameter was contrasted between the three groups of volunteers (KTZ: 5.4%, PTO: 7.7%, ZPT: -2.2%). \n\nIn conclusion, telogen effluvium was controlled by KTZ, PTO and ZPT shampoos at 1% concentration. In addition, KTZ and PTO increased the mean hair shaft thickness while discretely decreasing the sebum output at the skin surface.\n\n[Link to Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18498517/)",

    "body": "Hey, I haven't posted here in a while because I found a routine that works and I've always wanted to pay it forward so here goes.\n\nThis is the routine that's been working for me. I will include the products but I am not associated with them; I just know it helped me in the past when people include products:\n\n- Kelual Ducray DS with ciclopirox and piroctone olamine (I get it off eBay)\n- Dermarest 3% salicylic acid shampoo\n- CLOUDD healthy scalp shampoo\n- Suave clarifying shampoo\n- Zoryve foam prescribed by the doctor\n\nBackstory:\n\n I've had sebderm since January 2024 when a maddening itch began and then it turned into burning and stinging. I've struggled for almost a year now. \n\nAt this point in my journey, I have also realized that I didn't only have sebderm but I also had contact dermatitis in reaction to the ingredient c14-16 olefin sulfonate, which is in a lot of sulfate free shampoos. \n\nAt first I was using Zoryve with Odele shampoo (which contains olefin sulfonate but is otherwise sebderm safe). I had a total reduction in itching but had terrible stinging. When I realized my problem was olefin sulfonate, the stinging immediately went away but the general scaling was still there so I knew I had sebderm in addition to a reaction to the olefin sulfonate.\n\nDespite everyone's claims, Zoryve did not fix my problems on its own. As an anti-inflammatory, it is a tool but I think it has to be used in conjunction with an antifungal to get lasting relief.\n\nFor my part, I have had bad reactions to zinc and ketocozanole products, so I was struggling to find an antifungal I could tolerate. My derm prescribed me ciclopirox, but the shampoo was so shitty that it made my hair horrible. I found Kelual Ducray DA on ebay and it was a much better shampooing experience with a way better smell, so I switched to that.\n\nCurrently, my routine does multiple things:\n\nThe Zoryve down-regulates inflammation. I use it every night.\n\nI use the CLOUDD shampoo every day. If I use another shampoo, I always double wash with CLOUDD. The first ingredient is aloe vera and it has amazing barrier repair ingredients like panthenol and vitamin E. It has soothed my scalp like no other shampoo and it is sebderm safe. After one use, I felt the difference and nearly cried.\n\nI use the Kelual Ducray DS twice a week for an antifungal and leave it in for ten minutes before rinsing and double washing with CLOUDD. It's also worth it to note that ciclopirox and piroctone olamine have very low resistance profiles so they are a good choice for combatting the yeast.\n\nI use Dermarest to descale followed by Suave to clarify once a week. This helps me get any straggling scale off. The CLOUDD is moisturizing so it helps to have a more stripping wash once a week. \n\nAnd that's it. My head is clearer than it's ever been and the skin is beginning to feel normal again. I think what I'm doing is making logical sense and I am so happy to have found something that's working. Hope y'all can make use of this.\n\n",

I can use it close to my scalp without an uncomfortable feeling.\n\nI haven’t found a great conditioner.

Bonus points if they are also salt-free, as I have a keratin chemical straightening treatment done, and both those things eat away the treatment.

I've ordered it anyway because my scalp it's behaving extra itchy.\n\nI'm also looking into the following:\n\n\\- D'Aveia DS and anti-dandruff shampoo. It's a Portuguese brand and I can't find the INCI or if they have SLS.\n\n\\- Topicrem DS+ Shampoo and DS+ Baby Shampoo. I think they have SLS, but I'm not sure as I can't find the INCI. KA Keracur Plus Lotion looks amazing, though.\n\nAlso, Zinc Pyrithione has been forbidden in cosmetics shampoos in the EU since March 2022. I can still find shampoos that have it, but I'm avoiding them, as Piroctone Olamine it's a good alternative.\n\nIf anyone has good recommendations about hair products (shampoos, lotions, scrubs...) that aren't Oribe Serene (I wish!), I'd be very thankful.",

Mine didn't respond to Nizoral, Ciclopirox Olamine, Zinc, Piroctone Olamine, Azelaic Acid,  you name it.\n\nI want to start by saying that my sebderm was obviously linked to my skin overproducing oil. I had to bloat my face at least twice a day with those small sheets and my skin was greasier than a kebab after 1h. \n\n**5mg/day Isotretinoin fixed my acne, redness, scaling in the span of 3 weeks, hand-in-hand with daily 1%ciclopirox olamine cream. I had been using the previously mentionned cream for weeks but it only started working after I started Accutane.**\n\n Of course it's a really annoying treatment (have to take blood samples very regularily because of risks on the liver, every three months) and it's a very long term treatment course. However, my QoL was so bad that I wouldn't even go outside anymore, not meet my friends, because of how bad my skin looked. so this treatment is a godsend for me.\n\nBy the way, with 5mg/day, I don't have \\*any\\* side effects, *knock on wood.* Skin went from oily to combination, lips aren't cracking **at all** (only if I swim in the sea with the salt), my eyes are fine I wear contacts everyday, joints don't hurt etc. I think all those effects mainly happen at, as I would call it, horse dose for recalcitrant pustular acne that some of you may have taken; those are usually at least 40mg/day, at most 80mg/day if you're on the heavier side. Those doses can actually disrupt your skin barrier so much that it can cause sebderm... Isotretinoin is full of mysteries !\n\nAnyway, I am still struggling with scales on the scalp but I think I'm finally managing to see progress in this area. However, for people with oily skin and fungal acne whose life is being destroyed by this disease, I recommend you get informed on this treatment.\n\n**Just remember that low dose Accutane isn't a cure or treatment in itself, it's a modality in the treatment of sebderm,** meaning that you would need to use other products like anti-fungals even under accutane. And once I stop low dose Accutane it's likely that my sebderm will flare up again.",

But I wanted to post this because I have been lurking for a while and I see a lot of people using extremely harsh chemicals trying to eradicate bacteria that will most likely repopulate said area. Your skin harbors tons of opportunistic bacteria at all times washing safely reduces bacteria. If you are experiencing recurrent folliculitis it is possibly a sign that the bacteria is probably not the issue, but rather a symptom.",

Tiny red bumps which blistered and became raised and angry when exposed to friction.  I tried antifungals which didn’t help.  I then tried strong antibacterial washes and antibiotics.  Acne meds irritated my skin even more leaving welts and making me itchy!  I finally tried colloidal oatmeal lotion which got rid of the 75% of the redness and swelling overnight!!!!  I have continued to use it along with gentle washes and my skin connotes to heal.  I don’t want to speak too soon, but after using gentle washes and the colloidal oatmeal, my folliculitis is 90% gone!  I am in shock!  Could it be that I needed to moisturize and rebuild my skin’s barrier?!!!?",

I was even at the tiny concentration of 0.005% topical finasteride but side effects eventually caught up to me after a few months (see my previous posts for my progress with topical fin). \n\n-I have never used minoxidil because I am a very hairy dude and I don't want to turn into an ape.\n\n-Unfortunately I am not left with many androgen blockers to try so I went the spiro route.\n\n**Current Regimen:**\n\n1. 2.5% spironolactone topical solution applied once daily at night time and washed off in the morning. I apply about 4-5 mL a day onto my scalp with a syringe and rub it in with gloves.\n2. Piroctone Olamine Shampoo (Sebamed) once daily (anti-dandruff)\n\nNothing else; NO minoxidil or microneedling. Ingredients per my compounding pharmacist are just micronized spironolactone and ethanol mixed together. This is prescribed through my dermatologist. The solution smells a bit like weed, but it is not offensive my any means. After it is washed off you can't smell it anymore.\n\n**Side Effects:** **Literally nothing.** This is expected as it is not absorbed systemically at all:\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3411088/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3411088/)\n\n**Shedding:** Massive shed at around day 30 that obliterated my crown area and left me with almost nothing on top (see second picture). Stopped around day 100. Now just shedding at my baseline (100+ hairs/day)\n\n**Progress/Thoughts:** Personally I'm not seeing much regrowth after 1 year. I think I have maintained what I have so far. Since I can't tolerate finasteride I plan to continue for now. I found a pharmacy that can do 5% spiro in a lotion or foam so I may try that within the next few weeks.  \nSpiro for androgenic alopecia systematic review for those interested:\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10010138/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10010138/)\n\n\\*\\*All pictures except day 60 are the same length hair.

    "body": "PLEASE READ WHOLE ARTICLE, IT MAY HELP YOU UNDERSTAND USAGE OF CREAMS. \n\nThis thread is about \"How to use...\" corticoid creams and dermocosmetic products. There are more than enough products you can choose from and yes, it is confusing but bear with me. \n\nYou all read that one thing works for one person and not for the other. In some cases it is true but when I asked people about HOW and WHEN did they use specific product I never got same answer twice. So now I will try to give you that information - consulted with specialists on how to use products on your SD, to lower the chance of failing/worsening your SD.\n\n\nSee lower part of article to read directly about CORTICOID cream, I will add some introduction to the topic and other products here.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask, I am more than happy to talk about our problems.\n\n\n..............\n\n\nFinally here it goes...\n\n\nSame as you I suffer from this itchy scaly inconvenience for a while. And I read many articles, advices and whatnot about usage of different substances to use on SD. Some of the advices were good/bad, some introduced alternatives and some talked about many different creams.\n\nThey were pretty useful but they never described WHEN (i.e. at what stage of SD) and HOW (routine - how much and how often) to use specific substance - making it really hard to comprehend the right usage of products. I consulted dermatologists, cosmetic specialists and my med school texts (yeah soon to be doctor here) and I will try to explain what I found out - in the most comprehensive way I can.\n\nYou see, SD as you know has stage of flare-up and then some period of calm state - with minimal symptoms.\n\nCALM STATE - routine to help keeping your skin calm and lowering the frequency and severness of flare-ups.\n\nUse products with Zinc pyrithione/Selenium disulfide/Piroctone olamine etc. There are:\n- moisturisers - creams or emulsions\n- cleansers - gels/soaps/facewash\nYou can find both for SD sensitive skin. Use combination of one moisturiser and one cleanser - that is enough.\n \nThey are really good during the calm period of your SD. Best habit is using moisturiser twice a day (morning/evening) and some gentle cleanser once in the evening - before moisturising - but you need to make sure it is suitable cleanser for your skin. Here comes important rule. LESS IS BETTER. \n\n1) Your skin needs to breathe so never use thick layers of creams/emulsions. Gently massaging in thin layer is enough. \n\n2) When you are using a cleanser, dont keep it on your skin for too long - it may irritate your skin. So put it on for about 30 - 60 seconds and then rinse it off - its sufficient enough.\n\nAnd now,\n\nCORTICOID/STEROID CREAMS.\n\nThey are discussed in almost every thread by people having good and bad experience. I noticed that most people dont really know all the specifics of corticoid usage (it is mostly those who have bad experience, sadly). So if you want to use the corticoid cream without side effects, treatment failure and more severe flare-up rebound - read on.\n\nCorticoid creams do one thing well for SD. They suppress inflammation. Which is useful only at the start or during flare-up. So you should try to stop using them when you start seeing effect - but it is not that simple. How should you proceed with using corticoids:\n\n1) Use cream with weak steroid - hydrocortisone is the most common. You dont have to use anything stronger.\n\n2) Use it only during flare-up.\n\n3) Use it ONCE A DAY!! (max twice)\n In the evening, after cleansing your skin. If you need to use it twice, try to avoid direct sunlight after putting on corticoid in the morning.\n\n4) Use it this way until you see it calming down - but maximum for TWO WEEKS.\n\n5) After the calming or the two weeks comes the period of another two/three/four weeks (depends on how much and how often did you use it) when you use the corticoid less and less. Key word GRADUALLY.\n        a)Every time during this period put on less and        \n            less of the cream.\n        b)Make the frequency also lower. So put it on \n            every OTHER evening for first week, than once      \n            in 3 days, 4 days, week and then you can\n            safely stop.\n\n6) Dont stop using your Calm state routine even during flare-up. Be gentle with the cleanser and put on corticoid and then moisturiser - both after cleansing.\n\n7) Not all flare-ups are so severe that you need to use corticoid cream.\n\n\n..........\n\n\nTake home message.\n\n1)Less is better. Consistency is everything. Keep up your calm state routine. And be gentle.\n\n2)Yes, you should try to avoid using corticoid creams BUT if you really feel it is necessary, dont be scared to use them. If you follow these steps of how to use them - you will avoid the side-effects.",

It causes itching, flaking and is very difficult to manage, however, I finally have it under control after a lot of trial and error. \n\nI started initially with Nirzoral (Ketoconazole) the benefit was very short lived. I then tried shampoos with Piroctone Olamine which were better but still required a lot of additional effort. The game changer was using shampoos with Ciclopirox Olamine such as Oilatum or Stiprox. They aren’t a cure but do drastically help to keep the symptoms under control even with long-term use.\n\nSecondly, Sebclair cream which contains Piroctone Olamine, is excellent and nips any flair ups in the bud. These are the two key items I use in my arsenal to manage SD without too much effort.\n\nOther tips include rotating shampoos, I rotate with T-gel and Alpecin Dandruff Killer to try and avoid building a tolerance. Also using a Tangle Teezer style brush in the shower with these really helps exfoliate, remove flakes and help thoroughly shampoo through my beard.\n\nLastly, absolutely avoid any product with oils and fats that aren’t medium or short chain triglycerides (like coconut oil) as these feed the Malassezia and make symptoms much worse.\n\nAny this is just my experience but maybe it might help others.",

    "body": "I have read that some people had succes with Cicalfate so I thought lets give it a go. When you check the ingredients it is not Malazia safe. I ordered a tube and tried it when going to sleep. The next day I woke up I had red weird sebderm bump on my face near my nose.  I have been using Avene Extreme Emulsion for longer then a month with Niacinamine drops without any problems at all. It was a long time ago I had these strange spots. I only had to deal with redness near my nose that I cant get rid off. The Niacinamide made it a bit less red but not enough. It seems this cream Cicalfate does not work for sebderm and I do not recommend you buy it. The people with succes probably do not have sebderm where they use this cream on the face. Or they are in a different phase. I too had peroids in the past where I could use Biotherm cremes that are not suitable for SD but in that timeframe my sd was probably less serious so my skin could handle it. \n\nIn the past I used Kerium DS creme. It seemed to work but after long periods of use I think it has created the permanent reddness near my nose. So I try to stay of this cream now. It could be that this creme is to aggresive with the piroctone olamine. Therefore I shifted to Niacinamidd and Zinc of TO and Avene Extreme Emulsion as I read some post people had succes with. That combination did not irritate my skin at all. \n\nThe only thing I still have is little membrames (with red spots since it irritates my skin) on my forehead every now and then when I use Niacinamide or Kerium Ds. When I scratch these open I get irritation for 1 of 2 days and then the spots go away. I dont know why that is. When I use only Avene I dont have this problem. Could it be the Zinc my skin reacts to...I dont know. I will test it by buying Niacinamide without Zinc.\n\nI wash my face every morning and in the evening I use a none irritating soap. I use a Salicic acid wash every couple of days of La Roche. I try to keep my skin as clean as possible. I use cold water to wash it of. I also wash my beard beard with the soap and use the Avene Extreme for moisturising the skin. That keeps it clear so far.",

He suggested that I completely stop oiling my hair because it blocks the natural oil that hair produces. Now, oiling is a big part of my culture's beauty regimes, and I do not know anyone else who doesn't oil their hair! He also told me to wash my hair as soon as my scalp becomes oily and to look for a good foaming shampoo. \n\nHe also prescribed [Alpecin Caffeine Liquid](https://www.alpecin.com/en-gb/shampoos-liquids/details/product/alpecin-caffeine-liquid/) with these ingredients: Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Parfum, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Panthenol, Menthol, Caffeine, Zinc PCA, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Linalool, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Retinyl Acetate\n\nand \n\na NoSkurf Lotion with key ingredients Climbazole & Piroctone Olamine; rest of ingredients are: Aqua, Propylene Glycol, Sweet Almond Oil, Steareth-21, Stealth-2, Isopropyl Myristate, Laureth-23, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Polyacrylate, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Trideceth-6, PEG/PPG 18/18 Dimethicone, Zinc Pyrithione, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Red 33, Blue 1, Perfume\n\nApart from these, I've also been prescribed D3 tablets, Iron supplements, and [Adgain](https://ciplamed.com/content/adgain-capsules) capsules. \n\nI have absolutely no idea what these ingredients do, or how they interact. I am googling them one-by-one, but it would be really helpful if anyone can take a look at this prescription and talk about their experiences with similar stuff, it would be great! \n\nThanks!",

Corn starch is the degreaser, and the other two give the hair some texture. \n\nHaving experimented with both kaolin clay and silica in my hair, I'd say silica is a lot more potent for texturizing, while kaolin boosts degreasing and makes the hair drier (which I like because I have very straight hair). There are hair powders that are mostly made with silica such as \"Got2b Powderful volumizing powder\" and \"Osis dust it\".\n\nI'd start by mixing 95% corn starch with 5% texturizer, and then experiment from there. You can use a salt shaker to disperse the powder on your hair. I've used those fancy \"powder spray\" pumps before but I found them to be utterly useless because they don't pump out enough product.",

The user reports in the internet (and I mean mainly rosaceagroup.org) report almost all better results then with Kataconazol. Only problem with Climbazole is that AFAIK you can not really buy OTC products in USA, because the FDA did not allow it's use (or made no rules I think -> not allowed to sell products with it), but there is no problem in importing the things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing that makes System 4 Clibmazole Scalp Tonic so interesting for me is not just climbazole (other active is piroctone olamine) , but it is a leave on product (what is much much better then a rinse product like a shampoo) & for me doesn't make my scalp dry, like many shampoos do & the hair do not look oily after applying & is easy to apply. So you can wash your hair with a really mild shampoo (e.g. a baby shampoo that is Malassezia safe without heavy sulfates, I now ordered  Bioderma ABCDerm Shampoo, hope i will get it today). The only bad thing is it really doesn't smell very good. And that you do not know the concentrations of the actives, but climbazole & piroctone olamine is effective in really really small amounts when it is a leave on product, so probably there will be enough in it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI plan to use this Tonic every day till all the Malassezia is gone on my scalp, then just every-some-days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the way the whole line does look not so bad, with a lot of different products for different types of hair/scalp: [https://sim.fi/en-system4](https://sim.fi/en-system4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly I don't know how you guys in America order this the best, I am from Austria and ordered from nicebeauty.com.

They then switched this out to piroctone olamine without much explanation or notice.\n\nI was researching why this may be and it looks like zinc pyrithione has been listed as a category 1B carcinogen and is now banned in cosmetic products in the EU.\n\nWhy is there not more awareness about this?",

I have consulted with three dermatologists specializing in scalp and skin, and all of them said that I would not be a candidate for a hair transplant. (Currently taking finasteride).\n\n# Hypothesis 1: Thyroid Levels\n\nI was told that my thyroid might be an issue, so I had my levels checked, but they were very normal.\n\n# Hypothesis 2: Vitamin D\n\nmy levels are 67 (which is high within the normal range\\[20\\~100\\]), so it’s not a vitamin D issue.\n\n# Hypothesis 3: DHEA \n\nBypassing Finasteride Pathway and Binding Directly to Scalp Androgen Receptors\n\nI used topical dutasteride for about six bottles, and applied MTS (microneedling therapy system) once a month, but I did not see any benefit.\n\n# Hypothesis 4: Nutritional Deficiency\n\nNo, I take daily multivitamins, omega-3, magnesium, probiotics, vitamin C, MSM, CoQ10, alpha lipoic acid, and grape seed extract.\n\n# Hypothesis 5: Diabetes\n\nDiabetes can cause circulation problems. However, I am not obese and am only 30 years old. I don’t think I have diabetes.\n\n# Hypothesis 6: Seborrheic Dermatitis\n\nInterestingly, I did not experience hair loss when I had seborrheic dermatitis. Oddly, my hair loss accelerated rapidly once my seborrheic dermatitis was cured and my facial acne disappeared. I still use a shampoo with piroctone olamine.\n\n# Hypothesis 7: Lack of Nutrition to Hair Follicles\n\nKorea is known for its good cosmetics. I consistently used expensive hair loss tonics (containing niacin, lactobacillus, caffeine, rosemary oil, peppermint oil, dexpanthenol, and various natural ingredients). I have spent an unbelievable amount of money on these products.\n\n# Hypothesis 8: Chronic Inflammation\n\nIn my school days, I always had acne, atopy, oily skin, keratosis pilaris, body acne, and hives. Interestingly, it feels like the inflammation has moved from my sebaceous glands to my hair follicles. (I am currently taking beta-sitosterol to reduce inflammation).\n\n# Hypothesis 9: Causes Similar to Female Pattern Hair Loss?\n\nFor women, DHT is not considered the main cause, as about half of the women experiencing hair loss also lose hair under the ears, sideburns, and back of the neck. This cause has not yet been properly identified.\n\n# Hypothesis 10: Excessive Cortisol and Stress\n\nI think I got stressed because of hair loss, not that hair loss was caused by stress.\n\n# Hypothesis 11: High Prolactin Levels\n\nI am planning to test my hormone levels next week.\n\n",

But I've only just started minoxidil (3 months) and topical dutasteride (1-2 months). I've had some regrowth on top and side temples, but eveything else is still yet to be seen.\n\nIf I were to guess, it was my seborrheic dermatitis that accelerated the hair loss. After I started using keto, my Scalp feels way healthier. Again needs to be seen whether I get hair thickening tho.\n\nThe last thing that I recently found out that I don't think you've considered is healthy gut microbiome. I'm trying to improve it just for general health + mainly hair. Just taking a probiotic supplement isn't gonna cut it. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/PexjQ5oieTw?feature=shared\n\nCheck out this link.

[Link](http://www.nikkietutorials.com/site/2015/05/april-hits-and-oh-god-nos-2015/) \n\nI recently bought some while it was on sale and loved the price for how much you get compared to my normal primer (Hourglass Mineral Viel). Other than a slightly \"clean man\" smell at initial application the stuff seems to actually work really well. It has kept my foundation in place and also helped keeping my oil at bay. I got curious on the ingredients and I didn't know if this stuff is actually going to end up doing me harm!! \n\nIngredient List for Nivea's Site: \nWater, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tapioca Starch, Triceteareth-4 Phosphate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol , Piroctone Olamine, Fragrance.\n\nI know that Glycerin is used in alot of primer water sprays to help foundation to stick but anything else in it I am not familiar with. \n\nThanks in advance for any advice or wisdom!!

        "body": "Yes! But I got out of it! Let me share how just in case that helps. \nMy last, worst ever flare up lasted over a year, I think partly due to moving to a more humid area (and just lower quality of life compared to my past) and partly due to incompetent doctors who wouldn't recognise sebderm if it hit them in the face. My sebderm was always present but under control until it started spreading last year and no longer responded to hydrocortisone cream and nizoral shampoo. It started to affect my whole face instead of just my eyebrows and scalp and boy did it hurt. I spoke to 3 different GPs who were honestly the most clueless people I've ever spoken to. They kept prescribing me medication for rosacea, which I also have but only lightly, and it presents completely differently from sebderm. \n\nThen, a 4th GP gave me antibiotics (low dose). This worked but as I soon as I stopped taking them the sebderm came back with a vengeance (but I have heard from people whose sebderm cleared up permanently after antibiotics, so it does work for some).\n Finally, I went to a dermatologist. She gave me trimovate and elidel cream. The trimovate could only be used for 10 days so... you can probably guess, it worked well but it came back after ten days. The elidel didn't do much. \n\nThen I read a post here on reddit recommending coconut c8 oil and tea tree oil. Started using a mix of those two weeks ago and now my sebderm, for the first time since I got it at 14, is completely gone! All this to say, even after a nightmare year, there is still hope! I hope you find something that works for you!",

I’ve been managing seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp really well with a Vichy anti-dandruff shampoo, which I use 1–2 times per week. It contains the following ingredients:\n\n\tAQUA / WATER - SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE - COCO-BETAINE - GLYCERIN - DIMETHICONE - CETYL ALCOHOL - HYDROXYSTEARYL CETYL ETHER - CARBOMER - CI 19140 / YELLOW 5 - CITRIC ACID - 2-OLEAMIDO-1,3-OCTADECANEDIOL - PPG-5-CETETH-20 - PROPYLENE GLYCOL - SALICYLIC ACID - SELENIUM SULFIDE - SODIUM CHLORIDE - SODIUM HYDROXIDE - SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE - PARFUM / FRAGRANCE\n\nOn other days, I typically use Sebamed Plus Shampoo for sensitive skin, which has these ingredients:\n\n\tAqua (Water), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Hydroxypropyl Oxidized Starch PG-Trimonium Chloride, Piroctone Olamine, Menthol, Parfum (Fragrance), Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, CI 42090 (Blue 1 Lake), CI 47005\n\nI know the transplanted area needs time to heal properly, so I’ve held off using these shampoos for now. However, seborrheic dermatitis tends to flare up if I don’t keep it under control, so I want to know:\n\t1.\tWhen can I safely resume using my Vichy anti-dandruff shampoo?\n\t2.\tShould I wait longer to use the Sebamed shampoo as well, or is it gentler and safe to use earlier?\n\t3.\tAre there any precautions or alternative recommendations for managing seborrheic dermatitis during this healing phase?\n\nI’m following my surgeon’s advice for post-transplant care, but I’d love to hear from others with similar experiences or knowledge. Thanks in advance for your help!",

I asked about piroctone olamine and it said the following: \n\n**Piroctone olamine is sometimes not as recommended as ketoconazole for hair loss treatment, but recent studies and discussions suggest it could be quite effective, potentially even better in certain aspects. The comparison between these two is based on their anti-fungal properties and effects on scalp health, which indirectly influence hair loss and growth.\n\nA study comparing 1% ketoconazole, 1% piroctone olamine, and 1% zinc pyrithione formulations found that all three shampoos were effective in reducing dandruff and hair shedding. However, it was noted that ketoconazole and piroctone olamine also made hair thicker, suggesting potential additional benefits in improving hair shaft thickness beyond just controlling dandruff and related hair shedding. This study indicates that piroctone olamine could be as effective, if not more, in certain conditions compared to ketoconazole, especially when considering hair thickness and scalp health (https://tressless.com/research/nudging-hair-shedding-by-antidandruff-shampoos-a-comparison-of-1-ketoconazole-1-piroctone-olamine-and-1-zinc-pyrithione-formulations-8Ewm).\n\nAnother pilot study with an antimicrobial lotion containing piroctone olamine demonstrated significant reduction in inflammation and increase in hair density for individuals with androgenetic alopecia, suggesting its potential efficacy in treating hair loss (https://tressless.com/research/improvement-in-the-inflammatory-aspect-of-androgenetic-alopecia-a-pilot-study-with-an-antimicrobial-lotion-mZQr).**\n\nIf this is all true, and seems to be given the studies it produced, why is piroctone olamine ignored by Tressless?",

The ingredients are:\nAvene Spring Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Centrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Disodium EDTA, Piroctone Olamine, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Cetearyl Sulphate, Water.\n\nAll suggestions for a replacement appreciated.

I have quite greasy hair so I wash it every other day, every two days. It dried my hair but seemed to remove the itching significantly. \n\nThen I figured that piroctone olamine is an ingredient that helps with keeping things under control too. I used the Bioderma Nodé DS+ (il live in Belgium) at first but it is quite an expensive shampoo. I found out that it is the same ingredient than in Head&Shoulders shampoos so I just use the head&shoudlers ones now and it seems to keep the itching and greasy hair feeling away, as much as the bioderma did. \n\nI also clean my towels and sheets with some antibacterial soap to keep everything clean. \n\nNow, from time to time I put the ordinary squalane with retinol oil on my scalp as it helps to hydrate+dry out the little pimples that I still get.\n\n+ I started noticing some hair growth so I guess that it calmed my anxiety about it and makes me less obsessed which maintains some kind of “virtuous circle”\n\nI hope this helps !",

My face sometimes gets a bit blotchy after a shower but tends to calm down after a while. The PO options from Clever Soap didn't work for me either.\n\nI also use MCT oil. It is, as far as I know, an anti fungal. I know people bang on about it endlessly here but I find it works even though I get oil build up in the pores after using it. It's... nasty but it beats the redness and flakiness, for me at least. That and a calendula balm from Lyonsleaf which has the same after effects and smells like furniture polish.\n\nI know this isn't what you were asking for but I share your pain about the discontinued ZP products and wanted to share what works (to an extent) for me.\n\nGood luck in your search!",

What I mean is, I was unable to rinse my face for a single day and my skin is already scaling, I was looking to make a cream so that I can have a leave-on formula with antimycotic properties.  \nI have some knowledge of chemistry but I was a bit overwhelmed when researching preservatives and emulsifiers for this purpose, so I don't know if what I came up with is adequate.  \n\n\n* Water (64.9%)\n* Virgin hemp seed oil (20%)\n* Green tea wax (10%)\n* Acnacidol BG (3%)\n* Cetearyl Glucoside (1%)\n* Salvacosm 340 (0.5%) <- parabens blend\n* Piroctone olamine (0.5%)\n* Vitamin E (0.1%)  \n\n\nPlease point me in the right direction if my formula is all messed up!  \n\n\nAlso, I have no idea on what Ph I should aim for, and if citric acid is good for acidifying creams.",

This is the first I have heard if it, and it certainly looks interesting.  Do you have any clinical data on its effectiveness?\n\nSebhorrea (I am going to misspell this consistently, sorry) is one of those skin ailments that is 'caused' by any number of things.\n\n'Causes' of course being distinct from 'triggers' in that no one knows what triggers a flare up, in a pathophysiological sense, so the symptoms are treated as if they are the cause.  Seasonal changes and stress, though apparently commonly self-reported by those afflicted, are not treatable in a medical sense and cannot be used in a differential diagnosis.\n\n Off the top of my head:\n\n* Fungus/Yeast\n* Auto-immune reaction\n* Inflammatory response (catch-all for 'body is doing something to defend itself from something not actually harmful') \n\nI recall that treatments generally fall under one or a combination of:\n\n* Steroid creams\n* Anti-fungal (nizoral usually)\n* Topical immune suppressant (Protopic)\n* Keratolytics (salicylic acid)\n* Other treatments that work because ???, like coal tar\n\nLet me know if I am mistaken in any of this, or if there is new research I should look at.  I have seen promising stuff regarding biofilm disruptors using xylitol and ... some other thing that is used in perfume base... farnesol? These work to control the yeast by denying them structure to build their colony and by selectively targeting the mazzelia the the normal biome can regenerate.\n\nCan you go over your ingredient list and explain why you picked each?\n \n*Note: I am not a medical doctor, so please take this information as it should be taken, which is half-remembered text-books read on the toilet by someone who reads too much non-fiction.*",

I don’t expect people to have tried this specific product, but I was wondering if anyone could help me look over the ingredients?\n\nAbout the product, as described on the official ACO website (translated):\n\n“ACO Spotless Daily Face Cream is a moisturising gel cream formulated for oily and blemish prone skin. This gel cream calms and nourishes the skin after cleansing, and helps to prevent blemishes and clogged pores/skin congestion.\n\nContains mattifying ingredients that absorb excess sebum and leaves the skin matte and refreshed. The gel is oil-free and non-comedogenic. Use on the whole face after cleansing. Fragrance-free.”\n\nIngredient list:\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Oryza Sativa Starch, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Allantoin, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Piroctone Olamine, Phenoxyethanol\n\nMy skin type:\nOily combination skin. Sensitive. Kind of blemish/acne prone. Prone to skin congestion.\n\nI’m aware YMMW and that people respond differently to different ingredients. I apologise if this is a stupid question… I’m not very knowledgeable on ingredients. I recognise acids, alcohols and oils, but that’s about it.\n\nIf anyone is good at ingredients, please let me know if this seems like an overall safe product for oily combination acne-prone sensitive skin. I understand it isn’t black or white and I will take the answers lightly. I just need some guidance.\n\nAre there any obvious red flags? Anything that is known to not work well for **some** people? Does it seem **generally** safe and worth trying? :)\n\nSorry again if this isn’t the right place and question… Let me know if that’s the case, but kindly refrain from leaving snarky comments.\n\nThanks in advance! :)",

I bought a pure powder of it, which I occasionally use in mega quantities (like half a teaspoon). After doing that, my scalp feels nuked (very dried out and very \"clean\"), and applying any topicals with alcohol is painful. I very much expect this increases absorption to some degree. I just did a wash like that, and applied 13 pumps of CosmeRNA. Why? Because I want to see if I can get a bigger and more obvious effect on the itch and daily shed, and if it lasts beyond 2-3 days. If it still only lasts a few days, I will officially be disappointed. I'm very aware many here are against proclamations of the relevance of the itch and daily shed, but based on the polls, most people seem to think these metrics have value. I'll report the result.\n\nMark",

Use on face & body, all ages and skin types\".  \nThe cream was quite moisturizing on my face. It has a light, pleasing fragrance (which coming from me is saying something – fragrance typically triggers migraines for me and I usually avoid it like the plague). It has a very delicate honey-milky-vanilla scent that fades fairly swiftly after application.  \n Unfortunately, it wasn’t quite heavy enough for me on its own (my skin is quite badly dehydrated at the moment). It’s a cream that I would really like to try the slug method with. I finished my bottle, sadly, and didn’t get the opportunity to try Vaseline over the top of it (I only just learned about the slug life!) which I think would be fantastic for dehydrated skin - it contains some really nice skin-repairing ingredients. I’m definitely planning on getting it again and I’m going to try out some of their lip balms, too. \n\nA word of caution: this cream does contain numerous oils, so if that’s a known acne-trigger or sensitivity of yours perhaps steer clear! It didn’t break me out and I’m usually quite prone to pimples if something disturbs my skin; however, YMMV. The company is also very responsive and helpful about answering questions about their products. \n\nFull list of ingredients copied from MooGoo’s website: Aqua (H₂O’s Fancy Name), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol (Plant-Based Emulsifying Wax) and Polysorbate 60 (Food Grade Emulsifier), Glyceryl Stearate (Food Grade Emulsifier),  Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Aloe Vera), Squalane (Olive), Piroctone Olamine (Olamine Salt), Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride (Guar Gum), Mel (Honey), Allantoin, Acetum (Apple Cider Vinegar), Natural Pear Fragrance, Natural Vanilla Fragrance, Hydrolysed Milk Protein (For Skin Elasticity), Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Humulus Lupulus (Hops) Extract.",

It’s antifungal and anti-inflammatory — really helpful for keeping SD calm without irritating the scalp.\n\n⸻\n\nApplication Tip\n\nAlways leave Vichy or Nizoral on your scalp (or beard) for at least 2 full minutes before rinsing. That contact time is crucial for the active ingredients to work.\n\n⸻\n\nHair Loss Meds I Take\n\t•\tFinasteride 1mg daily\n\t•\tDutasteride once a week\n\t•\tMinoxidil foam once daily (started 4 weeks post-op)\n\nThis combo has helped support hair regrowth and maintain results post-transplant.",

I healed these issuses but since that time I started to suffer from different symptoms like weird breakouts on my face, neck, chest, breast and back. Sometimes I would wake up with weird, white threads in my mouth. I noticed that I can't concentrate, I'm irritated easily, sometimes even aggressive. I have anxiety and deppresive thougths . I'm often bloated to the point that I look like pregnant and when I press my belly on left, lower side of belly it hurts. I got my blood and stool tests done and I was told that I have neutropenia, low ferritin, b12 \n folic acid levels. Icreased CRP level. And that I have h.pylori infection. \n\nI was given Pylera antibiotic and PPI which I started to take and now I'm on day 7/10. My skin started to get crazy few days ago and initially I didn't think of fungal overgrowth but then I remembered that few years ago I've read article about that. \n\nAll the symptoms I have show that I may deal with fungal overgrowth on my skin/in my body: \n1. I was and I'm currently on antibiotics. \n2. I have dealt with candida issues down there in the past. The infections were recurrent although I was using oral antifungal. \n3. I'm on  which, I've read, increase risk of fungal overgrowth\n4. I've read that candida and h pylori go hand to hand \n5. Breakouts started when I finished first antibiotic therapy - that time it was metronidazole \n6. I have sweet tooth:) I'm vegetarian and dietitian and I really eat clean and healthy in general but I love sugar, especially fructose in fruits. I could be frutarian with no problem haha I don't know if it's related but internet myths say that fungus is feed by sugar\n7. I had a 1 year long period (it was 2 years ago) when I was under massive amount of stress - my sister got leukemia \n\nNow, being on anti h pylori antibiotics, I'm breaking out like I never had. Besides the reasons I've written above, the things that indicate that I'm dealing with FA is that is suits to all the FA symptoms I've read about in different articles. The worst breakout is on my face and neck. I have it also on my chest,back, breast and a few pimples on my belly. It's in form of small, red bumps, around half of them being filled with white puss. They pop very easily for example when I run my fingernail over them. All the infected area is itchy, I want to scrach it. After washing the skin is red and irritated. Today I've tried to wash it with my boyfriends shampoo that contain piroctone olamine and selenium sulfide and then I put some clotrimazole cream 2% but for now I don't see any improvement. \n\nI'm planning to finish h pylori eradication and then focus on restoring my gut and skin health. I have some itraconazole pills, do you think it's safe to combine it with antibiotics to help my skin? \nI also ordered today some FA safe spf, moisturizer. \n\nWell, that would be it. I know it's quite long post. Please let me know if I may have right conclusions about the whole thing. \n\nThe photo is my poor skin today morning (before using antifungal shampoo and clotrimazole)",

Of course, best to check in with your doctor about what to do if possible to make sure products you use won't interact with their treatment plan. \n\nI like sulfur masks/soaps when I'm \"breaking out\"after antibiotic use. Starface (in the US) makes a nice one.\n\nI've also had some luck with incorporating probiotic rich foods like yogurt, kombucha, kimchi, and a probiotic supplement to help recolonize what the antibiotics may have put out of balance. \n\nGood luck and try to be patient! Fix one thing at a time and give yourself time and space to heal and find balance again💜",

The itchiness isn't soothed that much but I now feel a healthy scalp. Doctor had recommended sebiprox before, which did absolutely nothing for me. Oh and I do use it more than recommended.

They are **not** clustered together, in fact they tend to be far apart from each other and they are usually on the sides and back of my head. One I have now is over two centimetres in in size, is very swollen and painful. It hurts when I move my head and when I put my head on the pillow at night. Oh, sometimes they get hot to the touch.\n\nI used tea tree oil, salicylic acid and piroctone olamine but to little effect. When I first starting getting them, I saw a doctor and I was told it was a blocked hair follicle. He told me to just use dandruff shampoo, which I've tried to do. I've tried changing pillowcases frequently just in case that might be contributing to the problem. I'm worried that whenever it does finally go away, it will leave a scar and possibly a bald patch. \n\nI should probably go back to the doctor for a second opinion but the doctors surgery in my town is severely backlogged at the moment and it's impossible to get an appointment in less than two weeks. I wanted to get an appointment while I still have the bump, so I could show the doctor. Maybe they could drain it and I could get some relief.\n\nMy dad used to call them \"corks\" because when they were popped, loads of waxy/oily liquid would come out of them. Any ideas as to what it could be? What can I do?",

If they truly are blocked or infected hair follicles then i would give the BHA another try, and buy it from a company that posts clear info about it’s ph. The BHA 9 treatment from Paula’s Choice is a good spot treatment. The Cln shampoo may help with both the oiliness and the bumps. Check all you hair products and laundry products for Methylisothiazolinone (MI) and methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI). If you have an allergy to those products this may be the reaction.",

It hasn't irritated me, and it has helped to subdue both the inflammation and bumpies I had growing on the side of my nose, and also the redness has been reduced dramatically! I've only been using it three days, she sent it to me in the mornings, but I've put it at night too, just because I'm still waiting to buy the active she sent to use at night (soolantra).  \n\n\nThe bumpies I get are these:   \n\n\n[photo on monday morning 17 oct](https://preview.redd.it/ci3p4a7e87v91.jpg?width=1718&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6a1d2e29aa0c7f2eac482a45c2915e43779bece)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[my face yesterday, I'VE ONLY APPLIED IT ON THE SIDES OF MY NOSE AND FOREHEAD](https://preview.redd.it/9soke5bj87v91.jpg?width=1076&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fdfcdfd3ff585b198305fc98908be372eee8f33)\n\nMy cheeks are better because of the tretinoin.   \nI'm in Mexico, so no idea if this is available in other countries but, thought I would recommend.The fragrance is strong but after it gets absorbed I don't find it lingering, I'm also usually sensitive to that and I haven't had much issue.\n\nI'm sorry i don't have proper before and afters, or before and afters at all, but I'll try to take a photo later.  \nedit to add a photo.

It's a bit pricy for me so I switched to another piroctone olamine shampoo and my dandruff came back with a vengeance. Over the last 8 months I've tried so many things: prescription, OTC, natural. I didn't want to go straight back to the past shampoo that worked because i had trouble affording it and I know it's important to rotate shampoos. I have my nostrils under very good control by switching from face wash to only cleansing with c8 and c10 MCT oil. I also use it on my scalp after washing and it helps some. The shampoos help somewhat but they really dry out and/or irritate my scalp, even though I follow with a very gentle, natural moisturizing dandruff conditioner with tea tree oil and salicylic acid, and apply my MCT oil. \n\nI did just go ahead and order the last shampoo that worked well, it's very gentle and has the probiotics, piroctone olamine and I think maybe some herbals. It doesn't irritate or dry out my skin. I have curly hair that doesn't need to be washed every day, but I find for my scalp it needs to be washed every day or I get greasy buildup and flaking. It's hard because the dandruff shampoos say to only use a couple times a week after the first couple weeks, but my build up and flakes come back within a day or two, then my skin gets irritated using dandruff shampoos every day or two. I plan to use the probiotic piroctone olamine shampoo a couple times a week, but I need to clean my scalp in between without irritating it. I ordered the shampoo counterpart to my natural dandruff conditioner, it's a very gentle herbal dandruff shampoo, and I also ordered CeraVe gentle hydrating shampoo that is supposed to heal the skin barrier. I want to try them between washes with the \"real\" dandruff shampoo. Has anyone experienced similar issues with cleansing their scalp between dandruff shampoo days, or keeping it under control between? \n\nI have sensitive skin that reacts to a lot of fragrances, sulfates etc, essential oils, and most dandruff shampoos have sulfate and fragrances and essential oils. I'm kind of wondering if using dandruff shampoos is making my sd worse. I think I've found a good solution, but if this doesn't work I'm thinking of just ditching dandruff shampoos and switching to just the CeraVe gentle hydrating shampoo and a similar gentle conditioner to try to calm by scalp down and rebalance my skin.",

I’ve been a lurker on this sub for awhile but now it’s time to share my own experience and hopefully gain some advice.\n\nI have very clog-prone, acne prone, oily sensitive skin, very redness-prone and with the occasional itchiness. \nWhile I didn’t think my acne, blackheads or sebaceous clogs were necessarily fungal but rather hormonal, I do follow a FA safe routine as I find many FA triggers to also trigger breakouts in me, as well as ingredients that soothe rosacea for my redness and flushing. So basically I’ve been using a combination of sensitive skin-safe and rosacea-safe (mild BHAs, calming ingredients such as mugwort and centella) as well as FA safe, anti bacterial products. I also use hypochlorous acid spray plus hormonal acne treatments (bc pills, anti androgens etc). \nDespite all this, my skin still struggles with sebaceous plugs that turn into acne, and if I am not on top of my routine all the time I get the occasional bumps and texture. Plus the obvious breakouts if I use FA triggers (fatty acids, oils or esters etc.)\nI also think it’s worth mentioning that my mom has seborrheic dermatitis which she treated with sulfur and selenium products in the past, and while I am not sure whether my skin’s issues have anything to do with SebDerm, I’m seeing a lot of overlap on reddit with shampoos that work for FA and SebDerm.\n\nRecently I was having a stubborn breakout on my forehead (little red bumps) that were not budging despite my usual attempts at exfoliating, using salicylic acid or clay masks.\nAnd lo and behold!! I tried my roommate’s ketoconazole 2% shampoo on my forehead on a whim, and I must admit I was quite scared at the ingredient list because of all my issues, but it worked amazing and cleared all my bumps and redness in a couple of days!! Ive been attempting using it on one side of my face (cheeks) and my pores look sooo clear and free of texture!! I am genuinely flabbergasted as I was hesitant to put shampoo on my face but the results speak for themselves!\n\nNow as for my questions to the lovely people on this sub…I’ve read that FA can become resistant to ketoconazole over time. \n1. Can I use ketoconazole every day or do I have to cycle? I’m afraid of building resistance and having this not work for me anymore in the long run. Must I cycle with selenium products to destroy the FA biofilm if I want to keep using ketoconazole?\n\nSecondly, I’ve been looking into other products and ingredients mentioned a lot on this sub and seems that zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide and ketoconazole are the winners (piroctone olamine seems to not work well enough for quite a few people from what I’ve  read on here). So far Ive seen H&S, Selsun shampoos with zinc pyrithione and Vanicream soaps recommended on here as alternatives to ketoconazole. However, the ingredient lists on these products are honestly scarier to me than those on the ketoconazole shampoo. Fragrances, stereates, SLS… \n\n2. If these ingredients are in a product which combats FA, does that mean I can ignore my usual triggers and just go for it? Usually these ingredients, especially the stereates, fatty acids and oils would be disastrous for me. Is there any way to maybe find alternatives to these shampoos and soaps? Do I need to be searching for alternatives which are meant for the face?\n\n",

        "body": "I was struggling with fungal acne for the better part of a year after taking some antibiotics for a yeast infection (how ironic! lol). I tried every face product imaginable for my skin that’s prone to clogged pores and closed comedones with the occasional hormonal acne.\n\nI can’t say what will work for you, but I’ll share what worked for me:\n-switched all my beauty and makeup products to FA safe products. I used the app Skin Sort meticulously to figure out what would work. I have thick curly hair so i was afraid switched my shampoo and conditioner would ruin my hair but i found the Paul Mitchell invisible line has worked rly well for me. \n\n-used nizarol every 2-3 days and let it sit on my face for 5-10 minutes\n\n-this sounds strange but i used foot fungal cream on my face very lightly in the affected fungal areas which were mostly my cheeks in chin 1-2 times a day.\n\n-i also iced my face every morning since fungal acne hates the cold. I took an ice cube wrapped in a paper towel. Also helped with my puffy allergy prone eyes lol \n\n-i stopped all facial cleansers, toners, serums and moisturizers. There was always a “be gentle with your face!” rhetoric so i used to use fresh paper towels and patted my face down but turns out i wasn’t exfoliating enough. I used to use chemical exfoliators but it ruined my skin. \n\n-to take makeup off i use a vitamin c miscllar water, wash it off with lukewarm water and dry scrub my skin lightly with a hand towel i switch out every 3-4 days and spray my face with hypochlorous spray to kill any bacteria.\n\n-probably the most important for me; nutrition! I had to cut out processed sugar and started taking probiotics. I rly think this was one of the biggest issues i had. \n\nThankfully with ALL that, 5 months later my skin is SO much better. My cheeks are smooth and I get the occasional hormonal deep pimple but i just slap a pimple patch on it until it goes away. \n\nHope this helps!!",

        "body": "1. I don’t use FA shampoos for my face frequently, it can damage your skin barrier over time because of how drying it is. Maybe once every two weeks or once a month, as maintenance, once you cleared your active FA. I do cycle keto with zinc pyrithione for my SCALP (keto twice a week, zinc pyr on other days), because of the resistance built up (yes it does happen, so I really would not recommend antifungal shampoos daily for your face, use it for maintenance or emergencies imo) \n\n2. I did not bother checking whether my ketoconazole shampoo (Pristin, it’s the mildest out of all my seb derm shampoos) has any of my usual triggers or not, because it always worked for me (scalp and face) and I don’t use it daily. Selsun (the red cap one) is totally fungal safe if you are worried about triggering a breakout, but I wouldn’t use selsun daily if it’s for your face, since again, it’s super drying. \n\nI don’t think you have to find one made specifically for your face, since it’s just meant to be applied for a few minutes and washed off. But I heard good things about the de la Cruz sulfur mask if you want something specifically for your face. \n\nP.S. I had both Seb derm and FA, with a mix of closed comedones and clogged pores.",

    "body": "Will try and post pics later, new user, still working out Reddit... this is long, apologies.\n\n37F, UK based. Long term atopic eczema sufferer, but kept well controlled with emollients, havent used any steroid creams for about 8 years now.\n\nAt around 3 months post-partum with my second baby (now 7 months old) I developed a very bad bout of TE, along with severely greasy hair and a very grainy, sore scalp with hard scales and tender, burning sensations. Thought it was irritation from dry shampoo after c section, so stopped that.\n\nAssumed it was all post-partum shedding, but my scalp has been on FIRE and is red raw, to the point where functioning day to day is tricky. Over the last few months I have done the following:\n\n1. Saw a trichologist who said TE and irritation, try aloe shampoo and wash hair more - no improvement.\n\n2. Saw a second trichologist who said TE and \"mild\" seb derm. Gave me a scalp treatment that seemed to make things worse and an anti-dandruff shampoo with piroctone olamine - no improvement.\n\n3. Saw GP who did bloods (ferritin was very low, so I luckily managed to get an iron infusion via my work at the end of June), felt more energetic, but no change in hairloss or scalp symptoms. GP also advised some betacap and T Gel for my scalp - T Gel irritated the shit out of my scalp and made it soooo itchy, but did seem to lift some scales. Couldn't really use again though. Betacap didn't do much apart from sting and maybe take the edge off the burning.\n\n4. Paid to see a private dermatologist who said TE, AGA and a very bad seb derm, but could also be a demodex folliculitis or (hopefully not) LPP, so a biopsy would be a good idea if treatment doesnt work. In the meantime to use nizoral shampoo as a soak for 20 mins, plus nizoral cream mixed with elidel topically at night. She said ivermectin and metronidazole orally might be a good idea in due course and gave me some bactroban nasally for staph eradication.\nWell, I had a *horrendous* reaction to nizoral 2% shampoo after about 5 mins. My scalp burned like never before, like a chemical burn, it was so awful I was in tears and nearly went to A&E! The keto cream is ok, but doesn't seem to do much, maybe reduces the scales a bit. I am reluctant to use the elidel, as it stung quite a lot on patch testing and it seems like pretty strong stuff with a load of side effects.\n\n5. I have tried; not washing, which made things worse, washing daily, helps temporarily, baby shampoo, awful burning, E45 shampoo, made more hair fall out, H&S, no improvement, Phillip Kingsley, no better/no worse, TBS ginger shampoo, possible mild improvement, but itchy, Oilatum (ciclopirox), helps the most with the scales, but makes my scalp very tight and itchy afterwards. I have got some Dercos (selenium), but a bit anxious to try it after the Nizoral debacle. I have been regularly washing pillow cases and looking for food triggers etc.\n\nI am at my wits end and today have developed sores around my mouth and on my lips, so am really worried it is now spreading to my face. If anyone has any advice I would be super duper grateful. I have seen lots of things about MCT oil or squalane... I don't think my scalp would cope with ACV rinses. We can't get zinc pyrithione products easily in the UK.\n\nTL:DR\nHaving a likely seb derm nightmare on my scalp postpartum, along with TE, nothing seems to be working and my scalp is red and raw with scales. HELP!\n",

Since you're unable to easily obtain Zinc P shampoos/products I would certainly suggest looking into C8 MCT Oil. It's cleared my facial/eyebrow sebderm and many folks within this community have had phenomenal results using it on their scalp. I personally use Bulletproof brand Brain Octane C8 MCT Oil. I apply topically and also add a teaspoon to my coffee every day to help with internal inflammation as well. You may need an extremely gentle baby shampoo to wash the MCT Oil out....maybe Happy Cappy Daily Shampoo would be a good choice if available in the UK, maybe via Amazon? This particular brand/non-medicated type for Daily use has received high praise in this sub (but I've only used their medicated version with Zinc P and have had extraordinary results).\n\nIf nothing seems to be working after 2 weeks of using C8 MCT Oil, this could indeed be related to demodex mites. In that case maybe look into ivermectin based lice shampoos or topical ivermectin. Wishing you the best, hope this helps a bit! 🙏",

Fyi, i use oil control shampoos as a counter for excessive sebum.\n\n**To start off i've noticed that some specific shampoos, f.e some H&S ones, with similar ingredients in them, tend to be more aggrevvating towards rosacea and they usually leave a flared up feeling post wash that can last, depending on how serious your rosacea is.

I did notice that, post using it, my hair look more thin, shedding and thats a bit worrying.

You can mitigate the consequences by avoiding shampoo run down your face/wash well post shampoo etc...\n\nYou can drop your recommendations below as well as the ingredients involved in the products you use.",
