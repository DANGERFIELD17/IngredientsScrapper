This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

        "body": "The \"Bio-Protein Care and infused with Glutamic Amino Serum\" is not doing anything in the formula except giving their marketing people something to talk about.\n\nThe shampoo is also not having much effect on frizz as the only ingredients that might last through rinse-off include the Guar (cationic polymer) and maybe the dimethiconol (silicone).  Although in reality, the dimethiconol mostly gets rinsed away too.\n\nIn the conditioner, the ingredients that are having the greatest impact include the Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethiconol/Silsesquioxane Copolymer, and Behentrimonium Chloride.\n\nThese are all ingredients you can find in other formulas. \n\nThe idea that the smoothing performance is unlike anything on the market is debatable. There are likely lots of products that can give you the smoothing effect of these products. However, using a combination of very good formulas (these are), an appealing fragrance, and solid marketing, you can come to believe it is the best you've ever used.  Just know that you haven't used everything and there are lots of products that you would be happy with if only you could test them on a blinded basis.",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

I would apply a thick layer in the PM and my skin would have totally absorbed it by morning. My PD was GONE in 3 days. I really feel for those of you struggling with this...it is such a frustrating condition!

Got the product from Paytm ONDC for Rs. 199 (50% off coupon).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Quantity:** 150ml\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Packaging:** The cleanser comes in a cute pump packaging. Pump can be twisted to lock and unlock which will be helpful for travel. Refer to the image below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cleanser packaging](https://preview.redd.it/vqxzomkuovuc1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=649c3171c0244b1d9614b79e9d103d984e140049)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cleanser texture:** The texture is creamy as the name suggests. Very similar to Cetaphil gentle cleanser, just a little more creamier. Consistency is runny just like Cetaphil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cleanser texture](https://preview.redd.it/ag9wyjnfqvuc1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6d8189d598a85417d5eb3b24cc7079240c65177)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven though it is Soap-free and very similar to Cetaphil gentle cleanser, it still lathers up quite well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Lathering](https://preview.redd.it/luyjpocoqvuc1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c058bb3a9a6ff7f29d07661e7861e8e7084c6833)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Experience:** The cleanser cleansed my face very well. Lathered up decently and the application on my face was very gentle. It felt as if I was applying a body lotion on my face. Skin felt soft and clean after wash and face was not stretchy or dry. I used this cleanser as second cleanser in my routine after removing off my sunscreen using micellar water. I did not face any breakouts or bumps on my face so far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe  cleanser is fragrance free. However it has that medicinal smell like other simple cleansers. Smell is a bit different and weird but not overpowering or irritating at all so can be ignored.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, it is a really good gentle cleanser which does not strip my face off of essential oil but still cleanses pretty well. It seems like a suitable replacement for my daily cleanser which is the simple refreshing facial wash. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough it has only been a couple of days since I started using it so take this review as an initial impression for now. Will update the post after using it for a longer duration or if I face any issues with the product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to shoot your questions/queries and do let me know if I have missed out on anything since this is my first review here.\n\n&#x200B;",

After all, skincare for me is therapeutic and I don't wanna get bored doing it.\n\n**TL;DR** I love the Oxecure Ultra Gentle Moisturizer.  Oxecure cleanser irritated my skin. I still love Human Heart Nature Nourishing  Cleanser.\n\n**Oxecure Ultra Gentle Moisturizer***Ingredients:*  Water,  Glycerin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, C15-19 Alkane,  Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/vp Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polydecene,  Propanediol, Glyceryl Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, PEG-100 Stearate,  Squalane, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin,  Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA,  Panthenol, Alpha-glucan Oligosaccharide, Potassium Hydroxide,  Maltodextrin, Polymnia Sonchifolia Root Juice, Ceteareth-25, Propylene  Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Cetyl Alcohol, BHT,  Lactobacillus, Pantolactone, Behenic Acid, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol,  Ceramide NS, Ethylhexylglycerin, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract,  Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS, Caprooyl Phytosphingosine,  Caprooyl Sphingosine, Ascrobyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Glyceryl Oleate,  Lecithin, Tocopherol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Calendula  Officinalis Flower Extract, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Chamomilla  Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hypericum Perforatum  Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Tilia Cordata Flower Extract\n\n*Notable ingredients:* 5 types of ceramides - Ceramide NP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS paired with Cholesterol and fatty acids - Caprooyl Phytosphingosine & Caprooyl Sphingosine to mimic skin's barrier function.\n\nAlso has glycerin, panthenol, pantolactone, lactobacillus, squalane, and aloe extract.\n\nFor reference I've tried the well-loved **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream** which unfortunately broke me out. I also hate its texture and how it sits on top of my skin. Then there's the **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Soothing Gel** which gave me a more pleasant experience than the cream. I have gone three bottles of it already. So yea, I loved it but I also found it boring. Like it's just your regular moisturizer - *Oh no, OP discovered how moisturizer works.*\n\nAnd oxecure moisturizer came into the picture. From the list of ingredients above it is way moooore extensive than the ceramide gel so I was afraid it would break me out. Fortunately, it didn't. In fact, I like it better than the ceramide gel! It is lightweight but you'll know you have applied it unlike with the gel which absorbs completely with my skin. Nevertheless, I still like it for that coz I feel like the previous products I have applied are sealed. It also doesn't pill with my sunscreen. One drawback - it is expensive. 700 pesos for 75 ml.\n\nAlso soothes my skin when it is irritated especially when the horror of using the Oxecure cleanser happened.\n\n**Oxecure ph 5.5 Gentle Cleanser***Ingredients:*  Water,  Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine,  Glycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate,  Cocamide MEA, Citric Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Potassium  Sorbate, Disodium EDTA, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Ethylhexylglycerin,  Ceramide 3, Garcinia Mangostana (Mangosteen) Peel Extract, Centella  Asiatica Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Sctutellaria  Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinesis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla  Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root  Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Aloe  Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\nSurfactants: Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), Cocamidopropyl Betaine (CAPB), Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids\n\nFrom the first week of using it, I really liked it. It didn't dry my skin out. However, days after my skin started to turn red and patchy whenever I used it. I don't know which ingredient/s sensitized my skin. I'm pretty sure not the SLES and CAPB as they are present to Celeteque cleanser (which I liked). And considering it has lot of hydrating and moisturizing ingredients, kinda bummer this turned out to be a holy fail for me. My body enjoys it now tho. Still, for me it is worth trying coz who knows it might work perfectly for you.\n\nA hunt for a cleanser started. I was using Celeteque Hydration Cleanser for years already. I didn't have any problems with it except that sometimes I feel like it kinda dries my skin especially when my skin is retinizing from tretinoin use. Still I should've stuck with *if ain't broke, don't fix it* mantra.\n\nSo one day I was at Watsons, just the usual window shopping of products. And I stumbled upon Human Heart Nature products and saw the **nourishing** variant cleanser. It brought back memories when I was just starting with skincare. When I was hopeless and felt like every products I used were not helping with my skin concerns, that cleanser gave me hope. I experienced the real definition of gentle cleansing after trying harsh scrubs and whatnot on my face.\n\n*Ingredients:*  water, decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, glycerin, Solanum lycopersicum  (tomato) fruit extract, carrageenan, tocopherol, sodium lactate, sodium gluconate, dicaprylyl ether, glyceryl oleate, hydrogenated palm  glycerides citrate, parfum, levulinic acid, sodium levulinate, phytic  acid, p-anisic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid\n\n*Surfuctants:* decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside - derived from coconut so be warry if you're sensitive to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo fast forward I bought a bottle of it. I used it for a week before giving my verdict. And now I can say that it is still the gentlest cleanser I have ever used. My skin feels supple whenever I use it. Although it has now a different packaging from what I can remember, it's still my first love. That feeling when everything feels right.\n\n*Hoy vevs iba na 'yan.*",

    "body": "Hair Type: Thin, 2B/C Curl Patterns, Oily scalp, prone to hairfall\n\nSome hair background:\nSo I switched to using silicone and sulphate free haircare on a whim back in 2017. To my surprise, this changed my previously mostly straight hair to pretty curly. I learnt about CGM afterwards but since that seemed like a lot of effort, I just stuck to using CG friendly products and was happy with what my hair looked like. Cut to 3 months ago, when I moved to a new place with a really humid climate and my hair fall became like 10 fold. I tried going back to products that had worked for me in the past but nothing helped. Eventually, I thought, that the increased frizziness caused by humidity was the cause of the hair fall and since no product seemed to make my hair soft and silky like before, I decided to go back to silicones. A combination that helped my hair fall to some extent was Bblunt Intense Moisture Shampoo (the blue one) and Loreal Professional Serie Quinoa Protein Hair Mask (used this as conditioner after every wash). But this combination also did make my hair straighter than it had been in recent years. Decided to give the BBlunt Curly Hair range a try (the pink color one). This range does contain Silicones, so it is not strictly CG friendly but it has worked for me. I do not use any leave-in products to style my hair, but I don't mind some frizz. The curls I get from just these 3 products are pretty impressive, as good as any other CG friendly shampoo/conditioners I have used in the past. And my hair fall though still not as less as it was 6 months ago, is definitely better. Details below.\n\n1) Bblunt Curly Hair Prepoo (Pink and white tub packaging)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Vera Extract, Cocos (Coconut)Water, Aayla mido propyltrimonium Chloride/Acrylamide Copolymer, Citric Acid, PEG-90M, Parfum (Perfume)\n\nThoughts: Definitely my favourite of the 3. I have been looking for a  pre-shampoo product to add to my routine. Oiling and Aloeing have not worked for me. I have previously used some hair masks that said they can be used before shower but they were thick and creamy and impossible to spread properly on semi-wet or dry hair. THIS product is everything I wanted. It is a gel-like consistency, spreads super easily. I usually brush out my hair before showering and this is when I lose the most hair. Since this product claims at helping in detangling I decided to use this before I brush my hair and the hair I lost was significantly less! During and post-shower, my hair maintains great slip!  This has the potential to be HG for me. It has a pleasant coconutty smell, but the fragrances in these products do not last too long, which is nice (The loreal mask makes my hair smell like a salon even 2 days later).\n\nRepurchase Status: WRP Definitely!\n\n2) Bblunt Curly Hair Shampoo (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Cocamidopropyl Retain, Decyl Glucoside, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Acrylates Copolymer, Cocamide MEA, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol, PEG-150 Distearate, Polysilicone-29, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Menthol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine,TriticumVulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polysorbate-80, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Parfum (Perfume).\n\nThoughts: It is a shampoo that does its job. It cleans my oily scalp well without stripping it too much. It does not lather and spread as well as the blue BBlunt shampoo but that is to be expected as this one does not have SLS. One thing I have to mention is that near my roots this is the only product from the 3 that I used, and I noticed that the hair in that area did have some curls (usually hair close to my roots does not curl up), so this shampoo is definitely doing something right. Smells pretty fresh (like a cactus? or something softer than that lol) cant describe it. But again the smell does not linger post-shower.\n\nRepurchase Status: Maybe (I have a bunch of other shampoos lying around that I have to finish up first post-monsoon. If using any of those increases my hair fall again, will return to this)\n\n3) Bblunt Curly Hair Conditioner (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Behentrimonium, Methosulfate, Isopropyl Myristate, Dimethicone, Almond Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Silicone Quaternium, Polyquaternium-7, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cococoyl Satosire, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Polysorbate-20, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Panthenol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, MAgnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Trideceth-12, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Dipropylene Glycol, Perfume\n\nThoughts: When I first used it I felt like it was super light and would not do much conditioning, but to my surprise when I rinsed it out, my hair had great slip, and detangled very easily. Some of that I will say must be because of the prepoo, but this conditioner also must be contributing. I guess since I was using the super thick loreal mask as conditioner previously, that's why this conditioner feels very light to me, but if it's doing its job, then it's ok of course. This smells like something sweet... white chocolate or marzipan. Overall I like it, and in combination with the prepoo, my hair is a lot softer than the loreal mask. \n\nRepurchase Status: Probably (again have a bunch of conditioners, i wish to use up first)\n\nI am a bit confused that even with silicones, how do these products work so well in giving me curls. Maybe I just don't know enough about how silicones work. But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down, I can use my Fix My Curls Cleansing Shampoo once in a while, I guess.",

But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down\n\nThat's because silicones are not the devil that cg hair community paints them out to be... Silicones are nothing but emollients just like natural oils that cg community likes to sing praises about... Except silicones are better than natural oils at their job of calming down the frizz and are lighter. And about weighing down, would your hair feel weighed down if you continuously apply oil without washing it off? Yes, yes you will. And what are oils again? Emollients same as a silicones. You see the similarity and the comparison. It took me a while to get out of the influencer-fed info that SILICONES WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY CURLY HAIR... Because I use sulphate free shampoo (wow shampoo at that) and silicone conditioner and feel no difference.\n\nSome people cannot tolerate silicones because that's how their *individual* hair is... Just like some people can't tolerate hyaluronic acid or a niacinamide serum. But this fear of silicones and this blanket statement that silicones are bad for curly hair comes from lack of education and knowledge about them. And if you have any doubt, feel free to ask.",

Aldi replaced it with Formic Acid for which CosDNA has no irritant/acne score, but did replace Laureth-10 with Laureth-4 which is worse according to CosDNA (but it’s very low on the ingredients list). \n\nAldi foaming wash has added Lactic Acid lower down on the list (Moisturising in low concentrations).\n\nBoth kinds of Aldi wash have added Glycerin.\n\nAt first glance, Aldi improved their face wash while Simple made theirs possibly slightly worse. \n\nAll product images here https://imgur.com/a/Y2qE1LZ",

I got pH strips and have been entertaining myself looking for things to test; here are some new products in my collection.  \n\n**Sonia Kashuk \"Resurface\" Gentle Exfoliating Wash, Target, $15/4.2 oz/125 ml, pH ~7 [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_011a202371.html)**  \n*ingredients*  \n> Water (aqua), diatomaceous earth, glyceryl stearate se, stearic acid, glyceryl stearate, cocamide mea, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, glycerin, vitis vinifera (grape) seed oil, glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice) root extract, rheum rhaponticum root extract, cyathea medullaris leaf extract, ethylhexylglycerin, steareth-21, ceteareth-20, panthenol, polyquaternium-7, aloe barbadensis leaf juice powder, methyldihydrojasmonate, carbomer, disodium edta, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, chlorphenesin, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, benzyl alcohol, methylisothiazolinone, titanium dioxide (ci 77891)  \n\nThings I like:  \n* Not expensive  \n* Great for exfoliating legs pre-shave  \n* Unscented and fragrance free  \n* Licorice root extract (!)  \n* Non-foaming, non-oily  \nThings I don't:  \n* Fine grains (diatomaceous earth) but too rough for most face use  \n**Sonia Kashuk \"Renew\" Micro Exfoliating Toner, $15/5.7 oz/170 ml, pH 4, Target**  \n*ingredients*  \nNot listed online, and I'm too lazy to type it out right now. Good: more licorice! Bad: citrus fruit extracts! Meh: witch hazel!  \nThings I like:  \n* pH okay  \n* seems to be doing something  \n* no fragrance  \n* is an okay toner, packaging/dispenser is nice    \n* no alcohol   \nThings I don't:  \n* lacks straightforward/proven exfoliating ingredients  \n* unknown quantities of AHA from fruit sources  \n**Pacifica \"Sea Foam\" Complete Face Wash, $8-10/5 oz/147 ml, Ulta/Target/etc, pH ~5, [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2c68115146.html)**  \n*ingredients*  \n>Purified Water, Cocomidopropyl Betaine (Coconut Source), Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate (Coconut Source), Sodium Cocoyl Sulfoacetate (Coconut Source), Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Decyl Glucoside (Corn Source), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin (Vegetable), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Glycol Stearate, Carica Papaya Extract, Lemon Bioflavanoids, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, , Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Citric Acid, Tocopherol Acetate, Panthenol, Napca, Allantoin, Nori Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Peel Extract (Mangosteen), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (White Tea), Sea Algae Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (All Natural).  \n\nThings I like:  \n* Nice amount of lather (on par with other low-pH cleansers)  \n* Does a good job removing sunscreen, makeup, and everything else in one go  \n* Good pH  \n* Leaves my skin feeling clean but not tight/dry  \nThings I don't:  \n* Coconut oil content means this isn't for everyone  \n* Includes fragrance (mild/coconutty and last on list, but still)  \n* Burns my eyes really, really badly if it gets in them at all  \n  \nI don't know if I'll repurchase these in the future (since I'm just starting out using them) but figured others could use the reference. Also: the Sonia Kashuk face oil is dumb and don't even bother with it. Also: once the SK face mask shows up at Target, I'll be trying that also. Also!  \nAny tried any of these and have insights?

Hasn’t been sold for about 3 years I think): \n\nAqua / Water,Cyclohexasiloxane,Nylon-12,Isododecane,Alcohol Denat.,Cyclopentasiloxane,PEG-10 Dimethicone,Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone,PEG-20,Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate,Disteardimonium Hectorite,Phenoxyethanol,Magnesium Sulfate,Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate,HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Crosspolymer,Titanium Dioxide [Nano] / Titanium Dioxide,Methylparaben,Acrylonitrile/Methyl Methacrylate/Vinylidene Chloride Copolymer,Tocopherol,Butylparaben,Aluminum Hydroxide,Isobutane,Alumina,Silica,Glycerin,Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate\n\nFast forward to 2 months ago I ruined my hair with Garnier ultimate blends coconut oil shampoo (I forgot this brand ruined my hair in the past):\n\nAqua/Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Coco-Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, CI 14700/Red 4, Cocos Nucifera/Coconut Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxycitronellal, Sodium Hydroxide, Theobroma Cacao Shea Butter/Cocoa Seed Butter, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Salicylic Acid, Benzyl Salicylate, Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Caramel, Citric Acid, Hexylene Glycol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Parfum / Fragrance\n\n(Though I do think my hair is bad with coconut oil, I’m not sure if that’s the sole reason as the result is basically the same as when I used this shampoo in the past) \n\nI initially thought that it’s because my hair is already dry and coarse (as well as low porosity fyi) that these shampoos didn’t do me much good as they have drying alcohols and a few sulphates, and nothing that is really moisturising or nourishing. Though, I thought about it more, and in between the two periods I ruined my hair, I was using this shampoo by Herbal & Essences which also does seem pretty drying, but didn’t damage my hair at all (from what I saw physically):\n\nAqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Cocamide MEA, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Hexyl Cinnamal, Magnesium Nitrate, Zea Mays Silk Extract, Rose Extract, Pearl Extract, CI 19140, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Sorbate, CI 42090\n\nIt in fact has more sulphates, but also more humectants at the same time. Could it be the alcohol? Or is the problem in fact, not the drying of my hair? I’m really lost and scared to buy another shampoo in case I ruin my hair again.",

You will get a much better recommendation by making an appointment and they can even try out what you want to buy on you before you purchase and take it home! \nSide note: if you use a sulfate free shampoo always wash twice!

        "body": "Why is it a problem to have silicone on the hair shaft? Specific emollients in hair care products are there for a reason. Iirc polyquats are even more difficult to remove than amodimethicone, but why bother? These ingredients impart shine and smoothness and are somewhat protective (among other things). Your hair does not contain living cells and does not require nutrients to be delivered into the inner core, nor does it require water inside the hair shaft. In fact, from my research less water in the hair shaft is ideal. So a layer of emollients will do more good than harm imo.\n\n\nObviously buildup will occur after some time, and when this occurs you can always use a clarifying shampoo. I was strictly no sulfates/silicones for a few years for my curly hair. Nowadays knowing the science behind things, I don't understand the movement.",

        "body": "There seems to be some disagreement about which cleansers remove which silicones. Amodimethicone is definitely one of the harder silicones to remove. My shampoo has that same cleanser, and some people describe it as essentially a sulfate while others say it's the most stripping of the non-sulfates but still weaker. If it were me, I would go by how my hair feels. If your hair seems gunky, sticky, or like it won't detangle the way it normally would, you can throw in a suave daily clarifying wash. If not, maybe your hair just likes being coated in silicone (or the shampoo is cleaning adequately) and you don't have to worry about it. The other thing to watch out for is that those heavy silicones tend to prevent oils from getting to your hair, so if you feel like your hair is really dry, or like the texture of it when unconditioned is getting worse, that may be a sign to switch conditioners or at least do a sulfate wash and use a silicone-free deep conditioner before you resume using the amodimethicone one.",

    "body": "Hi, all!\n\nI recently switched shampoos and am now experiencing mild breakouts on my back and around my hairline.\n\nPrior to the switch, I was using Herbal Essence's Hello Hydration shampoo and conditioner. While using this shampoo and conditioner combination, my hair seemed dry, frizzy, and fragile. However, it did not cause me to break out anywhere.\n\nThe ingredients in the shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Orchis Mascula Flower Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Sodium Citrate, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium 76, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Blue 1\n\nThe ingredients in the conditioner:\n\n> Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Orchis Mascula Flower Extract, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Blue 1\n\nA little over a week ago, I stopped using both of the above products and switched to SheaMoisture's Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo to try to get away from sulfates. I started only with the shampoo, not the conditioner, because I break out very easily and wanted to test each product separately so that I'd know what product was causing me to break out if I did indeed end up breaking out (it's a mistake I've made before).\n\nThe ingredients in that shampoo:\n\n> Deionized Water, Decyl Glucoside(Coconut Oil), African Butyrospermum Parkii (shea Butter)*, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Argan Oil, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B-5), Rosemary Extract, Sea Kelp Extract, Vitamin E, Guar Gum, Lonicera Capifloium (Honeysuckle) Flower (and) Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Avacado Oil\n\nAfter a little over a week of using this shampoo every other day, I've noticed a change in my hair. It seems healthier, less frizzy, and easier to manage. I LOVE the improvement. However, since the change, I've also experienced breakouts on my back, around my hairline, and on my cheeks where the ends of my hair touch my face. This makes me incredibly sad, because I love what this product does to my hair, but the breakouts mean I can no longer use it.\n\nAre any of the ingredients in this shampoo particularly comedogenic? Which one(s) could I be reacting to? I really like the change this product made to my hair, so is there a shampoo similar to this one that is less likely to break me out?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nIf it helps identify ingredients I might be sensitive to, a long time ago, I dyed my hair black, and after noticing that the Hello Hydration Shampoo made the color fade quickly, I switched to Herbal Essence's Color Me Happy Shampoo and Conditioner. That stuff broke me out horribly. I know that it was the shampoo and/or conditioner and not the dye because I didn't switch products immediately after dying my hair but waited a few weeks. I experienced no breakouts during that time and only broke out after switching shampoo and conditioner. I switched to both at the same time however, so I have no way of knowing whether it was the shampoo, conditioner, or both that caused me to break out.\n\nThe ingredients in the shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Passiflora Incarnata Flower Extract, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Linoleamidopropyl PG Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Red 33, Red 4, Yellow 10\n\nThe ingredients in the conditioner:\n\n> Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Passiflora Incarnata Flower Extract, Glutamic Acid, Fragrance, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Benzyl Alcohol, EDTA, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Yellow 10, Red 33, Yellow 6",

I shaved the underside and deep conditioned with every wash it because it was all broken off, started washing my hair less (once every 3 or 4 days now), stopped using heat products, get haircuts every 8-10 weeks, and  tried buying better shampoos/conditioners for my hair.\n\n\nAt that time, I bought an olive oil shampoo/conditioner pair from Regis Designline and it seemed to work well.

    "body": " \n\nGillette Guard shaving cream introduction & review.\n\nA couple of days ago, I went to the local pharmacy at work after lunch. As I often do, I quickly glanced over the shaving products rack, & I saw something new. Gillette has launched a new shaving cream in India, - Gillette Guard shaving cream. I assume that it is intended to be paired with Gillette Guard razors. I’ve used those super cheap Guard razors & found them extremely good for very quick shaves as they shave like a safety razor while still being in a pivoting cartridge format. I feel that if Gillette can make an equally good shaving cream, it ought to be worth trying. So I picked up a tube. The tube has 125 grams of product (4 oz) & is priced at the low, low price of 49 Indian rupees, or 68 US cents. That’s an amazing price, which is weight for weight, probably about half that of most normal shaving creams in the region.  Most other shaving products here contain about 3oz, & cost just over $1.\n\nThe tube specifies on the packing that it can be applied by hand or a brush. Since I normally shave with a brush that is how I plan to apply it to test it.\n\nThe ingredients are, Water, Stearic acid,  Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Coconut oil, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate/HEMA Crosspolymer – 2, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Silicate, Azadirachta Indica seed oil, Fragrance, Benzyl Salicylate, Linalool, Limonene.\n\nThe ingredients seem fairly standard, except for the acrylates & crosspolymer. On looking them up, I found that they are gelling agents.\n\nI applied cream today morning with a brush & lathered up after a shower. My Omega 10029 came up in the rotation. The product in the tube was white & looked more like toothpaste than shaving cream. I applied more than usual, since I wanted to test the performance, & I was a little afraid that the gelling agents might affect the performance. The product applied more like hair gel than shaving cream, while there was lather, & the bubbles were tiny, which is a good indication of higher potassium/sodium ratio, but the lather felt funny. On shaving the first pass WTG, I found that while the lather felt slick enough when rubbed between my fingers, the lather had very, very little lubrication indeed while shaving & I could really feel the blade in the Tech type razor. After the first pass, I felt that I could not continue to shave this way, & perhaps the lather would do better with a cartridge razor, so I did my next pass with a cartridge. If I’d wanted to continue with the DE, I’d have had to change the lather. Since it was the lather that was being tested, not the razor, I switched to a Sensor Excel razor for XTG. At that point, I had no trouble with the second pass, but the lubricity was still lacking. \n\nI’m beginning to suspect the gelling agents are being used as fillers in this formulation. If the gelling agents were not there, this product would be  thin soapy water.\n\nI’m going to experiment with using the cream again tomorrow, this time used brushless before coming to any conclusions or making any statements. There is no way I’m going to use this product with a brush again.\n\nUPDATE Day 2 :- I used that cream again today without a brush. I can confirm that it works well & was most probably designed primarily as a brushless cream. In fact, it's a fairly good cream when applied that way. No nicks or cuts & a pretty smooth face. A good, close shave.\n\n\nWhile looking at the package, I re-checked the how-to blurb about applying it. It reads 'Using your hand or a brush, lather the cream & then apply the cream to your beard'\n\nWhile that's not proof , the fact that using it by hand has been mentioned first before the brush does make me think that it was designed to be used primarily without a brush.\n\nI'm a little concerned about the gelling agents in this formulation. (Carbopol Smart 3000 or equivalent). I have never seen them in any similar product before & I know nothing about their safety. They've been around for less than five years, which is not enough time for issues to come to light.",

So of course, they go and reformulated the shampoo and now it doesn't work for me. \n\nThe ingredients for the version of the Suave Coconut shampoo I liked were:\n\nShampoo: Water (Aqua), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Ammonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Benzoate, Fragrance, PPG-9 Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Disodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract\n\nThis old version Suave Coconut seems so basic and no frills but it made my hair feel right--not too dry and not weighed down.\n\nMy routine was: Wash with the shampoo,  I only had to use a tiny amount of the conditioner and a little Garnier smooth and sleek leave in conditioner and no other products and my hair was amazing. I air dried. It was so nice not having to struggle with my hair.\n\nI have tried to find a replacement for the shampoo and I can't find one. Every other shampoo is either too drying or too heavy. If you have any idea what ingredient made this old version of the Suave Coconut shampoo so so special and/or similar product recommendation I'd appreciate it.\n\nAnd oddly enough, the shampoos I tried that were too drying, using more conditioner doesn't help.

    "body": "I'm a med student, and this is actually bringing back some old memories of undergrad chemistry.  I had a clogged toilet and no plunger.  It was late at night, so I looked for YouTube tutorials on how to unclog a toilet without a plunger.\n\nMost of them said to use warm water and dish soap.  I tried it, and it didn't work.  The water just sat with dish soap in it until I could finally get a plunger this morning.\n\nBut then I realized that my girlfriend had put this toilet bowl cleaner thing in when we first set up the apartment.  It's called Bowl Fresh and is something you just drop into the toilet bowl.\n\nThe dish soap I used was Ajax Triple Action.  The listed ingredients are: Water, Ammonium C12-15 Pareth Sulfate, Lauramidopropylamine Oxide, Sodium Chloride, Poloxamer 124, Fragrance, DMDM Hydantoin, Pentasodium Pentetate, Sodium Bisulfite, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, FD&C Yellow No 6, FD&C Red No. 40.\n\nThe Bowl Fresh thing seems to be a borax based compound.  There are two versions of it.  One with just borax and one with a borax/bleach mixture.  Luckily it seems we just have the borax one.    The listed ingredients are: Sodium sulfate, Sodium tetraborate anhydrous, Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, Sodium chloride, Sodium Carboxymethyl Cellulose, Hydroxyethyl cellulose, Acid Blue 9, Water, Cocamide MEA, Aluminum sulfate anhydrous, Tetrasodium EDTA, Glycols (polyethylene), Citric acid\n\nFrom my old understanding, ammonium sulfate is acidic and can create dangerous chlorine gas when mixed with bleach.  It seems that nothing in the Bowl Fresh is a strong base, so it looks like I may be in the clear.  Can anyone with more chemistry expertise give me some insight?  Do I have toxic chemicals in my air at home now?\n\nThanks so much!",

    "body": "i've been contemplating and over thinking this post for far too long now, i'm new to SCA and i have plenty of unrelated questions but i didn't want to spam the community, so for now i've decided to focus on this topic. i know i've procrastinated far too long but my birthday is next week and its my goal to start a skincare routine by then and to have the best skin i can have by then. here's my issues:\n\ni'm a 16 (soon to be 17) year old girl without a job and living in a low income family. i've been on SCA long enough to know that good skincare isnt cheap,  i don't have the money to but a $15 cleanser. idk why but i've been hesitant about starting a SCR probably because i'm fearful i'll do it wrong or the purging & potential for a product not agreeing with me will be too much to handle. i have a lot of new mini kits that i got for christmas and i thought i'd ask for your guy's reviews on these products (because i haven't seen anyone post on most of these yet) and your recommendations for me on creating a routine with what i currently have instead of going out and buying some the the HG products of this community. \n\nfirst, here's some history of my skin:\ni've known about skincare since i was about 11 from watching yt, before that i had did nothing but let water hit my face in the shower. at first i went to walmart and target trying any product that interested me and was cheap. i never stuck to a routine and to this day i've never consecutively washed my face for more than 5 days. the good news is in the last couple of years i've been educating myself more and watching out for certain ingredients and staying away from harmful products. i know i probably sound crazy to you all but i've never even used sunscreen. thankfully, it seems as if i'm crazy blessed because i've never had bad skin issues or a lot of acne, in the last 2 years though my skin has been the worst i've seen it, i don't really know how to rate it because sometimes i look at my skin and think \"ah its not that bad it's practically clear\" and other times, especially when i'm wearing makeup or in good lighting i'm thinking \"goodness, my skin is awful\". my main issue are blackheads on my nose, texture all over my face especially on my forehead (but pretty much unnoticeable unless you're up close or in good/dim lighting), whiteheads on my chin, and a few persistent zits on my cheeks and a few others that pop up here and there. \n\nnow to the products. i'm going to list all of the products i've accumulated and not used recently, most of them are sample sizes from gift sets. my request is for you to give me a mini review on any of the products you've tried and from the skin issues i've relayed for you to tell me what you'd suggest my routine to be with the products i have. if you need anymore information please let me know, and i apologize if i've one anything wrong or worded things weird i'm new to this site and new to skincare at this level.

Skincare actually doesn’t have to be expensive to be effective. In fact, there are many companies for example, The Ordinary that are making great products that are inexpensive. \n\nYour lucky you don’t really have acne prone skin so here’s the routine I’d recommend to you for blackhead:\n\nAM:\nGentle cleanser - I’d recommend CeraVe ($10.98)  \n\n\nSerum/Acids: For blackheads Id recommend - The Ordinary Niacinimide 10% + zinc 1% as its gentle and is known to un-clog pores. Here, you could alternate and  use The Ordinarys Salicylic Acid 2% Solution.\n\nMoisturizer \n\nSunscreen daily \n\nPm: \n\nCleanse with same gentle cleanser\n\nExfoliate 2-3 times per week - I’d recommend The Ordinary  Glycolic Acid 7% Toner \n\nSerums/Acids: Here you can use either the salicylic acid or Niacinamide again. Or you can use one of these in the morning and one at night but don’t mix them together. \n\nMoisturize",

Add this to any of the above masks for a nice glow to your skin. (Skip if you're very pale because it might be too yellow) \n\n**Products to Try in the future**\n\n- Stridex pads in red box. It's ~$7 and the salicylic acid will help with your minor acne problems. \n- Sunscreen   \nI would highly recommend getting sunscreen or start wearing ball caps if you're out in the sun.

They get stuck in the cream and get combed out, cream and all.\nPrevents lice from slipping through the comb-teeth\nBlocks the gaps of the tapering teeth-tips, preventing lice and especially those really small nymphs (young lice) from slipping through.\nMakes every hair structure easy to comb through, which in turn facilitates a painless, fast and effective combing treatment.\n\n\nThe ingredients are: Aqua, Cetyl alcohol, Cetrimonium chloride, Cocamide MEA, Phenoxyethanol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Citric acid\n\nAnd now to the question: I suspect that is is simply a greasy hair conditioner sold as something made specially to treat lice\n\nAm I right? \n",

        "body": "I'm no expert in lice treatment, but this ingredient list looks like a regular conditioner to me. \n\nWhat evidence do they have of its effectiveness?\n\nI really like 100% dimethicone as a headlice treatment because it makes the hair too slippery for them to attach their eggs, and it also makes the hair very easy to comb through with a nit comb.  It's also not a pesticide that the lice can become resistant to, and dimethicone is well tolerated for skin, very few people are irritated by it.  In fact, some of the schoolchildren in this study showed improvement in their scalp health over the course of treatment: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4475297/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4475297/)\n\nIt looks like the active ingredient in Paranit is something else though, called Osmolone.  I haven't heard of it but it supposedly is not a pesticide but works by drying out and suffocating the lice.  The only sources I could find are the website of products that use it or sell those products, and press releases from the product company, so none of these are unbiased and the information was not detailed at all.",

    "body": "I'm back to this, having tried a couple of shampoos on the market and having narrowed it down to what each effects my scalp/face the most, in any way. Fyi, i use oil control shampoos as a counter for excessive sebum.\n\n**To start off i've noticed that some specific shampoos, f.e some H&S ones, with similar ingredients in them, tend to be more aggrevvating towards rosacea and they usually leave a flared up feeling post wash that can last, depending on how serious your rosacea is. However, they tend to be more effective towards acne (if you also have that) and dandruff.**\n\n* *Example 1-> Product: Head & Shoulders Deep Cleanse For Oily Scalp*\n* *Ingredients: Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Cocamide MEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Citrate, Parfum, Piroctone Olamine, Citric Acid, Glycerin, Sodium Salicylate, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-10, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Limonene, Sodium Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Propylene Glycol, Hydroxycitronellal, Linalool, Citronellol, Citrus Limon Fruit Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, CI 42090*\n\n**Other shampoos like the le petit marseillais one** **(or gen ones that are more eco) with very different ingredients in it and missing the most well known trigger ingredients, is more friendly towards rosacea. I did notice that, post using it, my hair look more thin, shedding and thats a bit worrying. (placebo?!)**\n\n*Example 2->Product: Le Petit Marseillais w/ Thyme and White Clay*\n\n* *Ingredients: Aqua, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Thymus Vulgaris Extract, Kaolin, Polyquaternium-10, Glycol Distearate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.*\n\n**P.S: Ingredients that can trigger rosacea flare ups, quoting AAD:**\n\n* *Alcohol*\n* *Camphor*\n* *Fragrance*\n* *Glycolic acid*\n* *Lactic acid*\n* *Menthol*\n* *Sodium lauryl sulfate (often found in shampoos)*\n* *Urea*\n\nThere's also shampoos that belong to an in between category, having slightly different ingredients in them, but i do notice that, thus far, none of them are as friendly as an eco shampoo which doesn't have the same ingredients as a H&S one, or has them in a very low percent.\n\nThis makes sense as ingredients that trigger rosacea when applied to the face straight away, can be effective when applying them to your hair/scalp which is a continuation of your face contact area. You can mitigate the consequences by avoiding shampoo run down your face/wash well post shampoo etc...\n\nYou can drop your recommendations below as well as the ingredients involved in the products you use.",

There are a lot of products on the market that contain a lot of chemicals, many of which have by now become familiar sights in ingredients lists. There are an awful lot of them derived from coconut and palm exclusively, but there are also a lot of them that can be derived from other sources. There isn't any regulation currently in place (at least in the United States, that I am aware of) that requires manufacturers to disclose the source of their chemicals, which can lead to a lot of companies falsely claiming that their products are coconut and/or palm free, when they are just the opposite. Some of the chemicals you will see are things like Vitamin A-palmitate. This one in particular can be tricky as it can be found naturally in beef fat, or it can be derived from coconut or palm plants. You see it a lot in milk, particularly milk that is 2% or less milk fat, which would make you think that it is derived from beef fat, but when you start digging, you find out that it is far more readily available (and therefore cheaper for dairies to buy in the quantities they use) to acquire a palm derived version. Now, devil's advocate here, it may be simply that the dairies do not actually know that they are adding a palm derived product into their milk, as they are likely going through a bulk supplier.\n\nI have also come to realize that there are a lot of companies who advertise things as being coconut and/or palm free and are completely unaware that the chemicals they use come from those sources.

High androgens.*\n\nNow, I'm sick, like actually sick of seeing everywhere that oily scalps should avoid silicones in their **shampoos** at all costs as it clogs scalp, causes hair-loss, makes hair greasy, builds up etc etc, don't use this, don't use that blah blah blah (mind you I've used shampoo with silicones all my life and never had a reaction, hair's beautiful below waist length) \\~ should just stop washing my hair yeah?? smh\n\nMy current shampoo is formulated for all hair types and has the **following ingredients:** \"*Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Dimethiconol, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Cannabis Satvia Seed Oil (Hemp Oil), Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract (Hibiscus Flower), PEG-45M, Carbomer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cocamide MEA, TEA-Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, TEA-Sulfate, Glycol Distearate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Mica, Titanium Dioxide.\"*  \n\n\nAs you can see dimethiconol is in the shampoo with SLES, but even if a shampoo works well for me, I get paranoid if it's not clear, like I know it sounds stupid but it's taken a huge toll on me, as I'm taking a holistic approach to managing PCOS, and I love my hair so I've been experimenting and trying out different shampoos, as I can't stick with one due to all the advice about \"don't use this, don't use that\" despite a shampoo feeling good on hair, I feel depressed as it feels like oh there's dimethiconol in my shampoo it's probs secretly damaging my hair and I don't know about it.   \n\n\n**Can someone,** *who hasn't graduated from tiktok university,* **please please tell me, are silicones really that bad for oily scalps??**  especially if it's in a shampoo that has SLES in it? how do silicones stick to **scalp** and lead to buildup? doesn't buildup happen if you don't wash your hair?  in that case anything and everything can build up? Why can't I find specific information about dimethiconol vs dimethicone, my conditioner has both dimethicone and amodimethicone, and no please don't stick a link from labmuffin talking about silicones, I've seen it, she doesn't go through it in the detail I'm looking for, and ps she talks about conditioners, I don't care about conditioners, as my **hair is not oily**, but sometimes dull, lifeless, and limp, sometimes frizzy, but **my scalp is oily.**  And **why and how does dimethiconol stick to hair and lead to buildup if the shampoo has SLES in it which is designed to cleanse and thus gets rid of the dimethiconol? if so, why is it used in shampoos then? and if it's getting cleansed, why would it buildup??**  \n\n\nI like washing my hair regularly, I don't believe in hair training or all that bullcrap, as sebum production is genetic and other factors play roles such as certain conditions and etc ie: PCOS. What bothers me is that people say \"shampoos for oily scalp's too stripping, shampoos for dry hair is too moisturising\" so isn't it better to use a hydrating shampoo that's formulated for all hair types that cleanses and also hydrates and provides a balance??  \n\n\nCongrats for making it to the end...🙏🏽",

        "body": "People say a lot of things about hair products, and most of them are not scientists who have truly studied it and how something affects anyone's hair but their own. \n\nInstead of listening to what other people say about how a shampoo might behave in your hair, your own experience of how the shampoo works for you is the best source of information.  It sounds like the shampoo you're using now works well for you.  If you're not experiencing scalp issues or noticing a lot of buildup on your scalp, then you're good.\n\nI know you've already seen at least one Labmuffin video that didn't specifically address dimethiconol, but have you seen [this older video she did](https://youtu.be/yzM4pCKXZ5Y?si=4XzJ3dq_VbQhYP1H) about silicones in skincare as well as haircare products?  I ask because she specifically addresses the concern of silicone buildup on the skin.  She talks about how it doesn't create an impenetrable coating in the skin, and even if it did, it would come off eventually as the outermost dead skin cells naturally are shed.  If you're really concerned about scalp buildup specifically, you can integrate a scalp exfoliant into your haircare routine to help it shed those dead skin cells.  Salicylic acid is great for oily scalps because it's lipophilic.\n\nAccording to [this sub's own guide on silicones](https://new.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/), dimethiconol specifically is in Group 2, so it's relatively easy to wash out with shampoo.  I really don't think you have anything to worry about.  But if you're still worried, you could try writing to her directly; she loves to geek out about silicones specifically so I bet she would be willing to answer your question.  You could also try writing to [The Beauty Brains](http://thebeautybrains.com/), it's two cosmetic chemists who answer questions like this on their podcast.",

        "body": "It’s true that silicones can cause build up and weigh hair down over-time since they’re a polymer (plastic/rubber hybrid) that coats the hair in a similar way that oils do making it smooth and soft. I don’t know too much about the science but it can still be formulated to cleanse while coating the hairs to become smooth but will essentially cause build up. \n\nand yes typically those with oilier scalps are cautioned to avoid because of how heavy it can be. \n\nbut everyone’s hair and scalp is different. \n\nso if your hair and scalp are totally fine with the added silicone in your shampoo, then there’s no reason to eliminate it.  \n\nIf there is build up, it can easily be remedied by using a clarifying shampoo -some people like an apple cider vinegar rinse -once a week or how ever often you feel you need it which is what most people should be doing anyhow. Sadly I feel like not everyone knows this because companies don’t advertise clarifying products the same way we see hair smoothing,  anti-frizz, and even dandruff products being marketed.  Probably because it’s  the one product that could eliminate most scalp issues lol. But we’re just taught how to remedy one problem and make our hair look nice but no one talks about scalp care. \n\nI too have an oily scalp. I avoided shampoos and conditioners with silicones (and sulfates) for a while. But lately I’ve become serious about growing out my hair and found that some people use silicone to achieve healthy hair. \n\nIt’s been a while since I’ve used a shampoo with silicones but I can remember that most of them just weighed my hair down and made my scalp more oily or irritated so i just don’t buy it. As for now, I personally prefer a sulfate free/silicone free clarifying shampoo that I’ve found during my “free of all things bad” phase. And yes it’s clarifying but the one I’m using - I don’t find it to be harsh or stripping at all and it’s the only shampoo i like that makes my hair feel clean and light and most importantly keeps my scalp from getting oily within a day.  i still need to wash every other day but my scalp just feels a lot more comfortable with that shampoo. \n\nI’ve also tried other brands of shampoos that were sulfate and silicone free yet they were making my scalp oily and weighing my hair down?! Sooo…?!?!\n\nBut I do now use a  conditioner containing silicone and it’s been awesome. Before, I had been using conditioners without silicones and all the “nasties” yet those kinds never helped to truly condition or hydrate my hair and just made the ends of my hair a tangled mess. \n\nMy hair feels and looks healthier than it has in the past with my current regimen. \n\nSo use whatever you feel is working for you and what your scalp and hair is feeling comfortable with. Everyone’s scalp is different. Just keep a clarifying shampoo or a clarifying rinse on hand!",

        "body": "I'll add that it's a fair question regarding why silicones wouldn't be broken down by the surfactants in a shampoo, what function do they serve.  It depends of course on the formulation, but there is a technology that was developed in the 1980's to create 2-in-1 shampoo+conditioners by essentially suspending silicones in such a way that it will deposit on hair from a shampoo while it’s being rinsed.  Pantene later applied this technology in their shampoos without calling them a 2-in-1, and now many shampoos use this technology to add some conditioning to the hair even before a conditioner is used.\n\nIt's explained simply here: [https://thebeautybrains.com/2015/11/if-pantene-is-so-good-why-isnt-it-sold-in-salons-episode-108/](https://thebeautybrains.com/2015/11/if-pantene-is-so-good-why-isnt-it-sold-in-salons-episode-108/)\n\nand in more detail here: [https://new.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/lmbrwj/how\\_does\\_dimethicone\\_behave\\_in\\_a\\_sodium\\_laureth/](https://new.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/lmbrwj/how_does_dimethicone_behave_in_a_sodium_laureth/)\n\nApparently guar is often used to create this suspension of the silicone; note that your shampoo contains Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride.",

    "body": "Hi, /r/curlyhair!  Long time lurker, first time poster!  I got these two products as a Christmas gift and used them for a few months before I decided to buckle down and write a review.  Here goes, please feel free to ask any questions!  \n\n**Basic Info** \n\nLeonor Greyl is a luxury natural hair care line.  I personally am a sucker for high-end products so I had to try these.  The shampoo/conditioners I usually use are the Cristalliste line from Kerastase (the pink bottles).  My hair is naturally 3B but I flat iron 1-2 times a week at most and rock it curly otherwise.  \n\nLeonor Greyl has a whole line of different products but the two I will be reviewing are the **Shampooing Reviviscence – Deep Repairing Shampoo for Damaged Hair and the Masque Orchidee — Conditioning Mask for Thick, Dry Hair**\n \n**Shampoo info:** Deep repairing shampoo for dehydrated, colored, damaged and brittle hair. This luxurious shampoo reconditions and restructures the most damaged hair, thus regaining strength and vitality, manageability, shine and softness.\n\n**Mask info:** Silk proteins, vegetal ceramids and oils work together to smooth, detangle, protect and restructure hair fiber. Leaves hair soft and manageable.\n\n\n**Ingredients** (as listed on product):\n\n**Shampoo:** Aqua, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, PEG-40 Glyceryl Cocoate, Sodium Coceth sulphate, Decyl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl dimethylaminohydroxypropyl hydrolysed collagen, Hydrolysed Quinoa, Limonium latifolium, Fucus Vesiculosus Extract, Hydrolysed Silk, Bambusa vulgaris Extract, Myristamine Oxide, Polyquaternium-47, Cetyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-33, Quaternium-91, Cetrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, PEG-15 Cocopolyamine, Lauryl Dimethyl Amine Oxide, Parfum (Fragrance), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Cereus Grandiflorus (Cactus) Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Vegetable Glycerides, Lactic Acid, Guar, droxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Daucus Carota Extract, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Limonene, Linalool, Geraniol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional\n\n**Mask:** Aqua, Methylheptyl Isostearate, Adipic Acid/Diethylene Glycol/Glycerin Crosspolymer, Hydrogenated Vegetable Glycerides, Cetyl Alcohol, Cocamide MEA, Buxus Chinesis Seed Oil, PEG-15 Cocopolyamine, Orchis Maculata Flower Extract, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Sericin, Parfum (Fragrance), Ceteareth-33, Jojoba Wax PEG-120 Esters, Butyrospermum Parkii, Lauryl Dimethyl Amine Oxide,\nElaeis Guineensis (Palm) Oil, Hydrolysed Silk, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Triticum Vulgare,\nTrietanolamine, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Price**\n\nSuggested retail for the shampoo is $67 (!) and the mask is $62.  Both are 200 mL (6.8 oz).  I've seen it online on Amazon for cheaper though.  Good thing this was a gift!  \n\n**Where to Buy**\n\nStore retailers are available on Leonor Greyl's website but there are several online retailers that sell this, such as Amazon, Doobop, etc.  \n\n**How to Use**\n\nFor the shampoo, you are supposed to lather and leave it in your hair for 5-minutes before rinsing out.  The mask can be used like a regular conditioner or you can leave it in your hair for 5-minutes if you want to do light conditioning, or 20-minutes for a deep treatment.\n\n**Pros**\n\nAfter the first month or so of using it once a week I noticed a bit of a difference.  My hair felt soft after I washed with these products and it didn't feel stripped.  The shampoo lathers pretty well and the mask spreads really nicely on my hair.  It's like butter.  Curls looked more well-defined.  \n\n**Cons**\n\nThe price.  The smell.  Oh dear lord, the shampoo smells like old ladies.  Consistency of the shampoo is really weird, too.  Maybe I got a bad bottle but it was like some solid stuff mixed in with liquid stuff.  I have to shake the bottle when I get it out and [this](http://i.imgur.com/mEnHADU.jpg) was what it looks like.  The bottle also opens from the bottom so as soon as I opened it the first few times the flood gates opened and all this watery shampoo poured out that I didn't need.  The mask doesn't smell as strongly as the shampoo does but it's pretty pricey, too.\n\n**Overall**\n\nIn my opinion these products were not worth the money.  Considering the price, the amount of product I got, and its performance, I'd rather spend my money on something else.  Without a doubt, these products would be good as a step up from using something like, say, from the drugstore.  The products I was using already were pretty high-end to begin with so it was like a lateral (or dare I say a step down) shift for me.  \n\nIf you're looking to step up from drugstore stuff then check out Ouidad.  If you're using mid-range stuff and are in the market for something HE then go with Kerastase.  \n\nThat being said, don't be discouraged just because of my review!  They have a sampler set on their website you can try if you feel so inclined.  \n\nI really wanted to like these products but I just can't.  Very disappointing but I'm glad I was able to try them.

However, Pantene shampoo contains several harsh chemicals—including sulfates and benzyl alcohol—that can lead to damaged hair and may even cause hair loss in some people.\n\nSo is Pantene good for your hair?\n\nLet’s look at what kind of shampoo is best for healthy hair and which harmful chemicals you should avoid to prevent scalp irritation and hair breakage. \n\n📷\n\n## How bad is Pantene for your hair?\n\nPantene hair care products may work for some people, but they contain several potentially harmful ingredients that can cause significant hair damage and have been linked to various skin conditions, including dandruff, dermatitis, and acne. \n\nHow bad Pantene is for your hair depends on your particular type of hair, your hair care routine, and whether you have colored or chemically treated hair. \n\nWhile Pantene products are marketed as beneficial for all hair types, the harsh chemicals in Pantene’s shampoos aren't suitable for fine hair, curly and textured hair, or color-treated hair.\n\nMany Pantene shampoos contain silicone which coats your hair shafts to make the hair appear shiny and smooth. However, silicone can build up and lead to clogged hair follicles, [a common cause of hair loss](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-most-common-cause-of-hair-loss) and scalp skin issues.  \n\n\nOther problematic ingredients in Pantene products are sulfates, including sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate. These synthetic compounds are used as foaming agents and strip your hair and scalp of natural oils, which can cause dry, brittle hair that’s prone to breakage. \n\nSome people reported that using Pantene made their hair fall out and that switching to sulfate-free shampoo improved hair loss.  \n\n### Pantene ingredient breakdown\n\nPantene shampoo and conditioner ingredients can vary depending on the product. However, according to Pantene's [website](https://pantene.com/en-us/ingredients/our-essential-ingredients), there are common ingredients found in most of their shampoos. \n\nHere is a breakdown of some of the most common Pantene shampoo ingredients: \n\n* **Sodium lauryl sulfate** and **sodium laureth sulfate** in Pantene are surfactants that remove dirt and oils.\n* **Cocamidopropyl betaine** is another surfactant that helps to create a rich lather and improve the cleansing ability of the shampoo.\n* **Sodium benzoate** helps extend the product's shelf life and maintain its effectiveness over time.\n* **Benzyl alcoho**l acts as a solvent and helps prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and fungi.\n* **Dimethicone** is a type of silicone that coats the hair shafts to achieve smooth and frizz-free hair.\n* **Methylchloroisothiazolinone** and other synthetic preservatives prevent microbial overgrowth and stabilize the texture of the shampoo.\n* **Artificial fragrances and dyes** are typically used in Pantene products to achieve a pleasant smell and color. \n* **Guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride** is often found in Pantene conditioners and helps detangle the hair and improve its manageability.\n* **Tetrasodium EDTA** and other synthetic chelating agents prevent shampoos from separating and help to evenly spread the product.\n* **Cocamide MEA** is a synthetic compound that thickens shampoo and improves its texture.  \n\n\n📷\n\n## Is Pantene dangerous to use?\n\nUsing Pantene regularly has been linked to damaged hair and accelerated hair loss, and may cause allergic reactions and increase your risk of hormonal imbalances and cancer.  \n\nAlthough not all Pantene products contain parabens, some shampoos still include these harmful synthetic preservatives. \n\nParabens are linked to a range of health issues due to their potential to disrupt estrogen levels which can cause [hormonal imbalance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/hormone-imbalance-signs-causes-solutions), fertility issues, and weight gain—and they may even contribute to the development of breast cancer.\n\nIn fact, paraben exposure from shampoos may pose significantly more health issues than dietary intake of these preservatives. \n\n“*The topical application of paraben-containing products more likely contributes to the systemic paraben concentration than their oral intake due to the rapid intestinal and hepatic metabolism,”* states a group of toxicologists that published this [study ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5618656/)in the *International Journal of Molecular Science*.\n\nIn addition, a [report ](https://www.safecosmetics.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Not-Too-Pretty.pdf)published by *The Environmental Working Group* found phthalates in several Pantene hair care products. Phthalates are a group of chemicals that can cause an imbalance in sex hormone levels and have been linked to birth defects, [infertility](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-overcome-infertility), and reduced sperm count. \n\nIf you have been using shampoos containing parabens and phthalates and are worried about your health, it’s essential to consult with a healthcare provider to discuss any potential medical concerns.\n\n📷\n\n## What kind of shampoo is best for your hair?\n\nTo find the best shampoo for your hair, it’s essential that you understand your hair type and scalp condition. \n\nHere are three things to consider when choosing a [shampoo to restore damaged hair](https://www.drberg.com/blog/can-shampoo-really-restore-damaged-hair).\n\n**1. Hair type** \n\nIf you tend to have [oily hair](https://www.drberg.com/blog/nutrient-deficiencies-in-dry-or-oily-hair), you may benefit from a gentle clarifying shampoo that helps to remove excess oil and buildup. \n\nIf your hair is dry and brittle, choose a shampoo with natural argan oil that hydrates and nourishes your hair strands.\n\n### 2. Scalp health\n\nA healthy scalp is a foundation for beautiful hair. If you have sensitive skin, a shampoo containing tea tree oil and [aloe vera](https://www.drberg.com/blog/the-benefits-of-aloe-vera) can soothe an irritated scalp and reduce flakes and dandruff. \n\nA [review ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4452276/)published in *the Journal of BioMed Research International* confirms that aloe vera has potent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties and can significantly reduce [dandruff](https://www.drberg.com/blog/best-remedies-for-dandruff)[.](https://www.drberg.com/blog/best-remedies-for-dandruff) \n\n### 3. Avoid harsh chemicals \n\nSynthetic ingredients tend to remove the natural oils on your scalp, which causes dull hair that’s prone to damage and split ends. \n\nSulfates, parabens, and benzyl alcohol, are bad for your hair. These harsh chemicals may cause dry and brittle hair, trigger skin irritation and allergies, and slow down hair growth. \n\n## How to shop for a shampoo with clean ingredients\n\nTo promote healthy and strong hair, choose a sulfate-free and paraben-free shampoo that doesn’t contain phthalates, silicone, or alcohol.\n\nLook for products with natural and organic ingredients such as plant extracts, essential oils, and botanicals that nourish your scalp and hydrate your hair. \n\nIt’s also important to read product labels. Opt for a shampoo with a short and simple ingredient list, and avoid those with long lists of unfamiliar chemical names.\n\nLast but not least, research the brand, look for statements such as cruelty-free and environmentally friendly, and check for certifications such as organic and USA GMP-certified manufacturing. \n\n📷\n\n## Could your scalp benefit from biotin shampoo?\n\nUsing the wrong shampoo can irritate your scalp and leave your hair frizzy and tangled. And, what’s more, shampoos containing parabens and sulfates may even harm your health.  \n\nTo achieve healthier hair, it’s important to support strong hair follicles and nourish the scalp. \n\nUnfortunately, many shampoos contain harsh chemicals that strip natural oils from the skin, which can cause dull hair that's hard to manage, slow growth rate, and hair loss.  \n\nWhile healthy hair growth relies on a wide range of nutrients, biotin is particularly important for stimulating the formation of new hair shafts and regulating normal hair follicle function.  \n\n*“Biotin is an essential nutrient that’s important to maintain the health of your scalp and hair,”* says Dr. Berg. “*Biotin deficiency can result in brittle and thinning hair and has been linked to hair loss.”*  \n\nWhile biotin is found in many foods, it’s a heat-sensitive nutrient that quickly degrades during cooking, leaving you at risk of biotin deficiency. \n\nStress, alcohol, and certain medications—including antacids, antibiotics, and cholesterol-lowering drugs—deplete biotin and may contribute to dry scalp skin and damaged hair that’s difficult to manage.   \n\nA combination of biotin deficiency and using the wrong shampoo can significantly impact the health of your hair follicles, and replenishing biotin should be the first step to revitalizing your hair.\n\nUsing a biotin shampoo may help:\n\n* Strengthen hair \n* Promote hair growth\n* Increase shine and smoothness\n* Nourish hair follicles \n* Reduce hair loss and thinning\n\nMost shampoos don’t contain biotin and are made with cheap synthetic ingredients that don’t hydrate and nourish your hair.\n\nThat’s why we designed our own shampoo infused with biotin and powerful hair-nourishing oils. If you’re looking for a premium-quality shampoo, you need to check out this product.\n\nWe designed Dr. Berg Biotin Shampoo to cleanse, hydrate, replenish, and promote soft and healthy hair—from roots to ends.\n\nIt not only contains highly-concentrated biotin, but it’s also infused with invigorating botanicals, rejuvenating essential oils, and enriching aloe vera.\n\nDr. Berg Biotin Shampoo is also packed with nutrient-rich argan oil that penetrates deep into hair shafts and replenishes your hair with essential vitamins and minerals.\n\n📷\n\n## A gentle and high-performing shampoo made for everyday use  \n\nDr. Berg Biotin Shampoo takes a far more gentle and nourishing approach to hair care compared to conventional shampoo brands.\n\nOur unique formula cleanses and hydrates without harsh chemicals that strip your scalp's natural oils, making Biotin Shampoo perfect for everyday use and suitable for all hair types.\n\nDr. Berg Biotin Shampoo is sulfate-free, silicone-free, and paraben-free and won’t leave residues or product buildup.

Is Pantene shampoo safe to use?\n\nPantene products contain sulfates, benzyl alcohol, and synthetic preservatives. These harsh chemicals can damage your hair and irritate your scalp and hair follicles which can cause hair loss and thinning.\n\nSome Pantene products also contain parabens and phthalates, which can penetrate the skin and disrupt hormone balance which has been linked to fertility issues, weight gain, and congenital disabilities.  \n\n### 2. What are the disadvantages of Pantene shampoo?\n\nPantene shampoos are made with low-quality synthetic ingredients that can strip the natural oils from your hair and scalp, leaving you with dry and frizzy hair that isn’t easy to manage.\n\nPantene also contains potentially harmful chemicals that can interfere with hormonal balance, cause skin irritation and acne, and disrupt normal hair follicle function.  \n\n### 3. What type of hair is Pantene good for?\n\nWhile Pantene shampoo works for some people, it contains harsh chemicals that may not be suitable for curly or fine hair, textured hair, and color-treated hair. \n\n### 4. Is Pantene bad for the environment?\n\nPantene contains tetrasodium EDTA which has been found to have negative environmental impacts, particularly when it enters the water supply. \n\nTetrasodium EDTA binds to heavy metals and prevents their breakdown, which can lead to pollution and is believed to be harmful to organisms in aquatic environments.  \n\n### 5. Does Pantene have silicone and parabens?\n\nYes, some Pantene products contain silicone and parabens. \n\n### 6. Does Dr. Berg Biotin Shampoo contain sulfate?\n\nNo, Dr. Berg Biotin Shampoo is a sulfate-free formula packed with biotin, aloe vera, and nutrient-rich argan oil that penetrates deep into hair shafts and keeps your hair healthy.",

    "body": "I used to have the softest hair until I started experimenting with other shampoos, I was dumb then and knew nothing about ingredients or hair. I would wash every day and never (or rarely) used conditioner. I had bought natural shampoos that claimed to be mild, but I now realize they were very harsh and drying because they contained olefin sulfonate, even though it's not a sulfate it's harsher. And I have been realizing my itchy scalp and dry flakes can be connected to this and sodium lauryl sulfate. Also, I had tried a nourishing shampoo loaded with proteins in it and I'm thinking that could have contributed a lot as well, bc I seem to have all the symptoms of protein sensitive hair (dry, rough, straw like after using it).\n\nAnyway back to now, I have started using pantene essential botanicals volumizing shampoo. It seems ok, and my itchy/dry scalp seems to be reduced significantly. I haven't used it long enough to tell if it will change my texture, but will it have a positive impact on my poor hair? the primary detergent is Sodium laureth sulfate which I read is better, and I can't tell if there are any proteins - does histidine count? I don't use conditioner after because I don't like silicones plus I have thin hair that gets weighed down\n\nhttps://imgur.com/DVbjvDo\n\nINGREDIENTS: WATER, SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, COCAMIDE MEA, FRAGRANCE, SODIUM CITRATE, SODIUM XYLENESULFONATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, GUAR HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, DISODIUM EDTA, PANTENOL, PANTHENYL ETHYL ETHER, HISTIDINE, ZEA MAYS (CORN) SILK EXTRACT, VERBENA OFFICINALIS LEAF EXTRACT, PEARL EXTRACT, CITRUS NOBILIS (MANDARIN ORANGE) PEEL EXTRACT, CITRUS GRANDIS (GRAPEFRUIT) FRUIT EXTRACT, CITRUS AURANTIUM BERGAMIA (BERGAMOT) FRUIT EXTRACT, METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE, METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE",

SP is actually pretty good, but it's diluted to hell so you're not saving that much over the actual salon products in the long run. I'd suggest Biolage Hydrosource (get it from a salon or Ulta, Matrix products at big box stores and Amazon are not legit) or if you want something from a drugstore try Nexxus Emergencee or L'Oreal Evercreme. The latter is completely sulfate free. Shea Moisture and Cantu products are also good if you have very thick curly or wavy hair.",

Anyways, I recently picked up Paula’s choice and noticed after first time use my skin looks and feels way more oily then usual and needed some advise and expertise. \n\nMy morning and night time routine is fairly similar in the sense that I first use Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser, after application I rinse off and apply my Humphrey’s oil controlling Witch hazel toner, and once that has set I apply the Paula’s choice BHA exfoliant. \n\nI guess my question here is what am I doing wrong?

I do not dye or straighten my hair, I air-dry after showering.\n\nI have been trying out L'Oreal Botanicals Lavender shampoo / conditioner and weekly mask with satisfying results, but it seems to be a little expensive for a drugstore product, especially because my hair takes a large amount of product to condition and their (VERY creamy!) conditioner comes in a tiny 200ml tube.\n\nLooking at the curlsbot ingredient tester, the shampoo and conditioner products seem to be great! The conditioner has a great smell, very creamy and has no silicones or parabens and I had good results co-washing without shampoo over 3 days between shampoo washes. Almost no issue, except for two clarifying cleansers in the shampoo:  olefin sulfonate cocamide mea, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate. The products seem to be easy to find and leave a great smell in my hair.\n\n**I just need some approval about these products from curlies with experience** as I have just started growing out my enormous mane and I want to take good care of it. Reviews online are just not trustworthy.\n\nHere is a link to their product pages:\n\n[https://www.loreal-paris.co.uk/products/hair-care/shampoo/botanicals-lavender-shampoo](https://www.loreal-paris.co.uk/products/hair-care/shampoo/botanicals-lavender-shampoo)\n\n[https://www.loreal-paris.co.uk/products/hair-care/conditioner/botanicals-lavender-conditioner](https://www.loreal-paris.co.uk/products/hair-care/conditioner/botanicals-lavender-conditioner)",

The dimethicone present in the La Roche-Posay product is a silicone that could build up on your skin and may have a comedogenic effect.\n\nDespite the fact that the Bioderma product also contains silicones, they are chemically different and evaporate quickly.\n\nIf your skin is very oily, you could try moisturizing serums that contain hydrating ingredients with almost no greasy ones.\n\nTry using a gentle cleanser of the \"syndet\" type to remove dirt while leaving a bit of natural sebum to lubricate your skin :)",

    "body": "The hair on my head is pretty close to straight male middle eastern hair, and it's plentiful but not very coarse. My beard however, is still kind of thin (by brown people standards) but the hairs are rather coarse and pubey.\n\nMy scalp produces a lot of oil on its own, and at the end of the day my hair generally looks its best. I'm pretty sensitive to shampoos and conditioners. Virtually every drugstore conditioner I've ever used in my life has left my hair feeling weird after a shower, and by the end of the day when my natural oils have kicked in, it's just a mess. So I don't use it.\n\nAlmost every shampoo that I've used throughout the years has been some sulfate ridden goop. So when I take a shower, I'm just left feeling like my hair had some paint stripper run through it for a few hours until it stops being so flat and dry. Also, I *have* to wash my hair every day, because I also sweat like a garden hose, so the oiliness + the sweat is overwhelming when I wake up. I can't go into society once I haven't washed my hair in like 36 hours at most. The thing I really need the most out of a shampoo/conditioner is to just make my hair not smell like sweat.\n\nOrganix/OGX in particular was not good for me. Garnier was okay. One of the Pantenes were okay but I never saw it again, and the rest were awful.\n\nAlso, coconut stuff has left my hair feeling even worse. It dries me out to the point where my oils don't even do their thing.\n\nI never cared much because my natural oils just carried me throughout the day anyways. But now that I'm growing a beard in quarantine, I'm noticing that I need to do things a bit differently.\n\nMy face doesn't get very oily on its own, so my skin is great with little effort but my beard is dry and unruly as fuck. It definitely needs some kind of conditioner in the shower, beard oil/beard balm and brushing help but they are only doing so much.\n\nThe usual rotation of drugstore shampoos/conditioners is not good for my beard at all. I was looking into \"beard shampoo\" and \"beard conditioner\" but it's all really expensive, so I figured I might as well fix whatever I'm doing with my head anyways.\n\nI also have a laundry list of ingredients I'm trying to avoid:\n\n* parabens\n* sulfites and most sulfonates\n* silicones, particularly because of the beard\n* most alcohol (the fatty ones are okay)\n* triclosan\n* polyethylene glycols, but I'm kinda torn on propylene glycol but my research leads me to believe it's mostly okay \n* most coconut derived stuff - cocamidopropyl betaine is a big one that's in pretty much everything but I'm pretty wary of all the cocas, like cocamide MEA and DEA\n* salt (sodium chloride) unless it's pretty much one of the last ingredients\n* some of the stuff I was looking at met these requirements but had some sus antibacterial agents like methylisothiazolinone in them that even the big corporations were phasing out of their products\n\nSo far I've come across some low poo brands like Weleda, and some brands like SheaMoisture and Acure (mainly their conditioner) that fit the bill. Free & Clear shampoo looks good too but I heard their conditioner sucks. If you guys can suggest some other products that might work for me I'd really appreciate it.",

    "body": "Hi y'all! So I've been intrigued by the nopoo method for a while now and after talking to some of my online colleagues in the last few days, I've decided to give it a go! It's still mostly quarantine here in South Carolina/Georgia and I figured now would be as good a time as ever to give this a shot.\n\nI had washed my hair normally last Wednesday with the shampoo listed below. From what I understand I should not need a clarifying shampoo for that one but I could be wrong. Today I scritched and preened and brushed with a BBB brush, which made my hair go from fairly greasy to really gross looking, and then I showered and did a Water Only wash. I stood under the shower head with warm water and scritched and preened for at least twice as long as it usually takes me to wash my hair. Then I washed my body. And then I went back under the shower head and scritched and preened some more. My hair felt very oily to my fingers even after doing the water wash twice, but I resisted the urge to use the shampoo. I did use my regular bath towel to ruffle my hair so it wasn't soaking wet. I do intend to get a microfiber towel or maybe steal one of my husband's old tshirts... but I didn't have access to that today. As of right now, my hair is still wet so I am not sure if it still looks oily or not. I hope not. I will say again that it felt oily while in the shower, but it is feeling cleaner to the touch as it dries.\n\nMy goal is Water Only and I'm pretty much a cold turkey kind of person. I do have an important appointment the end of this week that I'll need to look presentable for, and I would like to look mostly clean for my in-laws when we visit on Saturdays. As my hair is short, it is difficult to pull it back if it gets bad. I can sort of pull back the top but only a bit. Also, I can't stand to wear a hat or really anything on my head beyond the occasional tiara... cause a girl needs a tiara every now and then, lol.\n\nI would gladly welcome any insights, warnings, anecdotes, encouragement, or words of wisdom any of y'all would like to toss my way. I am super new to this and want to be as prepared as I can be for this journey. I'm also very lazy when it comes to my hair so I know this is going to be a change for a while but I'm hoping it will be worth it.\n\nSo anyway, here's some information about my hair type, routine, and anything else I could think of to add in after reading through several posts on this page.\n\n**My Hair Type**: From the chart listed in the link on the sidebar I believe my hair type is \"2b: Wavy/Medium: Can tend to be frizzy and a little resistant to styling.\" The description for 2c also fits, but I don't have as much as a wave as indicated in the picture chart.  I have struggled with frizz all my life. It's gotten better since I moved to a more humid climate but when I go to my parent's in the desert the frizz comes back really bad. My hair is also very resistant to styling and will not hold a curl for more than an hour, even when I would use products as a teenager.\n\n**Porosity**: This one really confused me. I did the strand test where you feel the hair and it felt quite rough to me going from tip to root, which would mean high porosity. But then I did the water test and the strand never sank, which means low porosity. So I'm getting conflicting answers between the two different tests. I will say that my hair is coarse and holds onto water for a very long time. It takes hours to dry naturally. My hair is also very oily and always has been. My skin is oily as well. EDIT: After doing another test I'm going with Low Porosity. \n\n**Water**: According to my city's website and a map I found online my water is soft, but not very soft.\n\n**Protein**: I tested this today and when wet, my hair is stretchy but not very much. 20-30% seems about right. But honestly I'm guessing as I didn't use a ruler or anything to try and get actual measurements.\n\n**History:** I am a 38 year old female and I have only ever dyed my hair twice before. I was in my 20s both times. I do not use heat styling except for special occasions so maybe twice a year. I will blow dry my hair occasionally as going to bed with wet hair is a problem for me, but I prefer to let my hair air dry and do so most of the time. I do not use hairspray, gel, or mousse except when I heat style for special occasions.\n\n**My goals**: I am tired of my hair being oily and greasy all the time. I want a low maintenance hair care routine. (I know that it will take extra work during transition). I want to get rid of my frizziness and unmanaged look. I would very much like to stop buying shampoo. I want to be Water Only if possible.\n\n**My current routine**:  I have been washing my hair on Sundays and Wednesday with Herbal Essences Smooth Rose Hips Hair Smoothing Shampoo. Maybe once a month I will use the matching Herbal Essences Conditioner on my tips. Occasionally I will use Clean Freak: Not Your Mother's Dry Shampoo spray on Saturday's before going to visit my in-laws for presentability. I have used nothing else in my hair for at least the last 3 months, and probably longer than that.\n\n**Herbal Essences Smooth Rose Hips Hair Smoothing Shampoo:**  **Ingredients**: Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Cocamide Mea, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium Edta, Peg-60 Almond Glycerides, Linoleamidopropyl Pg-dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Red 33, Yellow 5, Blue 1.\n\n***I put this shampoo into the tool mentioned in the pinned post and it turned up sulfates but no silicone, so I am assuming that I don't need a clarifying wash. Please correct me if I'm wrong about this.***\n\n**Herbal Essences Smooth Rose Hips Hair Smoothing Conditioner:** **Ingredients**: Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Glutamic Acid, Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Edta, Tocopheryl Acetate, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Yellow 5, Red 33.\n\n**Clean Freak: Not Your Mother's Dry Shampoo: Ingredients:**  ISOBUTANE PROPANESD ALCOHOL 40-BALUMINUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATEISOPROPYL MYRISTATESILICAISOBUTANE PROPANESD ALCOHOL 40-BALUMINUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATEISOPROPYL MYRISTATESILICA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank y'all so much for reading!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/db5hs2i2v3951.jpg?width=953&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c44bd5d1a9db1b7dcaba004645f16afd9fb0a47d",

Your hair might surprise you and get pretty wavy, it looks like there's some hiding in there to me.\n\nThat conditioner has silicone in it, but you should be good if you did a last wash with the shampoo.\n\nThere are alternative washes available that won't impact your transition progress that you can use when you need to look presentable. Rye flour is quite popular.  Since you have soft water,  you have quite a few options.  There's a link in the sidebar with a number of options in it.\n\nI do have an unrelated question.

        "body": "Hmm. Well, I washed my hair with water only for the first time today. My hair was quite oily before washing as it had been 4 days since my last shampoo. I was hopeful that I'd be pleasantly surprised and that water only would make my hair look cleaner even if it was just for a day. Unfortunately, now that my hair is dry, it still looks like I poured a bottle of oil on it. I read in someone else's post that their hair would be oily after washing but it would be better the next morning. I'm hoping for some of that mojo. \n\nI have also started looking into LowPoo as a possibility to get through the oily transition if it's going to be this bad. Curlsbot.com recommended the  Not Your Mother's Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water Sea Minerals Shampoo and Conditioner. My local Walgreens says they have some in stock so I might go grab them tomorrow so that I'll have something \"acceptable\" in the house when I can't take it any more and have to do something to clear the oil.

    "body": "I've started using a shampoo and conditioner from the L'Oreal Elvive Hydra Hyaluronic range recently. The products are advertised for dry hair and contain ingredients such as glycerin and sodium hyaluronate, typically used as humectants in skincare.\n\nMy understanding of glycerin and sodium hyaluronate is that they are water-based ingredients, so I was sceptical if this is just marketing and if they'd do anything meaningful or simply be washed out.\n\nThe formula does include silicones, so perhaps the active ingredients could be trapped underneath that, but on the other hand, perhaps the silicones would be stopping them from penetrating the hair? (I'm not sure if the glycerol or hyaluronate are the right molecular size to enter the hair shaft in the first place.)\n\nSuppose they could bypass the cuticle would they provide any benefit?\n\nI've been looking at diagrams of hair anatomy and can't tell if dry healthy hair is meant to contain a certain amount of water. Assuming it is, and that a damaged cuticle leads to a reduction of this as water is escaping, leaving hair feeling \"dry\", would such ingredients be able to increase the water content in hair?\n\nIf so, is there such a thing as too much water, where this could help damaged hair, but make healthy hair limp or fragile? \n\n\"Dry\" hair is fragile too, ie. inflexible and prone to snapping, but it's not clear if increasing water content can alleviate this if oils and silicones haven't been enough.\n\nMy understanding of humectants in skincare is that they work by either drawing in water from the air or pulling it up from the skin surface, but neither of those seem to apply here, so are hair humectants doing anything, particularly when used with silicones? Would it maybe make sense to apply silicones afterwards?\n\nThe hair range also includes a leave-in product with a lot more hyaluronate, and oil instead of silicone, but I don't know about penetration when it comes to applying this on dry hair (presumably on a layer of silicones from the conditioner).\n\nI'd love if someone could weigh in on the science here.\n\n--\n\nList of the ingredients in this range for reference:\n\nShampoo:  \nAQUA / WATER • SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE • GLYCOL DISTEARATE • SODIUM CHLORIDE • COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE • DIMETHICONE • CI 60730 / EXT.

HYA and glycerin won’t remain on your hair when washed out, but in a conditioner, they may linger a bit, as most conditioners leave behind a film by design.  It is good to have humectants in a formulation for many reasons.  But not every ingredient in a formulation is going to perform independently as it would if you were using separately.  In other words, in a formulation it does one thing, while if you were put a HYA serum directly on your hair, it would do something else (or have a different effect rather).  \n\nFwiw, you can always a drop or two of HYA or glycerin to your leave-in conditioner if you want more humectants in your hair.",

        "body": "The relationship between hair and water is complicated.  When most people talk about \"moisturizing\" or \"hydrating\" their hair, they're really talking about the benefits of using conditioner, which mostly forms a coating of conditioning agents on the hair that make it softer and smoother rather than adding water.  It's a mis-application of skincare concepts to hair.  Hair is quite different from skin.  If there's too much water in the hair, it actually feels more dry, which is what the moisture bot that this comment will trigger says.  Porous hair, especially if there is chemical or heat or sun or chlorine damage, will usually allow too much water into the hair shaft, so conditioners offer the benefit of decreasing (but not completely blocking) the amount of water that passes through.\n\nHowever there has been a bit of an overcorrection of this idea in some hair science circles to give the impression that hair doesn't benefit from any water at all, and that's not true either.  [This video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1qFlgNSgLp/) is information-dense and just scratches the surface of the topic, and I wish I had additional resources to share but that's all I've found that's made for a general audience.\n\nIn your situation, your hair feels dry (rough/brittle) to you, so it may actually have too much water in it and would benefit from products with oils, silicones and other polymers that help reduce water passing through.  L'Oreal has a big budget for product development and testing, so I trust that their products are good for the hair type they say they are, but exactly how & why may not match what the label says, that's just marketing that is aimed to appeal to customer's *perceptions*, not reflect scientific reality.  It could be the silicones in the product and other ingredients you're not familiar with that offer a lot of the benefits that the product promises.  You might find some of the [LabMuffin Beauty articles/videos on silicones](https://labmuffin.com/?s=silicones) useful, it's important to understand that they don't create an impermeable barrier on the hair to block anything from getting through.\n\nI share the skepticism of the other commenter that humectants in a shampoo would do much for hair, since it's meant to remove stuff from the hair and then is rinsed out.  Conditioners are formulated to stick to the hair, however it's still very possible that the hyaluronic acid is featured mainly for marketing purposes.  There has been a recent fad in marketing to highlight skincare actives in the products, but hair and skin are very different and those actives don't necessarily behave the same way for hair or help hair at all.  Glycerin may be useful if the product leaves it on the hair, but people's experiences with glycerin in hair products vary wildly, because it depends a lot on your local climate and the humidity level of the air around your hair.  It's also possible that glycerin was added to the product to change the product consistency rather than its effect on the hair, or simply because people *associate* it with moisture/hydration even though that's not the role it plays in the product.",

Plus the insoluble salts can leave a greasy layer on items immersed in the water at the time. In fact this is similar to how commercial greases are made: Oils are thickened with calcium salts of fatty acids or alkylsulfonates, which are partially soluble in the oil, so convert it into a semi-solid mixture, aka grease.",

    "body": "So I was going through all the old products in my house trying to get rid of old/unusable stuff aka not curly girl friendly, and I ran across an old bottle of Suave Naturals Shampoo Passion Flower that must be at least 8 years old. I recently bought ogx coconut curls conditioner and was thinking this might be useful to wash out the Dimethicone. Looking at the ingredients I was surprised the second ingredient was ammonium lauryl sulfate because I thought Suave Naturals didn't use sulfates, but I haven't looked at the shampoos too much. So a few questions here: 1. Is this shampoo too old/has it gone bad? 2. Would this be useful in removing the cones from my conditioner? and 3. Would this be a good shampoo to hold onto or should I just toss it?\n\n\n\nIngredients: Water, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Ammonium Chloride, Tocopheryl Acetate, Passion Flower Extract, Peppermint Extract, Rose Extract, Lavender Extract, Cocamide MEA, Fragrance, PEG-5 Cocamide, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, D&C Red No 33, D&C Orange No 4.",

I'm so happy for him. ^ _ ^\n\nHowever he has a coconut allergy so it's really hard to find shaving soap or lotion. I've taken up making him special soap from scratch but I'm learning it really could be better than what I am doing. Unless there is a really good recipe from some other home soap makers here I am wanting to buy him some stuff.\n\nAs far as I know he just does his shave after a shower and not doing the 'pre-shave' oil or lotion. Would there be something I could get him that might make his experience better?\n\nAnd of course what would be a good shaving lotion or soap I could order online for him that has no coconut? \n\nIf you are unsure some of the lesser common names of coconut I found a handy list I've used every time I buy him stuff I keep handy on my phone:\n \n* 1,2 Octanediol\n* 2 Phenoxyethanol\n* Ammonium Lauryl Sulphate\n* Capryl Glycol\n* Caprylic Acid\n* Caprylic Glycol\n* Caprylic/Capric\n* Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides\n* Caprylyl Glycol\n* Ceteareth-20\n* Cetearyl Alcohol\n* Cetearyl Glucoside\n* Ceteth-20 Phosphate\n* Cetyl Alcohol\n* Cetyl Esters\n* Cocamide MEA\n* Cocamidopropyl Betaine\n* Cococaprylate/Caprate\n* Coco Glucoside\n* Cocomide DEA\n* Coconut diethanolamide (CDFA)\n* Cocos nucifera (another name for coconut oil)\n* Coconut Oil\n* Decyl Glucoside\n* Disodium Cocamphodiprop\n* Disodium cocoamphodiacetate\n* Emusifying Wax\n* Glyceryl Caprylate\n* Glyceryl cocoate\n* Hexyl Laurate\n* Isopropyl Myristate\n* Laureth-3\n* Lauric Acid\n* Lauryl Glucoside\n* Lauryl Alcohol\n* Lauramide DEA\n* Myristic Acid\n* Olefin Sulfonate\n* Organic Sodium Cocoate\n* PEG - 7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* PEG -100\n* PEG – 100 Stearate\n* Phenoxyethanol\n* Polysorbate 20\n* Sodium Cocoate\n* Sodium Coco-Sulfate\n* Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate\n* Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate\n* Sucrose Stearate\n* Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n* Sodium Laureth Sulfate\n* Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinat\n* Sodium Lauryl Sulfate\n* Sodium Stearate\n* Sorbitan Stearate\n* Stearyl Alcohol\n* Stearalkonium chloride\n* Sucrose Cocoate\n* TEA-Laureth Sulfate\n* Vegetable Cetearyl Glucose\n* Vegetable Glycerine (depends on source)\n\nAs you might imagine it's really hard to buy him stuff sometimes. -_-",

You say it's a coconut allergy, but it looks like the sodium stearate would be a salt of stearic acid, and would be dependent upon whether or not it's derived from saponifying coconut oil.   \nIf his allergy is only to coconut oil, and not actually to the stearates, you may be able to find a decent soap that is suitable.  \nHow severe are his allergic reactions?",

A decent number of people on this subreddit, including me, find or suspect that niacinamide and/or hyaluronic acid are irritating, but there are plenty of people who are fine with those ingredients. Shea butter aggravates some people with rosacea but not others. I think I read somewhere that citric acid can bother some people with sensitive skin. Other than that, it really just comes down to individual differences I think. \n\nSo long as they play well with your skin, I imagine the oils, shea butter, fatty alcohols, and ceramides in these could all be helpful for sensitive and dry skin.",

Completely different ends of the price spectrum, but I find them to both work incredibly well on my wavy, fine hair. I've been using the gisou shampoo and conditioner for over a year now, and it makes my hair so healthy. I have an issue however-I've noticed that whenever I use it, I shed WAY more than usual. Recently I switched back to Garnier just to try it, and I immediately stopped shedding like that when washing. Why might this be?

    "body": "I'm fairly sure I have seb-derm or something extremely similar, and have been using the Eucerin urea shampoo to deal with this. It not only helps with my scalp, but my hair gets very soft and clean from it. However, after moving to a different state with harder water, it got a little more oily more often, and I ran out of the shampoo. Since I couldn't find it online for a reasonable price, and my hair was getting steadily worse even oily right after the shower, I tried others.\n\nFirst was a hard water shampoo with helped mildly, then Tsal which helped a bit (applied non-optimally), then Flexitol which seemed to make it worse. I then applied Tsal dry to my hair, sectioning it out, applying it twice more in the shower, letting each application sit for 2-3 minutes. This removed the oily feeling, but it takes a LARGE amount, and a few days later my hair felt dry and a bit tangly. So far I've been doing about the same thing but not applying it dry.\n\nMy question is why does the Eucerin Shampoo help so much when others help very little or take so much product to reach the same effectiveness? I've also used the Sebamed shampoo before, but it's also very hard to find now. Is it just the percentage of Urea, and Eucerin has a very high percentage without noting it anywhere on their website? Other ingredients in Flexitol making the urea less effective? Should I just try using the Eucerin Scalp treatment since this is somewhat easy to get?

    "body": "You have a plethora of fancy hair colour options today, ranging from deep burgundy to rich auburn, chocolate brown to champagne. Indeed, you don't have to think twice about dying your hair lavender, marine blue, or even pink, do you? After all, everyone else is wearing trendy shades.\n\nBut hold on! Do you take the time to look over the ingredients in your hair colour before purchasing it? When you're shopping for hair dyes, does the word \"ammonia\" ring a caution bell in your head? If you're ever unsure whether or not you should buy [***ammonia-free hair dye***](https://30shades.ie/brand/bbcos/keratincolor/), let us help you out.  \n\n\n1.  **WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF AMMONIA IN HAIR DYES?**\n\nAmmonia is an alkali that is used to raise the pH of your hair when it is being coloured. It aids in the opening of the cuticles (hair's outer layer) so that dye or hair colour can be deposited on the cortex (the inner layer of your hair).\n\nSimply explained, ammonia causes the hair cuticle to bulge. The greater the absorption of hair colour into the hair, the longer your hair dye will last.\n\n**2. AMMONIA'S DANGEROUS EFFECTS ON HAIR COLORING**\n\n· When ammonia is dissolved in water, it generates ammonium hydroxide, which can irritate the skin. When it comes into contact with the skin, it can cause skin burns, as well as irritation to the nose and eyes.\n\n· Ammonia dyes harm the cuticle, allowing moisture to leave. Frizzy, dry, and brittle hair is the result of this.\n\n· Ammonia is used on the hair, it has the potential to enter the bloodstream via the scalp. Lung difficulties, sinus infections, throat infections, and eye infections can all be caused by the ammonia vapours that salon employees are exposed to.\n\n· Ammonia penetrates the hair and degrades an amino acid called tyrosine. Tyrosine helps hair retain its colour by regulating the generation of melanin (hair pigment) (new or old). When tyrosine is depleted, your hair's capacity to hold any colour is harmed.\n\n· Ammonia is detrimental to the environment. When it is washed into the ocean, it can harm agriculture and forests, as well as pose a threat to aquatic animals. Ammonia molecules are small and quickly evaporate. This evaporation produces a strong odour.\n\n3.  **DOES AMMONIA APPEAR IN ALL HAIR DYES?**\n\nAmmonia dyes used to be the sole way to darken your strands. Today, however, there are a variety of ammonia-free hair dyes available.\n\nWhile ammonia-based hair dyes can stay for a long time (thus the term \"permanent hair dye\"), ammonia-free hair dyes are kinder to your hair and skin. Organic hair colours are a good choice if you have a sensitive scalp.\n\n4.  **WHAT ARE THE CONTENTS OF AMMONIA-FREE DYES?**\n\nMonoethanolamine (MEA), which contains alcohol, is used in ammonia-free hair colour. To make MEA less harmful, it is added at a lower concentration and in combination with emollient oils. Other ammonia substitutes include cocamide MEA and aminomethyl propanol MEA. Permanent hair dyes without ammonia, often known as demi-permanent hair colour, contain such chemicals.\n\nSemi-permanent hair dyes are dyes that do not contain ammonia. They do not open up the cuticle to achieve long-term benefits. Instead, the dye is applied to the outer layer of your hair strands.\n\n **5. BENEFITS OF AN AMMONIA-FREE DYE**\n\n· Does not irritate the scalp or create itching.\n\n· Ammonia-free hair dyes do not damage the cuticle of your hair, so don't ruin your hair's health.\n\n· Hair can retain any colour for longer since the melanin is not damaged.\n\n· It has no pungent smell and does not irritate any of your senses.\n\n **6. WRAPPING IT ALL UP**\n\nYou don't have to give up on your desire to colour your hair in your favourite colour. We have the best organic, scalp-friendly and [***ammonia-free hair dye***](https://30shades.ie/brand/bbcos/keratincolor/) alternative. At **30 shades of blonde**, we offer a variety of organic hair colours to choose from, all of which are ammonia-free. If you are still not convinced that ammonia-free is better, visit our website and read the testimonials. Probably, that will convince you.",

Although ive noticed these little hairs sticking up all over my head so i hope thats a sign of new regrowth. I also was told by the hair dresser i now have some silicone buildup in my hair that i need to clear up too. \n\nThanks in advance guys :) \n",

It's well above my knowledge level, but I avoid Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Laurel Sulfate. They are cheap industrial cleaners and destroy oil. They also give a nice foam which we've gotten use to as a reaction thinking it's cleaning or something.\n\nGlycerin is great by itself as something between my humectant layer and occlusive top layer.\n\nI think Citric Acid acts as a drying agent like alcohol. \n\nI think your last few ingredients are fragrance—Citrus Oil, Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool. If you have remotely any skin issues kick all fragrances to the curb. (\"Unscented\" means it has a scent, but they added more chemicals to stop it from smelling.)  \"Fragrance Free\" is the term to look for and even that is never 100% honest.

Read the following to find out.\n\nThis [Body-care Salt with Seaweed by TianDe](https://www.truegether.com/category/health-and-beauty) works as an exfoliating scrub that gently cleanses the body of impurities and gives a moisturized soft and glowing skin. This is another product of TianDe’s Hainan Tao collection. \n\nThe brand TianDe states to work as a bioactive supplement for the skin and their results are similar to therapeutic solutions. TianDe states the wisdom and knowledge of the Ancient East have brought uniqueness to their formula. They claim to use herbal ingredients and nanotechnology to induce their products. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fyeoypzoogr71.png?width=180&format=png&auto=webp&s=c03d0879a3af508b966fdb18d952af53156fe2a4\n\nNow let’s talk about the ingredients and benefits of the TianDe Body Care Salt with Seaweed;\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n· Maris sal, potassium lauroyl glutamate, agua, glycerin, hydroxyethylcellulose, sodium Laureth sulfate, linalool, algae extract, parfum, citronellol, Cocamidopropyl betaine, xanthan gum, cocamide MEA, geraniol, imidazolidinyl urea, benzyl benzoate, tetrasodium EDTA, citral, hexyl cinnamal.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n· This body care salt along with seaweed helps in removing the dead skin cells on the body.\n\n· It is a gentle body scrub for cleansing.\n\n· It cleans the body of impurities by effective exfoliation.\n\n· It provides nourishment and moisture to the skin by taking care of the hydro-balance of the skin.\n\n· It contains dusted Fucus (algae of the Pacific Ocean) which is abundant in micro and trace elements along with vitamins. It is a great way of locking moisture into the skin.\n\nThis is a unisex full body scrub. There is no suitable skin type. Consider doing a patch test before using this scrub all over your body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgjke2nqogr71.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffe5f5e598f0181345f16b15bd34c204390e432d\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n· Take out a small amount of the TianDe Body Care Salt and apply it to your skin.\n\n· Gently massage the body care salt in a circular motion all over your body.\n\n· After massaging properly wash off the salt with water.\n\n· Pat dry your body with a gentle towel.\n\n· Apply suitable gentle moisturizer according to skin type and conditions.\n\n· Use it twice a week for exfoliation to achieve the best results.\n\nAs for me, this has proved to be a good exfoliating scrub. I have dry sensitive skin so it is hard for me to find a suitable product. However, this body care salt with seaweed has not caused any negative reaction. This does not confirm that the body scrub will be ideal for everyone since not all people have the same skin. Whether a product will suit you depends on your skin conditions, allergies, tolerance and skin type. That is why I always recommend a patch test. \n\nBody scrubs are generally used for exfoliation. Exfoliating the skin twice a week helps in preventing acne and providing soft glowing skin. The dirt and impurities that hide deep into the pores can't be cleaned with simple soaps or body washes. Using body scrub twice a week is a healthy habit for healthy, clean and nourished skin.\n\nThere you go, that’s all you need to about this TianDe Body Care Salt with Seaweed.\n\nAlso, you may check out these [free online selling sites like eBay](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html) for better deals and discounts!",
