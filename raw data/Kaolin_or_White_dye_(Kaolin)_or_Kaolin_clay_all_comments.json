Bottom, Iranian Shamshir, Crucible steel.](https://preview.redd.it/oj7m6y0k3e591.jpg?width=6733&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be106e56821267c4dfb0c9c1707143f878f62c87)\n\n**\"Damascus steel\" usually refers to two main types of steel**:\n\nThe most common you'll see made today is \"**pattern-welded steel**\", where alternating layers of nickel rich and nickel deplete steel are stacked, forge welded, and **folded** or manipulated to create a pattern. The blade is then polished and etched to reveal the layers. While modern pattern welded blades typically use nickel containing steels to maximise contrast, historically this was not the case.\n\nThis method of construction using stacked, folded or otherwise forge welded, dissimilar* steels is how the majority of sword steels were made, worldwide, until advances in technology allowed for the use of more homogenous steel products. Pattern welding, and variants such as multibar patterns and laminated blades, were used widely and includes swords like spatha, “viking” swords, katana and more. It is worth noting that even \"monosteel\" swords which were made without the use of dissimilar steel, but still made from bloomery or refined blast furnace steel, were also subject to similar stacking, folding and forge welding techniques.\n\n*Bloom is here considered to contain multiple dissimilar steels due to the heterogeneous nature of bloom. \n\nThis description of pattern welding and forge consolidated steels is intentionally simplified as they are not the focus of todays post, however for more information - particularly on bloomery and blast furnace production of steels - I recommend \"The Knight and the Blast Furnace\" by Alan Williams.\n\nIn the present day, this is the type you will see chef’s knives, swords, and even pocket knives being made of, and it can range from being rather cheap to incredibly expensive depending on the materials and workmanship.\n\n[Pattern welded Pala blade in \\\\\"Turkish Ribbon Twist\\\\\" style.](https://preview.redd.it/ijgu7seo3e591.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=630b2d095047fcd34d73f1e37c87db156a4f195a)\n\nThe other type of \"Damascus Steel\" is a form of hypereutectoid, pattern forming **crucible steel.**\n\nAnd that is what I will be discussing today.\n\nIt is a hypereutectoid steel, which means that it has over 0.8% carbon by definition. It is formed by liquifying steel in a crucible, and is **NOT** **produced by folding** or layering steel. The typical composition is around 1% to 2% carbon, which by modern standards makes this an “ultra-high carbon steel”, often abbreviated as UHCS.\n\nIt is formed by melting steel with specific impurities in a crucible (historically, made of high kaolin content clay, rice husks as chaff, quartz sands, and other additives), and the process of turning this crucible “charge” into steel is quite complicated, with the potential for failure to produce an attractive pattern being high if any part of the process is not conducted correctly.\n\nIn summary, the crucible charge is brought up to melting temperature, and held at this temperature for a while, allowing the constituent alloying elements present in the steel to spread and bubbles to boil out. It is then slowly cooled, before the ingot is removed, roasted to decarburise the rim, drawn out into a bar, manipulated to produce a surface pattern with ball peens, wedges and grinding, and finally forged it into a blade, and thermally cycled.\n\nAs stated, this steel is typically the range of carbon content is between 1 and 2% in historical examples, and thus melts in a temperature range between 1200 and 1400c (for more information, see “iron carbon phase diagrams”). It must also have sufficient levels of carbide formers (vanadium, molybdenum, manganese etc) in order to form patterns (Verhoeven et al, 1998,. Verhoeven et al 2018).\n\nThe pattern in crucible steel are formed by \"rafts\" of steel rich in carbide formers, where ultra-hard cementite spheroids form over subsequent forging cycles, which etch bright, and areas devoid of carbide forming elements (CFEs), which remain as pearlite, a soft mix of carbides which etches dark. The shape and size of the rafts is determined by the length of dendrites that form during the slow cooling of the ingot, as dendritic regions of the steel are carbide former depleted, and interdendritic regions are carbide former rich (Verhoeven et al, 2018).\n\n[Crucible steel shamshir blade, kara Khorasan pulad](https://preview.redd.it/rbchxn5t3e591.png?width=8091&format=png&auto=webp&s=6081374d34827d01a9493c3673aeddc09372cbb0)\n\nMany people conflate pattern-welded steel with crucible steel, and call both “Damascus”. Whilst this is accepted in colloquial language, it is important to distinguish between the two – particularly when it comes to identifying antiques, or documenting them.\n\n\"Damascus\" can therefore be used to refer to either pattern welded, or crucible steels, as both are pattern-forming steels, but it is best to specify which sort of \"Damascus\" is being discussed. The term has been used historically to describe both pattern-welded steel and crucible steel. Many swords and gun barrels made in germany were marked \"damastahl\" in the 18th and 19th century, and they were pattern welded, so there is historical precedent for such a naming convention, but the two techniques (and end products) are very different.\n\n**To be ABSOLUTELY CLEAR: \"True\" damascus steel is herein used as a term to refer to historical, patterned crucible steel. I am using this term entirely because it is understandable. The correct naming and etymology is discussed later. Both pattern welded and crucible steel blades can be called \"damascus\", and were historically, but the \"lost\" form is the crucible steel form.**\n\n**The Myth: \"Damascus Steel is a Lost Art\":**\n\nThe is quite a long history of crucible “Damascus” steel, in the form of primary sources in which the process was written down - as early as 350BCE - 420BCE Zosimus, an early alchemist in Alexandria, wrote the following:\n\n>\"The tempering of Indian Iron: Take 4 pounds of soft iron, and the skins of myrobalans, called elileg, 15 parts; belileg, 4 parts; and two parts of glassmakers magnesia. Then place it into a crucible and make it level. .... Put on the charcoal and blow the fire until the iron becomes molten and the ingredients become united with it. ... Such is the premier and royal operation, which is practiced today and by means of which they make marvelous swords. It was discovered by the Indians and exploited by the Persians\".\n\nThis is by no means the only method to make crucible steel - some was co-fusion, using both cast iron and bloom, while some was indeed made with bloomery and carbon bearing material (often plants).\n\nIncidentally, the oldest known crucible steel sword is from the 6th to 3rd century BCE and was found interred in a megalithic site in Thelunganur, Tamil Nadu, India (Ramesh et al, 2019) and daggers from \\~500BCE have been found with the associated production site in Kodumanal, Tamil Nadu (Sasisekaran & Rao, 1999. Sasisekaran, 2002). This is consistent with the Zosimus account describing the technique as discovered by India.\n\n[Thelunganur sword, Ramesh et al 2019](https://preview.redd.it/cfthvr2f4e591.jpg?width=2128&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8141215372f59d840de48a1f9237b31689535a4)\n\nThe Islamic writers al-Kindi (full name Abu Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi - circa 800CE - 873CE) and al-Beruni (full name Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni - circa 973CE - 1048CE) both wrote detailed procedures for the production of crucible steel, too.\n\n⁠This is how Biruni described it in the manuscript Al-Jamâhir Marefat al-Jawâher. (From Khorasani et al, 2013):\n\n>“He says that they \\[ironwokers\\] include five ratl رطل of \\[horse\\] shoes, the nails of which are made of narmâhan نرمآهن\\] in the crucible\\]. Then they add ten derham درهم of each \\[of the ingredients\\] rusaxtaj روسختج\\] antimony\\], marqiša-ye talâ’i طلائى مرقيشا\\] golden marcasite\\] and meqnesiyâ مغنسيا\\] meqnisiyâ مغنيسيا ;manganese dioxide MnO2\\] to the crucible, close the crucible with clay, and put it in the furnace. Then they fill the furnace with charcoal and blow air with Rumi (Roman Byzantine/Anatolian) bellows that are pumped by two men until the iron melts. Then they add a combination of halile هليله) myrobalan), pust-e anâr انار پوست) pomegranate peel), melh al-ajeyn ملحالعجين) the salt used for dough), and sadaf-e morvarid مرواريد صدف) pearl shell). From each the same amount approaching forty derham درهم are placed into small bags. One small bag is then added to each crucible. They keep heating vigorously without pause for one hour and then stop the heat. After it cools off, they take out the iron ingot (egg) from the crucibles. A person said that he was sitting next to a smith who was making swords in the province of Send سند\\] Sind\\]. He saw that the smith was using narmâhan نرمآهن and putting a very soft, ground mixture, which had a red color on it. Then the smith placed it in the furnace, and took it out and hammered it, and continued this process a couple of times. When asked why he did that he looked contemptuously. When he \\[the person sitting next to the smith\\] looked closely, he saw that the smith was hammering and mixing dus دوص with narmâhan نرمآهن the same way they made iron ingots (eggs) in Herat.”\n\nThe metallurgical research into how this steel gets its patterns spans back far, with Michael Faraday (yes, that Faraday) having published a paper on recreating Indian crucible steel (known to him as wootz) in 1819, with subsequent papers in 1820 and 1822. It wasn't until 1837 when Pavel Anasov, a Russian metallurgist and director of the Zlatoust arms factory, that it was successfully recreated in any substantial quantity. Since then, research has been done on modern steels (Sherby and Wadsworth, 1983) and on historical blades, revealing the mechanisms by which the patterns forms (Verhoeven et al, 1998).\n\nAnosov was a metallurgist and Colonel of the Russian Army during the occupation on the Emirate of Bukhara in the 1820’s, when he established contact with steelmakers in the region and attempted to recreate the steel in his steelworks in Zlatoust, but after failing asked Captain Massalski (results published 1841) whose regiment was stationed there, to observe the process and undertake further observations.\n\nMassalski documented the Bukhara method, noting 3 key metals, cast iron, iron, and silver. Massalski stresses the ratio of one part iron, 3 parts cast iron (N.B: a co-fusion method of making steel with the right amount of carbon) and the crucibles hold around 2.5kg of steel, making up 1/3rd of the potential capacity of the crucible.\n\nThe metal workers start the fire and the metal begins to melt after some 5 to 6 hours, and makes a bubbling sound. When the bubbling sound ends, this is a sign that the fusion has ended. The workers remove the lid, add 0.013kg to 0.017kg of silver, stir rapidly with an iron rod, cover the charge with charcoal, and cover again with the lid. (N.B: this was a potentially primitive form of \"killing\" the steel, a process by which reactive elements in the charge react with another reactive metal - silver in this case, aluminium in modern times - and are thus removed from the reaction, resulting in less porosity due to gas production. The other method of degassing historically used was simply holding the ingot at the molten, liquidus temperature for longer). \n\n* N.B: Silver is not particularly reactive, so the purpose of silver might not have been killing the steel. The atmosphere and composition of a crucible melt, as well as the 1400-1500c temperature at which silver was added require further investigation to determine the mode of action. it may be that the liquid silver was moving into the grain boundaries of the steel during solidification, displacing phosphorus or sulphur.\n\nThey return the crucible to the fire and allow it to cool as the charcoal burns out, slowly, over 3 days. After cooling, the ingot is removed and tested by polishing to check for dendrites. The steel then passes to smiths, who “know that from then onwards whether the ingot survives being forged is a matter of luck”\n\n[A freshly made crucible steel ingot, image credit Peter Burt](https://preview.redd.it/zkm0z19a4e591.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c39855adc912f208268efe017e54de3cc3f55ae)\n\nThis is clear evidence that not only was the crucible steel production process being conducted in Bukhara in 1841, but that the mechanisms of pattern formation were already being formally investigated. And this is by far not the most recent ethnographic account of crucible steel manufacture.\n\nIn Mawalgaha, Sri Lanka, Ananda Coomaraswamy documented crucible steel production in 1903 – (Coomaraswamy, A. (1908): Medieval Sinhalese Art. Pantheon Books, New York, Juleff et al 2009). He found two crucible ingot fragments, crucibles, iron blooms and small iron bars. The two crucible ingot fragments were collected from the Mawalgaha village, where Kiri Ukkuwa demonstrated how to make steel for Coomaraswamy – providing the most recent known eyewitness evidence for crucible steel manufacturing.\n\nThis form of \"Damascus\" steel was therefore historically used as early as the 6th century BCE (Park et al 2019) and as late as 1841 when Massalski recorded crucible steel production in Bukhara, leading to the production of Bulat in Zlatoust by Anosov, and 1903 in Sri Lanka (though it was not actively being made en masse, and was only demonstrated using previously abandoned equipment).\n\n**In summary: Production between 1903ish, and 1980ish, was virtually halted, thus leading to the myth of it being a \"lost art\", however as will be shown in this document, the process was well documented and has since been replicated.**\n\nThe result is that there are now upwards of 150 individuals (at least, that I know of) who can produce crucible steel with an accurate metallurgical composition, which naturally form patterns in the steel due to carbide segregation. It is structurally, functionally and visually identical to historical crucible steel - and can only be differentiated by analysing the amount of radionuclides in the steel, as all historical steel is low background steel, and modern recreations are typically not.\n\nBecause I recognise that metallurgy is easier to grasp with visual aides, here is a comparison of antique crucible steel from an Iranian shamshir in my collection, and modern crucible steel (made by Niko Hynninen).\n\n[Left: Closeup of an antique Iranian shamshir blade in crucible steel.

The modern term “wootz” first appears around 1794 in writings by Sir Joseph Banks, who mistranslated Sanskrit for “utsa” as “wootz” (Dube, 2014). In the regions where crucible steel was made, and where it was forged into blades, it was not called \"damascus\". This name is primarily a medieval name, and primarily used in Europe.\n\nThe origin of the name \"Damascus\" steel is contentious - The Islamic writers al-Kindi (full name Abu Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi) (circa 800 AD - 873 AD) and al-Beruni (full name Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni) (circa 973 AD - 1048 AD) were both scholars who wrote about swords and steel made for swords, based on their surface appearance, geographical location of production or forging, or the name of the smith.\n\nThere are three potential sources for the term \"Damascus\" in the context of steel.\n\nThe word \"Damas\" stems from the root word for \"water\" (\"ma\") or \"broiling\" in Arabic (Sachse, 1994, 13) and Damascus blades are often described as exhibiting a water-pattern on their surface, and are referred to as \"watered steel\" not only in English but in other languages.\n\nThe second theory is geographical, as Al-Kindi called swords produced and forged in Damascus as Damascene (al-Hassan, 1978, 35) but it's worth noting that crucibl steel blades were made in many nations, and crucible steel is not known to have ever been produced in the city of Damascus. Al Kindi also describes crucible steel production using the typical term Pulad, distinct from these damascene swords, indicating that the two types are separate. It is also worth noting that Al-Kindi did not describe these swords as having pattern forming steel.\n\nThird, Beiruni mentions a sword-smith called Damasqui who made swords of crucible steel (Said, 1989, 219-220). In a similar fashion, Al-Kindi mentions swords called “Zaydiya which were forged by a man called Zayd, and hence they were attributed to his name\". We therefore have a precedent for naming swords based on their makers, which may explain how \"Damascus\" came about.\n\nIt is my opinion that the \"watered\" hypothesis is most likely for the origin, though the popularisation of the term may have indeed occurred due to western travellers who purchased the swords in damascus, and described them thusly, as it was a massive center for trade.\n\n**How Crucible steel gets its pattern:**\n\nCrucible steel, as the name implies, is made in a crucible process, and requires completely liquefication of the crucible charge.\n\nMost surviving \"recipes\" for crucible steel call for either a combination of bloomery iron, and cast iron, or the use of bloomery iron and organic carbon sources (like plant leaves) - but crucible steel recipes included other elements, like organic material - rice husks, leaves, bark - as well as shells, glass, and even silver. The trace impurities in the iron used, and in these additives, are key to the patterns they show after forging.\n\nIn order to form patterns, carbide forming alloying elements like vanadium, tungsten or manganese are necessary in small amounts, with vanadium being the most common historical alloying element. These carbide formers cause the segregation of hard cementite carbides, which form the \"white streaks\" in crucible steel.\n\nThe segregation of CFEs into interdendritic reasons is due to the differences in solidification temperature between high CFE and low CFE steel, with low CFE steel solidifying at a higher temperature than high CFE steel. This causes the low CFE steel to solidify first when the ingot is slowly cooled, and it does so by branching out into dendrities of relatively pure iron, while the impurities such as phosphorus, CFEs and sulfur get pushed into the regions between these branches.\n\n[Dendritic structures visible on freshly made crucible ingot - image credit Peter Burt.](https://preview.redd.it/4plho3o14e591.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5862b44b804955becc1428e59c7f6ad289ddfc0d)\n\nDuring the forging of the crucible steel \"puck\", these carbide formers are pushed into parallel, layered sheets in the microstructure of the steel (Verhoeven et al, 1998).\n\n[Parallel cluster sheets.](https://i.redd.it/gi70lojz3e591.gif)\n\nBecause vanadium and other CFEs do not readily dissolve at forging temperatures and do not rapidly migrate at forging temperatures, these sheets of carbide formers form distinct bands in the steel. As the steel is thermally cycled, carbides aggregate onto the CFEs via ostwald ripening, and form spheroids of cementite. The interdendritic regions without CFEs form as pearlite, a soft two-phase mixture of carbides, or sorbite, and imperfect form of pearlite. This is diagnostic of historical crucible steel (Verhoeven et al 2018, Feuerbach 2002, Feuerbach 2006).\n\nIt is worth noting that vanadium is not the only effective carbide former found in historical crucible steel blades, and other carbide formers like manganese are seen in historical examples - or even chromium as seen in Chahak, Iran (Alipour et al 2021). Additionally, the other microalloying elements in the steel can effect the contrast and spacing of the pattern, with phosporus notably increasing the contrast of the pattern after etching (Khorasani and Hynninen, 2013)\n\n**Historical perspectives on Crucible Damascus Steel quality:**\n\nRegarding the historical reputation of historical crucible steel swords: they were always very expensive, very desirable, and very well thought of - HOWEVER - there are accounts from the 14th century of cold-short blades (high in phosphorus) which claims that crucible steel swords are prone to breakage in cold weather.\n\nThe exact quote is by Alī ibn ʻAbd al-Raḥmān Ibn Hudhayl, translated:\n\n>\"the Hindy sabre often breaks when the weather is cold and shows itself better when the weather is warm”\n\nDespite this, they were very valued. Mohammad ibn Abi al-Barakāt Jŏhari Nezāmi in 1196 CE states a good shamshir blade of crucible steel was valued at 100 golden Dinar (Khorasani et al, 2013).\n\nAl-Idrisi (Full name Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Idris al-Idrisi - circa 1100CE - 1166CE) claimed that \"*nothing could surpass*\" the edge of a crucible steel sword.\n\nBertrandon de la Brocquiere, a Frenchman, wrote about his travels to the Middle East in 1432CE–1433CE. He wrote:\n\n>\"Damascus blades are the handsomest and best of all Syria... I have nowhere seen swords cut so excellently. They are made at Damascus, and in the adjoining country.\"\n\nNote: This is potentially the source of the (incorrect but often repeated) claim that crucible steel swords were made in Damascus.\n\nIn the early 1600's, Polish king Zygmunt III Waza ordered a Armenian merchant (Sefer Muratowicz) to purchase a number of watered steel blades from Isfahan, Persia due to their value and reputation (Muratovich et al, 1777). On this same journey, the merchant purchased carpets embroidered with the royal coat of arms, which still survive today.\n\nRegardless of the reputation crucible steel enjoyed in its' day, the reality is that it was by nature very clean, with minimal slag - which made it less likely to break due to inclusions - and there is a lot of variation in the metallurgical composition of this steel. Some have higher carbon, or more phosphorus, and the quality varied. Heat treatment also widely varied.\n\nCompared to bloomery steel which was folded and consolidated, it's more uniform and much lower in slag - the term for non-metallic inclusions. The same is true of refined blast furnace steel, which also requires forge consolidation after finishing the finery process.\n\n[Microstructure of a Japanese Katana, 2% Nital etch. Note the presence slag inclusions (black) within the mostly martensitic steel.

It depends on the exact sword being analysed, as crucible steel was produced for around 2 millennia and in many places. For example, some accounts of crucible steel swords being able to be bent 90 degrees exist, however these can easily be countered with extant examples that take a set no matter the degree of bending.\n\n**Production methods:**\n\nHere are 4 different processes, which were recorded from at early as Al Kindi, to as late as 1841CE with Massalski - from the Deccani process used in Hyderabad, to the south Indian process, and the Isfahan process, and the Bukhara process.\n\nThere are more processes out there, I just haven't gotten around to writing them out.\n\n**Bukhara:**\n\n>3 parts clean iron, 1 part cast iron. Place in a crucible that is five times as tall as it the base is wide, with a mouth three times the size of the base. The weight of iron should be 2-2.5kg.  \n>  \n>Using a charcoal melting furnace with air venting holes, heat until melted (6 hours) or until a bubbling sound can be heard from the crucible. once bubbling stops, remove the lid of the crucible and add 0.013-0.017 grams of silver to the crucible and stir with a metal rod. reseal the crucible, seal all holes in the furnace, and allow to cool over 3 days.  \n>  \n>Remove the puck from the crucible, and polish one corner of it to check if the watered pattern is good. If the pattern is poor, reheat to a red heat and hold for seven minutes before allowing to cool in air.  \n>  \n>Forge into a bar using the top of the button to form the spine of the blade, and never heating above red.\n\n**South Indian:**\n\n>In a clay crucible of conical form (200mm height x 50mm diameter) add 250-500 grams of bloomery iron, as well as wood chips, rice husks, vines or leaves. Seal the crucible with a clay lid, leaving a vent hole. Allow to fully dry  \n>  \n>Using a bellow-fed charcoal forge, heat for 6 hours or until molten. allow the crucible to cool in the forge (some sources say to quench it in water).  \n>  \n>The button will have a striated appearance if everything was done correctly.\n\n**Deccani (Hyderabad) Process:**\n\n>Using a mixture of iron sand derived iron ore, and iron clay derived iron (mirtpalli and kondapur iron), place in a crucible with glass, sealed with clay with a vent hole. Place in a bellow powered charcoal furnace for 24 hours. The steel will melt within the first 3. After 24 hours, remove crucible and allow to cool in the air.  \n>  \n>Once cool, remove the buttons and cover each in clay, and anneal in a conventional forge for 12-16 hours. repeat this annealing process until the button is no longer brittle.\n\n**Isfahan Process:**\n\n>To a crucible, add 10% casi auriculata wood, and asclepias gigantean leaves with two parts pure iron, one part cast iron, and three parts silicate-rich iron ore up to a total weight of 200 grams.  \n>  \n>10-1200 of these small crucibles are heated at a time in a kiln operated with charcoal and bellows for 6 days, before the crucibles are broken open, and the buttons removed.  \n>  \n>The buttons are then transferred into a \"hot room\" to anneal and temper for 2 days so they do not shatter from cooling too quickly.\n\nAuthors note: I suspect that if this room is a furnace-heated compartment, and is hot enough, they also experience some level of rim decarburisation, as well as converting the microstructure of the puck to a more forgeable state compared to steel which has not been roasted.\n\n**\\*\\*References\\*\\***\n\nAlipour, R., Rehren, T., Martinón-Torres, M. \"Chromium crucible steel was first made in Persia\", Journal of Archaeological Science, Vol. 127, 2021,\n\nAl-Hassan, A.Y., 1978, Iron and Steel Technology in Medieval Arabic Sources, Journal for the History of Arabic Science 2: 1,31-43\n\nAnosov, P.P.

Sherby and Jeffrey Wadsworth, 1985, \"Damascus Steel\", Scientific American, 252(2) p. 112 -120\n\n**N.B:** A brief note on the claim **carbon nanotubes** exist in crucible steel:\n\nThe only articles that \"found\" carbon nanotubes was published as a brief communication to Nature, i.e not a full article. This was in 2006, and was only a few pages in length.\n\nIt later found its away into a conference paper by the same authors, still not a full length peer reviewed research article. This was 2 pages in length. These findings should be considered preliminary.\n\nThe method used (dissolving crucible steel in acid and seeing what remains) revealed stands of carbon, but carbon dissolves VERY readily into steel. Crucible steel is typified by cementite spheroids, which often stretch into rods during forging as they are deformed. If you dissolve cementite in acid, removing the iron component, you are left with carbon.\n\nThis does not mean there was an intact carbon nanotube in the core of the cementite rod - and even if it DID mean that, it would have negligible impact on performance because it is \\*encased\\* in cementite, which itself is in a soft matrix of pearlite or sorbite.\n\nBut don't take my word for it. Other academics, including those who have been instrumental in understanding crucible steel (namely John Verhoeven) doubt the findings.\n\n\" John Verhoeven, of Iowa State University in Ames, suggests Paufler is seeing something else. Cementite can itself exist as rods, he notes, so there might not be any carbon nanotubes in the rod-like structure.\"\n\n\"Another potential problem is that TEM equipment sometimes contains nanotubes, says physicist Alex Zettl of the University of California\"\n\n[https://www.nature.com/news/2006/061113/full/news061113-11.html](https://www.nature.com/news/2006/061113/full/news061113-11.html)",

Since acrylics dry so fast, they’re a perfect fit for my process. Rather than mixing wet paints directly on the panel, I use layers of broken color to create the effects I want. My go-to paints are Fluid Acrylics from Golden Paints.\n\n👉What pen do you use for sketching?\n\nI sketch with alcohol markers in various shades of Light Umber. These lines don’t wash away under paint layers but blend in nicely as I build up the painting. I love the brush tips—they let me make quick broad strokes or fine details with ease.\n\n👉 What’s that orange color you use at the beginning?\n\nI start by grounding my panel with a rough mix of Azo Gold Fluid Acrylic and Satin Glazing Liquid, both from Golden Paints.\n\n👉 Why cover the panel with orange just to paint over it?\n\nThe warm underpainting helps unify my colors and brings a vibrant energy to the final piece. Even though most of it gets covered, little flecks of orange and red peek through the layers, adding warmth and movement. I especially love how this complements my earth and sky palettes.\n\n👉 What surface do you paint on?\n\nI paint on Claybord panels from Ampersand Art. They’re archival, rigid hardboards coated with an ultra-smooth, slightly absorbent kaolin clay surface—perfect for my layered approach.\n\n\nWESTERN DOWNS, 16x16”, Acrylic 🎨",

    "body": "Common Questions About My Painting Process\n\n👉 What’s your palette?\n\nAzo Gold\nPyrole Red\nPyrole Orange\nRaw Sienna\nBurnt Sienna\nLight Umber\nCobalt Blue\nUltramarine Blue\nTeal\nCadmium Yellow\nNaples Yellow\nWhite Gesso\nCarbon Black\n\n👉 Why do you use acrylics instead of oils?\n\nI like to work quickly and build up many layers as I paint. Since acrylics dry so fast, they’re a perfect fit for my process. Rather than mixing wet paints directly on the panel, I use layers of broken color to create the effects I want. My go-to paints are Fluid Acrylics from Golden Paints.\n\n👉What pen do you use for sketching?\n\nI sketch with alcohol markers in various shades of Light Umber. These lines don’t wash away under paint layers but blend in nicely as I build up the painting. I love the brush tips—they let me make quick broad strokes or fine details with ease.\n\n👉 What’s that orange color you use at the beginning?\n\nI start by grounding my panel with a rough mix of Azo Gold Fluid Acrylic and Satin Glazing Liquid, both from Golden Paints.\n\n👉 Why cover the panel with orange just to paint over it?\n\nThe warm underpainting helps unify my colors and brings a vibrant energy to the final piece. Even though most of it gets covered, little flecks of orange and red peek through the layers, adding warmth and movement. I especially love how this complements my earth and sky palettes.\n\n👉 What surface do you paint on?\n\nI paint on Claybord panels from Ampersand Art. They’re archival, rigid hardboards coated with an ultra-smooth, slightly absorbent kaolin clay surface—perfect for my layered approach.\n\nPEAK DISTRICT, 16x16”, Acrylic 🎨",

This discovery helped lend credence to the name itself as the third Precursor known as the Atrekna had  consecutively replaced the Lanaktallan for the Precursor being fought.\"*\n\n\\- History of the Milky Way Galaxy on the Atrekna, published and verified by the Amalgamated Races Research and Development\n\nNakteti moved down the hallway, escorted by five of Lady Keena's children. Two on each side, one trailing slightly behind. In defiance of her expectations, her escorts weren't unarmed, but rather just waved through the checkpoint manned by white armored troops. She found the helmets they wore slightly imposing and reminiscent of Terran skulls, which she supposed was the exact reaction the designer had been trying to create.\n\nThe hallway was obviously built for Lanaktallans, she could tell by the width and the slow corners. The artwork on the walls was a mixture of Lanaktallan and Terran and something else. Lots of paintings of small spacecraft, space battles depicting large wedge shaped ships, and charging white armored troops.\n\nFinally she reached the door at the end and waited as bowing functionaries pulled it open.\n\nNakteti had to admit, she half expected to find Darth Harmonus sitting on a throne atop a stack of skulls with mostly-nude Terran females chained to the throne.\n\nInstead it was a comfortable meeting room with a large table that she could tell had a built in holotank hidden beneath the wooden veneer. There were multiple chairs at the sides, two drink dispensers, and a nutriforge.\n\nInside was two Lanaktallan, one in heavy manacles without chains and the other in a severe uniform. There were four Terrans, all of them in military uniforms, a chrome cyborg with a single red eye that moved back and forth across a horizontal black macroplas visor, a glimmering digital sentience made of red and silver...\n\nAnd of course, Darth Harmonus himself.\n\nNakteti had to admit, the sight of him took her breath away. He was taller than the other humans, dressed entirely in black combat armor, with a cape that hung down from his shoulders and was held fast by links of polished warsteel. His presence rolled out of the doors, enveloping her with an aura of danger, competence, and malevolence.\n\nIn other words, a typical Enraged Terran.\n\n\"Lady Nakteti,\" Darth Harmonus wheezed.\n\n\"Lord Harmonus,\" Nakteti said. Despite the fact she was a planetary owner and ruler she still bowed. She knew power and authority when she saw it and she was in his house.\n\n\"Come inside, if you would,\" Darth Harmonus wheezed, making a sweeping gesture.\n\nNakteti noted that several of the decorations on the wall trembled as he hand passed them by.\n\n\"Grand Most High in Chains Mo'otTwo'ot,\" Darth Harmonus said, waving at the one with the heavy manacles.\n\n\"Lady Nakteti,\" the Lanaktallan said. Nakteti noted that there was no servile sycophancy in the Lankatallan's gaze, just the steady appraisal of a powerful being.\n\n\"Director of Population Therapy and Recovery, Red Prince,\" Darth pointed out.\n\nThe Digital Sentience gave a nod. \"Lady Nakteti.\"\n\nThe other introductions went around. Meklords of Terra, the other Lanaktallan was an envoy from someone known as Mana'aktoo, who had defected from the Unified Council early in the war and was allies with the Harmonus Empire and a signatory of the Terran Confederacy of Aligned Systems.\n\nNakteti introduced her escorts, all children of Her Grace Khoonkeenadee, the Arch-Duchess of Relflagen, Lady of Magic and Beauty, the Arcane Will of King Nganto, She Who has Birthed a Hundred.\n\n\"How is your mother?\" Darth Harmonus asked. \"I assume she is well and hewing her way through an enemy army as we speak?\"\n\n\"As we last heard, she is well,\" Lady Surscee said. \"She has been ordered to establish a new fortress and conquer new lands for King Nganto.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear such,\" Darth Harmonus wheezed.\n\n\"You know her?\" Nakteti asked.\n\nOne of the Meklords chuckled. When Nakteti looked at him he smiled.\n\n\"My Lady, anyone who spends more than a few decades in the LARP community knows of Lady Kay. She's *the* top of the ladders,\" He chuckled.\n\n\"Just be glad she was never interested in our LARPs and preferred anarcho-primitivism,\" another Meklord said.\n\n\"She'd own most of the systems,\" the heavily synthesized voice of the cyborg added.\n\nFrom there the conversation went of recent news. The Great Die Off, the surrender of the Unified Council, and the Atrekna Counter-Assault. Once that was over, Nakteti asked questions about the founding of the Empire.\n\nDarth Harmonus referred most of the questions to Red Prince, who Nakteti learned was a licensed psychotherapist.\n\nAs the day moved on and she snacked, listening to the wisdom and experience of the other system leaders in the room, Nakteti was glad she had come. There were plenty of differing viewpoints on how to handle insurgencies, how to treat victims of millions of years of oppression, how to handle the emotional explosion by people who had spent their entire lives on drugs and suddenly found themselves free inside their own mind for the first time.\n\nAs the discussion went on, she realized that her task wasn't one of months or a few years, but decades.\n\nAfter a luxurious dinner, hosted by Mo'otTwo'ot, there was even more discussion. However, it turned to imports and exports. Darth Harmonus and the Meklords believed that having industry and agriculture, despite the fact it was actually superfluous thanks to nutri-forges, helped the population both in the creation of it and the availability of 'naturally grown' food products.\n\nPart of Nakteti wanted to disagree with how Red Prince stated that some people, even Terrans born into post-scarcity, enjoyed laboring in the fields and in factories, that it gave them a sense of accomplishment.\n\nBut she had seen her own people crave the iron hand of dictatorship.\n\nAfter the meeting she found herself standing outside, in a garden, beside a fountain, when she could feel the rolling waves of pressure coming from behind her, growing stronger with each moment. Magnus shifted slightly, like he was concerned, but Nakteti just kept staring at the water of the fountain where glowing fish chased phosphorescent algae.\n\n\"You are discontent with the duties of rulership thrust upon you,\" Darth Harmonus wheezed.\n\n\"I am,\" Nakteti said.\n\n\"I too once was,\" the Terran said, his voice heavily synthesized.\n\nNakteti wondered how bad his lung damage was and what reasons there was he didn't get it repaired.\n\n\"However, standing next to my loyal troops in conquering the first world, I saw the misery and hopelessness of the common people. Of Lanaktallan barely able to feed their families, of children taken from parents to be raised in creches, of a despotic system with no other purpose but sustain itself unto infinity,\" the big black cyborg said. \"I thought, for a few moments, of just cracking the planets and moving on. Of releasing them from their torment with death. Of getting revenge for my sister and my nieces and nephews by committing the same slaughter I had come to avenge.\"\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\n\"Why didn't you?\" Nakteti asked finally. \"Was it that you did not want to be like the Unified Council?\"\n\n\"Because it would have disappointed my sister,\" Darth Harmonus said. \"Disappointed the woman who took me in after the deaths of our parents. She would have rather died a thousand times then be the incentive for me to slaughter billions.\"\n\n\"Do you think she would have approved of what you have done?\" Nakteti asked.\n\nThere was silence again, broken only by the rhythmic wheezing of the Terran cyborg.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nMore silence.\n\n\"She would not have approved of using martial force to take these systems. She would not have approved my fall to the Dark Side. She would have *understood*, but not approved,\" Darth Harmonus said. \"She would have mourned every death as if she knew each individual. She would have beseeched me to stop my invasion, stop my armies.\"\n\nHe was silent again.\n\n\"But she would, I like to think, approve of what I do now,\" he said. Another moment of silence. \"She told me once, when I was a little boy and had dropped a china teapot, that it was easier to discard broken shards of pottery than it was to rebuild what had been broken.\"\n\nHe held out his hand and a small teapot appeared. It was laced with glimmering gold in a pattern that Nakteti found beautiful.\n\n\"A simple teapot of clay, kaolin, feldspar, and quartz, made all the more beautiful and unique by repairing it with gold laced warsteel. The pieces could have been discarded, but then the broken vessel would have never been anything more than shards, never again to be a thing of beauty,\" Darth Harmonus wheezed softly. \"She taught an angry child, raging at a malevolent universe that had taken almost everything from him, to take something broken in rage and transform it into a thing of beauty through passion and dedication.\"\n\nThe hologram vanished.\n\n\"The Unified Council broke these people. Destroyed their culture. Made them into nothing more than drones to feed the appetite of generations far in the future,\" he said. \"By destroying, by shattering, the 'protections' that guarded these broken people, it is up to us, our duty and our privilege, to put them back together.\"\n\nHe was silent another moment.\n\n\"It is up to us, Lady Nakteti of the Tnvaru Clans, to decide if we shall use warsteel and gold, passion and dedication, to repair these broken vessels,\" he spun in place, his cloak swirling out.\n\nHis voice floated back to Nakteti as he walked away.\n\n\"Or if we will use blood and fire.\"\n\n\\-------------\n\nVuxten dropped down on one knee, panting, grounding the tip of the chainsword into the dirt. His uniform was drenched by the rain falling around him, his muscles shivered in exhaustion, and his mouth was dry despite the wet air.\n\n\"Better,\" Lady Keena said from where she was sitting in the doorway of a circular dwelling with a low cone roof made out of animal skins. She had an infant attached to one breast which was trying to look at Vuxten and hold onto the nipple at the same time.\n\nThe other infant was being held by Peel, who had the baby on her back on Peel's lap. Peel was holding the baby's ankles and pushing the fussing infants knees up toward her chin with slow, gently, but firm motions.\n\nThe baby of Peel's lap broke wind loudly and stopped fussing.\n\n\"There you are, sweet pea,\" Peel smiled.\n\nVuxten had learned that infant humans sometimes had trouble with intestinal gas and could be quite loud in vocalizing their distress.\n\n\"Again,\" Lady Keena said.\n\nVuxten struggled to his feet. He lifted the chainsword over his head with one hand, the other hand held straight out to the side at full extension while he stared in front of him.\n\n\"Small circles,\" Lady Keena ordered.\n\nVuxten began moving his hand in small circles.\n\n\"Now hop up and down on one foot,\" Lady Keena ordered.\n\nVuxten followed instructions. When he had first tried it, he'd either mess up the hopping or stop circling his hand. Now he was able to do it, but with difficulty.\n\n\"Recite the Corps Motto,\" Lady Keena snapped.\n\nVuxten tried to shout it out but lost his balance, stumbling, falling down on one knee again, using the tip of his chainsword being thrust into the dirt to stop himself from faceplanting.\n\n\"Better,\" Lady Keena said. She waited a moment. \"On your feet.\"\n\nVuxten struggled up.\n\n\"Again.\"\n\nFinally, at almost dusk, he was able to recite the entire Telkan Marine Corps motto while hopping on one foot, holding his chainsword over his head, and making small circles with one hand. All without falling over, misspeaking, or stopping the circles.\n\n\"Sit, Vuxten, sit,\" Lady Keena said. When Vuxten sat down next to her Casey handed him a narcobrew. She looked him up and down. \"I think we've gone as far as we can for right now. We've got the reflex nerves open, we need to lay in your reflexes now. Reflexes that can save your life.\"\n\nVuxten just nodded, taking a long drink off of the cold bottle.\n\nCasey looked up at the rain, closing his one eye and letting it wash over his face. Lady Keena had been forcing him to do what was called 'grass drills', something that Vuxten had become *very* familiar with during Basic Training when he'd first joined the Telkan Marine Corps.\n\n\"You're doing better holding your rage instead of letting it overpower you, both of you,\" Lady Keena said. She took a drink off of a mug of steaming spiced ale. \"There's a few more things...\"\n\nThe ground suddenly heaved and cracked, the sound of screaming and wailing could be heard as a bright red light speared out of the crack in the ground.\n\nEveryone present came to their feet, Lady Keena reaching out and snatching up her sword, lightning arcing up and down the blade as the quartet spread out, facing the crack in the ground.\n\nMassive taloned fingers burst from the ground, first on one side the crack, then the other. The fingers curled as whatever was inside the crack grabbed the sides and began pulling the crack open.\n\n\"Holo?\" Casey asked, holding his magac pistol in one hand and chainsword in the other.\n\nPeel shook her head. \"No. I can feel the tremors in the ground.\"\n\nA massive head rose up out of the crack. Black horns, curved, rose up first, then a brown plated head with another set of horns off the side. Amber glowing eyes over a wide nose with a broad mouth full of multiple rows of fangs made up the face. Bat wings extended from the back as the huge figure pulled itself free, standing over seven meters tall when it stood up fully, the winds flapping twice before folding up behind the figure.\n\nThe crack in the ground sealed with a rumble and Vuxten noticed that the grass was scorched, yellowed, and dessicated.\n\n\"Isn't this sweet,\" the massive figure growled out as it shook out a chain of black iron threaded through with strands of barbed wire.\n\n\"What is thy purpose, beast?\" Lady Keena asked stepping forward.\n\n\"Quietly. We don't want to wake the babies,\" the massive demon rumbled. \"Babies crying hurts my ears,\" it said, flapping its large ears twice.\n\nAs Vuxten watched the demon suddenly shrunk down, turning into a short matronly looking Terran female dressed in an official looking skirt and blouse, her black hair held in a pair of braids.\n\nVuxten recognized her from Trucker's court martial.\n\n\"The Detainee, Lady of Hell,\" Casey said, lowering his pistol and chainsword.\n\nVuxten followed suit as he watched the woman light a cigarette and tuck away the pack and lighter.\n\n\"Call me...

It was very succinct and yet, developed quite a bit of backstory in just a few sentences. And for something this hogging long  that is really really impressive.( Well for anyone but you Mr. Ralts )\n\nNot that You aren’t totally impressive because you ARE…😎😂😉\nIt’s just that this sort of excellence in character development that takes very little wordage is even more impressive considering the millions of words that you have written.\n\nI am losing my voice and since I am speaking this into my phone I’m gonna have to cut this a little short, but as to the rest of the contents of this chapter it was very naughty of you to tease with this intro and then stop it there.\n\nNot that I’m not grateful for an update, and not that I’m complaining. \n\nit’s just it now I have to wonder what happens next and I have to go to sleep so I can do errands tomorrow!\n( that’s why it’s naughty, you’re making it hard to sleep lol )\nThanks again Mr. Ralts for sharing this.\n\nI won’t bring this up again unless you do because I do not wish to bring up anything painful for you but I’m still thinking of you and your family and I hope your loss eases eventually.\nGod bless and Jesus save you sir.\nThanks again",

Terrans are the anvil, that upon which things are beaten.  Terrans are the work-piece, shaped and forged.  Terrans are the fire, used to forge others, the water used to make them hard, and the gentle warmth of tempering to make them strain.  And finally, the stones to make them sharp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurther edit:  Wait...  Did Dee just wiggle her ears at Dee's babies?\n\nI feel like as she goes on, for all her bitching and complaining and various \"all-about-me\" reasons, she's actually doing things now because it benefits others. Dee's babies, for example.  \"The crying hurts my ears\" bullshit, you just didn't want to disturb the important sleep they're doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWeirdly, I suspect she's good with kids",

I also think those women who look like emotionless girls were genetically tailored with Dees DNA, they were told not to make emotional connections because it would make them weak.

My boyfriend even made me a birthday cake....\n\nWhen I saw him come up to me and gave me a hug and said happy birthday, I couldn't hold back my emotions and started bawling my eyes out in front of his parents who are looking at me like IS HE OK???? \n\nMy heart felt like it was gonna stop, I was so fking happy. I never thought that me 5'11 180 pound femboy being so happy, especially since its been hell in my life for the past 4 years.\n\nI introduced myself formally and I got to spend the rest of the day with him and his family laughing, talking and joking. His parents were SO SWEET and accepting of me. \n\nMy 18th birthday, by far my greatest day of my life.\n\nEdit: This post got SO much love. I ended up showing my boyfriend this post I made, and just like AHHHHH my heart, I love him to bits and pieces. You guys all deserve the best of happiness in your life, and I'm sure you will all one day find a special person who you can call your lover or partner. LOVE YOU LOTS KAOLIN <3",

    "body": "So as TI7 fast approaches I thought I'd drop in my own theory about the next hero.\n\nSo as we know, the hero teased [**HERE**](http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/comics/comic_monkeyking_arcana/en/033.png?v=undefined) in the Monkey King Arcana comic, is the most likely for the release. This would make the next hero the 4th Elemental Spirit. This theory is also reinforced by the voice line [\"I've seen Xin and Kaolin. Where's your other brother?\"](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/0/04/Monkey_ally_169.mp3).\n\nBut who are the spirits? Well, as seen in the Lore of both [Ember Spirit](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Ember_Spirit/Lore) and [Storm Spirit](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Storm_Spirit/Lore), they were ordinary people who gained the power of a [Celestial](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Celestials), a being attuned with a specific element, through some means. This can also been seen in [Brewmaster](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Brewmaster/Lore), as his [Father](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Brewmaster%27s_Father) was a Celestial, and he has the power to split into 3 elements.\n\nSo lets run with this notion that the next hero is in fact the 4th Spirit, what element would he be? The most logical answer to this is Water/Sea/Ocean, and this for 2 reason. Reason 1: We currently have 3 elements of what would be considered the base 4. Ember=Fire, Storm=Wind, Earth=Earth, ?=Water. Reason 2: TI7's theme is Aquatic this can be seen in [**THIS**](http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/blogfiles/blog_tcktslsimg2017.jpg) image for the TI7 ticket sales, [**THIS**](https://steamcommunity.com/games/dota2/announcements/detail/501428497042074435) blog post, and [**THIS**](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C-uW2byXoAAtpin.jpg:large) picture.\n\nBut hand on a second, aren't each of the spirits assigned to a particular Attribute in Dota? What would the 4th Spirit be? This is when things get a little crazy! \n\nAs we were fast approaching the reveal of patch 7.00 and Monkey King, 4chan had posted 'leaks' about the 7.00 update (unfortunately I can not find any images of said leaks so your just going to have to trust me on this). Contained within said leaks were Monkey King, the addition of talents and the most far fetched of all; a 4th Attribute. Now for the sake of keeping things simple lets call this possible new attribute 'Mystic' and assign it the colour purple (I get to why soon).\n\nSo Mystic. What does it do? Why choose purple? Who is a Mystic hero? What effects does this have on Dota?\n\nLet's first start with the colour. As explained in /u/SirActionSlacks- 's video [LoreGasm 1: A Collection of Colors-The Theory of the Third Ancient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da_KSTeBBGk), colour has a significant role in the Dotaverse with the 5 key colours being Blue=Radiant, Red=Dire, Green=Nether, Yellow=World, and Purple=Mystery. Also, the 4th Spirit is shown to be purple in the Monkey King Arcana comic.\n\nSo what would Mystic do? Well currently in Dota, each Attribute has properties associated with it. These being, Strength= HP and HP Regen, Agility= Attack Speed and Armor, and Intelligence= Mana, Mana Regen and Spell Amp; with Magic Resistance and Movement Speed not being tied to anything. As you can see from this STR and AGI are both linked to 2 properties with INT being liked to 3. My theory of what Mystic could be, is Spell Amp and Magic Resistance (or a new term Cloak, if changed from a % value to a numerical one to mirror armor). This would give 2 properties associated with each Attribute and leave only Movement Speed as the independent property.\n\nNow for the effect this would have on Dota. This would be the single biggest fundamental change in Dota history. Far outreaching the effects of 7.00 and the talent systems. Briefly touching on some of these;  \n**1st (Heroes):** Currently all Heroes are sorted into the category of the 3 Attributes, meaning some Heroes would be moved from their current Attribute into a the new Mystic category.  \n\n**2nd (Items):** New items would have to be added to have the Mystic Attribute and some existing items would possibly switch to Mystic. E.g. of current items being affected would be be Power Treads with Tread Switching (have to cycle 4 instead of 3), Agh's (is currently made of the 3 Attributes, would have to change to 4) etc.  \n\n**3rd (Skills):** There are a few skills in Dota that interact with others that would be affected. E.g. Essence Shift steals 1 from each attribute and gives Slark 3 AGI (this would change to 4 AGI using the current model), Primal Split currently splits Brewmaster into 3 elements, the current 3 spirits (would possibly have to become 4).  \n\n**4th (Balance):** Adding Mystic would add huge amount of room for balance. As I said earlier, if it controls Spell Amp and Magic Resistance/Cloak then it would be another method of balancing Heroes and items. E.g. Terrorblade could start with 12 Armor have great AGI gain but on start with 0 Cloak and have poor Mystic. It could also allow Heroes that are reliant on Spells to have an easier way to beef them up(this is assuming that the %Spell Amp/Mystic is better than the current with INT).\n\nAnyway, that's my theory on on the next Hero and a possibility of the 4th Attribute. \n\nThanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed.\n\n**TL;DR The 4th Hero revealed at TI7 will be the purple Water/Sea/Ocean Spirit. There is a possibility that he is assigned to a new Attribute, Mytsic, which is Purple and controls Spell Amp and reworked Magic Resistance called Cloak.**\n\nORRRRRRRRRRRRRRR I'm totally wrong and the next hero is [Ilexa](http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/comics/comic_monkeyking/en/047.png?v=undefined).",

Honestly I don't think he's gonna be the Water Spirit. \n\nTake the classical elements into consideration. Earth, fire, air, and water, it seems straight forward what it should be, but that neglects the fifth element, which isn't love, but rather aether.\n\nThis fifth element appears in a lot of cultures, and generally has to do with everything that isn't physical, specifically space or the mystical. Purple seems more aligned to space (see: Enigma) than water as well. In addition, the flavor for Aether Lens mentions the final breath of a mage.\n\nIf you really wanted to get down into the theory crafting, Aether Lens might be Aghanim's dying gift to his young son, Rubick. Rubick having a cache of gems is brought up in one of Meepo's responses, and Aether Lens certainly looks like a gem.\n\nIf we continue along that line, with dying humans assuming Celestial qualities, the 4th Spirit might actually be the reincarnation of Aghanim.",

TA is completely unrelated to Juggernaut in the lore with no accounts of them having ever met, yet Monkey King suddenly had a line that implies the two know eachother and that something happened? \n\nYeah, probably not a love affair, I'm thinking Juggernaut's arcana is going to have something to do with The Hidden Ones. Makes sense, considering that, in a sense, he does hide his face behind a mask. Another thing to consider is that we have no idea when (or even if) the fourth spirit brother is coming. Seems kinda dumb to win a contest during TI6 and then have the arcana not be released for a long ass time while they work on a new hero. Who knows, maybe the fourth spirit is at a decent stage of development, but given the scale of the last update, I doubt they've started working on it other than getting a concept out (like \"this is what we want to do next, lets put a teaser on the comic while we're at it\").",

    "body": "Hey everyone, my name is Rima and I'm a medic and TCCC instructor here in Ukraine. \n\nRecently I received a couple of packets of hemostatic gauze in generic black packaging. I was immediately suspicious when the package said \"Kaolin Hemostatic Gauze\" but had zero manufacturer or origin markings. All real hemostatic gauze like Celox, QuikClot, and Sam Chitosan have manufacturer markings. IMAGINE being a medic, thinking you have hemostatic gauze and it turns out to be regular and you find out the hard way at the worst possible time; when your casualty is actively bleeding. The minimum time to hold pressure for hemostatic gauze is 3 minutes and regular gauze is 7 minutes. If the medic holds pressure for 3 minutes thinking they have hemostatic gauze and they take pressure off and the casualty is still actively bleeding because the hemostatic gauze was fake. The more the casualty bleeds, the bigger problems the medic will have, worse patient outcomes, etc. \n\nI am writing those for those who may not know the difference and need to or are trying to stretch their dollars by buying knockoffs, soldiers and donors alike. \n\nReal hemostatic gauze is treated with the hemostatic chemical agent that stops bleeding 5 times faster than regular gauze, it will react to liquid. In the video above,  I tested an expireed QuickClot Combat Gauze against the generic one I was given with water mixed with food coloring. The solution when I packed the wound with QuickClot turned from red to milky pink as the hemostatic agent reacted to it because the gauze actually had the hemostatic chemical. The fake gauze when I tested it had zero reaction. The problem is they look the same, but they definitely don't work the same\n\n\nI have the same issue with Chinese made tourniquets. Just because it looks the same does NOT mean that it functions the same. Chinese tourniquets break all the time. My students have destroyed DOZENS in training. Buy the CAT7. We CANNOT, I repeat, CANNOT cut corners on costs and try to save a buck. The whole \"yeah but I can get more bang for my buck with the cheap version!\" doesn't work here. This will cost lives and already has. Quality over quantity always. I would rather have one $45/$50 USD celox than two of these fake hemostatic gauzes. I want what will stop bleeding FAST. Same with CAT7. one CAT vs 3 Chinese tourniquets that will fail? CAT wins every time because it is reliable.\n\n\nPLEASE DO NOT BUY KNOCK OFFS. Someone paid TWENTY dollars for regular gauze disguised  as hemostatic gauze which you can buy for a few bucks. \n\nApproved hemostatic gauzes:\n\nQuikClot Combat Gauze\n\nCelox Hemostatic Gauze\n\nSAM Chitosan Hemostatic Gauze\n\nFor soldiers who need quality IFAKs/tourniquets/hemostatic gauze, there are many good NGOs that will provide them to you at no cost.\n\nFor more information, pictures and details, the link to my blog is here: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rimaziuraitis/real-vs-generic-why-cutting-corners-costs-lives",

Anyways, those loose granules would get blown around in helicopters, or didn't work if gravity wasn't assisting. Next gen put the granules in a packet, but couldn't be packed fast/deep enough, so they started treating gauze. Battlefield medicine being what it is, gauze would get accidentally left in, so they have the X-ray detectable blue thread woven in.\n\nSince the GWoT, battlefield trauma care has become a refined art. Yes, the good stuff is \"expensive,\" because that's what it costs to work in the first place. When your friend is bleeding out, you are not going to be gentle with materials, and your fingers turn into flippers. That stuff is getting gross-motored, and it has to work.

    "body": "So sometimes I have people telling me how indie eyeshadows are hard to work with and have a lot of fall out. Sometimes, the issue is the eyeshadow formulation. There are brands that sell repackaged eyeshadows or simply mix a few colours together and sell them without any bases to help adhesion. Without the base to add adhesion to your eyeshadows, you need to work extra hard to make the colours stay on your lids since they'll be more likely to fly away or slip completely off.\n\nSome people think the 2nd option doesn't count as repackaging, but for me, well..why should I pay someone to mix a few colours together when I can buy the colours for wayyy cheaper from TKB and mix them myself?\n\nTKB's micas and pigments go for **$1.50 for 6g**. \n\nIt's way cheaper than your average **$4-6 for 1.5-2g** of indie eyeshadows. \n\nThe mark up you're paying should be for the time they took to find the perfect formula to make the eyeshadows look great without the help of many other products. If you're ok with paying a mark up for prettier packaging, that's fine, but I'm not.\n\nSo here's a guide to deciphering your eyeshadow ingredients:\n\n**Colour** \n\n*If your eyeshadow only contains these ingredients and nothing outside this category, it's most likely repackaged*\n\n* Iron oxide \n* Mica \n* Tin Oxide\n* Titanium Dioxide (whitens, can be used for adhesion too)\n* Zinc Oxide (make it more opaque, can be used for adhesion too)\n* Carmine (red, non-vegan)\n* Ferric Ferocyanide (blue, not lip-safe in the US)\n* Ultramarines (blue, not lip-safe in the US)\n* Chromium Oxide (green, not lip-safe in the US)\n* Manganese Violet \n* Copper Powder \n* Bronze Powder \n* Boron Nitride \n* Boron Glow \n* Bismuth Oxychloride (makes things shiny, adds slip too)\n\n**Glitter**\n\n*Ingredients that make up glitter...if your eyeshadow only contains glitter and colour, that's iffy too*\n\n* Polyethylene Terephthalate\n* Aluminum\n* Polyurethane 33\n* Calcium Aluminium Borosilicate\n\n\n**Personal nopes** \n\n*If any eyeshadow contains these ingredients, I personally consider it not worth buying*\n\n* Cornstarch (it can rot)\n* Talc (just a filler to make the eyeshadows cheaper, reduces pigmentation)\n\n_______________________\n\nIf your eyeshadow only contains the ingredients listed above, it doesn't contain any bases and highly likely repackaged (or made crappier if fillers are added).\n\n______________\n\n**Some Ingredients Your Eyeshadows SHOULD Contain**\n\n*These are just a couple of common ingredients, it does not cover every ingredient possibly used for binders.*\n\n**Ingredients for Adhesion**\n\n*Makes your eyeshadows stick to your skin instead of flying all over the place*\n\n* Carnauba Wax\n* Magnesium Stearate\n* Magnesium Myristate\n\n\n**Ingredients for Glide**\n\n*Makes it glide on smoothly on your skin...helps reduce the drag from ingredients that add adhesion*\n\n* Silica\n* Silk powder (not vegan)\n* Micronaspheres\n\n**Others**\n\n*Other ingredients that may be included*\n\n* Calcium Carbonate (absorbs oil)\n* Kaolin Clay (absorbs oil, also a filler..not my favourite since too much can make the colour clay-like. Some brands use kaolin clay instead of talc as a filler. Kaolin clay is not good enough on its own as a base, so if the eyeshadow only contains kaolin clay, colour & glitter, I don't buy it.)\n* Allantoin (humectant and supposedly good for your skin)\n\n____________________\n\n\nThis is taken straight from my blog post, and screenshots of examples of potential repackaging & legit ingredients can be found [here](http://workingwithmonolids.blogspot.ca/2014/11/legit-or-repackaged-guide-to-finding.html).\n\nEDIT: There is some confusion since a brand I've listed claims that they clearly mark repackaged colours. However, the eyeshadows with sketchy ingredients that I've screenshotted and linked to on my blog are all colours that the brand *claims are not repackaged.* ",

They give other indies a bad rep.\n\nSo, I'm totally not being defensive here or anything but- my eyeshadows have talc in them. :) but it's for a good reason! Talc is a good filler if you want to decrease pigmentation on purpose. If I didn't put pretty much a translucent filler in there it would insanely hard to get the colorants to move around. Well, there's a couple of other things in there that help with that too. Haha.\n\nSometimes it's better to have diluted colors. Higher pigmentation doesn't always mean a better product.\n\nI really love this post because it will probably encourage people to do a little bit more research. But this is still an amazing amount of information so that they know what to look out for. Thank you for posting it!",

    "body": "Hey, Reddit.\nIt's been less than 24 hours since new patch has been released and I already found an easter egg and major chain of links of what the next hero can be.\nIf you open the \"Legend of the Monkey King\" comic book (located in /700/monkeyking) to the part where MK gets on trial of \"Spirit Brothers\", you may see familiar three spirits (Raijin, Kaolin and Xin) and one extra Spirit Brother that we don't know.  Link to that page> http://imgur.com/a/8prSA\nThe 4th Brother has the same head shape and eyes as Ember Spirit and Earth Spirit have, meaning that it can't be Brewmaster or any existing hero from Dota 2. Also, 4th Brother possess a dark blue, almost indigo colour (Very similar to what Enigma has) and his leg area on the second picture of comic page seems to be the most calm and cloak-like. All in all, this 4th Brother can be Suijin - the God of Water in Japanese mythology. And here's why he can be the next hero:\n- If you look on the Arcana of Monkey King, you may find that he basically has been interacting with 4 Elements during his story in a comic book: The first form \"Timeless Tale\" states that MK was born from a rock (Earth Spirit). Then he finds his iconic weapon inside the seas (Water Spirit). Then he fights Razor inside the Narrow Maze and it seems a bit farfetched but Razor is made of Electricity (Storm Spirit). Finally, MK burns inside the furnace of Ember Spirit. \nSo his second Arcana form of \"Rumble in the Deep\" possess exact the same colour effect of dark blue and indigo as 4th Brother has.\nKnowing of how much Valve love to leave us some clues on the next hero in pictures (like Skywrath Mage silhouette on Bristleback patch release) or cosmetics, I think this can be pretty good guess.\nSorry for my Ancient Celtic, not my first language",

Bottom, Iranian Shamshir, Crucible steel.](https://preview.redd.it/oj7m6y0k3e591.jpg?width=6733&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be106e56821267c4dfb0c9c1707143f878f62c87)\n\n**\"Damascus steel\" usually refers to two main types of steel**:\n\nThe most common you'll see made today is \"**pattern-welded steel**\", where alternating layers of nickel rich and nickel deplete steel are stacked, forge welded, and **folded** or manipulated to create a pattern. The blade is then polished and etched to reveal the layers. While modern pattern welded blades typically use nickel containing steels to maximise contrast, historically this was not the case.\n\nThis method of construction using stacked, folded or otherwise forge welded, dissimilar* steels is how the majority of sword steels were made, worldwide, until advances in technology allowed for the use of more homogenous steel products. Pattern welding, and variants such as multibar patterns and laminated blades, were used widely and includes swords like spatha, “viking” swords, katana and more. It is worth noting that even \"monosteel\" swords which were made without the use of dissimilar steel, but still made from bloomery or refined blast furnace steel, were also subject to similar stacking, folding and forge welding techniques.\n\n*Bloom is here considered to contain multiple dissimilar steels due to the heterogeneous nature of bloom. \n\nIn the present day, this is the type you will see chef’s knives, swords, and even pocket knives being made of, and it can range from being rather cheap to incredibly expensive depending on the materials and workmanship.\n\n[Pattern welded Pala blade in \\\\\"Turkish Ribbon Twist\\\\\" style.](https://preview.redd.it/ijgu7seo3e591.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=630b2d095047fcd34d73f1e37c87db156a4f195a)\n\nThe other type of \"Damascus Steel\" is a form of hypereutectoid, pattern forming **crucible steel.**\n\nAnd that is what I will be discussing today.\n\nIt is a hypereutectoid steel, which means that it has over 0.8% carbon by definition. It is formed by liquifying steel in a crucible, and is **NOT** **produced by folding** or layering steel. The typical composition is around 1% to 2% carbon, which by modern standards makes this an “ultra-high carbon steel”, often abbreviated as UHCS.\n\nIt is formed by melting steel with specific impurities in a crucible (historically, made of high kaolin content clay, rice husks as chaff, quartz sands, and other additives), and the process of turning this crucible “charge” into steel is quite complicated, with the potential for failure to produce an attractive pattern being high if any part of the process is not conducted correctly.\n\nIn summary, the crucible charge is brought up to melting temperature, and held at this temperature for a while, allowing the constituent alloying elements present in the steel to spread and bubbles to boil out. It is then slowly cooled, before the ingot is removed, roasted to decarburise the rim, drawn out into a bar, manipulated to produce a surface pattern with ball peens, wedges and grinding, and finally forged it into a blade, and thermally cycled.\n\nAs stated, this steel is typically the range of carbon content is between 1 and 2% in historical examples, and thus melts in a temperature range between 1200 and 1400c (for more information, see “iron carbon phase diagrams”). It must also have sufficient levels of carbide formers (vanadium, molybdenum, manganese etc) in order to form patterns (Verhoeven et al, 1998,. Verhoeven et al 2018).\n\nThe pattern in crucible steel are formed by \"rafts\" of steel rich in carbide formers, where ultra-hard cementite spheroids form over subsequent forging cycles, which etch bright, and areas devoid of carbide forming elements (CFEs), which remain as pearlite, a soft mix of carbides which etches dark. The shape and size of the rafts is determined by the length of dendrites that form during the slow cooling of the ingot, as dendritic regions of the steel are carbide former depleted, and interdendritic regions are carbide former rich (Verhoeven et al, 2018).\n\n[Crucible steel shamshir blade, kara Khorasan pulad](https://preview.redd.it/rbchxn5t3e591.png?width=8091&format=png&auto=webp&s=6081374d34827d01a9493c3673aeddc09372cbb0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany people conflate pattern-welded steel with crucible steel, and call both “Damascus”. Whilst this is accepted in colloquial language, it is important to distinguish between the two – particularly when it comes to identifying antiques, or documenting them.\n\n\"Damascus\" can therefore be used to refer to either pattern welded, or crucible steels, as both are pattern-forming steels, but it is best to specify which sort of \"Damascus\" is being discussed. The term has been used historically to describe both pattern-welded steel and crucible steel. Many swords and gun barrels made in germany were marked \"damastahl\" in the 18th and 19th century, and they were pattern welded, so there is historical precedent for such a naming convention, but the two techniques (and end products) are very different.\n\n**To be ABSOLUTELY CLEAR: \"True\" damascus steel is herein used as a term to refer to historical, patterned crucible steel. I am using this term entirely because it is understandable. The correct naming and etymology is discussed later. Both pattern welded and crucible steel blades can be called \"damascus\", and were historically, but the \"lost\" form is the crucible steel form.**\n\n**The Myth: \"Damascus Steel is a Lost Art\":**\n\nThe is quite a long history of crucible “Damascus” steel, in the form of primary sources in which the process was written down - as early as 350BCE - 420BCE Zosimus, an early alchemist in Alexandria, wrote the following:\n\n>\"The tempering of Indian Iron: Take 4 pounds of soft iron, and the skins of myrobalans, called elileg, 15 parts; belileg, 4 parts; and two parts of glassmakers magnesia. Then place it into a crucible and make it level. .... Put on the charcoal and blow the fire until the iron becomes molten and the ingredients become united with it. ... Such is the premier and royal operation, which is practiced today and by means of which they make marvelous swords. It was discovered by the Indians and exploited by the Persians\".\n\nThis is by no means the only method to make crucible steel - some was co-fusion, using both cast iron and bloom, while some was indeed made with bloomery and carbon bearing material (often plants).\n\nIncidentally, the oldest known crucible steel sword is from the 6th to 3rd century BCE and was found interred in a megalithic site in Thelunganur, Tamil Nadu, India (Ramesh et al, 2019) and daggers from \\~500BCE have been found with the associated production site in Kodumanal, Tamil Nadu (Sasisekaran & Rao, 1999. Sasisekaran, 2002). This is consistent with the Zosimus account describing the technique as discovered by India.\n\n[Thelunganur sword, Ramesh et al 2019](https://preview.redd.it/cfthvr2f4e591.jpg?width=2128&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8141215372f59d840de48a1f9237b31689535a4)\n\nThe Islamic writers al-Kindi (full name Abu Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi - circa 800CE - 873CE) and al-Beruni (full name Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni - circa 973CE - 1048CE) both wrote detailed procedures for the production of crucible steel, too.\n\n⁠This is how Biruni described it in the manuscript Al-Jamâhir Marefat al-Jawâher. (From Khorasani et al, 2013):\n\n>“He says that they \\[ironwokers\\] include five ratl رطل of \\[horse\\] shoes, the nails of which are made of narmâhan نرمآهن\\] in the crucible\\]. Then they add ten derham درهم of each \\[of the ingredients\\] rusaxtaj روسختج\\] antimony\\], marqiša-ye talâ’i طلائى مرقيشا\\] golden marcasite\\] and meqnesiyâ مغنسيا\\] meqnisiyâ مغنيسيا ;manganese dioxide MnO2\\] to the crucible, close the crucible with clay, and put it in the furnace. Then they fill the furnace with charcoal and blow air with Rumi (Roman Byzantine/Anatolian) bellows that are pumped by two men until the iron melts. Then they add a combination of halile هليله) myrobalan), pust-e anâr انار پوست) pomegranate peel), melh al-ajeyn ملحالعجين) the salt used for dough), and sadaf-e morvarid مرواريد صدف) pearl shell). From each the same amount approaching forty derham درهم are placed into small bags. One small bag is then added to each crucible. They keep heating vigorously without pause for one hour and then stop the heat. After it cools off, they take out the iron ingot (egg) from the crucibles. A person said that he was sitting next to a smith who was making swords in the province of Send سند\\] Sind\\]. He saw that the smith was using narmâhan نرمآهن and putting a very soft, ground mixture, which had a red color on it. Then the smith placed it in the furnace, and took it out and hammered it, and continued this process a couple of times. When asked why he did that he looked contemptuously. When he \\[the person sitting next to the smith\\] looked closely, he saw that the smith was hammering and mixing dus دوص with narmâhan نرمآهن the same way they made iron ingots (eggs) in Herat.”\n\nThe metallurgical research into how this steel gets its patterns spans back far, with Michael Faraday (yes, that Faraday) having published a paper on recreating Indian crucible steel (known to him as wootz) in 1819, with subsequent papers in 1820 and 1822. It wasn't until 1837 when Pavel Anasov, a Russian metallurgist and director of the Zlatoust arms factory, that it was successfully recreated in any substantial quantity. Since then, research has been done on modern steels (Sherby and Wadsworth, 1983) and on historical blades, revealing the mechanisms by which the patterns forms (Verhoeven et al, 1998).\n\nAnosov was a metallurgist and Colonel of the Russian Army during the occupation on the Emirate of Bukhara in the 1820’s, when he established contact with steelmakers in the region and attempted to recreate the steel in his steelworks in Zlatoust, but after failing asked Captain Massalski (results published 1841) whose regiment was stationed there, to observe the process and undertake further observations.\n\nMassalski documented the Bukhara method, noting 3 key metals, cast iron, iron, and silver. Massalski stresses the ratio of one part iron, 3 parts cast iron (N.B: a co-fusion method of making steel with the right amount of carbon) and the crucibles hold around 2.5kg of steel, making up 1/3rd of the potential capacity of the crucible.\n\nThe metal workers start the fire and the metal begins to melt after some 5 to 6 hours, and makes a bubbling sound. When the bubbling sound ends, this is a sign that the fusion has ended. The workers remove the lid, add 0.013kg to 0.017kg of silver, stir rapidly with an iron rod, cover the charge with charcoal, and cover again with the lid. (N.B: this was a potentially primitive form of \"killing\" the steel, a process by which reactive elements in the charge react with another reactive metal - silver in this case, aluminium in modern times - and are thus removed from the reaction, resulting in less porosity due to gas production. The other method of degassing historically used was simply holding the ingot at the molten, liquidus temperature for longer). \n\n* N.B: Silver is not particularly reactive, so the purpose of silver might not have been killing the steel. The atmosphere and composition of a crucible melt, as well as the 1400-1500c temperature at which silver was added require further investigation to determine the mode of action. it may be that the liquid silver was moving into the grain boundaries of the steel during solidification, displacing phosphorus or sulphur.\n\nThey return the crucible to the fire and allow it to cool as the charcoal burns out, slowly, over 3 days. After cooling, the ingot is removed and tested by polishing to check for dendrites. The steel then passes to smiths, who “know that from then onwards whether the ingot survives being forged is a matter of luck”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A freshly made crucible steel ingot, image credit Peter Burt](https://preview.redd.it/zkm0z19a4e591.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c39855adc912f208268efe017e54de3cc3f55ae)\n\nThis is clear evidence that not only was the crucible steel production process being conducted in Bukhara in 1841, but that the mechanisms of pattern formation were already being formally investigated. And this is by far not the most recent ethnographic account of crucible steel manufacture.\n\nIn Mawalgaha, Sri Lanka, Ananda Coomaraswamy documented crucible steel production in 1903 – (Coomaraswamy, A. (1908): Medieval Sinhalese Art. Pantheon Books, New York). She found two crucible ingot fragments, crucibles, iron blooms and small iron bars. The two crucible ingot fragments were collected from the Mawalgaha village, where Kiri Ukkuwa demonstrated how to make steel for Coomaraswamy – providing the most recent known eyewitness evidence for crucible steel manufacturing.\n\nThis form of \"Damascus\" steel was therefore historically used as early as the 6th century BCE (Park et al 2019) and as late as 1841 when Massalski recorded crucible steel production in Bukhara, leading to the production of Bulat in Zlatoust by Anosov, and 1903 in Sri Lanka (though it was not actively being made en masse, and was only demonstrated using previously abandoned equipment).\n\n**In summary: Production between 1903ish, and 1980ish, was virtually halted, thus leading to the myth of it being a \"lost art\", however as will be shown in this document, the process was well documented and has since been replicated.**\n\nThe result is that there are now upwards of 150 individuals (at least, that I know of) who can produce crucible steel with an accurate metallurgical composition, which naturally form patterns in the steel due to carbide segregation. It is structurally, functionally and visually identical to historical crucible steel - and can only be differentiated by analysing the amount of radionuclides in the steel, as all historical steel is low background steel, and modern recreations are typically not.\n\nBecause I recognise that metallurgy is easier to grasp with visual aides, here is a comparison of antique crucible steel from an Iranian shamshir in my collection, and modern crucible steel (made by Niko Hynninen).\n\n[Left: Closeup of an antique Iranian shamshir blade in crucible steel.

The modern term “wootz” first appears around 1794 in writings by Sir Joseph Banks, who mistranslated Sanskrit for “utsa” as “wootz” (Dube, 20 14). In the regions where crucible steel was made, and where it was forged into blades, it was not called \"damascus\". This name is primarily a medieval name, and primarily used in Europe.\n\nThe origin of the name \"Damascus\" steel is contentious - The Islamic writers al-Kindi (full name Abu Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi) (circa 800 AD - 873 AD) and al-Beruni (full name Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni) (circa 973 AD - 1048 AD) were both scholars who wrote about swords and steel made for swords, based on their surface appearance, geographical location of production or forging, or the name of the smith.\n\nThere are three potential sources for the term \"Damascus\" in the context of steel.\n\nThe word \"Damas\" stems from the root word for \"water\" (\"ma\") or \"broiling\" in Arabic (Sachse, 1994, 13) and Damascus blades are often described as exhibiting a water-pattern on their surface, and are referred to as \"watered steel\" not only in English but in other languages.\n\nThe second theory is geographical, as Al-Kindi called swords produced and forged in Damascus as Damascene (al-Hassan, 1978, 35) but it's worth noting that crucibl steel blades were made in many nations, and crucible steel is not known to have ever been produced in the city of Damascus. Al Kindi also describes crucible steel production using the typical term Pulad, distinct from these damascene swords, indicating that the two types are separate. It is also worth noting that Al-Kindi did not describe these swords as having pattern forming steel.\n\nThird, Beiruni mentions a sword-smith called Damasqui who made swords of crucible steel (Said, 1989, 219-220). In a similar fashion, Al-Kindi mentions swords called “Zaydiya which were forged by a man called Zayd, and hence they were attributed to his name\". We therefore have a precedent for naming swords based on their makers, which may explain how \"Damascus\" came about.\n\nIt is my opinion that the \"watered\" hypothesis is most likely for the origin, though the popularisation of the term may have indeed occurred due to western travellers who purchased the swords in damascus, and described them thusly, as it was a massive center for trade.\n\n**How Crucible steel gets its pattern:**\n\nCrucible steel, as the name implies, is made in a crucible process, and requires completely liquefication of the crucible charge.\n\nMost surviving \"recipes\" for crucible steel call for either a combination of bloomery iron, and cast iron, or the use of bloomery iron and organic carbon sources (like plant leaves) - but crucible steel recipes included other elements, like organic material - rice husks, leaves, bark - as well as shells, glass, and even silver. The trace impurities in the iron used, and in these additives, are key to the patterns they show after forging.\n\nIn order to form patterns, carbide forming alloying elements like vanadium, tungsten or manganese are necessary in small amounts, with vanadium being the most common historical alloying element. These carbide formers cause the segregation of hard cementite carbides, which form the \"white streaks\" in crucible steel.\n\nThe segregation of CFEs into interdendritic reasons is due to the differences in solidification temperature between high CFE and low CFE steel, with low CFE steel solidifying at a higher temperature than high CFE steel. This causes the low CFE steel to solidify first when the ingot is slowly cooled, and it does so by branching out into dendrities of relatively pure iron, while the impurities such as phosphorus, CFEs and sulfur get pushed into the regions between these branches.\n\n[Dendritic structures visible on freshly made crucible ingot - image credit Peter Burt.](https://preview.redd.it/4plho3o14e591.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5862b44b804955becc1428e59c7f6ad289ddfc0d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the forging of the crucible steel \"puck\", these carbide formers are pushed into parallel, layered sheets in the microstructure of the steel (Verhoeven et al, 1998).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Parallel cluster sheets.](https://i.redd.it/gi70lojz3e591.gif)\n\nBecause vanadium and other CFEs do not readily dissolve at forging temperatures and do not rapidly migrate at forging temperatures, these sheets of carbide formers form distinct bands in the steel. As the steel is thermally cycled, carbides aggregate onto the CFEs via ostwald ripening, and form spheroids of cementite. The interdendritic regions without CFEs form as pearlite, a soft two-phase mixture of carbides, or sorbite, and imperfect form of pearlite. This is diagnostic of historical crucible steel (Verhoeven et al 2018, Feuerbach 2002, Feuerbach 2006).\n\nIt is worth noting that vanadium is not the only effective carbide former found in historical crucible steel blades, and other carbide formers like manganese are seen in historical examples - or even chromium as seen in Chahak, Iran (Alipour et al 2021). Additionally, the other microalloying elements in the steel can effect the contrast and spacing of the pattern, with phosporus notably increasing the contrast of the pattern after etching (Khorasani and Hynninen, 2013)\n\n**Historical perspectives on Crucible Damascus Steel quality:**\n\nRegarding the historical reputation of historical crucible steel swords: they were always very expensive, very desirable, and very well thought of - HOWEVER - there are accounts from the 14th century of cold-short blades (high in phosphorus) which claims that crucible steel swords are prone to breakage in cold weather.\n\nThe exact quote is by Alī ibn ʻAbd al-Raḥmān Ibn Hudhayl, translated:\n\n>\"the Hindy sabre often breaks when the weather is cold and shows itself better when the weather is warm”\n\nDespite this, they were very valued. Mohammad ibn Abi al-Barakāt Jŏhari Nezāmi in 1196 CE states a good shamshir blade of crucible steel was valued at 100 golden Dinar (Khorasani et al, 2013).\n\nAl-Idrisi (Full name Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Idris al-Idrisi - circa 1100CE - 1166CE) claimed that \"*nothing could surpass*\" the edge of a crucible steel sword.\n\nBertrandon de la Brocquiere, a Frenchman, wrote about his travels to the Middle East in 1432CE–1433CE. He wrote:\n\n>\"Damascus blades are the handsomest and best of all Syria... I have nowhere seen swords cut so excellently. They are made at Damascus, and in the adjoining country.\"\n\nNote: This is potentially the source of the (incorrect but often repeated) claim that crucible steel swords were made in Damascus.\n\nIn the early 1600's, Polish king Zygmunt III Waza ordered a Armenian merchant (Sefer Muratowicz) to purchase a number of watered steel blades from Isfahan, Persia due to their value and reputation (Muratovich et al, 1777). On this same journey, the merchant purchased carpets embroidered with the royal coat of arms, which still survive today.\n\nRegardless of the reputation crucible steel enjoyed in its' day, the reality is that it was by nature very clean, with minimal slag - which made it less likely to break due to inclusions - and there is a lot of variation in the metallurgical composition of this steel. Some have higher carbon, or more phosphorus, and the quality varied. Heat treatment also widely varied.\n\nCompared to bloomery steel which was folded and consolidated, it's more uniform and much lower in slag - the term for non-metallic inclusions. The same is true of refined blast furnace steel, which also requires forge consolidation after finishing the finery process.\n\n[Microstructure of a Japanese Katana, 2% Nital etch. Note the presence slag inclusions (black) within the mostly martensitic steel.

It depends on the exact sword being analysed, as crucible steel was produced for around 2 millennia and in many places. For example, some accounts of crucible steel swords being able to be bent 90 degrees exist, however these can easily be countered with extant examples that take a set no matter the degree of bending.\n\n**Production methods:**\n\nHere are 4 different processes, which were recorded from at early as Al Kindi, to as late as 1841CE with Massalski - from the Deccani process used in Hyderabad, to the south Indian process, and the Isfahan process, and the Bukhara process.\n\nThere are more processes out there, I just haven't gotten around to writing them out.\n\n**Bukhara:**\n\n>3 parts clean iron, 1 part cast iron. Place in a crucible that is five times as tall as it the base is wide, with a mouth three times the size of the base. The weight of iron should be 2-2.5kg.  \n>  \n>Using a charcoal melting furnace with air venting holes, heat until melted (6 hours) or until a bubbling sound can be heard from the crucible. once bubbling stops, remove the lid of the crucible and add 0.013-0.017 grams of silver to the crucible and stir with a metal rod. reseal the crucible, seal all holes in the furnace, and allow to cool over 3 days.  \n>  \n>Remove the puck from the crucible, and polish one corner of it to check if the watered pattern is good. If the pattern is poor, reheat to a red heat and hold for seven minutes before allowing to cool in air.  \n>  \n>Forge into a bar using the top of the button to form the spine of the blade, and never heating above red.\n\n**South Indian:**\n\n>In a clay crucible of conical form (200mm height x 50mm diameter) add 250-500 grams of bloomery iron, as well as wood chips, rice husks, vines or leaves. Seal the crucible with a clay lid, leaving a vent hole. Allow to fully dry  \n>  \n>Using a bellow-fed charcoal forge, heat for 6 hours or until molten. allow the crucible to cool in the forge (some sources say to quench it in water).  \n>  \n>The button will have a striated appearance if everything was done correctly.\n\n**Deccani (Hyderabad) Process:**\n\n>Using a mixture of iron sand derived iron ore, and iron clay derived iron (mirtpalli and kondapur iron), place in a crucible with glass, sealed with clay with a vent hole. Place in a bellow powered charcoal furnace for 24 hours. The steel will melt within the first 3. After 24 hours, remove crucible and allow to cool in the air.  \n>  \n>Once cool, remove the buttons and cover each in clay, and anneal in a conventional forge for 12-16 hours. repeat this annealing process until the button is no longer brittle.\n\n**Isfahan Process:**\n\n>To a crucible, add 10% casi auriculata wood, and asclepias gigantean leaves with two parts pure iron, one part cast iron, and three parts silicate-rich iron ore up to a total weight of 200 grams.  \n>  \n>10-1200 of these small crucibles are heated at a time in a kiln operated with charcoal and bellows for 6 days, before the crucibles are broken open, and the buttons removed.  \n>  \n>The buttons are then transferred into a \"hot room\" to anneal and temper for 2 days so they do not shatter from cooling too quickly.\n\nAuthors note: I suspect that if this room is a furnace-heated compartment, and is hot enough, they also experience some level of rim decarburisation, as well as converting the microstructure of the puck to a more forgeable state compared to steel which has not been roasted.\n\n**\\*\\*References\\*\\***\n\nAlipour, R., Rehren, T., Martinón-Torres, M. \"Chromium crucible steel was first made in Persia\", Journal of Archaeological Science, Vol. 127, 2021,\n\nAl-Hassan, A.Y., 1978, Iron and Steel Technology in Medieval Arabic Sources, Journal for the History of Arabic Science 2: 1,31-43\n\nAnosov, P.P.

Sherby and Jeffrey Wadsworth, 1985, \"Damascus Steel\", Scientific American, 252(2) p. 112 -120\n\n**N.B:** A brief note on the claim **carbon nanotubes** exist in crucible steel:\n\nThe only articles that \"found\" carbon nanotubes was published as a brief communication to Nature, i.e not a full article. This was in 2006, and was only a few pages in length.\n\nIt later found its away into a conference paper by the same authors, still not a full length peer reviewed article. This was 2 pages in length. These findings should be considered preliminary.\n\nThe method used (dissolving crucible steel in acid and seeing what remains) revealed stands of carbon, but carbon dissolves VERY readily into steel. Crucible steel is typified by cementite spheroids, which often stretch into rods during forging as they are deformed. If you dissolve cementite in acid, removing the iron component, you are left with carbon.\n\nThis does not mean there was an intact carbon nanotube in the core of the cementite rod - and even if it DID mean that, it would have negligible impact on performance because it is \\*encased\\* in cementite, which itself is in a soft matrix of pearlite or sorbite.\n\nBut don't take my word for it. Other academics, including those who have been instrumental in understanding crucible steel (namely John Verhoeven) doubt the findings.\n\n\" John Verhoeven, of Iowa State University in Ames, suggests Paufler is seeing something else. Cementite can itself exist as rods, he notes, so there might not be any carbon nanotubes in the rod-like structure.\"\n\n\"Another potential problem is that TEM equipment sometimes contains nanotubes, says physicist Alex Zettl of the University of California\"\n\n[https://www.nature.com/news/2006/061113/full/news061113-11.html](https://www.nature.com/news/2006/061113/full/news061113-11.html)",

Now as we all know, the three spirits have always been heroes with quite similar concepts, their skills are somewhat similar (Some form of hard CC, Remnants, Movement Abilities) as well as their names (Raijin, Kaolin, Xin). Now let's think about their names for a second and try to remember a certain someone with the same sounding name, [this](http://imgur.com/a/qCRc1) dude.\n\n\nHe looks aquatic with all those fins and scaly features, he's blue which is the color of the ocean and he looks vaguely like one of the Spirit Brothers, the shape of his head, his facial features and most especially his eyes. The first time I saw him I thought he was a spirit brother or at least a would be vessel for the Fourth Spirit, the Aqua Spirit. \n\n\nTL;DR: Calling it now, Breklin is the Fourth Spirit and Volvo teased him twice in the Monkey King comics.",

I had _almost_ accepted the fact that I would have to do a 'normal' interpretation of the theme, until [this video](https://youtu.be/rs9A20wRUxI?si=VfjZRqpSMFGZ8Oh9) of Simone Giertz' last meal dropped and one of her final meals would be rocks. She wanted to eat rocks. I can do something with that!\n\nI ended up researching different ways to make edible rocks for hours on end, and eventually ended up finding [this recipe](https://reportergourmet.com/en/news/5896-the-edible-stones-that-stunned-the-world-mugaritz-s-recipe). Edible rocks!\n\nFunny story; when trying to source the kaolin clay I kept finding stores that only sold it in massive quantities, and I only needed a few grams.. Eventually I came across a pet food supplement store that sold smaller quantities, so I had to get it from there. Feels weird to cook with something labeled as pet food, but it's pharmaceutical grade and safe to consume by humans. \n\nI tried making the aioli in the recipe as well, but emulsification is my arch nemesis. Ended up just eating these with BBQ sauce. The shell doesn't do a whole lot flavour wise, but it does add an interesting texture and mouth feel.  ",

The comment section here can be really helpful, but it was getting quite long, so we thought it would be good to start a new Beginner thread.\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMany people come to look to revamp their current routines or create a new routine. While not all of the products mentioned here will work for 100% of people, this is a good place to start regardless of skin type/concern. \n\nThe products mentioned are those commonly recommended on the sub and by no means is it comprehensive. In addition, the products mentioned here tend to be affordable/widely available/effective for most people.\n\n**But PLEASE keep in mind that skincare is not an exact science and no one can guarantee success for an individual.**\nRecommendations on here have been the most well tolerated that we've encountered and users report a high degree of success with them. However, sensitivities are possible with any product and no product can guarantee 100% efficacy and tolerance in an entire population.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nFirst,  **stop** using St. Ives Apricot Scrub!!! The particles are large, non-uniform, sharp, and too abrasive to be suitable for facial use. Also, ditch any citrus fruits on the face and baking soda scrubs. More info [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/195lue/psa_please_do_not_use_baking_soda_on_your_skin_it/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/13wz1y/psa_lemons_and_limes_great_for_food_not_for_skin/). \n\nNext, **don't buy everything at once: include only 1 new product at a time**. Don't buy a new full blown routine if you don't need it!   Be patient, take your time, and **[Test patch](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/14sd25/i_just_learned_how_to_do_a_test_patch_properly/).**  .\n\nIf you can't seem to find a particular product in your country, a few online stores/companies can be helpful and ship internationally. These include [sasa](http://web1.sasa.com/SasaWeb/splash.jsp), [Paula's Choice](http://www.paulaschoice.com/), [iherb](http://www.iherb.com/), and [mmmule](http://mmmule.com/). \n\nNow, onto recommendations!!\n\n\n- **Cleanser** \n\n  We frequently tell folks it's not necessary to cleanse 2x a day, particularly for those suffering with oily/dehydrated/dry skin types. Exceptions include things like post-workouts or if you've been sweating through the night.\n\n  If your skin is feeling tight/dry/squeaky after cleansing, you should look for a new cleanser.\n\n  *Cleanser Recs*\n  \n  ~ Cerave Foaming (US/Canada): Suitable for acne prone\n\n  ~ Cerave Hydrating (US/Canada): Better for non-acne prone/dry\n\n  ~ Spectro Jel (Canada): Suitable for acne-prones\n\n  ~ Boots Sensitive Foaming Wash (UK/US/Canada/other?): Potentially suitable for all skin types\n\n  ~ Eucerin DermatoClean, \"gentle\" (Worldwide): Suitable for sensitive/acne prone\n\n  ~ [Oil Cleansing](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/): Suitable for almost all skin types, but the oil/oils you use depends on your skin type. Those with SD should tread lightly with this method, as some oils can exacerbate the issue.\n\n  \n- **Exfoliation**\n\n  Chemical exfoliation is the preferred method on /r/skincareaddiction, it tends to be more gentle than physical exfoliation *and* you can do it daily. You can learn more about the different types of chemical exfoliators in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1hj8yo/whats_the_difference_ahas_vs_bhas/) sidebar post.  \n\n  Lactic acid is the most gentle, so if you suffer with eczema/rosacea prone sensitive skin, start with lactic.  If you're acne prone/have lots of clogs and/or oily, start with a BHA (salicylic acid). If you are combo, and want the humectant benefits of an AHA, try Mandelic---partly oil soluble AHA. \n\n  Physical exfoliation (yes this includes a washcloth and the Clarisonic!) should not be used more than 1-2x a week, and not if you have active acne, sensitive, flaking, or irritated skin.\n\n  Exfoliation will be beneficial if you have any of the following concerns (not comprehensive): zits, uneven texture, congestion, blackheads, whiteheads, dull skin, dry skin, [sebaceous filaments (SFs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fmg0t/some_more_information_about_sebaceous_filaments/), etc.\n\n  Since AHAs/BHAs work at a lower pH to exfoliate, it's helpful to wait a few minutes before applying your next product (ie-moisturizer). If you don't have time to wait that length of time, at least wait until the AHA/BHA is dry.\n\n   Aim to use the AHAs in the PM--these cause photosensitivity. BHAs are more flexible, but when you can, do your exfoliation in the PM.\n\n  *BHA exfoliator recs (alcohol free)*\n\n  ~ Stridex Maximum Strength Pads aka Stridex in the red box (US/available on iherb or Vitacost): 2% salicylic. If known serious sensitivity to light fragrance/menthol proceed with caution. These tend to work fine for the majority of people\n\n  ~ Paula's Choice BHAs (Worldwide): Fragrance-free options, but pricier than stridex\n\n  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Various BHA products\n  \n  ~ Neutrogena 3 in 1 Oil Free Acne Stress Control Hydrating Acne Treatment (Various locations): 2% SA, light fragrance, contains 'cones.\n\n  *AHA exfoliator recs*\n\n  ~ St Ives Scrub Free Exfoliating Pads (US): 4-5% lactic acid. If very sensitive to fragrance or known fruit allergies, proceed with caution.\n\n  ~ Silk Naturals AHA Toner (US based but will ship to some international locations): 8% Lactic acid. Contains aloe. Fragrance-free.\n\n  ~ Paula's Choice AHAs (Worldwide): Varying concentrations of glycolic acid, fragrance-free\n\n  ~ Olay Regenerist Night Resurfacing Elixir (Worldwide): 8-10% glycolic acid, fragrance-free\n\n  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Varying Glycolic/lactic/ AHA+BHA combos\n\n  ~ Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Gel (US/International through iHerb): 10% glycolic acid, fragrance free\n\n  ~ Alpha Hydrox Swipes or Intensive Serum ( US/ Parent company may ship international to some locations): 14% glycolic acid, fragrance free\n\n  ~ MUAC Mandelic Serum (US/ ships internationally): 10% mandelic acid, fragrance-free\n\n  ~ Avene Cleanance K (US/Canada/Europe/Aussie/possibly other locations): AHA/BHA product.  2% Lactic, 6% Glycolic, and 1% Salicylic. Slightly more expensive than the other recommendations. Fragrance-free.\n\n- **Moisturize**\n\n  Everyone needs a moisturizer, even those with oily skin!  A lot of the time at least part of the oil production is commonly due to dehydration (aka lack of moisture). \n\n  *Moisturizer Recs*\n\n  ~ Cerave Cream aka Cerave in the tub (US/Canada): Suitable for any skin type. Also works for the body. Fast absorbing, lots of humectants/ceramides. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1k3k7p/attention_all_cerave_in_the_tub_users_ive_found/) thread has info on getting a pump lid for the jar.\n  \n  ~ Oilatum Natural Repair (UK): Suitable for any skin type. Similar to Cerave in the tub, though a tad more greasy. \n\n  ~ Cetaphil Lotion/Cream (Many locations worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Slightly greasier formula to Cerave in the tub. \n\n  ~ Vaseline  (Worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Good to add on top of moisturizer, or use alone to prevent water loss.\n\n  ~ EltaMD Intense Moisturizer (US): Vaseline alternative, non-sticky/day friendly option.\n\n\n- **Sunscreen**\n\n  This is your choice, just be sure to wear it everyday and it's at least SPF30 with high UVA protection. It's even more crucial  if you're using AHAs, retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, or you're on particular oral medications.\n\n  Proper amount for application is 2mg/cm^2. This is about 1/4 teaspoon (~1.2 mL) for the face alone. Reapplication should be every 1.5-2 hours (maybe even more depending on how nasty the UV index will be that day), and after every time you take a dunk in water. \n\n  Recommendations highly vary depending on location and type of finish you prefer. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/15tuqd/for_those_interested_in_trying_out_new_susncreens/) sidebar link on sunscreens gives you all you need to know.  Also, try a board search and look on the first few pages of the sub.\n\n  Generally, if you are very sensitive or acne prone, you'll want to look for an all physical sunscreen or at least a physical/chemical combo.  All chemical sunscreens tend to cause stinging/breakouts/irritation for many people.\n\n- **Spot Treatments/Masks**\n\n  This will vary based on your skin type, personal preference as well. An effective spot treatment generally has antimicrobial/anti inflammatory properties. \n\n  *Spot Treatments to Consider*\n\n  ~ Benzoyl Peroxide cream/wash:  If in a wash, leave on skin for a few minutes before cleansing off to allow the BP to take effect. Side effects can be dryness/redness sensitivity. [2.5%](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1j4l9o/just_want_to_share_what_my_doctor_told_me_today/cbb2fen) is also A-OK to use, and can be just as effective as the higher concentrations with just less irritation.\n\n  ~ Sulfur ointment/cream: Tends to be less irritating than BP\n\n  ~ Tea Tree Oil: Should be diluted with a carrier oil to avoid a chemical burn. Avoid if prone to allergic contact dermatitis. Potent fragrance.\n\n  ~ Neem Oil: Very potent fragrance \n\n  ~ Clay masks: These will help clear pores and help bring some acne to a head.    Bentonite is the strongest, not great for dry/very sensitive skin, and should be mixed with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV).   Kaolin/Rhassoul/French green are less drying and do not need to be mixed with ACV.\n__________________________________________________________\n\n**Order of Products**\n\nAs far as the order of your new and snazzy routine goes, it really depends, which is partly why we didn't include anything specific on here. \n\nThere's also a lot of flexibility in how/when you can use things (more pertaining to hydroxy acids).  Some people use multiple hydroxy acids (some in the form of a liquid) and/or have RX products that they need to use, so depending on the situation, the order and how often to apply things will differ. \n\nAn *example* routine with all of the things listed could go:\n\n**AM**\n\n-  Splash with water (unless feeling really grimy, use your cleanser)\n- Moisturizer\n- Sunscreen\n\n**PM**\n\n- (If applicable) Remove makeup, preferably with an oil\n- Cleanser\n- Exfoliator\n- Wait a few minutes, at least til it dries\n- Moisturizer\n- Spot treatment (also can come before moisturizer, *do whatever works for you*)\n\nAgain, this is JUST an example, and not etched in stone. It all depends what other things you're using and whether or not you need to tweak order of things, or increase or decrease usage of products.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPlease feel free to ask questions or leave some more product recs!",

The next day I applied it much thinner, just a pea-sized amount or so, and it was still a little greasy. This morning I applied about half that amount and it finally felt good, but I'm wondering if that's enough to even be effective.\n\n2. Should I apply the Cerave everywhere? My nose is the only part of my face that really gets oily - does it still need to be moisturized? What about under my eyes? I've seen mentions here and there that you don't actually need a specialized undereye cream, but I'm kind of paranoid from years of hearing that regular moisturizer will destroy my eye region and make me look like a crone within weeks.\n\n3. Sunscreen - does it go under or over the moisturizer? Either way, how long should I wait between products?\n\nThank you so much for this beginner guide!",

And sorry if you already answered this question, there's a lot of comments so I may have missed something:\n\nEverything I've read says to apply treatment products before moisturizer, allowing it to dry in between.

Since SA is oil soluble my theory is that it can still penetrate through the moisturizer but maybe I'm totally wrong about this.\n\nso my question is, is it worth it to moisturize while my skin is still damp or does moisturizing first reduce the effectiveness of the BHA too much?\n\n*edit for clarity",

I'd appreciate any feedback!  :)\n\nOk, so from what I've gathered, my skin type is sensitive, acne prone combo (it's oily in the T-Zone and dry everywhere else) and I have adult onset hormonal acne.  It means that the worst of my acne actually doesn't pop up in the oily areas, but instead along my jaw/cheeks/behind my ears.  I'm proscribed Spironolactone, which has cleared up the major papules, but I do still have quite a number of whiteheads. \n\nI've tested the Cerave Foaming cleanser and the Cerave in the tub for over a month at this point.  I really liked the way that my skin felt with them, but my skin gets tight after cleansing.  It does feel fine after I moisturize though.  So, does this mean it's too harsh?  I'm still a bit confused as to whether the tightness is expected before moisturizing?  \n\nNow that I've had a month of testing the products and know that they don't cause problems, I want to start introducing a chemical exfoliant as well.  I'm hoping this will help with the whiteheads I have.\n\nFrom my understanding, BHAs like Stridex are great for acne prone skin, but I'm also worried about the effects they have on sensitive skin.  Additionally - since my acne is hormonal will these even really affect it, other than to potentially damage healthy skin and re-aggrivate it?  Or am I not understanding hormonal acne?  Would I be better to start with lactic acid because of that gentleness?\n\nThanks in advance for any responses and opinions!

My parents did have me go to a dermatologist because they did care though. I don't think the dude knew what he was doing and despite trying some pills for a while I stopped taking those. I still use the BP and Differin now but at that time it's all I used.\n\nAnyway, I'm a junior in college now and for the most part I don't get that bad of acne anymore. Sometimes I'll wake up with 3-4 new pimples but usually it'll be just something small every day or two. I want to finish it completely though. My forehead is generally clean except for a few bumps near the eyebrows and above the nose. My cheeks don't often get new ones but this is where most of the redness and scarring is. New pimples mainly form around the jawline, sideburn area, and around the mouth (although since a few changes since discovering this two weeks ago, my chin has been great).\n\nI would like to continue the progress I've made, keep the new ones from forming (especially because I need to start shaving more often but I'm really scared to cause a breakout), and also get rid of the redness. I really think I'm still doing something wrong. My face looks like I have a bad sunglasses tanline and I want to eliminate that redness and start lightening the scarring because the scars have been there for a couple years and haven't significantly reduced in redness, although there still are occasional pimples in that area.\n\nMy routine is this: \nAM \n*Rinse with water \n*Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser (Began using a week or so ago from Clean and Clear Deep Action Cream Cleanser after reading here not to use products with alcohol in them. That seems to have helped as I haven't broken out this week.) \n*Prescription BP of 5% (Causes some flaking around the chin and mouth. Used to be much worse before I started using moisturizer and I would shave off the dead skin. It goes away after moisturizing though.) *Wait 15-20 minutes\n*CVS brand (comparable to Cetaphil) Moisturizing Lotion (I think I'm going to switch this out too, but I read here also to do one product at a time.)\nPM: \n*In shower\n*Same Fresh Foaming Cleanser from above. (On Saturday I use Clean and Clear Deep Action Exfoliating Scrub. I read not to exfoliate too often, I would do it more if it's recommended though. I've also only began this as of a week ago.) \n*Prescription Differin\n*Wait 15-20 minutes\n*Same moisturizer\n\nNotes: \n*I resumed taking Zinc supplements a week ago after stopping for 2 months \n*I never really use sunscreen on my face for fear of clogging pores/breaking out \n*My face generally gets greasy, on my cheeks especially, anywhere from 3-8 hours after washing. Sometimes I wake up with a greasy face and sometimes I don't. What's up with this? \n*I pat dry my face with a new paper towel after each wash to avoid irritation and using towels that touch other things. \n*I never really touch my face, I'm very conscious about it.\n\nSummary of questions: \n*How can I reduce the redness and not breakout?! (I've even been asked if I'm sunburned. That's gotta stop.) \n*How can I finish off the pimples that still form? \n*What should be corrected in my routine? \n*How can I shave without breaking out or mistakenly running over a forming pimple?\n*What is recommended for spot treatments of pimples that I notice forming?\n\nThanks!",

Honestly, I felt like it helped, but didn't see much of a difference for almost 2-3 months.

We were told idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease and he was referred to a GI specialist. He was on a novel protein diet, getting weekly b12 shots, and a probiotic to manage until he could see a specialist. We finally had clearance to neuter (had to hold off due to diarrhea), and we were shocked to see his bowels cleared up after surgery. Only thing that changed aside from losing his balls, was that he stopped chewing on his Benebone while drugged up. We did a quick trial test of giving him a Benebone and monitoring his stool, and his diarrhea returned. We took it away and he has had solid poops... After thousands of dollars, weekly vet visits, diet changes, etc. it literally just ended up being chewing on a Benebone that upset his tummy.

When you're escaping, using a spell or an item can sometimes turn you around and get you killed.\n\nAnd if you're on the offensive and you're going after someone and kill them with creeps around, you'd probably start auto-attacking creeps because they are the next closest targets, which would waste damage. If you can only attack 1 or 2 times per second, then that's an extra second it takes to kill an enemy, possibly even letting them get away because they get out of range before you can wade through their creeps.\n\nIf they like the mechanic, I say that valve should keep it in, but can we please have an option?

Nike, Jordan, Reebok, or Adidas, or be like Mike Conley and defy convention and endorse Dr. Scholls, or, shit, he could have endorsed fucking Muk Luks or those Starter Brand shoes from Wal-Mart.But instead, he went outside the wire to endorse the Chinese shoe company Anta. Now they paid him, they definitely paid him, but many people would have paid Klay. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[\"I was going to hopefully be the Michael Jordan one day of Anta. That really resonated with me, and knowing that I could be really big in China, that was really cool to me.\"](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/klay-thompson-signs-80m-deal-with-anta-aims-to-be-the-m-j-of-chinese-shoe-brand/)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThink about Klay in China. Jimmer Fredette, a rotation player that no NBA coach was willing to give a long-term gig, is a certified superstar there. Hell, he had a 10-day contract with the Knicks two years ago and they didn't even put him on the floor for 10 minutes, even with the Monosodium Glutamate faithful cheering his name like he was Beyoncé. But in China, they have nicknamed him \"The Lonely God.\" Loneliness is an honorable trait in China. That's why in all those Chinese movies, the badass hero is always living alone in some Kaolin hut on the border of Tibet until he is reluctantly called upon by an old flame to defeat the evil Optimus Prime or whatever. The Lonely God... how badass is that? It's true, too, Jimmer is an actual God in that country.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCan you imagine Klay on the Shanghai Sharks? This man, Jimmer, averaged 38ppg over there! Now don't get me wrong, Jimmer's a layer of cashmere wool away from being the goat—he made like 100 charity shots from three, even Steph can't do that—but if Klay went to China, he would average 50ppg on like 1.5 dribbles per game. He'd pull up from half-court, fire would trail the basketball like the tail of Haley's comet, and the Chinese announcers would scream \"Boom shakalaka!!!\" They wouldn't even have to stop play to replace the burned nets because KLAY THOMPSON DOESN'T HIT NET. He would destroy Jimmer and become the Godslayer. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI did the math. There are over 1.3 billion people in China. Everyone needs shoes. That's 1.3 billion shoes—more if people buy the limited edition KT100's, in honor of the 100ppg he averaged that year.",

    "body": "A video recently was published which claims \"damascus\" steel is a lost art. It used some of my photos (7:19) so I thought I'd be the right person to debunk it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hq5Gsw38apc\n\nFirst of all, let's clarify what I mean when I say \"True Damascus Steel\", because it is very easy to become mired in definitions and ambiguity. Distinguishing between them is important, because sideprojects can't.\n\n[Top: Ottoman Pala, Pattern welded. Bottom, Iranian Shamshir, Crucible steel.](https://i.imgur.com/Vy7xgrU.jpeg)\n\n**\"Damascus steel\" usually refers to two main types of steel**:\n\nThe most common you'll see made today is \"**pattern-welded steel**\", where alternating layers of nickel rich and nickel deplete steel are stacked, forge welded, and **folded** or manipulated to create a pattern. The blade is then polished and etched to reveal the layers. While modern pattern welded blades typically use nickel containing steels to maximise contrast, historically this was not usually the case.\n\nThis method of construction using stacked, folded or otherwise forge welded, dissimilar* steels is how the majority of sword steels were made, worldwide, until advances in technology allowed for the use of more homogenous steel products. Pattern welding, and variants such as multibar patterns and laminated blades, were used widely and includes swords like spatha, “viking” swords, katana and more. It is worth noting that even \"monosteel\" swords which were made without the use of dissimilar steel, but still made from bloomery or refined blast furnace steel, were also subject to similar stacking, folding and forge welding techniques.\n\n*Bloom is here considered to contain multiple dissimilar steels due to the heterogeneous nature of bloom.\n\nIn the present day, this is the type you will see chef’s knives, swords, and even pocket knives being made of, and it can range from being rather cheap to incredibly expensive depending on the materials and workmanship. It is also the sort of steel used as an example in photos throughout the video, such as at 6:32, or 9:15, so clearly the narrator was also a victim of the ambiguity surrounding these two steel types.\n\n[Pattern welded Pala blade in \\\\\"Turkish Ribbon Twist\\\\\" style.](https://i.imgur.com/bxcCDtY.jpeg)\n\nThe other type of \"Damascus Steel\" is a form of hypereutectoid, pattern forming **crucible steel.**\n\nAnd that is what I will be discussing today, as it was the primary topic of the video. Pattern welding was called merely a \"cheap knockoff\" - 10:07 in the video\n\nIt is a hypereutectoid steel, which means that it has over 0.8% carbon by definition. It is formed by liquifying steel in a crucible, and is **NOT** **produced by folding** or layering steel. The typical composition is around 1% to 2% carbon, which by modern standards makes this an “ultra-high carbon steel”, often abbreviated as UHCS.\n\nIt is formed by melting steel with specific impurities in a crucible (historically, made of high kaolin content clay, rice husks as chaff, quartz sands, and other additives), and the process of turning this crucible “charge” into steel is quite complicated, with the potential for failure to produce an attractive pattern being high if any part of the process is not conducted correctly.\n\nIn summary (and there will be more detail later on in this article), the crucible charge is brought up to melting temperature, and held at this temperature for a while, allowing the constituent alloying elements present in the steel to spread and bubbles to boil out. It is then slowly cooled, before the ingot is removed, roasted to decarburise the rim, drawn out into a bar, manipulated to produce a surface pattern with ball peens, wedges and grinding, and finally forged it into a blade, and thermally cycled.\n\nAs stated, this steel is typically the range of carbon content is between 1 and 2% in historical examples, and thus melts in a temperature range between 1200 and 1400c (for more information, see “iron carbon phase diagrams”). It must also have sufficient levels of carbide formers (vanadium, molybdenum, manganese etc) in order to form patterns (Verhoeven et al, 1998,. Verhoeven et al 2018).\n\nThe pattern in crucible steel are formed by \"rafts\" of steel rich in carbide formers, where ultra-hard cementite spheroids form over subsequent forging cycles, which etch bright, and areas devoid of carbide forming elements (CFEs), which remain as pearlite, a soft mix of carbides which etches dark. The shape and size of the rafts is determined by the length of dendrites that form during the slow cooling of the ingot, as dendritic regions of the steel are carbide former depleted, and interdendritic regions are carbide former rich (Verhoeven et al, 2018).\n\n[Crucible steel shamshir blade, kara Khorasan pulad](https://i.imgur.com/AviGGQh.jpeg)\n\nMany people conflate pattern-welded steel with crucible steel, and call both “Damascus”. Whilst this is accepted in colloquial language, it is important to distinguish between the two – particularly when it comes to identifying antiques, or documenting them.\n\n\"Damascus\" can therefore be used to refer to either pattern welded, or crucible steels, as both are pattern-forming steels, but it is best to specify which sort of \"Damascus\" is being discussed. The term has been used historically to describe both pattern-welded steel and crucible steel. Many swords and gun barrels made in germany were marked \"damastahl\" in the 18th and 19th century, and they were pattern welded, so there is historical precedent for such a naming convention, but the two techniques (and end products) are very different.\n\n**To be ABSOLUTELY CLEAR: \"True\" damascus steel is herein used as a term to refer to historical, patterned crucible steel. I am using this term entirely because it is understandable. The correct naming and etymology is discussed later. Both pattern welded and crucible steel blades can be called \"damascus\", and were historically, but the \"lost\" form is the crucible steel form.**\n\n**The Myth: \"Damascus Steel is a Lost Art\":**\n\nIn the video, at 7:33, the narrator states \"wootz\" was made in South India. This is true - but it was not ONLY made in South India. It was made in many places, and called many things. The \"wootz\" name pops up first in 1794, but more on that later.\n\nThe is quite a long history of crucible “Damascus” steel, in the form of primary sources in which the process was written down - as early as 350BCE - 420BCE Zosimus, an early alchemist in Alexandria, wrote the following:\n\n>\"The tempering of Indian Iron: Take 4 pounds of soft iron, and the skins of myrobalans, called elileg, 15 parts; belileg, 4 parts; and two parts of glassmakers magnesia. Then place it into a crucible and make it level. .... Put on the charcoal and blow the fire until the iron becomes molten and the ingredients become united with it. ... Such is the premier and royal operation, which is practiced today and by means of which they make marvelous swords. It was discovered by the Indians and exploited by the Persians\".\n\nThis is by no means the only method to make crucible steel - some was co-fusion, using both cast iron and bloom, while some was indeed made with bloomery and carbon bearing material (often plants).\n\nIncidentally, the oldest known crucible steel sword is from the 6th to 3rd century BCE and was found interred in a megalithic site in Thelunganur, Tamil Nadu, India (Ramesh et al, 2019) and daggers from \\~500BCE have been found with the associated production site in Kodumanal, Tamil Nadu (Sasisekaran & Rao, 1999. Sasisekaran, 2002). This is consistent with the Zosimus account describing the technique as discovered by India.\n\n[Thelunganur sword, Ramesh et al 2019](https://i.imgur.com/F5tJ7lZ.jpg)\n\nThe Islamic writers al-Kindi (full name Abu Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi - circa 800CE - 873CE) and al-Beruni (full name Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni - circa 973CE - 1048CE) both wrote detailed procedures for the production of crucible steel, too.\n\n⁠This is how Biruni described it in the manuscript Al-Jamâhir Marefat al-Jawâher. (From Khorasani et al, 2013):\n\n>“He says that they \\[ironwokers\\] include five ratl رطل of \\[horse\\] shoes, the nails of which are made of narmâhan نرمآهن\\] in the crucible\\].

Then they fill the furnace with charcoal and blow air with Rumi (Roman Byzantine/Anatolian) bellows that are pumped by two men until the iron melts. Then they add a combination of halile هليله) myrobalan), pust-e anâr انار پوست) pomegranate peel), melh al-ajeyn ملحالعجين) the salt used for dough), and sadaf-e morvarid مرواريد صدف) pearl shell). From each the same amount approaching forty derham درهم are placed into small bags. One small bag is then added to each crucible. They keep heating vigorously without pause for one hour and then stop the heat. After it cools off, they take out the iron ingot (egg) from the crucibles. A person said that he was sitting next to a smith who was making swords in the province of Send سند\\] Sind\\]. He saw that the smith was using narmâhan نرمآهن and putting a very soft, ground mixture, which had a red color on it. Then the smith placed it in the furnace, and took it out and hammered it, and continued this process a couple of times. When asked why he did that he looked contemptuously. When he \\[the person sitting next to the smith\\] looked closely, he saw that the smith was hammering and mixing dus دوص with narmâhan نرمآهن the same way they made iron ingots (eggs) in Herat.”\n\nThe metallurgical research into how this steel gets its patterns spans back far, with Michael Faraday (yes, that Faraday) having published a paper on recreating Indian crucible steel (known to him as wootz) in 1819, with subsequent papers in 1820 and 1822. It wasn't until 1837 when Pavel Anasov, a Russian metallurgist and director of the Zlatoust arms factory, that it was successfully recreated in any substantial quantity. Since then, research has been done on modern steels (Sherby and Wadsworth, 1983) and on historical blades, revealing the mechanisms by which the patterns forms (Verhoeven et al, 1998).\n\nAnosov was a metallurgist and Colonel of the Russian Army during the occupation on the Emirate of Bukhara in the 1820’s, when he established contact with steelmakers in the region and attempted to recreate the steel in his steelworks in Zlatoust, but after failing asked Captain Massalski (results published 1841) whose regiment was stationed there, to observe the process and undertake further observations.\n\nMassalski documented the Bukhara method, noting 3 key metals, cast iron, iron, and silver. Massalski stresses the ratio of one part iron, 3 parts cast iron (N.B: a co-fusion method of making steel with the right amount of carbon) and the crucibles hold around 2.5kg of steel, making up 1/3rd of the potential capacity of the crucible.\n\nThe metal workers start the fire and the metal begins to melt after some 5 to 6 hours, and makes a bubbling sound. When the bubbling sound ends, this is a sign that the fusion has ended. The workers remove the lid, add 0.013kg to 0.017kg of silver, stir rapidly with an iron rod, cover the charge with charcoal, and cover again with the lid. (N.B: this was a potentially primitive form of \"killing\" the steel, a process by which reactive elements in the charge react with another reactive metal - silver in this case, aluminium in modern times - and are thus removed from the reaction, resulting in less porosity due to gas production. The other method of degassing historically used was simply holding the ingot at the molten, liquidus temperature for longer).\n\n* N.B: Silver is not particularly reactive, so the purpose of silver might not have been killing the steel. The atmosphere and composition of a crucible melt, as well as the 1400-1500c temperature at which silver was added require further investigation to determine the mode of action. it may be that the liquid silver was moving into the grain boundaries of the steel during solidification, displacing phosphorus or sulphur. At sufficient levels, silver will segregate into grain boundaries in crucible steels.\n\nThey return the crucible to the fire and allow it to cool as the charcoal burns out, slowly, over 3 days. After cooling, the ingot is removed and tested by polishing to check for dendrites. The steel then passes to smiths, who “know that from then onwards whether the ingot survives being forged is a matter of luck”\n\n[A freshly made crucible steel ingot, image credit Peter Burt](https://i.imgur.com/emlGrhr.jpeg)\n\nThis is clear evidence that not only was the crucible steel production process being conducted in Bukhara in 1841, but that the mechanisms of pattern formation were already being formally investigated. And this is by far not the most recent ethnographic account of crucible steel manufacture.\n\nIn Mawalgaha, Sri Lanka, Ananda Coomaraswamy documented crucible steel production in 1903 – (Coomaraswamy, A. (1908): Medieval Sinhalese Art. Pantheon Books, New York). He found two crucible ingot fragments, crucibles, iron blooms and small iron bars. The two crucible ingot fragments were collected from the Mawalgaha village, where Kiri Ukkuwa demonstrated how to make steel for Coomaraswamy – providing the most recent known eyewitness evidence for crucible steel manufacturing.\n\nThis form of \"Damascus\" steel was therefore historically used as early as the 6th century BCE (Park et al 2019) and as late as 1841 when Massalski recorded crucible steel production in Bukhara, leading to the production of Bulat in Zlatoust by Anosov, and 1903 in Sri Lanka (though it was not actively being made en masse, and was only demonstrated using previously abandoned equipment).\n\n**In summary: Production between 1903ish, and 1980ish, was virtually halted, thus leading to the myth of it being a \"lost art\", however as will be shown in this document, the process was well documented and has since been replicated.**\n\nThe video, meanwhile, does not go into this level of nuance. It claims bluntly that \"damascus\" can no longer be made- see 8:50.\n\nThe reality is that there are now upwards of 150 individuals (at least, that I know of) who can produce crucible steel with an accurate metallurgical composition, which naturally form patterns in the steel due to carbide segregation. It is structurally, functionally and visually identical to historical crucible steel - and can only be differentiated by analysing the amount of radionuclides in the steel, as all historical steel is low background steel, and modern recreations are typically not.\n\nBecause I recognise metallurgy is easier to grasp with visual aides, here is a comparison of antique crucible steel from an Iranian shamshir in my collection, and modern crucible steel (made by Niko Hynninen).\n\n[Left: Closeup of an antique Iranian shamshir blade in crucible steel. Right: False-color demonstration of high and medium density carbide forming element distribution. Medium CFE density leads to divorced spheroids.](https://i.imgur.com/onW5GVV.jpeg)\n\n[Modern crucible steel by Niko Hynninen, under microscope. Note the clear swirling rafts of spheroid cementite, and divorced spheroids of cementite, as seen in the antique examples.](https://i.imgur.com/yZYvprV.jpeg)\n\n[Crucible steel (modern) by Niko Hynninen. ](https://i.imgur.com/Nx7HU4p.jpeg)\n\nAt 9:00, the narrator appropriately says it is \"speculated\" that production ceased due to the loss of ore sources, but this speculation ignores the fact that crucible steel was made in many places, from many ore sources. The actual reasons for the cessation of mass production of crucible steels is multi faceted and likely incorporates economic factors, such as import of cheaper, mass produced steel weapons and tools from europe, as well as legal factors such as restrictions to certain industries such as the forestry and mining industries under the British Raj.\n\n**Etymological information on \"Damascus\" steel:**\n\nUtsa / Wootz (sanskrit - and mistranslated sanskrit), Urukku (Tamil), Pulad (Persian), Fuladh (Arabic), Bulat (Russian), Polat (Turkish) and Bintie (Chinese) are all names for ultra-high carbon crucible steel typified by carbide segregation, which can be otherwise referred to as \"crucible damascus steel\". The modern term “wootz” first appears around 1794 in writings by Sir Joseph Banks, who mistranslated Sanskrit for “utsa” as “wootz” (Dube, 2014). In the regions where crucible steel was made, and where it was forged into blades, it was not called \"damascus\". This name is primarily a medieval name, and primarily used in Europe.\n\nThe origin of the name \"Damascus\" steel is contentious - The Islamic writers al-Kindi (full name Abu Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi) (circa 800 AD - 873 AD) and al-Beruni (full name Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni) (circa 973 AD - 1048 AD) were both scholars who wrote about swords and steel made for swords, based on their surface appearance, geographical location of production or forging, or the name of the smith.\n\nThere are three potential sources for the term \"Damascus\" in the context of steel.\n\nThe word \"Damas\" stems from the root word for \"water\" (\"ma\") or \"broiling\" in Arabic (Sachse, 1994, 13) and Damascus blades are often described as exhibiting a water-pattern on their surface, and are referred to as \"watered steel\" not only in English but in other languages. Note, the video mis-speaks or mis-titled this, saying it was \"\"Danas\", at 6:55.\n\nThe second theory is geographical, as Al-Kindi called swords produced and forged in Damascus as Damascene (al-Hassan, 1978, 35) but it's worth noting that crucible steel blades were made in many nations, and crucible steel is not known to have ever been produced in the city of Damascus. Al Kindi also describes crucible steel production using the typical term Pulad, distinct from these damascene swords, indicating that the two types are separate. It is also worth noting that Al-Kindi did not describe these swords as having pattern forming steel. While the city is mentioned around 6:45, no elaboration to the validity of this attribution given the background information is made\n\nThird, Beiruni mentions a sword-smith called Damasqui who made swords of crucible steel (Said, 1989, 219-220). In a similar fashion, Al-Kindi mentions swords called “Zaydiya which were forged by a man called Zayd, and hence they were attributed to his name\". We therefore have a precedent for naming swords based on their makers, which may explain how \"Damascus\" came about. This is mentioned around 6:55, but with no clarification.\n\nIt is my opinion that the \"watered\" hypothesis is most likely for the origin, though the popularisation of the term may have indeed occurred due to western travellers who purchased the swords in damascus, and described them thusly, as it was a massive center for trade.\n\nIn the video, each explanation is essentially given the same level of plausibility, despite the Damasqui explanation being weak, and the Damascus City explanation being inaccurate given how many places made crucible steel.\n\n**How Crucible steel gets its pattern:**\n\nAt 9:20, the narrator makes the claim that we do not know every single detail or the process of making this patterned form of crucible steel. I would contend that we do.Crucible steel, as the name implies, is made in a crucible process, and requires completely liquefication of the crucible charge.\n\nMost surviving \"recipes\" for crucible steel call for either a combination of bloomery iron, and cast iron, or the use of bloomery iron and organic carbon sources (like plant leaves) - but crucible steel recipes included other elements, like organic material - rice husks, leaves, bark - as well as shells, glass, and even silver. The trace impurities in the iron used, and in these additives, are key to the patterns they show after forging.\n\nIn order to form patterns, carbide forming alloying elements like vanadium, tungsten or manganese are necessary in small amounts, with vanadium being the most common historical alloying element. These carbide formers cause the segregation of hard cementite carbides, which form the \"white streaks\" in crucible steel.\n\nThe segregation of CFEs into interdendritic reasons is due to the differences in solidification temperature between high CFE and low CFE steel, with low CFE steel solidifying at a higher temperature than high CFE steel. This causes the low CFE steel to solidify first when the ingot is slowly cooled, and it does so by branching out into dendrities of relatively pure iron, while the impurities such as phosphorus, CFEs and sulfur get pushed into the regions between these branches.\n\n[Dendritic structures visible on freshly made crucible ingot - image credit Peter Burt.](https://i.imgur.com/m7btnxv.jpeg)\n\nDuring the forging of the crucible steel \"puck\", these carbide formers are pushed into parallel, layered sheets in the microstructure of the steel (Verhoeven et al, 1998).\n\n[Parallel cluster sheets.](https://i.redd.it/gi70lojz3e591.gif)\n\nBecause vanadium and other CFEs do not readily dissolve at forging temperatures and do not rapidly migrate at forging temperatures, these sheets of carbide formers form distinct bands in the steel. As the steel is thermally cycled, carbides aggregate onto the CFEs via ostwald ripening, and form spheroids of cementite. The interdendritic regions without CFEs form as pearlite, a soft two-phase mixture of carbides, or sorbite, and imperfect form of pearlite. This is diagnostic of historical crucible steel (Verhoeven et al 2018, Feuerbach 2002, Feuerbach 2006).\n\nIt is worth noting that vanadium is not the only effective carbide former found in historical crucible steel blades, and other carbide formers like manganese are seen in historical examples - or even chromium as seen in Chahak, Iran (Alipour et al 2021). Additionally, the other microalloying elements in the steel can effect the contrast and spacing of the pattern, with phosporus notably increasing the contrast of the pattern after etching (Khorasani and Hynninen, 2013). The narrator does not mention this - but it is important to know.\n\n** A brief note on the claim **carbon nanotubes** exist in crucible steel: **\n\nAround 8:00 in the video, the narrator discusses the carbon nanotube hypothesis, that crucible steel is full of carbon nanotubes due to the use of plant biomass in its production. Not only does this ignore the co-fusion process detailed earlier which does not use plant biomass, but it is also contentious. The narrator says at 8:10 that in a paper published in nature, carbon nanotubes were found, but there's an issue.\n\nThe only articles that \"found\" carbon nanotubes was published as a brief communication to Nature, i.e not a not a full article, not really a paper. Just a correspondence. This was in 2006, and was only a few pages in length.\n\nIt later found its away into a conference paper by the same authors, still not a full length peer reviewed research article. This was 2 pages in length. These findings should be considered preliminary.\n\nThe method used (dissolving crucible steel in acid and seeing what remains) revealed stands of carbon, but carbon dissolves VERY readily into steel. Crucible steel is typified by cementite spheroids, which often stretch into rods during forging as they are deformed. If you dissolve cementite in acid, removing the iron component, you are left with carbon.\n\nThis does not mean there was an intact carbon nanotube in the core of the cementite rod - and even if it DID mean that, it would have negligible impact on performance because it is \\*encased\\* in cementite, which itself is in a soft matrix of pearlite or sorbite.\n\nBut don't take my word for it. Other academics, including those who have been instrumental in understanding crucible steel (namely John Verhoeven) doubt the findings.\n\n\" John Verhoeven, of Iowa State University in Ames, suggests Paufler is seeing something else. Cementite can itself exist as rods, he notes, so there might not be any carbon nanotubes in the rod-like structure.\"\n\n\"Another potential problem is that TEM equipment sometimes contains nanotubes, says physicist Alex Zettl of the University of California\"\n\n[https://www.nature.com/news/2006/061113/full/news061113-11.html](https://www.nature.com/news/2006/061113/full/news061113-11.html)\n\n**Historical perspectives on Crucible Damascus Steel quality:**\n\nRegarding the historical reputation of historical crucible steel swords: they were always very expensive, very desirable, and very well thought of - and at 7:00 in the video, some of the historical hype for them is mentioned - HOWEVER - there are accounts from the 14th century of cold-short blades (high in phosphorus) which claims that crucible steel swords are prone to breakage in cold weather - these shortcoming are not mentioned.\n\nThe exact quote is by Alī ibn ʻAbd al-Raḥmān Ibn Hudhayl, translated:\n\n>\"the Hindy sabre often breaks when the weather is cold and shows itself better when the weather is warm”\n\nDespite this, they were very valued. Mohammad ibn Abi al-Barakāt Jŏhari Nezāmi in 1196 CE states a good shamshir blade of crucible steel was valued at 100 golden Dinar (Khorasani et al, 2013).\n\nAl-Idrisi (Full name Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Idris al-Idrisi - circa 1100CE - 1166CE) claimed that \"*nothing could surpass*\" the edge of a crucible steel sword.\n\nBertrandon de la Brocquiere, a Frenchman, wrote about his travels to the Middle East in 1432CE–1433CE. He wrote:\n\n>\"Damascus blades are the handsomest and best of all Syria... I have nowhere seen swords cut so excellently. They are made at Damascus, and in the adjoining country.\"\n\nNote: This is potentially the source of the (incorrect but often repeated) claim that crucible steel swords were made in Damascus.\n\nIn the early 1600's, Polish king Zygmunt III Waza ordered a Armenian merchant (Sefer Muratowicz) to purchase a number of watered steel blades from Isfahan, Persia due to their value and reputation (Muratovich et al, 1777). On this same journey, the merchant purchased carpets embroidered with the royal coat of arms, which still survive today.\n\nRegardless of the reputation crucible steel enjoyed in its' day, the reality is that it was by nature very clean, with minimal slag - which made it less likely to break due to inclusions - and there is a lot of variation in the metallurgical composition of this steel. Some have higher carbon, or more phosphorus, and the quality varied. Heat treatment also widely varied.\n\nCompared to bloomery steel which was folded and consolidated, it's more uniform and much lower in slag - the term for non-metallic inclusions. The same is true of refined blast furnace steel, which also requires forge consolidation after finishing the finery process.\n\n[Microstructure of a Japanese Katana, 2% Nital etch. Note the presence slag inclusions (black) within the mostly martensitic steel. Image credit George Vander Voort](https://i.imgur.com/vjf8LNg.jpg)\n\nCrucible steel can be more brittle, depending on the heat treatment, phosphorus, and sulfur contents, or it can be much more flexible. It depends on the exact sword being analysed, as crucible steel was produced for around 2 millennia and in many places. For example, some accounts of crucible steel swords being able to be bent 90 degrees exist, however these can easily be countered with extant examples that take a set no matter the degree of bending.\n\n**Production methods:**\n\nHere are 4 different processes, which were recorded from at early as Al Kindi, to as late as 1841CE with Massalski - from the Deccani process used in Hyderabad, to the south Indian process, and the Isfahan process, and the Bukhara process.\n\nThere are more processes out there, I just haven't gotten around to writing them out.\n\n**Bukhara:**\n\n>3 parts clean iron, 1 part cast iron. Place in a crucible that is five times as tall as it the base is wide, with a mouth three times the size of the base. The weight of iron should be 2-2.5kg.\n\n>Using a charcoal melting furnace with air venting holes, heat until melted (6 hours) or until a bubbling sound can be heard from the crucible. once bubbling stops, remove the lid of the crucible and add 0.013-0.017 grams of silver to the crucible and stir with a metal rod. reseal the crucible, seal all holes in the furnace, and allow to cool over 3 days.\n\n>Remove the puck from the crucible, and polish one corner of it to check if the watered pattern is good. If the pattern is poor, reheat to a red heat and hold for seven minutes before allowing to cool in air.\n\n>Forge into a bar using the top of the button to form the spine of the blade, and never heating above red.\n\n**South Indian:**\n\n>In a clay crucible of conical form (200mm height x 50mm diameter) add 250-500 grams of bloomery iron, as well as wood chips, rice husks, vines or leaves. Seal the crucible with a clay lid, leaving a vent hole. Allow to fully dry\n\n>Using a bellow-fed charcoal forge, heat for 6 hours or until molten. allow the crucible to cool in the forge (some sources say to quench it in water).\n\n>The button will have a striated appearance if everything was done correctly.\n\n**Deccani (Hyderabad) Process:**\n\n>Using a mixture of iron sand derived iron ore, and iron clay derived iron (mirtpalli and kondapur iron), place in a crucible with glass, sealed with clay with a vent hole. Place in a bellow powered charcoal furnace for 24 hours. The steel will melt within the first 3. After 24 hours, remove crucible and allow to cool in the air.\n\n>Once cool, remove the buttons and cover each in clay, and anneal in a conventional forge for 12-16 hours. repeat this annealing process until the button is no longer brittle.\n\n**Isfahan Process:**\n\n>To a crucible, add 10% casi auriculata wood, and asclepias gigantean leaves with two parts pure iron, one part cast iron, and three parts silicate-rich iron ore up to a total weight of 200 grams.\n\n>10-1200 of these small crucibles are heated at a time in a kiln operated with charcoal and bellows for 6 days, before the crucibles are broken open, and the buttons removed.\n\n>The buttons are then transferred into a \"hot room\" to anneal and temper for 2 days so they do not shatter from cooling too quickly.\n\nAuthors note: I suspect that if this room is a furnace-heated compartment, and is hot enough, they also experience some level of rim decarburisation, as well as converting the microstructure of the puck to a more forgeable state compared to steel which has not been roasted.\n\n\\*References\\*\n\nAlipour, R., Rehren, T., Martinón-Torres, M. \"Chromium crucible steel was first made in Persia\", Journal of Archaeological Science, Vol. 127, 2021,\n\nAl-Hassan, A.Y., 1978, Iron and Steel Technology in Medieval Arabic Sources, Journal for the History of Arabic Science 2: 1,31-43\n\nAnosov, P.P.

That was the \"secret\" of the legendary \"Toledo swords\" of Spain, and the near-mythical properties associated with Japanese katanas.\n\nOnce the ores were exhausted, the techniques used to produce that particular type of steel were \"lost\", because they didn't work as well with other types of iron ores, until metallurgists determined how to add the silicon back in with adjuncts such as sand, crystalline quartz, glass, or other silicon-rich materials during the smelting and refining process; at which point it was \"rediscovered\".",

    "body": "I used to do these 101s months ago. Kaolin is heavily misused by most people in pubs. I have been playing him exclusively since his release in Dota 2. The following pointers may help!\n\nKaolin is a hero that has a bit of everything. A ranged nuke/silence, a push ability, a AS/MS slow, a stun, a AOE dps ulti that can be refreshed multiple times etc. Its quite complicated and he's got a lot of  utlility that will take a lot of times to master but there are a few basically.\n\n**Laning**\n\n* Kaolin works in any lane that gives him levels. He's not the best ganker but has very good rune control with his boulder roll. Hence, while he can perform as an alright mid, he is better off in the offlane. \n\n* Offlaning Kaolin is straightforward. You use your Boulder Smash to get last hits and harass from a distance. If you are going to walk in to get a last hits always put a stone remnant within 800 range of urself. This is your backup remnant for you to rollaway if they jump on you.\n\n* Skill Build: Start off with 1/1/1. Then, max Boulder smash(Q) followed by the Geomagnetic Grip(E) and Ultimate whenever its up. \n\n* Justification: While the Boulder roll helps you chase it is very dangerous to use. Miss and your horribly out of position. It also puts you in the middle of multiple enemy heroes. It only scales with reducing cooldowns while the other two increase damage range and stun duration.\n\n* Combos: There are 2 main combos to use with Kaolin, the first available and level 3 when you have a 1/1/1 build. \nCombo 1: - Lane Killer combo\nStep1: Summon remnant behind enemy and Grip(E) it for a 1 second stun. \nStep 2: Boulder roll directly into the enemy for the damage and slow\nStep 3: You will find yourself behind the enemy after the roll. Use boulder smash to push him towards your tower.\n\nCombo 2: - Teamfight initiation combo\nStep 1: Summon a remnant in front of you and boulder smash it into a bunch of enemies. They are all silenced for 5 seconds.\nStep 2: Summon another remnant and roll in\nStep 3: Magnetise as soon as you get there\nStep 4: Pull in the first remnant you pushed to stun multiple enemies\n\nCombo 2 is best done after getting forcestaff. As a rule, never rule into multiple enemies unless you can get out fast or have your team-mates back you up.\n\nCombo 3: Ranged Nukage \nA stone remnant can be smashed 2000 range away. Use it to counterpush and threaten inititation.\n\n**About Magnestise**\n\nMagnetise is a deceptively powerful ultimate for both ganking and teamfighting. It is a bit confusing so let me explain it here.\n\n* On activation, it applies a DoT debuff on all enemies within 300 radius of Kaolin. This is a tiny AOE, think Omniknight Degen Aura AOE. \n\n* If there are 3 enemies affected by Magnetise and you silence/slow one of them with boulder smash/roll, the silence/slow debuff will be transferred to ALL enemies -> this effect is very underappreciated but it truly decimates teamfights. \n\n* If an enemy already affected by magnetise walks within 300 range of a stone remnant, it will emanate the Magnetise debuff to all enemies within 600 range. In addition, an enemy already affected with Magnetise will have his debuff duration refreshed.\n \n* When you play Kaolin, you realize you will be wrecking teamfights IF you stay alive after Magnestise. If you initiated with Combo 2 and die immediately after magnestise is nothing much. If you stay alive, you will be contributing multi hero silences, slows and a hell lot of DPS throughout the rest of the fight. Hence why I recommend only rolling in to initiate after getting a forcestaff or some other way to escape.\n\n* Magnetise lets you solo kill a lot of heroes whenever its up by using it with combo 1. After getting the initial debuff off, summon remnant on top of fleeing heroes to guarantee their demise. \n\n\n**Other pointers**\n\n* When offlaning, boulder smash your ranged creep to last hit. This will kill the ranged creep early and allow the creep wave to come towards you.\n\n* Boulder Smash a Tide/ES/Magnus in to allow them to get a good ulti off. \n\n* Geomagnetic Grip an allied hero getting chased. The range is insane and lets you get mana saves off. A great tactic would be to Grip the ally, force staff him and then boulder roll yourself away.\n\n* Geomagnestic Grip a batrider who used Lasso. The lasso-ed enemy hero will be pulled along.\n\n* You can perform actions while Boulder rolling. This includes all your active abilities and items. Try a Shiva's Guard. \n\n* You can place a remnant while boulder rolling. Hence initate the roll and then simply put the remnant in front of you to reduce wasted casting time, especially important for escapes\n\n* A bit obvious but Boulder roll lets you fly past unpathable cliffs\n\n\nThat's it for now, hope this helps!\n\n**Itemization**\n\n* Earth spirit is item independant. \n\n* Choice of boots: Arcane most of the time. He isn't much of a right clicker but he can benefit a lot from mana.\n\n* Positioning items: Force staff > Blink Dagger. Blink Dagger lets you do blink and push back a hero the same way magnus does a blink skewer back though. You can always buy both!\n\n* Disabling items: Rod of atos/Eul's\n\nAny item actly works with Earth because he doesn't really need anything but a little bit of mana in the early game.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbKog8RFt4\nAll credits to creator of video\n**Reserved to compile further tips from comments**\n\n",

Miss and your horribly out of position. It also puts you in the middle of multiple enemy heroes. It only scales with reducing cooldowns while the other two increase damage range and stun duration.\n\nI disagree with this. After the 4/1/1, I find the cooldown reduction on W to be far more powerful than the stun duration, at least at the relevant levels (8-10). You become far more mobile, and you don't lose much in terms of team fight and ganking due to the constant slow on W. It also propagates on Magnetize, unlike grip.\n\n>Magnetise does not work on creeps.\n\nThis is just plain wrong. Not only does it apply to creeps, but creeps can proc Stone Remnants. There's full functionality on creeps.\n\n>When offlaning, boulder smash your ranged creep to last hit. This will kill the ranged creep early and allow the creep wave to come towards you.\n\nI tested this a bit and it didn't seem to work as said. Sometimes my range creep would be killed quickly by enemy creeps, sometimes he wouldn't. In any case, the extra AoE damage from punching him in seemed to negate any benefit of his instant demise. Correct me if I'm not understanding this correctly.\n\n>A great tactic would be to Grip the ally, force staff him and then boulder roll yourself away.\n\nWhile I agree that this is a good way to get away, I suggest punching them forward instead of forcing. It's item-independent and saves your force cooldown for something more important. Pull works in the same way that Pudge's hook does, it pulls the target to the position you were at when you casted it. This means you can cast it then immediate place yourself to punch your ally in the best direction when they get to you.\n\n>If you are going to walk in to get a last hits always put a stone remnant within 800 range of urself.\n \nThis contradicts this:\n\n>You can place a remnant while boulder rolling.\n \nThe only time that pre-emptively placing boulders is useful is if you are going to blow more than 6 rocks in the immediate future and want to put some down so you can begin regening them. This situation is pretty rare, and even rarer in the laning stage. I'd say it's better to place them when you need them rather than limiting yourself in the future.\n\n>If you combo a Remnant with Boulder Roll, it will go a total distance of 1600. Hence there is no need to place the remnant 800 range away, put it near you so that you can roll multiple angles.\n\nThis is wrong. I'm not sure if it is intended like this, but a Boulder Roll will always end 1600 units away from the point that the remnant is consumed, not from where the roll started. You will get more distance if you place your remnant 800 units away when rolling, though that's not always a good thing.\n\nOther than that everything else seems spot on.\n\nAnother weird thing: you can punch your remnant while you roll into it. You will consume the remnant for your roll, but you will also punch the remnant for the silence. It seems kind of situational as you're putting all your eggs into one basket, but it seems like it could be devastating if you hit it with your Magnetize active (especially if you place the remnant to also refresh the Magnetize).\n\nSorry about the formatting.

        "body": "The smash tip to lasthit & control lane is pretty clever, I only ever thought to use grip because of its higher base damage.\n\nSome other things I've noticed:\n\n- Force staffing yourself while rolling appears to behave weirdly. If you force staff yourself during the windup, you can jump past remnants and enemies without striking or boosting off them. \n- If you force staff mid-roll, the roll will visibly break and you'll 'revert' to the force staff's 600-unit push. However, if you impact anyone during that 600 unit push, you'll be positioned behind them (and the slow applied, if applicable) as normal.\n- The gist of the above is that, basically, you can use your force staff for big plays, or just as easily ruin your escape if you're not careful.\n- It's also worth noting the 6.79 change to the way manipulating remnants works. If you want to manipulate a remnant, you have to click within 180 units of where it is, and you'll work with whatever was closest to your cursor. If you want to manipulate an ally or enemy unit, you have to click *directly on them*.\n- Urn has great synergy with Magnetize. It'll add 150 damage on top of 300/450/600 from Magnetize, assuming you don't refresh it.\n\nHero-specific tips:\n\n- **Clockwork.** You can grip an ally out of his cogs, or smash him out if he hooks in on you, or you can save him if he's an ally. Overall you're one of the heroes that can just ruin his day.\n- **Enigma.** You can grip an allied Enigma to safety while he channels Black Hole without interrupting it. You can drag allies out of Black Hole and they'll lose the disable on leaving the radius; if they impact Enigma on their way out, they'll stun him out of it if he isn't BKB'd.\n- **Crystal Maiden** can also be gripped mid-ultimate without breaking it. However, the damage and AoE slow goes with her. The frosted ground FX will remain at her original position; the falling crystals and the debuff will follow her.\n- **Rubick.** Gripping or punting an allied unit lifted by Telekinesis will cause the unit to be immediately dropped before the regular movement takes place. Rubick can manipulate Kaolin's remnants if he steals his spells.\n- **Pudge.** Allies can be gripped/punted while Dismembered, but if it doesn't stun him, they will continue to take damage and be disabled for the duration. There are no special grip + hook shenanigans.\n- **All allies** can cast spells while gripped, but can't seem to cast them while punted (though the timing is pretty tight). Stuns or forms of forced movement (force staff, swap, etc.) immediately break grip's momentum.",

He got me out of my 13 loss in a row streak [and I've been doing quite well actually.](http://i.imgur.com/7cyI5z2.jpg)\n\nAfter playing him a bit I think 4-1-1 -> 4-1-2 -> 4-4-2 is the way I like building the hero. Stun at lvl 1 is too low but I can't justify ignoring rock.\n\nI've seen other people play him. The play styles seem to vary a lot from player to player. I find myself using few rocks in the laning phase, but others like filling the place with them. Some like rolling in and using ult but I tend to sit back and throw silences while saving people.\n\nHis ult I still gotta get used to. When I'm 6~ I use it and get kills but as the game goes on I just die if I go too deep, forcestaff or not. \n\nFor items I don't modify my build too much atm because I wanna learn how to play him well first. I saw Draskyl build Drums and Eul's and after giving it a try it was good enough.\n\nAs the game goes on, though, you pretty much have unlimited mana and the only thing you lack is HP regen. I'm thinking of bottle, vangard, tranquils, etc. Still got to try the different combinations.\n\nAbout the lanes, all I can say is that mid looks nice but I've only gone mid once with him. I first blooded OD and he left the game 1 min later. I also solo'd offlane once and it was pretty fun but... The real fun of the hero is dual laning the offlane and fucking the enemy carry over. Unless it's one of those heroes who win the lane no matter what, you'll have a fun time and a lot of action.\n\nThis wall of text sucks. Sorry.",

It's a little weird, but since you're not getting farm you won't really be able to afford multiple huge items. Wand and bottle get you that mana and regen you need right before a fight, treads and vanguard for the extra tankiness. You could possibly do like a RoB or something instead of bottle to get mana regen, I only find myself with mana issues in the early game if managed poorly.\n\n\nAs for skills, I prioritize Q last, but I don't quite go 1-4-4. I end up doing like 1-1-1, to 1-1-2, to 1-2-2, and then leveling up based on what I need. Reducing cooldowns on all your abilities just helps so much. The extra stun duration makes your initiations and teamfights that much more useful. Rolling is always really good, but you don't really need 4 second cooldown that quickly to max it out first.",

This way, the enemy is stunned where you are rolling giving no chance to miss at level 3 and setting up for an easy push back. It makes the combo much easier during landing phases.\n\nThere are also similar things with this idea where you roll, place remnant behind before the roll starts, pull and kick the remnant while rolling through it.\n\nOne tip with the ulti that you didn't mention is that placing a remnant in a 300 radius around your hero before activating ulti will then cause it to explode in a 600 radius around the remnant (correct me if I'm wrong). This makes positioning yourself in the center not as big of a deal as you can roll in, hit a hero on the edge, place a remnant in the center of the enemy team, then ulti.\n\nI actually agree with the skill build you suggested. I first thought roll was more useful to have every 4 seconds but honestly, rolling once is all that is necessary in ganks and early team fights and the extra stun time helps your team setup ganks easier in my opinion.\n\nEdit: typed on my phone so a few errors",

    "body": "When I heard about this new product line the other day, I decided to look at all the products and their formulations via SkinCarisma to see whether anything looked worth trying. A few products seemed promising, while others seemed... not so much. I thought since I'd already done all the work, I'd share my findings here!\n\nIn order approximately from most to least promising:\n\nBlemish Control Spot Treatment, 5.5% Benzoyl Peroxide\n\n- **fungal acne safe!**\n- 5.5% is a higher concentration that necessary but shouldn't be too irritating\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both near end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (at end of ingred. list)\n- some nice **moisturizing** ingredients, including a good amount of squalane\n\nVitamin C Moisturizer\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 8th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (14th ingred.)\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane, lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- small amounts of cassia and green tea\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- advertises inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is last ingredient\n\nDark Spot Solution Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: polysorbate 20 (8th ingred.)\n- **niacinimide** is 2nd ingredient! brightening and anti-aging properties\n- advertises its inclusion of plankton extract but is 24th ingredient (also not much evidence that plankton extract does anything for skin besides moisturizing)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract  (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (last ingred.), citric acid (15th ingred.)\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- possible **allergen**: benzoyl alcohol\n- contains a lot of **silicones**\n\nRetinol Vitamin A Refining Moisturizer\n\n- amount of retinol isn't specified, but is placed 25th on ingredient list (you only need small amounts, 0.01% or more, to be effective, but need 0.5% or more for dramatic effects)\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.), polysorbate 20 (24th), cetyl palmitate (26th) \n- **retinol** has anti-acne, brightening, and anti-aging properties\n- other **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.), ceramide 3 (27th ingred.)\n- tons of aloe juice, good amount of squalane\n- small amounts of green tea and cassia\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- specifically advertises its inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is 26th (second last) on ingred. list\n\nOil-Free SPF 50 Moisturizing Sunscreen\n\n- broad spectrum\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl stearate (2nd ingredient), isopropyl palmitate (7th), PEG-100 stearate (8th)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.)\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: isopropyl palmitate (7th ingred.)\n- pretty small tube, only 50 mL\n\nFerulic Acid + Vitamins C and E Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for its vit C so is not a dupe for SkinCeuticals, but should still be effective\n- amounts of main ingredients not specified, however, vit C is the 5th ingredient, ferulic is 10th, vit E is 18th (second to last)\n- **brightening** ingredients: SAP\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E, citric acid, ferulic acid\n- citric acid (8th ingredient) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingredient)\n\nBio-Complex Moisturizer for Dry Skin\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- claim to have a \"high level\" of hyaluronic acid, and contains 2 kinds, but they're only 21st and 22nd on ingredient list\n- also super unclear on what their \"bio-moist complex\" is but if it comprises 20% of the product it must just be like, aloe and water and glycerin\n- but yeah, tons of aloe and glycerin, good amount of squalane, some other **moisturizing** ingredients, moderate amount of green tea extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (14th ingred.), vitamin E (23rd)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n\nVitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 5th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (13th ingred.), citric acid (10th)\n- contains **denatured alcohol** (3rd ingred.)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingred.)\n- HA is in the name and yet it's the last ingredient\n\nCharcoal Balancing Mask\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: PEG-100 stearate (9th ingred.), stearic acid (10th), glyceryl stearate (12th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- not sure how much charcoal is needed to be effective, but there may be a deceptively small amount in this, as it's the 16th ingredient and the product contains as much or more iron oxide as a colouring agent. also it lists \"charcoal powder\" and NOT \"activated charcoal powder\" so it may just be all-around useless.\n- advertises its use of hyaluronic acid yet it's the last ingredient \n- main mask component is **kaolin** clay (3rd ingred.)\n- 2 kinds of vitamin E (17th and 24th ingredients)\n- lots of aloe and some glycerin but not many other soothing or moisturizing ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: stearic acid (10th ingred.)\n\nHydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: contains polysorbate 80\n- claims to have 5 types of HA but I only counted 3: sodium hyaluronate, hydrolized HA, sodium acetylated hyaluronate (and they're all 18th or later in the ingredient list)\n- contains a TON of **silicone**, which seems like a poor choice to me, as HA should generally be applied earlier on in your routine and all that silicone will interfere with absorption of subsequent layers\n- no other notable or helpful ingredients, just a few **moisturizing** things like glycerin\n- more of a gel texture than a serum\n\nTriple-Peptide Eye Cream\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: stearic acid (3rd ingred.), glycol distearate (4th), shea butter (5th), ethylhexyl palmitate (8th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- peptides are last ingredient\n- contains ascorbic acid (vitamin C) but is 18th ingredient and what little benefit that amount gives will deteriorate due to air exposure from jar packaging\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane and caffeine\n- small amounts of green tea and green algae extract\n- 5 potential **comedogens** but this likely won't matter for the eye region\n- if you look up this product on Amazon to examine yourself, note that the copyable list of ingredients in the Important Information section is actually the ingredient list for the Retinol Moisturizer, so use the ingredients listed in the product images\n\nHydrating Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.), pomegranate seed oil (14th), coconut oil (15th), olive fruit oil (16th), argan oil (17th), jojoba oil (18th), babassu seed oil (20th), moringa seed oil (21st), crambe seed oil (23rd)\n- 2 potential **comedogens**: coconut oil (15th ingred.), avocado oil (19th)\n- in addition to above listed plant oils, also contains chia seed oil, the only non-problematic one lol\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin E (12th)\n- citric acid and benzoic acid (6th ingred.) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- **surfectants** used: decyl glucoside and glyceryl oleate\n\nOil-Free Micellar Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.)\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin

In the US, ingredients in concentrations of 1% or lower can be listed in whatever order the manufacturer wants to use. You can sometimes tell where that <1% begins if the product contains phenoxyethanol, because that's approved for use in concentrations of up to 1% -- meaning things *after* that are either at 1% or under.\n\n(Also, 1% HA isn't unusual, nor is it necessarily ineffective; it's normally used at/in concentrations of 0.2-2%. TO often uses 2% because of their unofficial \"more is **always** better\" philosophy [looking at you, 10% niacinamide serum], but <2% can be beneficial, too!)\n\nThat said, you'd think there'd be little reason for Amazon to list a \"banner\" ingredient at the very end when/if they have the option to list it earlier/higher.",

This means that you can replace a shield on an ally to detonate it on demand for the damage.\n* Abaddon's cast animations are long and the cast range on Aphotic Shield is garbage. If you're pushing/defending with your team and you're worried about enemy initiation, try casting and canceling Aphotic Shield on your team's highest priority hero. Not only will this constantly keep you in range to cast the shield, but if you've got beastly reactions you can almost instantly wipe off any disable.\n* If you get attacked by a hero while you have Aphotic Shield on, the game still acts like you've taken damage from that hero. This means that salves, clarities, bottle, Urn, Blink Dagger, Recall, and sleeps all get canceled.\n* You don't need to actually complete an attack to get the Curse of Avernus buff. During chases or escapes, you can animation cancel an attack on a neutral or a creep to give yourself a free 15% move speed bonus without having to wait through Abaddon's full attack animation. If you have Tranquils this is doubly important since it allows you to get the move speed buff without breaking your boots.\n* Curse of Avernus works on towers. Why doesn't Caustic Finale work on towers? That'd be sweet.\n* Aphotic Shield doesn't absorb any damage during Borrowed Time, all of it goes to healing.\n* There are very few situations in which you want to manually activate Borrowed Time pre-Agh, but it can be useful if you need to disjoint a projectile like a stun.\n* The self-damage taken from Armlet can heal you under Borrowed Time. This is a bug.\n* Abaddon's a great aura slut since most teams rarely want to waste the time necessary to kill him in a fight.\n\n*Versus*\n\n* The burst damage radius on Aphotic Shield is pretty huge (675).\n* If you have a nuke that does >400 damage, you can instakill Abaddon without Borrowed Time ever triggering.\n* If you don't trust your team, Eul's is a great Abaddon counter since it can waste 2.5s of Borrowed Time.\n* AA's Ice Blast prevents Abaddon from healing during Borrowed Time.\n\n**Bristleback**\n\n* If you're against heroes with global skills (AA, Invoker, Zeus), be sure to face in the inside of your Fountain when healing to take advantage of Bristolback.\n* Bristleback damage reduction does *not* work on towers.\n* Spam spells to keep Warpath stacks up when roaming around the map if you have the mana regen to support it.\n* Spam Quills in the fountain before TPing out to charge up Warpath stacks.\n* A highly effective hero to take advantage of stacked ancients with. By the time you get a Vanguard you should be able to take a three stack of ancients literally without even looking.\n* Bristle is tied for the fastest turn rate in the game. If you're laning against a ranged hero with a slow projectile, you should absolutely take advantage of this by gracefully pirouetting before every right click harass attempt.\n\n*Versus*\n\n* Bristleback damage reduction is calculated based on his orientation to the hero [who *owns* the source of damage he's taking.](http://a.pomf.se/frjjyf.webm) Summons deal damage based on their own position, not the hero who summoned them.\n* Magic Wand is core against this guy ALL GAME LONG. Unlike other heroes who stop spamming once the laning phase ends like Batrider or Zeus, Bristle needs to mash his spells for the whole game. No matter what role you're playing, you should always get a wand or a stick.\n* Quill Spray is physical damage, so if you get a Ghost Scepter this guy can't do anything except wipe his nose on you.\n* Quill Spray is *not* reduced by damage block, so building a Crimson Guard against Bristleback won't help you as much as you'd hope.\n* You can purge Goo stacks (Manta, Eul's, Diffusal).\n* Bristle is all about whittling down your armor and barraging you with physical damage. Stacking armor helps mitigate his damage output (Shiva's, AC, even a Basi ring is good).\n* Hexes disable the Quill Spray passive from Bristleback, but they do *not* disable the damage reduction passive. The only way to completely shut off this skill is with Agh Doom.\n* Razor makes Bristleback's life incredibly hard. Bristle can't go on Razor thanks to Unstable Current slowing him every time he casts Goo and Bristle has no easy way to stop Razor from slurping up his damage with Static Link.\n\n**Earth Spirit**\n\n* You can drop a Remnant right in front of your Boulder while you're revving up.\n* You can use items while Rolling (except Blink). This is mainly useful for TPs, Shiva's, Sheepstick/Orchid, and wards. If you use a Force Staff while it's revving up, you'll get the Force and continue rolling. If you use Force while rolling, you'll get the Force but the Boulder will break apart.\n* You can pick up runes while Rolling.\n* You can use/target spells while you're in your Boulder. This means that you can Smash an ally while you're rolling into them or do a drive-by Gripping.\n* When you hit an enemy hero with Rolling Boulder you'll always appear behind them and at the same angle from which you approached them. You can target your Smash on them while Rolling and you'll immediately kick them back along the path you came.\n* Rolling Boulder destroys trees along the path that you roll.\n* Neither Smash nor Grip can interrupt ally or enemy channels.\n* Reduce, reuse, recycle. Use the same Remnant you just Gripped to Roll into. Smash a Remnant into an enemy then spam Grip to catch it while it's still moving.\n* Fuckin Magnetize, how does it work? The trickiest part about using Magnetize effectively is getting it started. The initial Magnetize radius is a tiny AoE around Earth Spirit himself. But once you get it cracking on one unit, then the good times can start to roll. Use Force Staff or Boulder Smash to manipulate the Magnetized unit's position to get closer to other heroes, then cast a Remnant near it.\n* The trigger radius on a Remnant from a magnetized unit is larger than the activation/refresh radius to Magnetize new enemies, so place fresh Remnants closer to un-Magnetized enemies.\n* The Magnetize DoT lasts for 6 seconds on an enemy. Space out re-Magnetizations to squeeze out the most damage.\n* Earth Spirit only has a 57.70% winrate once he gets Agh. I find that highly surprising. On paper, the fact that you can Enchant an enemy, Grip them in, then kick them back 2000 units away seems like game winning initiation power during T3 pushes or defenses. The biggest bottleneck in this combo is the fact that Enchant Remnant's range is only 600.\n* Unfortunately, all the top Dotabuff Earth Spirit players seem to mainly use this item to fuck with teammates by punting them into the enemy fountain when the game's over, so I have no idea how good it really is. I'm serious, I watched like 30 replays (high ranked ES's rarely build Agh… but they do build Veil a lot) and they either: Used Enchant purely defensively to get allies out of trouble, Enchanted an enemy hero and then completely ignored them, Enchanted an enemy then promptly Rolled into them (which ends the Enchantment), or just not use the spell at all. The closest anyone got was Enchanting and Gripping an enemy, but then proceeding to skillshot the Smash. You don't need to skillshot it. They're considered a Remnant.\n\n*Versus*\n\n* Kaolin Showdown isn't invulnerable inside the Rolling Boulder. He's fully targeted and can be stunned and damaged as per usual.\n* Magnetize deals some substantial amounts of hurt. Don't stand next to your team if you're Magnetized and they're not.\n\n**Elder Titan**\n\n* Tower shots or creep attacks won't wake enemies up from Echo Stomp.\n* Don't start wailing on an enemy as soon as you land the Sleep. Get a better position, let your team get into a better position, then go to town.\n* Cast Echo Stomp when the Spirit is on its way back home. I don't understand why so few ET players take advantage of this. Cast the Spirit, step on some fools, then have it walk down the lane so the enemy team will forget about it. Then when it's on the way back, cast Echo Stomp and your Spirit's hips will start moving on their own~. Since the Spirit returns at 600 move speed, players won't always react quick enough to dodge it.\n* The Spirit walks around as fast as ET at the time of casting. This means that a Surged ET will have a Surge-speed Spirit. Active Phase Boots won't speed the Spirit up though (and it turns out it doesn't speed up Tusk's Snowball either…? Someone confirm this for me.)\n* Having your Spirit sit around on enemies in lane just for Natural Order is useless if you're not planning on attacking them any time soon. Have your Spirit go suck up some more damage/farm by sending it into jungle camps rather than sitting around spooning heroes.\n* You can use a long-distance Spirit Return to your advantage to set up for kills. When the Spirit comes back from its semester abroad, start pounding on people with the extra bonus damage. Spirit starts cooling down whenever it's cast, not whenever it's Returned, so you'll have another Spirit ready in the chamber to finish them off.\n* Use the Spirit to scout out fogged areas during pushes or defenses.\n* During chases, try to pincer your target by casting the Spirit on a choke point. Either they have to run through the whole thing and risk getting slept or they have to change paths.\n* You can teleport to the Spirit using Boots of Travel.\n* You can right click an enemy when your Spirit is selected to have it follow a hero. I don't have the Michael Bublé skills necessary to police my Spirit and my hero in a team fight and maximize Natural Order, but this isn't my first summon rodeo. Right click the enemy's highest priority hero when your Spirit is selected and it'll keep tip toe wing in its jawwdinz right behind them until the duration runs out.\n* Ideally, you want to cast Earth Splitter as far away from the enemy team as possible to give them the smallest amount of time to react to the crack approaching.\n\n*Versus*\n\n* With shpeed. Elder Titan is a very unwieldy hero. His Stomp is slow, his Spirit is slow, Earth Splitter is slow. If you can move fast and avoid his spells, you can evade a lot of damage that ET should be dealing to you.\n\n**Ember Spirit**\n\n* The capture radius on Searing Chains is huge, but that's usually a disadvantage since it means you'll probably catch creeps when you want to catch heroes. When possible, hold on to the Chains until you can position yourself away from worthless enemy units rather than ~~complaining about~~ relying on RNG.\n* While Sleighted, projectiles will follow you around as you bounce from unit to unit. It's not a disjoint, but you can use this invulnerability period to 'absorb' projectiles without taking any damage or stun.\n* You can use items during Sleight of Fist. This includes TP scrolls. Just be sure that your Sleight ends before the TP channel finishes, otherwise you'll be brought back to your Sleight remnant.\n* You can use spells during Sleight of Fist. Yes, Chains is a given, but casting and activating Remnants during Sleight is also important. You can cast Remnants mid-Sleight to close distances quicker when chasing and activating them at tail end of a Sleight will make you extremely difficult to lock down when being chased.\n* The hardest part of executing the Sleight+Chain combo is knowing when Sleight will actually go off. Don't get too excited and prematurely cast Chains first. Just hit the hotkey as soon as you can react to Ember going into Sleight and you'll probably land it.\n* When manfighting early on with a low level Sleight, keep the Sleight in your pocket until the end of the fight. With good timing, you can use the banishment phase of the Sleight to mask the backswing of one of your attacks while tripping up heroes who are mashing right click on you, stalling some potential auto attacks.\n* Your Remnants travel at 2.5x your move speed when cast. This means that… Okay, what the hell… Active Phase Boots don't speed up Remnant travel speeds either? I could have sworn this was like a day one Ember tip… Yes, I know that spells stop the Phase Boots active, but I thought the speed buff gets lost *after* the spell is cast.\n* You can pick up runes while traveling to a Remnant.\n* The explosion damage radius of an activated Remnant is actually larger than the Searing Chains capture radius. If you're about to gank someone, cast a Remnant to the side of them that has the fewest enemy units, rather than directly on top of them.\n* Remnants give a small amount of basic vision. They're no Beastmaster Hawks, but they can be useful when trying to get vision inside the Rosh pit.\n* Use Remnants for mobility purposes as well as damage. Toss one out before teleporting back to base so you can quickly get back out on the lane. Toss one out before dying so you can get back out on the map as soon as you respawn (or buyback).\n* I highly recommend using the\n\n        dota_disable_range_finder 0\n\n    console command when playing Ember. It becomes far easier to tell when Sleight of Fist will go off and you'll be able to exploit the full Remnant cast range during ganks and escapes.\n\n*Versus*\n\n* Whenever Ember uses Sleight, he leaves a temporary Remnant behind during the cast. This is where he'll always return once Sleight finishes. Use this as a beacon to set up stuns like Mirana's Arrow or Jakiro's Ice Path or just start mashing your silence/hex/disable on the temporary remnant so you can catch him as soon as he returns.\n* Ember hates silences, but he also really hates slows. Remnants scale off of Ember's own movespeed, so heroes with strong slows can cut Ember's aggression significantly since he'll need to pre-cast an escape Remnant before going in.\n* Ember consumes all currently spawned Remnants when he activates one. If an Ember just Remnant'd in on a teammate, it can be worth following up and chasing to force him to cast an escape Remnant.\n* Sleight of Fist gets affected by evasion, disarms, and damage block.\n* You can purge off Flame Guard. This makes Eul's a solid item to have against Ember.",

    "body": "With this work (which I decided to release as a separate post because of its length), I aim to give a brief account of the history of the Battle of Vuhledar and of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, as of the more recent developments that led to the fall of the town, and what is happening now. The purpose is to inform those who wish of the history, in order to provide a coherent and linear picture, as of more recent events, in order to illustrate the latest happenings. This is by no means to say that everything I write is 100% accurate or complete - I don’t have access to official documents from either side... But it is my full understanding of events... As someone who spends quite a lot of time following this conflict.\n\nAs I said, one cannot talk about Vuhledar without talking about the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, and the other way around. Let’s review the stories, in this war, of both and how their fates met. \n\nFebruary 24, 2022. Ukraine is invaded. Most of the forces of Russia’s Southern Military District penetrate from Crimea, along with several units of the VDV. The 58th Combined Arms Army is tasked to advance as far north as possible, in the direction of the M04 Highway, with the goal of cutting off the rear of the bulk of the UAF, which was deployed in the ATO/JFO area. The same task, but on the northern flank, is placed on the 20th CAA of the Western MD, which penetrates east of Kharkiv; while the 1st GTA of the Western MD, from Sumy Oblast, is tasked to head as fast as possible towards the Dnipro River.\n\nAfter the rapid capture of Melitopol by the 58th CAA, its formations split up: the 19th Motorized Division aims for Zaporizhzhia, being stopped by the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade approximately on the current front line, in the strip of land from the Dnipro to Huliaipole. The 42nd Motorized Division and 136th Motorized Brigade aim further east, in the strip between Velyka Novosilka and Volnovakha. They are substantially slowed and obstructed by local TDF as well as SOF units. However, units of the 58th CAA arrive at the gates of both Velyka Novosilka and Vuhledar. Indeed, in mid March 2022 elements of the 42nd Motorized Division captured Pavlivka. \n\nBy early March, the Battle of Volnovakha was raging. The important town, the loss of which triggered the encirclement of Mariupol, was being defended by the 53rd Mechanized Brigade (with support from the local TDF; the 503rd Separate Marine Battalion operated nearby), and attacked by battalion tactical groups of the 150th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA, along with DPR units such as the 100th Motorized Brigade (future 110th Motorized Brigade), the 11th Motorized Regiment (future 114th Motorized Brigade) and the \"Sparta\" Battalion. After two weeks of strenuous resistance, the Russians on March 11 captured Volnovakha. The remaining forces of the 503rd Separate Marine Battalion, which remained inside the pocket, fall back towards Mariupol. The 53rd Mech Brigade falls back to the Vuhledar area, and meets the forces of the 42nd Motorized Division that had just arrived there, which for the first time encounter a regular Ukrainian unit, by which they are stopped. The guys of the 53rd Brigade were thus the first defenders of Vuhledar.\n\nMeanwhile, elements of the 40th and 155th Naval Infantry Brigades of the Pacific Fleet arrive, BTGs of which had participated in the Battle of Popasna and its local breakthrough during May. In the second half of June, the Ukrainian 53rd Mech Brigade launches a counterattack that liberated Pavlivka, advancing several kilometers towards Yehorivka. [An account](https://archive.is/bCDli) about this.\n\nDuring July, the then newly formed 68th Jager Brigade also arrives in the Vuhledar sector. Around mid August, the 53rd Brigade is replaced by the 72nd Mechanized Brigade. The former is withdrawn for rest and will return to action in the following October, in the defense of the southern flank of Bakhmut. \n\nLet’s review the history in this war of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade. It has always been considered among the most combat-ready units in the UAF. As part of the decommunization, in August 2017 (the brigade had participated in the battle of Avdiivka of the previous winter) its honorary title became “Black Zaporizhzhians” (replacing “Krasnogradsko-Kyivskoi”), after the \"1st Cavalry Regiment of Black Zaporizhians\" of the Ukrainian People's Army. Its garrison is in Bila Tserkva, located some 70 km south-west of the Ukrainian capital. Unlike the vast majority of Ukrainian brigades, this one was not deployed in the Donbas at the time of the invasion (despite the fact that there were plans for its departure to Volnovakha a few days before the invasion).\n\nOn February 24, a large Russian grouping moves towards Kyiv. Forces of the Eastern MD, along with most of the VDV units engaged in Ukraine, attack the western bank of the Dnipro; forces of the Central MD attack the eastern bank, in the direction of Kyiv, including Chernihiv. Despite what's often thought, the Russian plans weren’t totally far-fetched, and the Ukrainians, caught by surprise in such a push towards Kyiv, found themselves in serious trouble. On the evening of the 24th, the first units of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade arrived around Kyiv from Bila Tserkva, and began to contribute actively to the defense of the capital, becoming one of the key players in the defensive arrangements around Kyiv. The overwhelming majority of the brigade's forces (which at that time had three mechanized battalions, a motorized battalion, a tank battalion, and support units) are concentrated in the eastern bank, namely in the Brovary area. Where they repel, with the support of the 114th TDF Brigade, the armored columns of the 90th Tank Division (which came along the M01 Highway) and the mechanized columns of the 2nd CAA (which came along the H07 Highway). Moreover, a battalion of the brigade is involved in the actions in the western bank of the Dnipro - specifically, in Moschun, where one of the most important battles of the Kyiv campaign happens, ending in Ukrainian victory. The Ukrainians (not only elements of the 72nd Brigade, but also units of the National Guard, TDF and SOF) succeeded in stopping BTGs of the 98th VDV Division and of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade. This was also made possible by the continuous and mighty support from the 43rd and 44th Artillery Brigades.\n\nIn early May, Zelensky rewards the brigade with the honorary award \"For Courage and Bravery\" for its prowess around Kyiv. Its 12th Separate Motorized Battalion is very presumably disbanded, while the brigade receives two linear rifle battalions, as do the rest of the veteran brigades of the Ground Forces, growing to five infantry battalions. Meanwhile, elements of the brigade are transferred to the Donbas, where they help stem the Russian attacks in the direction of Bakhmut after the capture of Svitlodarsk by the latters. \n\nIn August, the 72nd Mech Brigade is moved to Vuhledar, replacing the 53rd Mech Brigade. And here the stories connect. At the end of October 2022, the Russians launched their first offensive against Vuhledar, which featured the naval infantry brigades of the Pacific Fleet (155th and 40th). These managed to retake Pavlivka (albeit at a major cost in casualties), but were then stopped on the banks of the Kashlahach River, more or less where Ukrainian-held lines still were until not even two weeks ago. The Russians also succeeded in capturing most of the Kaolin Quarry, north of Volodymyrivka. Overall, the offensive ends in operational failure and is called off the following month. \n\nThis offensive, as well as the following one, take place under the command of Lieutenant General Muradov, commander of the Eastern MD (promoted to Colonel General in February 2023!), and of Major General Akhmedov, commander of the Coastal Troops of the Pacific Fleet - the latter was a protégé of Muradov, being his brother-in-law. The goal was clear. Move the Ukrainians away from Volnovakha, a relevant railway junction, and eliminate that Ukrainian stronghold which \"corner\" it formed acted as a pivot between the eastern and southern fronts. \n\nDuring these very heavy battles, in which both the infantrymen of the 72nd Mech Brigade and the \"hunters\" of the 68th Jager Brigade stand out, the two brigades are reinforced. The 72nd Mech Brigade receives under organic subordination the 48th Separate Rifle Battalion (still part of the brigade), while the 68th Jager Brigade receives the 26th and 52nd Separate Rifle Battalions (ceded to other brigades during 2023). These brigades are also supported by a battalion each from the 118th and 128th TDF Brigades, as well as by the large contribution of the 55th Artillery Brigade. \n\nLater, Ground Forces of the Eastern MD also arrive, following the Kherson retreat and the subsequent restoration of combat capability in Russia. The 29th CAA (formed only by the 36th Motorized Brigade, in terms of maneuver units) is deployed in the Vuhledar sector (the 36th Motorized Brigade partly partook in the first offensive too), with the 36th CAA (37th Motorized Brigade and 5th Tank Brigade) on its left. The 72nd Motorized Brigade of the 3rd Corps also arrives in the area.\n\nIn late January the second offensive was launched, with the goal of taking Vuhledar. This was much larger than the first and involved the brigades of the Pacific Fleet, as well as the 29th CAA, the 3rd Corps and, partly, the 36th CAA. As well as the 14th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade, the OBTF \"Kaskad\" and the “Vostok” Battalion of the 1st Corps. This is the major and most known known offensive; the one rightly much derided, for the high number of losses of armored vehicles, which seemed to almost willingly run on mines (often planted remotely through RAAMS). It is also the largest offensive, in terms of intensity, launched by the Russian Armed Forces between June 2022 (Lysychansk sector) and October 2023 (Avdiivka) - if we attribute the largest part of the Bakhmut campaign to PMC Wagner, competing with the repeated Russian offensives against Avdiivka between February and April 2023. \n\nThe Russians attacked mainly from their bridgehead on the Kashlahach River in Mykilske towards Vuhledar and, as we know, were repulsed with very high losses. Although such a fiasco is often associated with the Russian Naval Infantry, these were only a part of the forces involved, besides the only ones to have achieved some successes, ruined after their withdrawal. The \"Alga\" Battalion of the 72nd Motorized Brigade of the 3rd Corps got virtually wiped out during the actions. The famous [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/10ykow5/vuhledar_february_2023_five_russian_vehicles/) of the column of Russian armored vehicles driving into a minefield one after another shows an action of the 36th Motorized Brigade (29th CAA). Marines of the 155th Brigade managed to capture some positions in the dachas south-east of Vuhledar, getting close to the high rises, that were lost in the following weeks, when these positions were handed over to the 37th Motorized Brigade (36th CAA).\n\nDuring this period, the two brigades defending Vuhledar (72nd Mech and 68th Jager) and their “dowries” were also supported by the 21st Motorized Battalion of the 56th Motorized Brigade. In mid February, the offensive is called off. The attacking Russian forces lost much of their combat capability. The 136th Motorized Brigade of the 58th CAA arrives in the area, from the Avdiivka sector, to replace some of these units, which were withdrawn for R&R.\n\nIn the following months, things in the Vuhledar sector become much quieter as the Russians prepare for defense against the coming Ukrainian counteroffensive. Both Muradov and Akhmedov get relieved. During this period, the Vuhledar sector is, all in all, quiet. The 68th Jager Brigade is moved further west and participates in the initial phase of the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Velyka Novosilka sector, liberating, on June 11, Blahodatne, in the eastern bank of the Mokri Yaly River, with support from the 3rd Mech Battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade. The new 37th Marine Brigade is also involved in the eastern bank, failing, however, to capture Novodonetske. During June, they are reinforced by the 35th Marine Brigade, which arrived from Krasnohorivka (the one above Marinka). The 36th CAA, reinforced by the 1466th Regiment of the Territorial Forces and by the 131st Separate Rifle Regiment of the 1st Corps, focuses, along with the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade, in the defense of the eastern bank of the Mokri Yaly. \n\nIn late July, the 68th Jager Brigade is transferred to the Svatove sector, where the Russians initiate a small-to-medium-scale offensive against Ukrainian positions in the middle Zherebets valley, being replaced by the new 38th Marine Brigade. Marines from the latter, along with those of the 35th Brigade, liberate Urozhaine during August. \n\nIn the Vuhledar sector, on the Ukrainian side, only the 72nd Mechanized Brigade remains, along with the 234th Battalion of the 128th TDF Brigade. On the other side, they face the 29th CAA, the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade and the 116th Separate Rifle Regiment of the 1st Corps (now 51st CAA). The Ukrainians never carried out serious offensive operations in this sector. This does not mean that the 72nd Brigade did not carry out small-scale counterattacks of tactical nature. In late July the Ukrainians drive the Russians out of the last positions they occupied inside the dachas south-east of Vuhledar; at the same time the paratroopers of the 79th Air Assault Brigade, holding Marinka and Novomykhailivka, recover ground south of the latter settlement.  \n\nIn September, the 137th Marine Battalion of the 35th Marine Brigade assaults Novomaiorske, but is repulsed with serious losses by the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade. There would be no further Ukrainian advances in the Velyka Novosilka sector. In general, the operations of the Ukrainian Marine Corps in the strip between Novodonetske and Novomaiorske proved to be a costly failure. Later in the month, the four marine brigades are withdrawn for recovery, with the prospect of being employed in Krynky. They are replaced, in the eastern bank of the Mokri Yaly (i.e. the broad right flank of Vuhledar!) by the 58th Motorized Brigade, which was in the strategic reserve, along with the 20th Special Purpose Battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade and the 31st \"Dnipro\" Brigade of the National Guard, which is in charge of holding Urozhaine.\n\nAlmost simultaneously with the start of the offensive against Avdiivka in early October, the Russians (68th Corps and 155th Naval Infantry Brigade, supported respectively by the 1472nd and 430th Regiments of the Territorial Forces) launched an offensive against Novomykhailivka, which we can consider the broad left flank of Vuhledar, from the Ukrainian point of view. The 79th Air Assault Brigade along with its dowries hold out tenaciously, thwarting Russian advances for months. \n\nThe situation in the immediate vicinity of Vuhledar remains, on the whole, relatively quiet. There are frequent counter-battery actions between both sides and the usual KABs launched against the town by the Russians (mostly by the 11th Air and Air Defence Forces Army). This is also the area of the entire front (barring the northern front) where it is the easiest for the Russians to use air support, because of the relative proximity to bases in southern Russia. At this time the 72nd Mechanized Brigade is still a large and in good shape unit. There are rotations among its battalions, losses are not high. Most of the losses experienced during earlier Russian offensives have been restored.  \n\nDuring December things got worse on the left flank: the Russians managed to score a major advance, reaching the southern edge of Novomykhailivka. The 79th Air Assault Brigade is stretched and during the month finds itself forced to abandon its last positions within the ruins of Marinka. The arrival of the 46th Airmobile Brigade in Heorhiivka gives some breath to the 79th Brigade and allows them to mount a counterattack, pushing the Russians back south of Novomykhailivka, in early January. \n\nAt this time serious pressures begin, for the first time since February 2023, against the 72nd Mech Brigade. The 39th Motorized Brigade of the 68th Corps (supported by a regimental tactical group of the 18th Machine Gun Artillery Division of the same corps) shifts its attentions from Novomykhailivka to the terrain south-west of the settlement, carrying out several mechanized attacks from Solodke in the direction of Vodiane (an [instance](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/1afqwd3/30012024_a_massive_russian_mechanized_attack_was/) + [geolocations](https://x.com/klinger66/status/1752912881723576384)), together with the new 139th Separate Assault Battalion of the 29th CAA. A battalion of the 5th Tank Brigade of the 36th CAA is also temporarily committed in this direction. South of Vuhledar, the 95th Separate Rifle Regiment of the 1st Corps is deployed from Kherson Oblast, replacing the 116th, which was cannibalized to restore the losses of the 114th Motorized Brigade east of Avdiivka.\n\nAt first, Russian attacks are repulsed. In February, however, the Russians manage both to regain ground south of Novomykhailivka, capturing the first houses inside the village, and to advance along the Vodiane-Solodke Road. The Russians bring reserves, increasing pressure in the direction of Vodiane. While the battle rages in March between the 79th Air Assault Brigade and its dowries against the Russian 39th Motorized and 155th Naval Infantry Brigades inside Novomykhailivka, further south the 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th CAA is brought into action, after several months of rest after the battles around Kurdyumivka in the southern flank of Bakhmut. Detachments of the 14th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade support these attacks. However, counterattacks by the 72nd Mech Brigade succeed in recovering some ground and stabilizing the situation. \n\nThere is no slack on the right flank, meanwhile. The 58th Motorized Brigade, as [explained](https://censor.net/ua/resonance/3508029/yak_uryatuvaty_pokrovsk) a month ago by the Ukrainian journalist Butosov, acts as a mini-OTG (Operational-Tactical Group) and holds the entire sector from the Mokri Yaly to Shevchenko at bay, along with its assigned units. In early 2024, the 13th Motorized Battalion of this brigade is detached to Avdiivka, where it fights together with the 53rd Mech Brigade in the southern flank. After withdrawing from the city, the 13th Battalion goes to cover the area between Prechystivka and Shevchenko. Upon their return in late February, the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade [launches](https://x.com/klinger66/status/1766825902573244560) a mechanized attack north of Shevchenko, in the direction of the Kashlahach River; other assaults follow in the following days. The Russian marines manage, albeit with significant losses, to advance 1,5 km north of Shevchenko. \n\nDuring this period, off the front line, two things happen. The Vuhledar sector, as well as the Velyka Novosilka, the Kurakhove, and the Avdiivka ones, are transferred from the \"Tavria\" Operational-Strategic Group to the \"Khortytsia\" OSG, following the fall of Avdiivka. Meanwhile, the 72nd Mech Brigade is called upon to contribute to the expansion of the UAF. A separate machine gun platoon is transferred to the new 153rd Mech Brigade, as [reported](https://militaryland.net/news/official-introduction-of-153rd-mechanized-brigade/) by MilitaryLand too. Some officers and NCOs are transferred to the new brigades. I also found indications that a serviceman from the 72nd Mech Brigade was transferred to the 162nd Mech Brigade, a potential new unit whose existence has not been confirmed yet. \n\nIn the second half of April, after occupying all of Novomykhailivka, Russian attacks further increase in intensity. They attack fiercely from Novomykhailivka to Volodymyrivka, with multiple mechanized attacks every week, sometimes every day, despite the transfer of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade to the Kharkiv sector. The Russians' goal is to get as close as possible to Vodiane and to the Kostiantynivka-Vuhledar Road. To do this they had to \"jump\" the area's numerous forest belts one after the other, which often run perpendicular to their direction of attack. Mechanized attacks, very costly in material terms, happen in addition to infantry attacks, no less costly in human terms. Nevertheless, the Russians, belt after belt, progressively advance. The first significant manpower problems emerge in the 72nd Mech Brigade. \n\nIn late April, the 36th CAA and 40th Naval Infantry Brigade launch an offensive against Urozhaine, keeping the 58th Motorized Brigade and the other units busy. Reinforcements arrive in the long stretch of sector under the responsability of the 58th Brigade: the 157th and 160th Battalions of the 118th TDF Brigade (the latter is the battalion of the city of Uman). However, the density of Ukrainian forces in the right flank of Vuhledar is considerably low, if compared to other areas. In July, the Russians conquer all of Urozhaine, after which the 36th CAA and the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade stop the bulk of active offensive operations and start accumulating reserves. \n\nThroughout May and June there are very heavy battles in the left flank of Vuhledar, between the 72nd Mech Brigade and the Russian forces of the Eastern MD. Note, however, that the area south of Novomykhailivka is the border between the jurisdiction of Russia’s Group of Forces \"South\" and the GoF \"East\". In late June the Russians achieve very important successes in the area south of the Vodiane-Solodke Road, north of Volodymyrivka. They first occupy the rest of the Kaolin Quarry, then move several kilometers closer to both Vodiane and the Pivdennodonbaska No. 1 Coal Mine. In mid June there are serious coordination problems between a battalion of the 72nd Mech Brigade and, most likely, the 234th Battalion of the 128th TDF Brigade (possibly subordinate to the 48th Rifle Battalion of the 72nd Brigade). The TDF unit ran very high risks of finding itself surrounded, as a result of a failure from the command to notify the unit that nearby positions had been lost. This problem was reported by the Ukrainian observer Bohdan Myroshnykov. The unit at risk of being surrounded was then able to withdraw, but not without losses.\n\nhttps://t. me/myro_shnykov/5659\n\nhttps://t. me/myro_shnykov/5692\n\nThe first real tactical crisis in the Vuhledar sector arises. This is overshadowed by the analogous crisis in the Pokrovsk sector and the coeval Russian breakthrough near Toretsk and then in Niu-York, due to the mess with the rotation between the 24th and 41st Mech Brigades. The latter trouble (and the shameful circumstances during which it happened) finally cost Lieutenant General Sodol, the commander of the OSG \"Khortytsia\", his job, getting replaced by Brigadier General Hnatov (promoted to Major General in August). The \"Vuhledar file\" arrives at the new commander's desk. Hnatov is briefed on the difficult situation in Vuhledar and the gradual loss of combat capability of the 72nd Mech Brigade. As early as the last days of June some reinforcements arrive. The 35th and 36th Separate Rifle Battalions of the 61st Mech Brigade are deployed near Vodiane; the Self-propelled Artillery Battalion of the 31st Mech Brigade also arrives to provide fire support. Between Kostyantynivka and Vodiane, the 214th Special Battalion OPFOR is active, which was already fighting in the area under the 79th Air Assault Brigade.\n\nIn late July and early August, the Russians (whose assault detachments are always replenished with men to make up for heavy losses) score more advances on the left flank, approaching Vodiane and, further north, physically cutting the Kostiantynivka-Vuhledar Road, south of the former settlement (by the 39th Motorized Brigade of 68th Corps). Meanwhile, those units of the 61st Mech Brigade are withdrawn and taken to Kursk along with the rest of the brigade. Additional territorial defense units arrive, such as the 216th Battalion of the 125th TDF Brigade and at least one battalion of the 116th TDF Brigade, along with elements of the 2nd \"Galician\" Brigade of the National Guard (near Vodiane). By mid August, the Russian onslaught, at the expense of heavy casualties, continued seemingly unabated. The Russians (57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th CAA) overran the Kostiantynivka-Vuhledar Road south of Vodiane, and captured (39th Motorized Brigade of the 68th Corps) the important company-stronghold east of the village. Soldiers of the 216th Battalion of the 125th TDF Brigade [complained](https://x.com/Zoreslav9/status/1824857340165734842) of heavy losses after coordination problems with the 72nd Mech Brigade. On one occasion the deputy commander of the 72nd Brigade also allegedly beat the chief of staff of the 216th Battalion.\n\nLet’s recall that the Russians, specifically the 36th Motorized Brigade of the 29th CAA and the 95th Separate Rifle Regiment of the 51st CAA, also attacked intensely from the south, between Pavlivka and Mykilske. But in this case, without progress, thanks to the Ukrainian-held fortifications.\n\nIn late August and early September, the right flank \"wakes up” too. The 37th Motorized Brigade and the 5th Tank Brigade of the 36th CAA, to which the 430th Regiment of the Territorial Forces is attached, go on the offensive along with the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade. First they advance from their forward positions north of Shevchenko, reaching the Kashlahach River; a few days later they succeed, advancing several kilometers, also in occupying Prechystivka and even in approaching Zolota Nyva. In this area, under the jurisdiction of the 58th Motorized Brigade, the defenses of some of its battalions and those of the 118th TDF Brigade attached to it, yield, being able to do little against enemy forces of a multiple superior. The Russians also occupied several fortifications north of Prechystivka, reaching the course of the Balka Beresmova. Recall that during August, according to what I found, the 15th Motorized Battalion of the 58th Motorized Brigade was detached to support the 25th Airborne Brigade in Novohrodivka, in the Pokrovsk sector. \n\nBut these days something very important happens, publicly unknown even in Ukraine, which I discovered through an [article](https://transkarpatia.net/transcarpathia/hot-news/182022-prosimo-rozgolosu-zvertayetsja-2j-strileckij-bataljon-128ji-brigadi-podrobici.html) of a local online newspaper from Transcarpathia. During August the General Staff, probably Syrsky himself, must have approved the transfer of the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade from the Kamyanske sector to Vuhledar, to replace the 72nd Mech Brigade. I think Syrsky's intervention must have been necessary because the Vuhledar sector is under the jurisdiction of the OSG “Khortytsia”, while the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade performs duties under the OSG “Tavria\". \n\nOn August 30, MP Maryana Bezuhla (incidentally, greatly despised by every Ukrainian serviceman/observer I know) made it known that the 72nd Brigade would be taken out of Vuhledar, after being allegedly contacted by soldiers of the 72nd Brigade who were scared they would be sent to another hot sector (which in my opinion would make no sense - why transfer them in the first place then?). \n\nhttps://t. me/marybezuhla/1999\n\nFact is, the Russians immediately intensified their attacks, and the situation in the flanks got even worse. The rotation gets cancelled; the 72nd Brigade remains in place, scoffing Bezuhla on their official Telegram channel.\n\nhttps://t. me/ombr72/10252\n\nThey get reinforced by several battalions that are placed under its subordination (as we’ll see later); the General Staff likely accepts the future loss of Vuhledar at this point. This took place between August 30 and September 2. Let's get to the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade, which is today still covering the area between the Dnipro and Nesteryanka. A large brigade, not the best one, but in better condition than many others, since its sector is overall quiet. On September 1 came the order to withdraw from the positions and get prepared to move elsewhere. It has in its organic structure three mountain assault battalions, a motorized battalion, two rifle battalions, the tank battalion and support units. On that day, soldiers of the brigade's 2nd Rifle Battalion were in the forward positions in their sector as usual, which they have held for a year and a half. They were the first subunit of the 128th Brigade to complete the process of releasing and handing over their positions (I don't know whether they have been replaced by a TDF battalion, a separate rifle battalion or someone else), they packed up their stuff and were therefore ready for transfer. This battalion (formed by four rifle companies and the fire support one), according to the words of its soldiers, is up to 50% understrength, as it has not had any replenishment nor rotations for 17/18 months.\n\nHowever, on the evening of September 1 it was announced that the rotation to Vuhledar is cancelled. But... the 2nd Rifle Battalion was ready to go and had already left its positions, unlike the rest of the brigade. What does the Ukrainian command, which finds itself with a spare battalion (despite not even being a separate battalion but a linear one), do? They make it move anyway. Destination: the opposite part of Ukraine - Kupyansk. I managed to find a [document](https://i.imgur.com/PeNAem0.png) on this matter. During the night of September 2 a convoy of 72 vehicles (cars, vans...) crosses half of Ukraine and takes the battalion to the Kupyansk sector. The battalion is seconded to the National Guard (most likely the 1st “Bureviy” Brigade). The latters order the battalion in its entirety to cross the Oskil and take up positions 4 km from the Russians, where they are to hold the line and possibly carry out counterattacks. Most likely they were sent to the hot area between Kolisnykivka/Kruhlyakivka and Pischane. The whole convoy was supposed to cross the river on a pontoon bridge (which they said was known to the Russians) and take their positions on the eastern bank.\n\nAt that point, the 2nd Rifle Battalion refused to cross the Oskil (being threatened by the National Guard with disbandment of the battalion and being scattered to various units), and first of all asked Brigadier General Bohomolov (commander of Tactical Group “Kupyansk”) for at least a week of rest, as well as to reconstitute the battalion at full strength. At the end of that week they [recorded](https://versii.if.ua/novunu/2-gyj-strileczkyj-bataljon-128-ogshbr-prosyt-zberegty-jogo-v-skladi-ridnoyi-brygady-video/) a video appeal to Zelensky, where they said they were threatened with disbandment because of the refusal to perform dangerous tasks not commensurate with the battalion's actual strength, asked for two weeks of rest, the reconstitution of the battalion and to return to their “native” brigade, in the sector they know well.\n\nWhat was Bohomolov's response to this, a few days later? The battalion is disbanded. To achieve this, he definitely received the approval from the Operational Command “West”. The soldiers of the 2nd Rifle Battalion claimed that a colonel from the OC “West” told them that they would still carry out their assigned tasks, no matter under which unit, and that their battalion would not be receiving any rest, replenishments of men and gear etc. The order was carried out. The 2nd Rifle Battalion of the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade no longer exists. Its servicemen have been scattered among various units, probably among those already fighting around Kupyansk. A Facebook [group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/794941915926282) has already sprung up to share memories of the battalion and its (now former) members.\n\nLet’s get back to Vuhledar now. With the destruction of the rotation, the increasingly drained 72nd Mech Brigade remains in Vuhledar. It is reinforced by additional TDF elements, such as one battalion each from the 110th and 117th TDF Brigades (the former, north of Vodiane), as well as the 1st Separate Assault Battalion “Da Vinci” (the one that was ousted from the composition of the 67th Mech Brigade in April), that arrived from the Huliaipole sector. The 181st and 185th Battalions of the 122nd TDF Brigade also arrived in Vodiane. During September, the 2nd Airmobile Battalion of the 77th Airmobile Brigade also arrived from the Borova sector and is deployed east of Vuhledar. I identified all these movements through MIA notices and crowfunding activities on social media. These reinforcements, not for lack of valor of the troops, fail to scratch the Russian onslaught, which in fact increases in intensity as these have sniffed, like sharks smelling blood in the water, a rotation in the air. \n\nIn early September, the 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th CAA captures the settlement of Vodiane, the 139th Separate Assault Battalion of the 29th CAA the Pivdennodonbaska No. 1 Coal Mine, and Vuhledar is for the first time seriously threatened with encirclement. In the mid of the month, the Russians also take the Pivdennodonbaska No. 3 Coal Mine west of Vodiane. \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6798\n\nBut it doesn't end there. Shortly thereafter, a combined attack by the 5th Tank Brigade and the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade breaks through the Ukrainian defenses and advances several kilometers north of the Kashlahach River. \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6877\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6894\n\nFire control is taken over the Bohoyavlenka-Vuhledar Road. Secondary routes for supplies, in the fields, are constantly hit. In all this, the Russians are heavily aided by the 14th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade. In fact, two Russian CAAs (albeit not large ones, but not considering the 68th Corps fighting farther north-east of Vuhledar) are fighting against one and a half Ukrainian brigades. Russian superiority in manpower is indisputable. To it must be added a huge volume of artillery fire and use of KABs and TOS against the town, as well as FPV drones against Ukrainian strongpoints.\n\nThe crisis becomes an emergency. The situation is no longer salvageable. The commander of the 72nd Mech Brigade, Colonel Ivan Vinnik, is [removed](https://dumskaya.net/news/nazad-na-front-byvshiy-nachalnik-odesskogo-ttsk-186067/ua/) and replaced by the head of the Territorial Recruitment Center of Odesa Oblast and former commander of the 14th Mech Brigade, Colonel Alexander Okhrimenko - who is considered a butcher for his handling of a counterattack against Masyutivka (Kupyansk sector) back in May 2023, which I had [written about](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1abhsmb/comment/kjoruls/) in January. I have no exact theory for this. Maybe the former commander had serious tactical responsibilities for what has happened over the recent months, maybe he was asking for permission to leave the town but was not granted it, maybe such a major loss must necessarily be accompanied by some positions getting axed. What is certain is never has the 72nd Brigade lacked valor. And while there is never enough of them, but there has not been too much of a lack of shells either recently, according to [words](https://suspilne.media/amp/donbas/843463-vsi-zasobi-aki-e-kinuli-na-cej-napramok-v-72-j-brigadi-cornih-zaporozciv-rozkazali-pro-oboronu-vugledara/) of its servicemen. In this regard, let's recall the contribution provided by the 55th and 148th Artillery Brigades. \n\nThere has been a lack of men. Reinforcements were never enough, and drip-feeded. In Bezuhla's words, the 72nd Mech Brigade was not even among the units that had priority for replenishement of men (the Ukrainians have this system - brigades fighting in the hottest areas and those that need to be largely reconstituted have the priority for receiving recruits, both in quantity and quality). \n\nIn late September, the Russians physically cut the Bohoyavlenka-Vuhledar Road. The situation got desperate. In the second half of September, the Russians also began making advances towards Vuhledar directly from the south. The 430th Regiment of the Territorial Forces captured the forward positions of the 72nd Mech Brigade near the industrial area of Pavlivka along the Kashlahach, which the Ukrainians had fortified over the years. An instance. \n\nhttps://t. me/voin_dv/11098\n\nThe 36th Motorized Brigade of the 29th CAA conquers the dachas south-east of Vuhledar and on, September 25, succeeds in occupying the first high rises of the town, in the area of the local headquarters of the State Migration Service of Ukraine. \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6919\n\nAt the same time, the 123rd TDF Brigade of Mikolaiv Oblast is ordered to move to Vuhledar. Until then they were deployed in the Kherson sector - one part of the brigade along the mouth of the Dnipro, another part around Beryslav, near Kakhovka. There they covered positions along the river to prevent Russian raids, as well as shooting down Russian drones. Most of the battalions of this brigade have been deployed in the Kherson sector for practically the entire duration of the war, at least since the war moved away from Mikolaiv, remaining there even after the liberation of Kherson and not getting actively involved in Krinky, but partially in some islands along the Dnipro. The brigade should have decent levels of staffing, largely from the volunteers who had formed it at the beginning of the conflict, but it reflexively has very little experience of fighting in the Donbas and a bad situation in terms of gear. \n\nTypically, when a TDF unit is transferred, we are talking about one/two of the battalions of a TDF brigade being assigned to another brigade and used to increase its infantry endowment. There are few TDF brigades that cover a given sector with all or most of their battalions being deployed there. Also because they would have serious difficulties in covering an area independently, not having an artillery group, a tank unit, armored vehicles, etc. Which by the way makes the HQ Staffs of most TDF brigades useless, but let's leave that aside. In this case, however, it would appear that the entire, or nearly the entire, brigade has been transferred and/or is in the process of being transferred. It is not clear whether it was assigned to the 72nd Mech Brigade, as I think. \n\nThere are problems with the 123rd TDF Brigade. The commander of its 186th Battalion, as I understand, [refused](https://www.facebook.com/vadym.dzugan/posts/pfbid0WP7dRMqD4BzXbnFgjFcBTtB8V848jS1F5Up9ptz81RjsYUnx5WDKFJszVixzKmW4l) to take his men in Vuhledar. At that point he was allegedly threatened by officers from the Operational Command \"South\" with the opening of criminal proceedings against him and charges against his brigade for the loss of Vuhledar. He committed suicide shortly thereafter, on October 2. The same day the OSG “Khortytsia” formally authorized the withdrawal from the town and the most nearby areas, as we shall see. It is unclear whether the battalion was disbanded, as is the custom in such cases of refusal. A hundred soldiers from the 187th Battalion of the same brigade refused to go to Vuhledar, and instead started a [protest](https://24tv.ua/biytsi-123-brigadi-tro-pokinuli-viyskovu-chastinu-voni-skarzhatsya_n2655328?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR0So_mzUoBW4TCM4DMsVjjPAwrW_6snQnCm677lJTX4kxEJ4Nd2Li4ZJF8_aem_4d5Iq-hrhQ0G2rQl26Aq9w) in Voznesensk (the capital of the raion where their battalion comes from). During the protest they complained that there is a shortage of weapons in their battalion and no machine guns are provided, and they also complained that they are not trained for such a mission. \n\nI will finish in the [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1fx0l49/comment/lqiorg8/).",

        "body": "This Ukrainian Telegram channel, “Mannerheims son”, run by a battalion chief of staff of a mechanized brigade fighting in Southern Ukraine, has different views, and says that this brigade has been provided with equipment; the TDF should be abolished and often hampers the conduct of combat missions, not because of the soldiers themselves but because of problems at the battalion level and interaction with the brigade to which they are assigned. He says it would have been much better if these soldiers had been assigned organically to the 72nd Mech Brigade.\n\nhttps://t. me/ukr_sisu/156\n\nhttps://t. me/ukr_sisu/157\n\nThe command of the TDF denied reports of weapons shortages and has been urging those soldiers to change their minds before criminal prosecutions for unauthorized abandonment of the military unit start. The 255th Battalion of the same brigade is already engaged in combat tasks around Vuhledar. According to what I have learnt from relatives of soldiers of the 123rd TDF Brigade, some soldiers were sent to Vuhledar (I mean the town itself, not the sector) during the last days of September, when the situation was already extremely compromised, with the task of supporting the 72nd Mech Brigade and preventing the Russians from taking control of the town's buildings. The relatives of the soldiers of the 123rd Brigade, in addition to being very worried - understandably, following the transfer of their loved ones from a quiet sector to a very hot one - confirm that they were sent there \"without equipment\"; and state that they are not refusing to perform combat tasks, but are demanding the gear to be provided. Numerous crowdfunding collections have sprung up these days from relatives and residents of the Mykolaiv region to finance the purchase of EW systems and other stuff needed for the brigade.\n\nAt this time (late September), there was no authorization from above to evacuate the town. Some groups, likely authorized by their officers, began to gradually [leave](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2knzxn9x7o) the city accompanying the most seriously wounded comrades-in-arms. The situation was very nasty, part of the communications was down. Supplies were virtually gone: vehicles had to pass through dirt roads, remotely mined by and under the eyes of Russian drones, with the danger of FPV drones, quadcopters and artillery/mortar fire.\n\nOn September 30, the assault detachment of the 5th Tank Brigade entered the town from the west, capturing several high rises to the west of School No. 3, followed by the assault detachment of the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade. A few hours later, stormtroopers of the 37th Motorized Brigade took the garage cooperative in the north-western edge of the town. During this day, there are still fierce urban clashes in much of the town's streets, despite both ammunition and literally everything else running very low. \n\nOn October 1, the Russians won the last isolated pockets of resistance within the town and cleaned out building after building. The bulk of what remained of the Ukrainian garrison withdrew during the night of October 1, not without losses. The retreat happened in isolated groups along fields and forest belts, in a very difficult environment because of Russian fires. During that day, the 36th Motorized Brigade finished its conquest of the town, occupying the north-eastern part of Vuhledar. \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6986\n\nOn October 2, the OSG “Khortytsia” admits that as a result of Russian actions on the flanks against Vuhledar and the following risk of encirclement, an order was issued to the units in the area to abandon the town and take on new positions.\n\nhttps://t. me/Khortytsky_wind/1188\n\nOn October 3, the Russian MoD officially acknowledges the conquest of Vuhledar and credited the GoF \"Vostok\" (East) with the conquest of the town. This GoF should be led by Lieutenant General Alexander Sanchik, the acting commander of the Eastern Military District, which was congratulated by Yury Trutnev, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia and Presidential Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District.\n\nhttps://t. me/mod_russia/44085\n\nhttps://t. me/general_governor/2719\n\nAfter 30 and a half months of resistance (remember what I wrote above: the Russians took Pavlivka for the first time in mid March 2022), the Ukrainian stronghold of Vuhledar is lost. Along with it, the combat capability of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade. The bulk of its battalions are out of action. Several companies virtually no longer exist. Some of the infantrymen are in convalescence after the battles of the past months/weeks. They will likely return later, but at the moment they are not available. In recent months the bulk of the brigade's drivers, mechanics, signalmen, etc. have also been transferred to the infantry. As evidenced by the very small number of POWs taken (beyond Russian ramblings), those who had remained in the town fought to the end. Others managed to reach Bohoyavlenka. Some of the wounded had to remain in the town, in a situation reminiscent of the “Zenith” bunker south of Avdiivka back in February.\n\nWe cannot forget those who allowed the evacuation and prevented the Russians from closing the ring around the town, namely infantrymen from other subunits of the 72nd Brigade and of the TDF, who tenaciously defended the two ventilation shafts of the Pivdennodonbaska No. 3 Coal Mine (west of the latter) and the nearby forest belts. Only in the last few days, as confirmed by DeepState and by geolocations, have the Russians captured the northern ventilation shaft, trying to advance into the area around it. This area has been relatively decently fortified by the Ukrainians.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/7003\n\nThe battle of Vuhledar, so long and costly for the Russians, is over. But the war is certainly not, let alone the problems in that corner that the front forms, that are going to get worse with the loss of Vuhledar. At the moment, the 72nd Mech Brigade will not be withdrawn, having no replacement unit that is able to \"inherit\" the front. I believe that most likely the brigade’s HQ Staff, the remaining fire support units, the UAV Battalion and the artillery group will continue to operate in the Vuhledar sector while the infantry work will be done by the TDF units attached to the brigade. Apparently, the 113th TDF Brigade of Kharkiv Oblast, or at least elements of this brigade, which until now covered the state border in Kharkiv Oblast, [is arriving](https://i.imgur.com/Egula4l.png) too. It is unclear how many battalions will arrive. Note that in recent weeks its 209th Battalion was fighting in Nevske in the Lyman sector, according to my findings.\n\nThe big questions are: how prepared the Ukrainian command actually was for the possibility of the town being lost; the intentions of the Russians now; how the front will settle in this very important area. In case the emergency continues in the future, perhaps the General Staff will find some decent brigades to transfer to this sector. As for the Russians, according to Russian sources, the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade is preparing to be transferred to Kursk Oblast to be brought into action against the Ukrainians up there. One of their battalions has already been there for a month. Note that this post also tackles the problems with desertion in the naval infantry brigades deployed in Kursk.\n\nhttps://t. me/severnnyi/2214\n\nThis may suggest that while the Russians will continue to press on in order to conduct tactical advances, they may initiate an operational pause in the sector in order to regroup the units of the GoF \"East\". Elements of the 35th CAA are also moving from the Huliaipole sector to Kursk Oblast, a sign that a structural reinforcement of the GoF \"East\" does not appear to be planned. The 5th CAA continues offensive actions of tactical nature in the direction of Makarivka, in the western bank of the Mokri Yaly, with limited successes. Actions between Urozhaine and Novodonetske have stopped, with the 36th CAA concentrated in Vuhledar, where the 29th CAA is deployed. Will the 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th CAA continue to be deployed in the Vuhledar sector in the future, will it return with its \"native\" army, will it be moved in other directions? Well… If I knew, I would inform the Ukrainians. The 68th Corps, which although being a formation of the Eastern MD acts under the GoF \"South\", is currently continuing to attack in the area between Katerynivka and Vodiane, facing the 79th Air Assault Brigade and its dowries. Yesterday the Russians managed to reach the gates of Katerynivka from the south, having occupied Kostyantynivka and the terrain south of the former village last month. \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/7015\n\nAs of the day before yesterday (it is unclear whether the Ukrainians have withdrawn), the 29th CAA, through its 200th Artillery Brigade, is attacking the southern ventilation shaft of the Pivdennodonbaska No. 3 Coal Mine, which the Ukrainians are clinging to tenaciously, as recognized by decent Russian sources. Who also state that the advancing towards Bohoyavlenka will not be easy. The Ukrainians have several strong points in the area, south of Bohoyavlenka.

Kaolin provides efficient implementations of differentiable 3D modules for use in deep learning systems. With functionality to load and preprocess several popular 3D datasets, and native functions to manipulate meshes, pointclouds, signed distance functions, and voxel grids, Kaolin mitigates the need to write wasteful boilerplate code. Kaolin packages together several differentiable graphics modules including rendering, lighting, shading, and view warping. Kaolin also supports an array of loss functions and evaluation metrics for seamless evaluation and provides visualization functionality to render the 3D results. Importantly, we curate a comprehensive model zoo comprising many state-of-the-art 3D deep learning architectures, to serve as a starting point for future research endeavours. Kaolin is available as open-source software at [this https URL](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin/).",

    "body": "I love history & trivia and I wanted to make an inventory of all the rich references in Dota 2. The information source is mostly Wikipedia, I simply compiled it. This is the **Strength** hero edition, let me know if you’d like to see something similar for Agility and Int. Hope you like, which one is your favourite? (Mine is Io, kappa).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Abaddon.** The Lord of Avernus. Avernus was an ancient name for a volcanic crater near Cumae (Cuma), Italy. Avernus was believed to be the entrance to the *underworld*, and is portrayed as such in the Aeneid of Virgil. The name comes from the Greek word aornos (ἄορνος < a- 'no' + ornis 'bird'), meaning \"without birds\", because according to tradition, all birds flying over the lake were destined to fall dead, likely due to the *toxic fumes* – hence Abaddon's response to killing Phoenix: \"That Phoenix flew too close to the *mist*.\" The Hebrew term **Abaddon**, meaning \"doom\", and its Greek equivalent Apollyon appear in the Bible as both a place of destruction and an angel of the abyss. In the Hebrew Bible, abaddon is used with reference to a bottomless pit, often appearing alongside the place שְׁאוֹל (Sheol), meaning the realm of the dead.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Alchemist.** Alchemists attempted to purify, mature, and perfect certain materials. Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of \"base metals\" (e.g., lead) into \"noble metals\" (particularly gold) – *Greevil’s Greed*; the creation of an elixir of immortality; the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease – mass regeneration of *Chemical Rage*; and the development of an alkahest, a universal solvent – *Acid Spray*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Axe.** The Mogul Khan. The Mughal (or *Moghul*) Empire was an early-modern empire in South Asia. For some two centuries, the empire stretched from the outer fringes of the Indus basin in the west, northern Afghanistan in the northwest, and Kashmir in the north, to the highlands of present-day Assam and Bangladesh in the east, and the uplands of the Deccan plateau in South India. *Khan* is a title of unknown origin for a ruler or military leader. In the Mongol Empire it signified the ruler of a horde (ulus), while the ruler of all the Mongols was the khagan or great khan. In the Old Norse written corpus, *berserkers* (or \"berserks\"; Old Norse: berserkir) were warriors who purportedly fought in a trance-like fury.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Beastmaster.** The Jungle Book (1894) is a collection of stories by the English author Rudyard Kipling. A major theme in the book is *abandonment followed by fostering*, as in the life of Mowgli. Beastmaster’s own lore: “*Karroch was born a child of the stocks. His mother died in childbirth*; his father, a farrier for the Last King of Slom, was trampled to death when Karroch was five. Afterward Karroch was indentured to the king’s menagerie, where he grew up among all the beasts of the royal court: lions, apes, fell-deer, and things less known, things barely believed in.”\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Brewmaster.** Primal split. Classical elements typically refer to the concepts in ancient Greece of *earth, water, air, fire, and (later) aether*, which were proposed to explain the nature and complexity of all matter in terms of simpler substances. The Chinese Wu Xing system lists Wood (木 mù), Fire (火 huǒ), Earth (土 tǔ), Metal (金 jīn), and Water (水 shuǐ), though these are described more as energies or transitions rather than as types of material. *Drunken Master* (Chinese: 醉拳; literally: 'drunken fist') is a 1978 Hong Kong action comedy martial arts film. It is an early example of the comedic kung fu genre for which Jackie Chan became famous. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Bristleback.** “Oy, calm down, I just took a quick trip to the bog.” The Tamworth, also known as Sandy Back and Tam, is a breed of domestic pig originating in its namesake Tamworth, Staffordshire United Kingdom. The *bristle(back)* density protects their skin from ultraviolet harm from the sun; nevertheless, when they moult between June and August (in the Northern Hemisphere), shade is sought along with *copious mud* (bog) coating to prevent sunburn.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Centaur Warrunner.** A centaur is a mythological creature from Greek mythology with the upper body of a human and the lower body and legs of a horse. The most common theory holds that the idea of centaurs came from the first reaction of a non-riding culture, as in the Minoan Aegean world, to nomads who were mounted on horses. Omexe, the lore ancient arena where centaur clans have for millennia gathered to perform their gladiatorial rites could be a reference to the *eques gladiator* (on horseback).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Chaos Knight.** Upon his steed *Armageddon* he rides. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are described in the last book of the New Testament of the Bible, the Book of Revelation. The four riders are often seen as symbolizing Pestilence, War, Famine, and Death. CK’s *Phantasm* summons 3 illusions, for a total of 4 horsemen.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Clockwerk.** “After burying his father among the ruins of their village, he set about to transform himself into the greatest tool of warfare that any world had ever seen. He vowed to never again be caught unprepared, instead using his talents to assemble a suit of powered Clockwerk armor to make the knights of other lands look like tin cans by comparison.” Leonardo's robot, or *Leonardo's mechanical knight* was a humanoid automaton designed and possibly constructed by Leonardo da Vinci around the year 1495. Ludovico Sforza, the Duke who commissioned the automaton, succeeded his nephew Galeazzo Maria Sforza, assassinated over a land dispute.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Doom.** Lucifer, the Fallen One. In mainstream Christianity, the devil (Satan or Lucifer) is a fallen angel who rebelled against God. Satan was expelled from Heaven by the Archangel Michael and sent to Earth. Michael was then commanded by God to guard the Heavens with a fiery sword (*infernal blade*).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Dragon Knight.** Saint George was a soldier of Cappadocian Greek origins, member of the Praetorian Guard for Roman emperor Diocletian (*knight*). The legend of Saint George and the Dragon describes the real-life Saint George (died 303) taming and slaying a dragon that demanded human sacrifices; the saint thereby rescues the princess chosen as the next offering. According to the Golden Legend, Silene in Libya was plagued by a *venom-spewing dragon* dwelling in a nearby pond, poisoning the countryside. While Saint George faced an untimely doom at the hands of the Romans, he was martyrized and the dragon slayer become a symbol of crusaders centuries later.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Earth Spirit.** Kaolin. Kaolinite is a clay mineral. Rocks that are rich in kaolinite are known as kaolin or china clay, used in the production of porcelain. The *Terracotta Army* is a collection of terracotta (clay based ceramic) sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210–209 BCE with the purpose of protecting the emperor in his afterlife.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Earthshaker.** *Totem poles* of the Pacific Northwest of North America are monumental poles of heraldry. They feature many different designs (bears, birds, frogs, people, and various supernatural beings and aquatic creatures) that function as crests of families or chiefs. They recount stories owned by those families or chiefs, or commemorate special occasions. In Greek mythology, *Poseidon was the cause and god of earthquakes*. When he was in a bad mood, he struck the ground with a trident, causing earthquakes and other calamities. He also used earthquakes to punish and inflict fear upon people as revenge. Raigor is originally a bull (*tauren*), the animal symbol of the god Poseidon.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Elder Titan.** “The one we know as the Elder Titan was a great innovator, one who studied at the forge of creation. He spends his time forever seeking a way to accomplish the repairs, that he might rejoin the parts of his broken soul.”  *The Titans* are a race of deities originally worshiped as part of Ancient Greek religion. They were often considered to be the second generation of divine beings, succeeding the primordial deities and preceding the Olympians. *Prometheus* is a Titan, culture hero, and trickster figure who is credited with the creation of man from clay, and who defies the gods by stealing fire and giving it to humanity, an act that enabled progress and civilization. Prometheus is known for his intelligence and as a champion of humankind and also seen as the author of the human arts and sciences generally. Much like in the Elder Titan lore, Prometheus spends eternity in suffering, the eagle of **Zeus** pecking away at his liver day by day.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Huskar.** The Sacred Warrior, Huskar’s spirit had been saved from eternity by the priest Dazzle. Huskar’s concept possibly originates with the *human sacrificing* of prisoners in *Aztec* Warfare, which would explain his ties to Dazzle (a jungle shaman) and Bloodseeker (whom also has a pre-Columbian flavour). Another possibility is *King Arthur's messianic return*, an aspect of the legend of King Arthur, the mythical 6th-century British king. One recurrent aspect of Arthurian literature was the notion that he would one day return in the role of a messiah to save his people (Nothl Realm, possibly resurrected by Merlin – Dazzle, a druid which abuses his powers to correct history).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Io.** “Io is nothing less than the sum of all attractive and repulsive forces within the material field, a sentient manifestation of the charge that bind existence together. It is only in the controlled warping of these electrical waylines that Io's presence can be experienced on the physical plane.” This is an obvious reference to Gravity and Electromagnetism, two of the four fundamental forces in the universe. Io is also a mythological being, a priestess of Hera who became one of *Zeus'* lovers. **Zeus gave Io the power to conquer the Aegis for OG**, and out of jealousy Hera (IceFrog) turned her into a cow. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Kunkka.** The Flying Dutchman is a legendary *ghost ship* that can never make port and is doomed to sail the oceans forever. The myth is likely to have originated from the 17th-century golden age of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). Sightings in the 19th and 20th centuries reported the ship to be glowing with ghostly light. In ocean lore, the sight of this phantom ship is a portent of doom.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Legion Commander.**  A Roman legion was a large military unit of the Roman army. The size of a typical legion varied throughout the history of ancient Rome, with complements of 4,200 legionaries and 300 equites. “Triage!” (LC response for denying own creeps). *Decimation* was a form of Roman military discipline in which every tenth man in a group was executed by his cohorts. The discipline was used by senior commanders in the Roman Army to punish units or large groups guilty of capital offences, such as cowardice, mutiny, desertion, and insubordination, and for pacification of rebellious legions. The word decimation is derived from Latin meaning \"removal of a tenth\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Lifestealer.** “Two minds inhabit the single form--a nameless creature of malevolent cunning, and the Master whose voice he pretends to obey.” Dr. Henry Jekyll and his alternative personality, Mr. Edward Hyde, is a fictional character in Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 novella Strange Case of **Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde**. Dr. Henry Jekyll feels he is battling between the good and evil within himself, thus leading to the struggle with his alter ego, Edward Hyde. He spends his life trying to repress evil urges that are not fitting for a man of his stature. He develops a serum in an attempt to mask this hidden evil. However, in doing so, Jekyll transforms into Hyde, a hideous creature without compassion or remorse. Jekyll has a friendly personality, but as Hyde, he becomes mysterious and violent. **Gollum** is a fictional character from J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. He was introduced in the 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, and became an important character in its sequel, The Lord of the Rings. Gollum was a Stoor Hobbit[1] of the River-folk, who lived near the Gladden Fields.[2] Originally known as Sméagol, he was corrupted by the One Ring and later named Gollum after his habit of making \"a horrible swallowing noise in his throat\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Lycan.** In folklore, a werewolf (Old English: werwulf, \"man-wolf\"), or occasionally lycanthrope (Greek: lukánthrōpos, \"wolf-person\"), is a human with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf (or, especially in modern film, a therianthropic hybrid wolf-like creature), either purposely or after being placed under a curse or affliction (often a bite or scratch from another werewolf) and especially on the night of a full moon.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Magnus.** The *woolly rhinoceros* (Coelodonta antiquitatis) is an extinct species of rhinoceros that was common throughout Europe and northern Asia during the Pleistocene epoch and survived until the end of the last glacial period. Magnus is named after *Gustav Magnus*, a German physicist who discovered the Magnus effect, an effect in which a spinning ball/cylinder curves away from its principle flight path.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Mars.** In ancient Roman religion and myth, Mars was the god of war and also an agricultural guardian, a combination characteristic of early Rome. He was second in importance only to Jupiter and he was the most prominent of the military gods in the religion of the Roman army. Most of his festivals were held in March, the month named for him (Latin Martius), and in October, which began the season for military campaigning and ended the season for farming. The word **arena** derives from Latin harena, a particularly fine-grained sand that covered the floor of ancient arenas such as the Colosseum in Rome, Italy, to absorb blood.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Night Stalker.** A vampire is a being from folklore that subsists by feeding on the vital force (generally in the form of blood) of the living. Over time, some attributes now regarded as integral became incorporated into the vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared over the course of the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth, and Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) fearing daylight.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Omniknight.** “Purist Thunderwrath was a hard-fighting, road-worn, deeply committed knight, sworn to the order in which he had grown up as squire to elder knights of great reputation. He had spent his entire life in the service of the Omniscience, the All Seeing One.” A military order (Latin: militaris ordinis) is a Christian religious society of knights. The original military orders were the Knights Templar, the Knights Hospitaller and the Teutonic Knights. They arose in the Middle Ages in association with the Crusades, their members being dedicated to the protection of pilgrims and the defence of the Crusader states. They are the predecessors of the secular chivalric orders.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Phoenix.** In Greek mythology, a **phoenix** (/ˈfiːnɪks/; Ancient Greek: φοῖνιξ, phoînix) is a long-lived bird that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. Associated with the Sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the ashes of its predecessor. According to some sources, the phoenix dies in a show of flames and combustion. In Greek mythology, **Icarus** is the son of the master craftsman Daedalus, the creator of the Labyrinth. Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris, asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings nor the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun; when the wax in his wings melted he tumbled out of the sky and fell into the sea where he drowned, sparking the idiom \"don't fly too close to the sun\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pudge.** Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus is a novel written by English author Mary Shelley (1797–1851) that tells the story of Victor **Frankenstein**, a young scientist who creates a hideous sapient creature in an unorthodox scientific experiment. Shelley described Frankenstein's monster as an 8-foot-tall (2.4 m) creature of hideous contrasts: “His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.” Additionally, there are cases of people suffering from mental illness engaging in **cannibalism** for sexual pleasure, such as Jeffrey Dahmer and Albert Fish.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Sand King.** *The Scorpion King* is a 2002 American historical fantasy action film directed by Chuck Russell, starring The Rock. The events of The Scorpion King take place 5,000 years before the events of The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, revealing Mathayus' origins and his rise to power as the legendary hero, the Scorpion King. The name is a reference to a historical king of the Protodynastic Period of Egypt, King Scorpion.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Slardar** Slardar's voice lines \"That is not dead that can eternal lie.\" and  \"And with strange aeons even death may die.\" are direct quotes from H. P. Lovecraft's short story The Nameless City. R'lyeh is a lost city that was first documented in the H. P. Lovecraft short story \"The Call of Cthulhu\", first published in Weird Tales in June 1928. R'lyeh is a sunken city in the South Pacific and the prison of the entity called Cthulhu: “The nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh…was built in measureless eons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults.”\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Spirit Breaker.** In Latin/from Ancient Greek barathrum = A pit, especially one at Athens into which criminals were thrown. The abyss, hell. In Greek mythology, the **Minotaur** is a mythical creature portrayed in Classical times with the head and tail of a bull and the body of a man or, as described by Roman poet Ovid, a being \"part man and part bull\". He dwelt at the center of the Labyrinth, which was an elaborate maze-like construction designed by the architect Daedalus and his son Icarus, on the command of King Minos of Crete. The Minotaur was eventually killed by the Athenian hero Theseus.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Sven.** “Sven is the bastard son of a Vigil Knight, born of a Pallid Meranth, raised in the Shadeshore Ruins. With his father executed for violating the Vigil Codex, and his mother shunned by her wild race”. **Sir Galahad** is a character from Arthurian legend- a knight of the Round Table and the son of Sir Lancelot. Legend says that Galahad searched for and later found the Holy Grail earning him the name 'The Grail Knight', as he was the only one on earth considered by God worthy of finding the Holy Grail. It is said that when he drank from the grail, he was surrounded by light and ascended to heaven. A rōnin (浪人, \"drifter\" or \"wanderer\") was a samurai without a lord or master during the feudal period (1185–1868) of Japan. A samurai became masterless upon the death of his master, or after the loss of his master's favor or privilege.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tidehunter.** *Leviathan* is a creature with the form of a sea monster from Jewish belief, referenced in the Hebrew Bible in the Book of Job, Psalms, the Book of Isaiah, and the Book of Amos. The Leviathan of the Book of Job is a reflection of the older Canaanite Lotan, a primeval monster defeated by the god Hadad. The word later came to be used as a term for \"great whale\" as well as of sea monsters in general. The *kraken* is a legendary cephalopod-like sea monster of giant size in Scandinavian folklore. According to the Norse sagas, the kraken dwells off the coasts of Norway and Greenland and terrorizes nearby sailors. Authors over the years have postulated that the legend may have originated from sightings of giant squids that may grow to 13–15 meters (40–50 feet) in length.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Timbersaw.** The Sudarshana **Chakra** (सुदर्शन चक्र) is a spinning, disk-like weapon,literally meaning \"disk of auspicious vision,\" having 108 serrated edges used by the Hindu god Vishnu. The chakram is a throwing weapon from the Indian subcontinent. It is circular with a sharpened outer edge and a diameter of 12–30 centimetres (4.7–11.8 in).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tiny.** In Norse mythology, the Jotun are often opposed to the gods. While often translated as \"giants\", most are described as being roughly human sized. Some are portrayed as huge, such as frost giants (hrímþursar), fire giants (eldjötnar), and **mountain giants** (bergrisar). **Enceladus** was one of the Giants, who according to Hesiod, were the offspring of Gaia, born from the blood that fell when Uranus was castrated by their son Cronus. The Giants fought Zeus and the other Olympian gods in the Gigantomachy, their epic battle for control of the cosmos. The Latin poet Horace has Enceladus use *trees as spears*. Enceladus (like other vanquished monsters, thought to be buried under volcanos) was said to be the cause of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Treant Protector.** *Ents* are a race of beings in J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy world Middle-earth who closely resemble trees. They are similar to the talking trees in folklore around the world. Their name is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word for giant. The Ents appear in The Lord of the Rings as ancient shepherds of the forest and allies of the free peoples of Middle-earth during the War of the Ring. The Ent who figures most prominently in the book is Treebeard, who (credibly) claims to be the oldest creature in Middle-earth.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tusk.** In Norse mythology, **Ymir** is the ancestor of all jötnar. The Poetic Edda refer to Ymir as a primeval being who was born from venom that dripped from the icy rivers Élivágar and lived in the grassless void of Ginnungagap. Ymir birthed a male and female from the pits of his arms, and his legs together begat a six-headed being. The gods Odin, Vili and Vé fashioned the Earth (elsewhere personified as a goddess; Jörð) from his flesh, from his blood the ocean, from his bones the mountains, from his hair the trees, from his brains the clouds, from his skull the heavens, and from his eyebrows the middle realm in which mankind lives, Midgard. In addition, one stanza relates that the dwarfs were given life by the gods from Ymir's flesh and blood (or the Earth and sea).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Underlord.** In religion, an *abyss* is a bottomless *pit*, or also a chasm that may lead to the underworld or hell. In the Dictionnaire Infernal (English: Infernal Dictionary), a book on demonology, organised in hellish hierarchies, **Baal** is the commander in chief of the armies of Hell.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Undying.** A *zombie* (Haitian French: zombi, Haitian Creole: zonbi) is a fictional undead being created through the reanimation of a corpse. Zombies are most commonly found in horror and fantasy genre works. The term comes from Haitian folklore, in which a zombie is a dead body reanimated through various methods, most commonly magic. Modern depictions of the reanimation of the dead do not necessarily involve magic but often invoke science fictional methods such as carriers, radiation, mental diseases, vectors, pathogens, scientific accidents, etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Wraith King.** “For untold years, King Ostarion built a kingdom from the remains of his enemies.” Countess Elizabeth Báthory was a Hungarian noblewoman and reputed serial killer from the noble family of Báthory. The stories of her sadistic serial murders are verified by the testimony of more than 300 witnesses and survivors as well as physical evidence and the presence of horribly mutilated dead, dying and imprisoned girls found at the time of her arrest. Stories describing her **vampire**-like tendencies (most famously the tale that she bathed in the blood of virgins to retain her youth) were generally recorded years after her death, and are considered unreliable. Her story quickly became part of national folklore, and her infamy persists to this day. She is often compared to Vlad the Impaler of Wallachia (on whom the fictional Count Dracula is partly based); some insist she inspired Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897),though there is no evidence to support this hypothesis. Nicknames and literary epithets attributed to her include The Blood Countess and Countess Dracula.",

He'd tried regularly for years. He'd only found normal rocks that had been displaced by quite a bit.\n\n\nI looked at the local surface geology. I looked at the layers of geology that were exposed in the crater basin. I could tell what most of them were from DF. \n\n\nThen I looked at the rocks around the area more closely. Took me about three minutes to find a type of rock that did not belong to any of the local geology layers. \n\n\nI looked at the guide and told him I'd found what he'd been looking for.\n\n\nHe told me that was very implausible. He would graciously allow me to test the radiation level of the rock I'd picked out, but I should not get my hopes up because much more experienced people than I had looked for years.\n\n\nWe took my chosen rock to the geiger counter. It was, indeed, notably radioactive. We compared it to several other local rock samples that I told them were naturally occuring, just to make sure it, and the results were very clear cut. \n\n\nThat guide was seriously vexed. He'd been looking for the wrong kind of thing for years at this crater, because he didn't know any geology. He couldn't tell what belonged in the local rocks, and what didn't.\n\n\nStill super pleased with myself and DF about it.\n\n\nOnce we knew what to look for, turned out there were huge patches of the radioactive rock in the area.

In short:\n\n*   Wear SPF 30-50 every day while using any topical retinoid, including Differin.\n*   Avoid the eye area (lid and thin undereye) as well as the lips and areas next to the nasal passages.\n*   Apply a pea-sized amount. Dr. Dray demonstrates this amount in her video. It is quite literally roughly the size of a pea.\n*   Apply after cleansing and moisturizing your skin, once your moisturizer has dried down. Don't use overly occlusive moisturizers before Differin application, like heavy oils.\n*   Do not introduce new products right before or while using Differin. The reason for this is that if you begin to break out from the new product, it can be misinterpreted as breaking out from the Differin.\n*   Retinoids are not pregnancy safe. Please speak with your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant before using Differin or any topical retinoid, including retinol.\n\n[If you do best by watching videos, Dr. Dray has an excellent video on this process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF0Sw_wVqgs). \n\n* * *\n\n##Starting Differin\n\n\nWhen you first start using Differin, you'll want to ween your skin into it. While some skin is very tolerant and can withstand every night almost immediately, for more sensitive skin types this can be a bit more of a process. I've written some general guidelines below, but please note that all skin is different so you may need to tweak this depending on your own skin.\n\n*   **Tolerant Skin.** If your skin is quite tolerant of topical therapies and rarely shows signs of irritation and peeling, feel free to begin applying a pea-sized amount of  Differin once a day, at night, after cleansing and applied over your moisturizer as Dr. Dray demonstrates above. If your skin begins to feel tender or like it is burning, even after application of a bland moisturizer, cut down to usage every other day.\n*   **Normal/Sensitive Skin.** If your skin is sensitive or relatively normal, apply a pea-sized amount of Differin every other night (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, etc.), after cleansing and applied over your moisturizer, as demonstrated above. If your skin begins to feel tender, even after application of a bland moisturizer, cut down to every third night.\n*   **Very Sensitive Skin.** If your skin frequently shows signs of irritation to new products, particularly things like AHA, BHA, or vitamin C serums, or if you have rosacea, you may want to start by applying a pea-sized amount, over moisturized, clean skin every third night. This is where I started. After a few weeks, your skin should be able to tolerate every other night without excessive burning, tenderness, or peeling. If it does, cut back to every third night.\n\nIf your skin starts to feel a-okay with every third night or even every other night, try to bump up frequency. The goal is to be able to use it every night, but if your skin never feels comfortable at that point, that is okay - use it as frequently as you can. Remember that for everything, everyone's skin is different and beautiful. Your mileage may vary.\n\nWhat to Expect\n------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Some tenderness.** As a point of reference, my skin is more sensitive to being scratched, hot water, scruffy beards, and chemical filter sunscreens, particularly sunscreens with avobenzone, since starting Differin.\n*   **Micro-peels.** Wearing makeup will be a challenge during the adjustment period (about two months) of using Differin. Your skin will look and feel smooth, but application of foundation will show very fine peeling all over the skin. *This is okay and normal.* If your skin is ever showing thick \"sheets\" of peeling, you should back down on usage. *Your skin should not be shedding like a snake from Differin .1%*\n*   **Slightly more breakouts.** Experiencing slightly more breakouts for the first few weeks is normal and fine. They should not be extremely aggressive or much worse than the breakouts you were experiencing before, particularly if your acne is mild.\n*   **Dryness.** Dryness is very typical with any retinoid product, particularly during the first 4 weeks. Apply more moisturizer than usual and more frequently throughout the day, if needed. Do not use occlusives like Vaseline on your skin before applying Differin, as this can inhibit some of the absorption of Differin.\n\n* * *\n\n##Combining Therapies at Home\n\n\n**[Referring back to my post I made previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/92hhpw/misc_skincare_ingredients_tretinoin_adapalene_and/) once again, all retinoids (and frankly, all acne treatments) are best when used as a combination therapy all over the affected area (in this case, the face).** The following is a listing of the ingredients that can be combined with Differin and how to use them. \n\nBenzoyl Peroxide (BP)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nBP is not a new drug. First shown to be effective against acne in 1934 (though not explored as a treatment for acne until the 1960s when William Pace began to treat patients with a precipitated sulphur cream that contained BP), it is now often prescribed as a treatment for mild-to-moderate acne in conjunction with topical retinoids, particularly adapalene (Differin). The FDA has permitted use of benzoyl peroxide in OTC concentrations of 2.5-10%. \n\n[Details of randomised, double blind clinical studies using BP for the treatment of acne](https://skinolog.ist/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BP_studies.jpg).\n\nIt has keratolytic, moderate comedolytic, and antibacterial properties, \"which include the reduction of *P. acnes* and *Staphylococcus aureus* on skin.\"¹ It is a largely vehicle-dependent drug, meaning that the formulation matters. One journal notes this: \"Many formulations incorporate BP crystals that vary in size and do not necessarily fully dissolve completely or at the same rate. Larger crystals that are not capable of settling into the follicular ostia due to their size may randomly rest on the skin surface for more prolongued periods of time, thus producing scattered foci of 'hot spots' that may present as patches of cutaneous irritation.\"¹ \n\nIn addition, in three double-blind studies 2.5% BP gel was been found to be just as effective as 5% and 10% preparations with fewer side effects due to the lower concentration of the drug. \n\nTo combine with Differin at home, I recommend finding it in a wash, such as PanOxyl, or Differin's brand \"Daily Deep\" Cleanser, which contains 5% Benzoyl Peroxide. Feel free to use BP in this form twice a week or every other night - whichever you and your skin are most comfortable with. This is a form of short-contact therapy (an effective way to use benzoyl peroxide with less side effects) that can also be done with gels or creams as well, especially if cleansers are too drying for your skin. In one study on short-contact therapy:\n\n> *Short contact therapy utilizing a 2 minute skin contact time with BP 9.8% emollient foam used once daily over a 2 week duration was highly effective in reducing the quantity of P acnes organisms on the back and provided comparable colony count reduction to \"leave on\" therapy using BP 5.3% emollient foam. ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22777224))*\n\nFor gels or creams, I sound like a broken record about this brand, but I do genuinely love Paula's Choice BPO formulations. I have a small, travel-sized tube of their 5% formulation (which is not more efficacious than their 2.5%, but I had to test it!) and I love it. Unlike most BP formulations that crust up and sit as a film on the skin, the PC BP spreads easily and sinks in. Acne.org also has a pretty wonderful formulation of 2.5% BP that I used many years ago. \n\nAn additional note about BP is that is must be used *all over* to be effective as a combination treatment. While it is frequently billed a spot treatment product, BP really shines when it is allowed to treat acne *before* it becomes a problem, by blasting *P. acnes* and unseen microcomedones. This is why infrequent short-contact therapy is ideal, as the whole face can become quite sensitized when you're new to Differin. \n\nTo use a cream or gel as short contact therapy, use it over your moisturizer, before washing your face. If this bothers you, wash your face very gently first, removing any makeup or sunscreen, and patting dry with a towel. Apply a thin layer all over, let sit for two minutes, and rinse away. Apply your moisturizer while skin is still damp to prevent TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) and let dry completely before applying a thin layer of Differin (about 20 minutes, if you are using it on the same day you use Differin). \n\nTo use a benzoyl peroxide cleanser, follow the instructions on the bottle, after removing any sunscreen and makeup with an oil-cleanser. Apply your moisturizer immediately after, while skin is still damp, to prevent TEWL and let dry completely before applying a thin layer of Differin. \n\nIf your skin feels particularly raw, painful, or chapped from the introduction of BP, cut down on frequency, use it on the \"rest\" day that you aren't using Differin, or remove it all together to let your skin heal before re-introducing. *Please note that these instructions are not for use with Duac, a prescription topical combining clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide*.\n\nSalicylic Acid (BHA)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSalicylic acid (SA) is in a class of ingredients known as hydroxy acids, which I've referenced before. SA is a lipophilic (oil-friendly, meaning it is ideal for oilier skin types or in conjunction with oily products) compound and found in a plethora of products. While frequently considered as the oil-friendly version of AHA, it differs from AHAs in how it exfoliates the skin (desquamation, keratolytic) as well as it's ability to prevent the formation of comedones (comedolytic). To quote a journal that overviews the many OTC treatments for acne:\n\n> **[On AHA]** *At lower concentrations, AHA functions as an exfoliant, interrupting corneocyte adhesion in the upper SC by interfering with formation of ionic bonds. As a result, AHAs promote individual corneocyte desquamation and decrease corneocyte clumping, both of which lead to smoother skin texture and decreased visible scaling and flaking; a decrease in follicular hyperkeratois promotes resolution and prevents formation of AV lesions, especially comedones. ...* \n\n>**[On BHA/SA]** *Due to its desmolytic properties, salicylic acid promotes individual corneocyte desquamation, thus simulating natural exfoliation, and exerts moderate comedolytic activity. The desmolytic and comedolytic properties of salicylic acid are concentration-dependent. In fact, salicylic acid is not keratolytic. Rather, it exerts its effect on SC desquamation by breaking the bonds created by corneodesmosomes, also called the “rivets” or “staples” of the SC, which sustain the adherence between contiguous corneocytes. ... The “physiological” desquamation provided by salicylic acid provides smoother texture and appearance to the skin and can give the illusion of decreased pore sizes.*\n\nThe journal goes on to add: \"Unfortunately, lower concentrations of salicylic acid may provide only a modest desmolytic [the process of breaking down carbon-to-carbon double bonds, such as between skin cells] activity, thus producing minimal therapeutic effects.\" In shorter terms, your mileage may vary. Some people find great success with BHAs while others feel like it does very little for them.\n\nOver the counter formulations can appear in 0.05% to 5%, while higher concentrations of SA are reserved for prescriptions and chemical peels. \n\nThese features make it less ideal (and much less studied) than BP for combination therapy with Differin, especially in lower percentages or untested formulations, but for some it may prove useful or even better than BP. \n\nTo use it with Differin, look for unscented washes or leave-on applications and use on clean, moisturized skin, before applying Differin or every-other-night, when not using Differin. Many people like Stridex pads due to their wide availability, but the formulation can be irritating to some. My personal favorite is (again - I swear I am not sponsored, I just really love their active ingredients) Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid (Extra Strength, if using her acne line). CosRX also has a couple products, if you prefer Asian beauty products. \n\nFor cleansers, there are fewer options. Clinique has one that is fairly pricey and Dr. Dray loves the classic orange, oil-free Neutrogena cleanser in the pump (not the bar!). Use after removing makeup, following the directions on the bottle, and immediately apply your moisturizer to prevent TEWL. Once dry, apply a thin layer of Differin. \n\nThe risks with BHA combination therapy are largely the same as BP - redness, dryness, tenderness. If you begin to feel any of these effects, cut down on the frequency of usage of BHA before cutting back on Differin. If needed, remove the BHA entirely until your skin heals.\n\nGlycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid (AHAs)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAHAs or Alpha Hydroxy Acids are a group of products that include glycolic, lactic, mandelic, and fruit acids. While the exact mechanism of these ingredients is rather poorly understood, it is known that they exert some effect by thinning the stratum corneum (SC) - the upper most layer of the epidermis - as well as dispersing basal layer melanin and increasing collagen synthesis in higher concentrations. \n\nAs mentioned above, AHAs can be helpful for some conditions of hyperkeratinization where the epidermal thickening impairs the SC permeability, resulting in skin fissures (microfissuring and macrofissuring). The most extreme examples of macrofissuring is usually seen on hands or feet, where the skin may split or \"fissure.\" At low concentrations (below 8%), AHAs disrupt the corneocyte adhesion. To re-iterate from above:\n\n>*At lower concentrations, AHA functions as an exfoliant, interrupting corneocyte adhesion in the upper SC by interfering with formation of ionic bonds. As a result, AHAs promote individual corneocyte desquamation and decrease corneocyte clumping, both of which lead to smoother skin texture and decreased visible scaling and flaking; a decrease in follicular hyperkeratois promotes resolution and prevents formation of AV lesions, especially comedones. Higher concentrations of AHAs (8-10%) can lead to both epidermolysis and thickening of the dermis.*\n\nFor some, this action can prove helpful when used in conjunction with retinoids, which most frequently cause peeling and dryness. \n\nTo use with Differin, look for low percentages to start with (4-8%) in leave-on products. Glycolic, while the most effective form of AHA, is quite irritating to some skin types due to it's ability to work quickly. Mandelic and lactic acid are especially gentle forms of AHAs due to their larger molecules that penetrate slower and may allow some people to use AHAs when they otherwise wouldn't be able to. \n\nTo start, add them to your routine on your off-nights and work up tolerability from there. Some people also find value in using short-contact therapy with AHAs - particularly glycolic - though this limits their efficacy, particularly with forms that penetrate much slower, such as mandelic acid. Some popular brands of AHAs are Paula's Choice (8% Glycolic Gel), Pixi Glow Tonic (note: this contains several plant extracts, which can be very irritating), Nip + Fab pads (also contain fragrance and plant extracts), The Ordinary (7% Glycolic Solution as well as 10% Lactic), Stratia (10% Mandelic), and as CosRX (Glycolic Acid). \n\nIt is not advised to use an AHA in a cleanser, as it is often not on the skin long enough to create noticeable differences.\n\nAs with all of the other above combinations, if you begin to experience redness, soreness, dryness, or irritation, cut down frequency and remove entirely if needed to allow your skin to heal.\n\n\nAzelaic Acid (AzA)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nA natural component of everyone's skin, azelaic acid (AzA) is also a viable combination therapy, and there are increasingly more products available over-the-counter that contain this ingredient. While AzA is not frequently prescribed for acne, it can be very helpful for some skin types, particularly those that are very sensitive. \n\nUnfortunately, there are no good studies around AzA when used with Differin, but there are studies around AzA in comparison to clindamycin and BP. Specifically, one study showed it to be as effective as 5% BP as well as 1% clindamycin in a randomized controlled study with 351 patients (BP gel) and 229 patients (clindamycin).\n\n> *Azelaic acid 15% gel proved to be as effective as BPO and clindamycin with median % reduction of the inflamed lesion (papules and pustules) of 70%, and 71% respectively. The azelaic acid gel was well-tolerated, the side effects (local burning and irritation) were distinctly less than with BPO but more pronounced than with clindamycin. Despite these side effects, the treatment was well-accepted by the majority of patients. (Abstract, [source](http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/16281587))*\n\nAzA is also bacteriostatic, meaning that it can suppress the ability for bacteria to reproduce, which can help inflammation. It also suppresses hyper-proliferation of keratin, which is a factor in acne. \n\nUnfortunately, it does take time to work and the side-effects when initially starting off can be aggravating. The most common side-effects are itching and stinging as well as mild dryness or peeling. This tends to resolve within 4 weeks. This can be difficult to push through. As someone who uses AzA, I can say that the initial itching upon application canfeel very intense and aggravating to deal with, though icing my skin helped me push through the worst days. Your mileage may vary.\n\nTo use AzA with Differin, I recommend trying to use it in your “off” nights, when not using Differin. If your skin tolerates this fine, feel free to use it every night. AzA is typically pretty gentle, but the itching can feel *very* intense if you have never used it before, especially when used on sensitive skin or skin that is sensitized from other ingredients.\n\nThere are a few trustworthy AzA topicals available over-the-counter in the US. Paula’s Choice makes one that contains 10% AzA and 2% BHA, which I reviewed. The Ordinary also makes a 10% AzA, though it feels quite powdery and silicone-y, which some people dislike. Garden of Wisdom is another option, especially for people sensitive to many ingredients. Their product is an 8% serum that receives a lot of love, though I have never used it myself.\n\nAnother option is Melazepam Cream (20% AzA). However, I want to mention that this formula contains two oils, which may inhibit some of it’s efficacy. Specifically, in a study involving 15% AzA, waiting until after moisturizing seemed to result in greater penetration of AzA in all moisturizers tested except for one, which contained an oil (macadamia nut oil). It was surmised that this was due to the occlusivity of the oil. Another potential issue is that Melazepam is made in Israel – something that may concern some consumers.\n\nIf you feel irritation or the itching is incredibly intense, try to back down on usage. I have found that applying a cool ice pack (wrapped in a towel so you aren't pressing such an extreme cold to your skin) can really help soothe some of the \"itch.\"\n\nSulfur\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTopical sulfur is another option, though hard to find and frequently found in masks and other short-contact products. Sulfur exhibits antimicrobial properties and has been used for hundreds of years to treat AV as well as seborrheic dermatitis. It is frequently found in formulas up to 10% in combination with other products, particularly resorcinol, which is thought to be antibacterial, antifungal, and keratolytic.\n\nUnfortunately, topical sulfur frequently causes mild irritation and sensitization, and has limited popularity.\n\nQueen Helene’s Mint Julep Mask is a popular product with sulfur, as well as the ProActiv mask. I would advise anyone using the Mint Julep Mask in particular with Differin to be cautious, as the clay (kaolin) can be very drying to skin that is already dry and peeling, and the fragrance content is fairly high, making it a potentially extremely irritating choice of treatment.\n\n---\n\nWhatever you decide, it is important to be consistent and not treat either the Differin or the combination product as a spot treatment. While this is a popular way to avoid irritation and sensitization, it only treats the symptom, not the disease, which is to say that it is only treating the comedone once it has surfaced as a larger issue rather than treating the root of the problem: the formation of microcomedones. Differin takes roughly twelve weeks to see full results, and products like AzA can take even longer. Whatever you decide, stick with it and listen to your skin by backomg off when it feels a bit more sensitive and moving up slowly in application when you feel you're adjusting.\n\n---\n\n##Sources\n\n\n1.

Also  the Remnant is a concrete unit that you can see on your control group ,Plus you can select the unit and see the time left on the remnant.\n\nOn the Other hand in DotA2 you can't target Remnants with Kaolin first and third skills, And you don't have an indicator that you are actually targeting the remnant, in the form of you mouse cursor. Also  the remnant is not a concrete unit that you can see on your control group, In addition you can't select the unit and see the time left on the remnant. \n\nIt's like Psuedu targeting another dimension of units that are single targeted with a ground targeted invisible hit-box.\n\nThat my friends makes the hero actually not fun to play for people who played this hero a lot in DotA, and have a feel for it. And that makes the hero really annoying to play on DotA 2. (considering you are used to DotA Kaolin )Moreover it makes it really hard (compared to DotA) to  land your spells in game time high speed environment ,with a terrain crowded with units that doesn't interact with your other dimension remnants  in the optimal way.\n\nFor me it is a total game breaker , I feel like the hero is incomplete.\n\n**Please no spam about how bad the video quality is(or on my desktop) I did my best\n,first  video I created via video capture +I have a shitty crummy Scurvy Laptop**\n\n\n",

If u put a stone into the cogs and try to pull it, u will most likely pull clock or a creep rather than the stone.",

MAKE IT OBVIOUS. \n\nI mean, they're clearly not going to make the remnants non-particles again, even though that would solve a lot of problems with them flying off slightly too far for vision during the night (fucking constantly) and not even giving them 0 vision range so you can still target the things.\n\nThere's not much you can do about going to punch a rock and having a teammate waddle over it right when you click and getting punched in instead.

It was like smell heaven for my face. \n\nNot only that, but they have a ton of other raw ingredients so that you can mix your own creams, lotions, body washes, makeup, and cleansers. They have an entire WALL of every oil under the sun--did you know that you can buy **broccoli seed** oil? HOLY SHIT YOU GUYS.\n\nOther stuff that I saw...

Emulsifiers, creams, exfoliants.They have powder mineral mixtures to create your own makeup. My mind is blown. And nothing really seems that expensive to me--am I crazy? AM I CRAZY? \n\nEach product page explains what the product is, what is does, what it's for, and what kind of product to put it in (cream, hair conditioner, mask, etc.). \n\nSorry that the website is totally in French, but if y'all ever go to Paris, make it an absolute must to visit this store. \n\nI am suuuper sorry if this seems like a marketing thing, but I found this place today and I was [like...](http://i.imgur.com/KffH8.jpg) and then I was [like...](http://i.imgur.com/vZL1m.gif) and then I was [like.](http://i.imgur.com/Zn8nf.gif) And then I felt compelled to share. \n\nedit: [here](http://www.aroma-zone.com/info/recettes/cosmetiques-maison?field_type_recette=cosmetique&limit=all) are a bunch of the recipes listed on their site to give an example of what you can mix up at this place.\n\neditII: ugh, I just found [UVA/UVB protection.](http://www.aroma-zone.com/info/fiche-technique/actif-cosmetique-ecran-solaire-naturel-aroma-zone)",

    "body": "Hero abilities can be found [here!](http://www.playdota.com/changelogs/6.78)\n\nSo what do you guys think of the two new heroes? I think Earth Spirit introduces some *very* interesting mechanics into the game, what with his \"innate\" ability that reminds me in some ways of the passive skills that every Champion has in LoL. Presumably, Kaolin's stones will be separate units that can be movable, so positioning his boulders correctly for the maximum effects on his abilities will require micro skills. Actually, for those of you who do play LoL, Kaolin reminds me of Syndra. I look forward to hearing from those who are more knowledgable and observant than I!\n\nAs for Nerif, he seems like a dedicated support. His ulti looks really, really good, turning any ally on the team into a pseudo-Slark for the duration, but I'm struggling to see the practical applications of his second and third skills, particularly his third.\n\nSo, for those of you who are more versed than I in these kinds of things, what do you think of the new heroes? What kind of items do you think would be best, and why? I look forward to reading your thoughts!\n",

They don't seem too Dota-esque - especially the Earth Spirit. The mechanics are quite awesome, but doesn't he stray a bit too much from the ~standard~ of Dota/Dota 2 heroes ? Hope you guys get my point.\n\nJudging by first looks and sample plays in War3, The Oracle can play from anything to a mid-ganker type of hero to a hard support of sorts. He's really versatile, I sort of like the concept.\n\nOn the other hand, the Panda fella is weird. He seems to require a lot of levels, since all his spells are quite good and need levels. Also his melee-forcestaff spell PLUS buying a force staff early on him is probably really ridiculous.",

        "body": "I know a lot of people are focusing on Kaolin, but Nerif seems straight-up absurd. A skill-by-skill look:\n\n* Fortune's End. On the face of it, this is a pretty standard nuke with decent efficiency and a mediocre purge attached. However, this is one of a small number of non-ultimate purges, which can be quite effective, and it combos nicely with the rest of his skill set, by stripping regen off of the target.\n* Fate's Edict. What the fuck? Seriously; what the FUCK? A six-second disarm for 50 mana on a 14s CD? And it amps physical damage received by 50%? This is anticarry potential like we've not seen in a long, long time. My initial reaction is that this is skilled later, but you may pick up a point for the disable early on. Gut reaction is that the rotation is Flames, Fortune's End, Fate's Edict, bang on them, Flames. Seriously; it's hard to overstate how good this skill is in late game matchups.\n* Purifying Flames. Super efficient nuke with a downside. Cooldown is really fucking short. Heroes hit with it will net 9/18/27/36 HP if the regeneration is allowed to go to duration. Seems like it is worth casting on your carry before ulting them, as they will come out of the ultimate and immediately get 18/36/54/72 HP from the doubled healing. At level 4 of this and the purge, we're going to see Nerif nuke for 660 magic damage, and with a 3s CD he can immediately blast again. That makes Nerif an immensely viable mid-game roamer, in my estimation. I think it is unlikely that Purifying Flames will make it to Dota 2 without seeing a cooldown increase.\n* False Promise. This is being compared to Shallow Grave, and it's not, at all. Shallow Grave is *reactive*, and lifesaving. Using False Promise to save someone is going to go poorly for you, unless you have a lot of healing readily available. As a tool to allow your carry to get some damage in, this will be great, but it will result in a LOT of dead carries after teamfights since the carry player has no tools to estimate how much damage they're taking. Between this and Fate's Edict, Nerif will be an immensely valuable carry-versus-carry support; the team with Nerif wins the fight, period.\n\nOverall, I'm very impressed with the power on this bad boy. I'll have to play him to see how he actually holds up, but on paper he has insane early and midgame nuking tools, and transitions into a support that can proactively turn the tides of a teamfight if he stays up.\n\nEdit: I think Fate's Edict is Magic Resist and not immunity, which means you could throw it on someone and then heal them for almost 400 with Flames.

        "body": "Nerif's second and third skills are actually the more interesting parts. You cast your second skill to a guy getting chased by painful magic damage dealers and cast flames on him to give him a **stackable 3s cd** +11/22/33/44hp regen while he has 100% magic resistance (no magic damage will hurt him). For 125 mana you can pretty much give anyone sitting around free 396hp over 9 seconds (with 3s cd as said). Fate's Edict can also help your Sven or whatever kill people faster after he lands his stun etc, and you can use flames as a quick finishing ability (or otherwise if you actually casted Fortune's End right after it) since it gives passive regen to the guy as well, but you definitely don't cast Flames after you cast Edict on enemies (100% spell resistance). Flames are non-lethal to allies as well.\n\nAs well as that, both his ult and Edict counter DoT's hard, and is probably the most straightforward counter to the spell Doom since you can either give 100% magic resistance or completely remove that negative status if I interpreted that correctly. Regardless his ultimate might well be too strong imo. Couple his ult with let's say just 1 purify and 2 shadow waves and you should get well above 1000HP healed by the end of the spell.\n\nHis AoE purge damage is pretty straightforward as well I think.\n\nKaolin I'm just worried about 5s silence being too strong over a 2400 toss range but I'm probably wrong. He looks pretty fun, and personally I feel he'll make a decent mid still. He has a 1400 range 125 damage 'AoE' spell for last hits and creep clearing (not unlike what NS does anyway with his single target nuke), and a quick 50 mana 1600 units 'logistics' spell to control runes, chase and gank.",

        "body": "Posted on PD forums too:\n\nOk, with a first glance I'd say the new Earth Spirit hero is a great support.\n\nInnate Skill: You start with 6 rocks which is the max stock and you get one every 25 seconds. You can place them at 1400 range and they stay active for 2 minutes. \n\n1st skill: Free Force Staff with damage, castable on any unit, can be used to send people chasing you far away. If you force a rock, it's a 2,5sec silence on whoever it hits. Can also be used for pre-dagger initiation for your teammates.\n\n2nd skill: You roll 800 range away and until you fine a hero. Damages for 180 to whoever you pass through. Passing through a rock doubles the range and speed and slows the hero you bump into by 80%. You can place a rock even when rolling, so it's pretty useful.\n\n3rd skill: Pulls an ally to you at 1000 speed (think of CK's stun), stunning enemies for 2.5 seconds. You can also pull a rock, which damages for a bit. Range 1400, great skill for saving mates. and Rock+Pull initiation.\n\n4th skill: Places a damaging debuff on units in 300AOE around you which does 50/75/100 dps for 6 seconds. It can be refreshed if they find a rock in 300AOE around themselves, but also exploding those rocks. So you can extend it for a long time if you place the rocks on them in the right time. Reminder that the debuff checks for rocks around the targets every second. \n\nThe great thing about this hero is the instant casting speed, so he can pull off his skills really easily.\n\n\nSo what you can do is: Rock behind the enemies (1400 ranges makes it easy), use your 3rd skill to pull and stun for 2.5 seconds, then your 1st one to silence for another 2.5 when the duration is over. Then possibly you can charge in with 2nd and ulti in then, while extending the debuff by either placing rocks on them or placing them in front of you and forcing them with your 1st (4 seconds CD on it).\n\nJust tested you can also place a rock in front of you and push it while charging for the roll, so with 2 rocks you can silence then, charge in like hell, damage, slow and ulti everyone in place.\n\nAnother good way of lockdown and damage is after ultying , you can place a rock behind them, pull it and damage/Stun/Refresh the debuff.\n\nSo most likey he should be played as a 3/4/5, with most focus on 4/5. His manacosts are low so he doesn't really need stacking Mana items unless they offer something else or when you wanna assist your team. I'd say positioning items would be the best for him to place and pull the rocks and to stun and then silence as many units as possible. So Blink Dagger and Force Staff, a Shiva's and Aura items in general. He's a STR hero with a decent growth, so HP is kinda redundant.\n\nSorry for any mistakes, just typed it a bit fast.",

At the end of the shield's duration, it will roughly heal him: 4418 + 4412 - 360*2 = 600hp.\n\n- You cast Fate's Edict and then cast Purifying Flames on an ally. Fate's Edict will make ally immune to spell's damage, but regen will still apply to him.\n\nI believe there will be some terrific plays by mixing these uses.",

    "body": "**What motivated this review:**\n\nI grew up in an area with access to natural hot springs.  I used to go for soaks in the geothermal pools quite often and it was (and still is) one of my favorite things to do.  I now live quite far away from where I grew up and sadly there aren't any hot springs within driving distance. Feeling a bit homesick this past winter, I tried out a bunch of Japanese hot springs powders and thought you guys might be interested in some reviews.\n\n\n[Album of the products reviewed.](http://imgur.com/a/B4wC5)\n\n[Bonus cat pic](http://imgur.com/bA5dtMf)\n\n\n**Bath Roman Muddy White**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/5ZXT7Ri)\n\n- I purchased this on Amazon Prime (~$18 for 680g tin).\n\n**Claims:** (from product description on distributor website, Larkin US)\n\n>  Contains Angelicae Radix Extract that increases blood circulation and relieves aches and fatigue\n>  Contains Dried Puerariae Radix Extract that increases skin vitality\n>  Helps to ease rheumatism, cold constitution and relieving fatigue\n> Transforms bathwater into milky white color with a calming citrus floral fragrance\n\n**Ingredients:**  \n- Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, Japanese angelica root extract, pueraria lobata root extract, fragrance.\n\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This was my favorite out of all of the bath powders I tried.  Lovely scent and very relaxing bathing experience! I've seen it described in marketing materials as \"fresh citrus floral bouquet\" but it doesn't smell how I'd imagine based on description alone. There are notes of citrus, but they are subtle. Stronger when you smell it in the tin, and seem to fade once the powder is dissolved in the bathwater.  The floral fragrance is similar to what I think of as hanbang: musky and herbal. Not sickly sweet. Neither feminine nor masculine.  There are notes of rose, but not like Mamonde rose, more like musky rose incense.  The scent is strong but IMO not overpowering. A little bit goes a long way.\n\n\n- RE the claims, adding this to the bathwater does seem to make the heat hold longer and it does soothe minor muscle aches and pains.  However, it definitely does not cure fatigue, as I'm usually so relaxed by the end of it that I'm ready to fall asleep in the bath.  I'm also skeptical of the claims about skin vitality.  It does make my skin feel silky, but beyond that the benefits to skin seem pretty negligible.\n\n\n\n**Bath Roman Muddy Blue**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/s8nXU5q) \n\n- Purchased on Amazon Prime (~$18 for 680g tin)\n\n**Claims:**  (from a description found on Rakuten)\n\n> [H]ot spring mineral (sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen sulfate) and herbal medicines (angelica extract) can work to the core of the body to enhance the warm bath effect, stiff shoulders medicated bath agent that is effective in low back pain, neuralgia. In warm coat of assimilated active ingredients, hot spring mineral turbidity hot water to enhance the warm bath effect prevents Yuzame. Protein and hot springs mineral of the surface of the skin to create a thin film on the entire body, in order to prevent the dissipation of heat, thermal effect will persist. In addition, herbal ingredients, angelica extract (active ingredient) is, to enhance the warm bath effect, warm the body from the core. To promote blood circulation, it is also effective in recovery from fatigue because loosen the body.\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- dried sodium sulfate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, Toukiekisu distributed, oxidation Ti, POE (300) POP (55), perfume, silicic acid anhydride, stearoylglutamic acid Na, anhydrous pyrophosphate Na, salicylic acid, bentonite, glycine, Jiouekisu, BG, blue No. 1\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This smells strongly of artificial fruit in the tin. At first whiff, it reminded me of Sweet Tarts candy.  A reviewer on Amazon compared it to Pez with a hint of flowers, which I think is pretty accurate.  It mellows out quite a bit once it's in the water.  The fragrance is not as strong as some of the other varieties.  The powder is a dark blue right out of the tin.  True to its description, it makes the bathwater a cloudy blue color.  \n\n- RE the claims, adding this to the bathwater does seem to make the heat hold longer.  I am skeptical about the claim that it forms a film that keeps your body temperature warm after leaving the bath.  I didn't notice any real difference compared to the warmth I feel after taking a regular old bath.  I am not sure what “Yuzame” means or why I'd want to prevent it, but the claim about relaxing muscles is definitely true, IMO.\n\n\n**Bath Roman Muddy Green**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/Ro6TWEM)\n\n- Purchased on Amazon Prime (~$24 for 680g tin)\n\n**Claims:**  (from a description found on Rakuten)\n\n> About 90% of hot spring mineral and herbal component of all the components. Enhance the warm bath effect in warm coat of turbidity hot water, to prevent Yuzame. Effective, such as fatigue, shoulder rest, low back pain, neuralgia, poor circulation, arthritis, heat rash, eczema, roughening resistance.\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- The scent is herbal, floral and slightly fruity. There are notes of passionfruit and citrus. Right out of the tin, the product is dark green.  It turns the bathwater into a beautiful cloudy bright green color.  \n\n- RE the claims, I can't speak to the parts about “neuralgia, poor circulation, arthritis, heat rash, eczema” and not sure what “roughening resistance” even means, but this one is just as good at relaxing tired muscles as the blue and white varieties.\n\n\n**Bath Roman Japanese Cypress (Hinoki) **  \n\n[pic](http://imgur.com/rdj2I3t)\n\n- Purchased from Rakuten (Master of Life) (~486 yen or ~$5 USD for 680g tin) but wouldn’t recommend that because it was very expensive to ship (even with SAL shipping, it came out to be about the same amount as Amazon or eBay, but took 10 times longer to get to me).  \n \n**Claims:**   (from a description found on Rakuten)\n\n> [A] medicinal bath salt series with natural essences, relaxing. Ion veil wraps the whole body, retains its warm after bathing, bath effect. Stiff neck, back pain, poor circulation, fatigue effects.\n\n**Ingredients:** \n\n- sodium sulfate, sodium carbonate, thehalose hinokitol, fragrance, D&C Yellow no. 8, polyoxyproplene glycol\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- Straight out of the tin, this stuff is orange in color and smells strongly of earthy pine with a hint of smoky campfire.  A more masculine scent overall.  Once it's in the bathwater, it mellows out but the pine notes stick around.  It turns the bathwater a cloudy orangy white color.  The effect of this one is similar to the Muddy varieties reviewed above.\n\n**Bath Roman Milk Protein**  \n\n[pic](http://imgur.com/q8yX8k8) \n\n- Purchased from Rakuten (Master of Life) (~486 yen or ~$5 USD for 680g tin) but wouldn’t recommend that because it was very expensive to ship (even with SAL shipping, it came out to be about the same amount as Amazon or eBay, but took 10 times longer to get to me).  \n\n**Claims:**  (from product description on distributor website, Larkin US)\n\n> Milk protein penetrates into dry skin cells, replenishing your skin's moisture level.\n> Soaking with Japanese bath powder keeps severely dry skin moisturized and nourished.\n\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n- sodium bicarbonate, sodium caseinate, fragrance, parabens, polyoxypropylene glycol\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This smells like sweetened condensed milk, but not in a bad way.  It’s a lovely sweet steamed milk and slightly floral, slightly baby powder scent, more feminine than some of the others.  It reminds me of Etude House Milk Talk body wash with a bit less baby powder and a bit more milk.  It didn’t seem that strong to me, but my husband came home while I was in the bath and he could smell it when he walked into the house (which is saying something because our bathtub is on another floor). True to the description, this does turn the water a milky white color.  It made my skin feel silky smooth, but I am skeptical about the claims about nourishing dry skin.  My skin certainly didn't feel dry afterward, but it wasn't incredibly moisturized, either.  My skin is naturally on the oily side, so someone with dry skin would probably not find it very moisturizing at all.\n\n\n**Bath Roman Ceramide**  \n[pic](http://imgur.com/vHSKQ2t)\n\n- Purchased from Rakuten (Master of Life) (~486 yen or ~$5 USD for 680g tin) but wouldn’t recommend that because it was very expensive to ship (even with SAL shipping, it came out to be about the same amount as Amazon or eBay, but took 10 times longer to get to me).  \n\n**Claims:**  (from product description on distributor website, Larkin US)\n\n> Contains Ceramides that replenish and retain moisture in the skin.\n> Helps eczema, acne, heat rash and other skin irritations.\n> Leaves skin smooth and moisturized after bathing.\n> Soaking with Japanese bath salts relaxes, moisturizes and polishes rough skin.\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n- Sodium bicarbonate, sodium caseinate, fragrance, parabens, polyoxypropylene glycol\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This has a bright, fresh lilac and clean linen scent.  It turned the bathwater a milky white color.  It made my skin feel soft and moisturized, but was not emollient.\n\n- Consistent with my review of the Milk variety, I am skeptical about the claims about moisturizing dry skin.  My skin certainly didn't feel dry afterward, but it wasn't incredibly moisturized, either.  My skin is naturally on the oily side, so someone with dry skin would probably not find it very moisturizing at all. I am lucky to have pretty tolerant skin that's not prone to irritation, so I can't speak to the claims about healing eczema, acne, heat rash and other skin irritations.\n\n**Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe (Uruoi)**  \n\n[pic](http://imgur.com/bJlMZzN)\n\n- Purchased from Japanese grocery store (~$8 for 600g), but you can buy it on Amazon for ~$12 shipped (not Prime)\n\n**Claims:**  (from description on Amazon)\n\n> Increase blood circulation and warm your core. Emerge renewed.\n \n**Ingredients:** \n\n- Sodium sulfate, titanium dioxide, sodium glutamate, fragrance, silica, PEG-75 stearate, cellulose gum, sodium polyacrylate, sekken soji, polyacrylic acid, bentonite, water, butylene glycol, methicone, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, pvp, aloe yohjyu matsu ekisu, sodium hyaluronate.\n\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- This was my least favorite of all the bath powders I tried, largely because of the scent.  It’s like a combination of artificial cucumber, lime, Pine Sol and Degree men's deodorant.   That said, it was the most moisturizing and emollient of all the bath powders I tried.  RE the claim about increasing blood circulation and warm[ing] the core,” my hunch is that it's mostly the hot bath water that is responsible for this, rather than the powder itself.\n\n\n**Bathclin Pure Skin**  \n[Pic](http://imgur.com/An3xsiP)\n\n- Purchased from a Japanese grocery store (~$8 for 600g), but you can buy it on Amazon Prime for ~$13\n\n**Claims:**  (from description on Amazon - same as Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe)\n\n> Increase blood circulation and warm your core. Emerge renewed.   \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\n- Sodium sulfate, titanium dioxide, sodium glutamate, fragrance, PEG-75 stearate, cellulose gum, silica, sodium polyacrylate, sekken soji, polyacrylic acid, bentonite, methicone, hydrolyzed collagen, water, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, pvp, glycine soja (soybean) seed extract.\n\n\n**Review:** \n\n- After trying and disliking the scent of Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe, I admit that I was not super eager to try this one, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Like the Bath Roman muddy white, this is marketed as having a “citrus floral” scent.  However, this one actually does have a strong citrus fragrance.  It smells strongly of grapefruit, which to me is heavenly.  There's a hint of Lemon Pledge fragrance, but I don't find it bothersome.\n\n- It could be my imagination, but I swear there is a slight effervescent effect right after the powder goes into the bathwater.  It turned the bathwater a milky white color.  It made my skin feel silky smooth but was not nearly as moisturizing as Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe.  RE the claim about increasing blood circulation and warm[ing] the core,” my hunch is that it's mostly the hot bath water that is responsible for this, rather than the powder.\n\n**Tabino Yado Hot Springs: Milky and Clear varieties**\n\n[Pic of the Clear varieties] (http://imgur.com/QBo58U1) (unfortunately I accidentally got rid of the box for the Milky varieties :-/)\n\n- I purchased these on Amazon Prime (~$23 for 28 packets), but you can also buy boxes of Milky (13 packets, 25g each) and Clear (15 packets, 25g each) separately for around $12 each.\n\n**Claims:**  (from description on Amazon)\n\n- Each of the 9 different varieties is supposed to represent a famous Japanese [onsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsen).\n\n- According to the product description:\n> [n]ot a perfume or bubble bath - Minerals promote circulation and warmth... Intense aromas relax you and last as long as your bath!\n\n**Ingredients for Milky varieties:**\n\n- [KIRISHIMA] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, fragrance, silica, aconus calamus root extract, aloe arborescens leaf extract, dipropylene glycol, alcohol, water, FD&C red no.28, FD&C yellow blue no.1 \n\n- [OKUHIDA] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminim silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090)\n\n- [SHIRAHONE] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, sodium glutamate, calcium carbonate, kaolin, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, potassium chloride, silica, cellulose gum, fragrance, ci no.59040 pyranine conc, ci no.73015 indigo carmine, \n\n- [TOWADA] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminim silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090).\n\n\n**Ingredients for Clear varieties:**\n\n- [BEPPU] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, fragrance, silica, aconus calamus root extract, aloe arborescens leaf extract, dipropylene glycol, alcohol, water, FD&C red no.28, FD&C yellow blue no.1 \n\n- [SHIRAHAMA] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminum silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090)\n\n- [HAKONE] Sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, sodium glutamate, calcium carbonate, kaolin, sodium chloride, titanium dioxide, potassium chloride, silica, cellulose gum, fragrance, ci no.59040 pyranine conc, ci no.73015 indigo carmine, \n\n- [KUSATSU] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, fragrance, aluminum silicate, chinpi, yellow 8 (ci 45350), touki, sodium metasilicate, orange 4 (ci 15510), polysorbate 80, butylene gycol, yellow 5 (ci 19140), blue 1 (ci 42090)\n\n- [NOBORIBETSU] Sodium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, dextrin, calcium carbonate, silica, potassium chloride, fragrance.\n\n**Review:**  \n\n- These come in small packets.  The packets are color coded but there is no English labeling so it was hard for me to judge the individual varieties.  TBH, all 9 varieties (4 milky, 5 clear) seem very similar to one another in terms of scent.  Many of them smelled fruity, similar to the Pez candy smell of the Bath Roman Muddy Blue. The only real differences I could observe were the obvious ones: the color and whether the water looked milky or clear.  The results really didn’t seem to differ all that much.   They all smell pleasant and do a nice job relaxing sore muscles.\n\n\n**TL;DR** \n\n- The first one I tried was Bath Roman Muddy White, and it got me hooked!   The Bath Roman Muddy and Hinoki varieties were my favorites overall.  They all made my skin silky smooth, relaxed my tired muscles and seem to hold the heat of the bath water longer.  My favorite is still the Muddy White because I adore the scent.\n\n- Bathclin Jojoba and Aloe was my least favorite of all of them because of its scent.  \n\n- All of them made for a relaxing bath experience, which is really all that I expect out of this type of product.  Unfortunately, hot springs powders are no substitute for the real thing.  That said, these are still fantastic products for soothing sore muscles and stress relief!\n\nEdited formatting & added bonus cat pic",

Please go to:** https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganBeauty/comments/18wh8k1/bland_fragrancefree_nonirritating_moisturizer/?\n\n Do you need to replace your beloved CeraVe moisturizer to veganize your routine? Is your skin so sensitive, it turns red just *thinking* about a new cleanser? Your moisture barrier is shot and you're dreading spring hayfever?\nI'm here to help, thanks to far too many hours spent shopping for products that my skin will tolerate.\nEvery product here is:\n\n* Vegan\n* Cruelty-free\n* Completely fragrance-free: no masking fragrances, \"natural\" fragrances, or essential oils\n* Free of irritating and sensitizing plant oils like lavender, thyme, citrus, and eucalyptus\n* Ragweed allergy safe: free of chamomile, feverfew, echinacea, calendula, and other ragweed flowers\n* Retinol-free\n\n**Warning for the highly ragweed sensitive:** Certain non-ragweed ingredients can cause cross-reactions in some people with ragweed allergies. These ingredients include sunflower oil, safflower oil, watermelon seed oil, and cucumber fruit extract. Also, bisabolol/levonemol is often derived from chamomile and could cause reactions. I noted the products that contain these ingredients.\n\n**Products may contain other allergens, such as soy and nuts. If you have any severe allergies, read all ingredient lists carefully! No product can be safe for every allergy!**\n\nThis list is US-centric; products from other regions are marked with their country of sale. The list is **sorted by price per ounce** so you can shop within your budget! (Price update in progress - April 2023.)\nFeedback and corrections are always welcome! Please let me know of any products I can add or anything on the list that has been discontinued.\n\n**Moisturizers without SPF**\n\n**Name** | **Packaging** | **ROUGH cost per oz in US** | **Notes**\n:- | :- | :- | :-\nQV Skin Lotion | pump | $0.50 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nQV Cream | pump | $0.75 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nQV Baby Moisturising Cream | tub & pump | $1 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nATTITUDE Extra Gentle Daily Moisturizing Natural Body Lotion | pump | $1 | \nEthique Gentle Hand and Body Lotion Concentrate | concentrate | $1 | price is based on volume after adding water\nQV Intensive Cream | pump | $1 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nBambo Nature Snuggle Time Body Lotion | tube | $1 |\nDesert Essence Hand and Body Lotion, Fragrance Free | tube | $1.25 | contains sunflower oil\nQV Baby Skin Lotion | tub & pump | $1.25 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nCeramedx Restoring Body Lotion | pump | $1.50 | contains safflower and sunflower oil\nYes to Avocado Fragrance-Free Daily Hand Cream | tube | $1.75 |\nShiKai Borage Therapy Lotion (Original Formula, Advanced Formula, or Children’s Formula) | pump | $1.75-$2 | contains safflower oil\nACURE Everyday Eczema Lotion | tube | $1.75 | contains safflower and sunflower oils\nACURE Seriously Soothing 24hr Moisture Lotion | tube | $1.75 | contains safflower and sunflower oils\nOrganic Fiji Nourishing Lotion with Organic Coconut Oil Fragrance Free | pump | $1.75 | contains sunflower oil\nPipette Baby Lotion | tube | $1.75 | \nCocokind Sake Body Lotion | pump | $2 | contains sunflower oil\nDrunk Elephant Sili Body Lotion | pump | $2 | contains sunflower oil, banana extract; parent company is not cruelty-free\nPipette Babykrav Oil | bottle | $2 | contains sunflower lecithin\nPure Anada Hand & Body Lotion - Unscented | pump | C$2 | contains sunflower oil\nAcne.org moisturizer | pump | $2 | may cause discoloration on pale skin\nQV Hand Cream | tube | $2.50 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nThe Seaweed Bath Co.

Interestingly, Quirant also also shows that Jones & Harrit are either morons or have been deliberately lying and misrepresenting facts.\n\n## The reaction\n\nAccording to Newton's third law, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, so following yesterday's post our resident truthers started getting excited and posted two nanothermite links to /r/conspiracy.\n\nAt some point First Class Nanothermite Specialist Prof. SovereignMan linked to [this article by French 9/11 'tard association Reopen911](http://www.agoravox.fr/tribune-libre/article/nanothermite-au-wtc-critique-de-l-76233) that supposedly debunks Quirant's article.\n\nThe comments on that \"debunking\" article are not surprisingly full of truthers from Reopen911 blabbing nonsense and downvoting sanity.\n\nA guy going by the handle mmarvin [rips them new assholes.](http://www.agoravox.fr/tribune-libre/article/nanothermite-au-wtc-critique-de-l-76233?debut_forums=200#forum2606322)\n\nThe Reopen911 article claims that the fact that Niels & Harrit used air was to \"reproduce the WTC conditions as closely as possible\".\n\nCommenter mmarvin calmly explains that the whole point of using DCS on these chips is to show that the material is self-oxidizing thermite.  **If you supply it with oxygen, any piece of carbon-contaminated crap will react and produce heat.**  They should have run the DCS under, say, a nitrogen atmosphere.\n\nSo the debunking is bunk.\n\nOh wait, Newton's third law says there is an *equal* and opposite reaction.  The two pathetic conspiracy posts not having been enough I suppose that's why I have been banned shortly thereafter from /r/conspiracy and thus I'm unable to further comment in the posts in question ([linky 1](http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/27a8lz/world_trade_center_dust_red_gray_chips_and/), [linky 2](http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/279q85/denying_the_obvious_nist_ba%C5%BEant_and_the_911/)) (how convenient.)\n\n## Enter the forensic scientist\n\nSo far Quirant has been debunking Jones et al.'s nanothermite claim using only data from their paper (published in a bullshit \"journal\" with b.s. peer review).\n\nBut in 2012, a bona fide forensic scientist, Dr. James Millette from\nMVA Scientific Consultants ran a proper analysis, trying to replicate Niels & Harrit's work. [Link (warning truther site)](http://aneta.org/911experiments_com/millette/paper/index.htm)\n\nGuess what?\n\n> The red/gray chips found in the WTC dust at four sites in New York City are consistent with a carbon steel coated with an epoxy resin that contains primarily iron oxide and kaolin clay pigments.\n\n> There is no evidence of individual elemental aluminum particles of any size in the red/gray chips, therefore the red layer of the red/gray chips is not thermite or nano-thermite.\n\nSearching for \"nanothermite\" revealed that our favorite nanothermite expert Dr. SovereignMan tried to [rebut Millette's findings with not one but **two** Youtube videos](http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/17vs4j/911_nanothermite_elemental_aluminium_in_wtc_chips/) that yours truly is now watching.  I will report back.\n\nEDIT 1: Typos\nEDIT 2: Yey shekels!",

The tiles on which new resources are added are determined as follows:\n\n- Tiles that used to have a resource in the previous age are automatically included; if no new resource qualifies for the tile's characteristics, it will remain empty, however.\n\n- More tiles are chosen at random, the same way resource tiles are chosen at the creation of the map.\n\n- Tiles with districts are excluded.\n\n- Only new resource types are spawned; there will be no additional camel spawns in the exploration age, for example.\n\nFurther, all rural districts will be respawned, updating standard improvements to fit whatever new resource might've appeared underneath.\n\nSo which resources get replaced by which? This depends on the terrain, biome, and feature of the tile. For the purpose of this list, \"Flat\" means not just flat but also featureless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Antiquity to Exploration**\n\n*Gained:*\n\n- **Furs** (all Tundra except Rough and Wet; Vegetated Plains)\n\n- **Niter** (Flat and Floodplains in all biomes)\n\n- **Whales** (Coast adjacent to land but not on lakes)\n\n*Lost:*\n\n- **Hides** can be replaced by either Niter (Flat Tundra, Grassland, or Plains; Floodplains Tundra) or Furs (Flat, Vegetated, or Floodplains Tundra)\n\n- **Salt** can be replaced by Niter everywhere and in Tundra also by Furs\n\n- **Wool** has no replacement\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Exploration to Modern**\n\n*Gained:*\n\n- **Citrus** (Flat Grassland and Plains)\n\n- **Coal** (Flat Grassland, Plains, and Desert; Vegetated Grasslands, Plains, and Tundra; Rough Grasslands and Plains)\n\n- **Coffee** (all Tropical; Flat Plains)\n\n- **Oil** (all Tundra and Desert except for Rough; Wet Grassland)\n\n- **Quinine** (Vegetated Grassland and Plains)\n\n- **Rubber** (Vegetated Grassland and Tropical)\n\n- **Tobacco** (Flat and Vegetated Grassland and Plains)\n\n*Lost:*\n\n- **Camels** can be replaced by either Citrus or Tobacco (Flat Plains), Coffee (Rough Plains), Oil (Flat Desert), or Coal (Flat Desert or Rough Hills); on Rough Desert it has no replacement\n\n- **Dates** can be replaced by Coal or Oil (Flat Desert) or only Oil (Vegetated Desert / Oasis)\n\n- **Dyes** have no replacement\n\n- **Gypsum** can be replaced by either Citrus or Tobacco (Flat Plains), or Coal or Coffee (Rough Palins); on Rough Tundra it has no replacement\n\n- **Incense** can be replaced by Coal, Quinine, or Tobacco\n\n- **Iron** can be replaced by Coal (Rough Grassland), Coffee (Rough Tropical), or both (Rough Plains); on Rough Tundra and Desert it has no replacement\n\n- **Jade** can be replaced by Coffee (Flat Tropical) or Oil (Flat Tundra)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Permanent Resources**\n\nAll other resources are permanent. These are: **Cotton, Fish, Gold, Horses, Ivory, Kaolin, Marble, Pearls, Silk, Silver, Truffles, and Wine.** *Treasure Resources* only become accessible in the Exploration age but are spawned at the beginning of Antiquity already: **Cocoa, Spices, Sugar, and Tea.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Summary of tiles losing resources without replacement:**\n\n- all Wool by Exploration\n\n- Camels on Rough Desert by Modern\n\n- all Dyes by Modern\n\n- Gypsum on Rough Tundra by Modern\n\n- Iron on Rough Tundra and Rough Desert by Modern",

    "body": "Just made a light bulb mini-terrarium. Shit's cash.  In this diy I'm going to show you how to make one.  Finished product looks like: http://i.imgur.com/Nkoe8.jpg\n\n(Need a bulb, pliers, short screwdriver or nail; small vegetation such as moss, and dirt)\n\nHow to make: \n~~~~~~~~~~\nStep 1: Get a light bulb. Ones with white inside are just as good as the clear ones. Avoid 'Clouded' ones; bulbs where the inside is, I guess etched, as you can't make it clear.\n\nStep 2: With pliers, take the brass contact off by getting up an edge of it, and twisting.\n\nStep 3: Take off top black glass with pliers. *WARNING* This type of glass tends to shatter and get EVARYWARE! Wear safety glasses, gloves, and do it over a trashcan or something.\n\nStep 4: Once the top black glass is off, take your nail or short screwdriver and tap the inside layer of glass. The housing that holds the filament should break off and fall inside the bulb.\n\nStep 4a (Optional): With a filer (I used a metal filer), file the glass around the top on the inside so you don't cut yourself and so that it's smooth.\n\nStep 4b: Shake the filament and its housing out, you may need to reuse your pliers for this.\n\nStep 5 [For white coated bulbs]: Put a teaspoon of salt in the bulb and fill it about half full with hot water. Shake it up while covering the top hole with your thumb. This should remove the kaolin (the white powder) and make your bulb clear as a snowglobe. If necessary, put in a paper towel and twist it around to get any kaolin the water couldn't get.\n\nStep 6: Go outside and gather moss and dirt. Some people recommend putting activated charcoal in there too. You can get other things to decorate it also, such as small rocks or chunks of coral (I have them all over the yard, glacier/mountain soil has an abundance for some reason)\n\nStep 7: Stick everything in there.\n\nStep 8: Add a teaspoon or two or three of water to hydrate the soil.\n\nStep 9 [Optional]: Cut out a piece of coffee filter the size of the hole. Glue half of it down, allowing it to flip down when you need to water the terrarium. I've never seen anyone else do this, but I would think this keeps out most bad molds and keeps spores from the moss and such inside.\n\nStep 10: Get something to hold your lightbulb so it doesn't roll around. Glass sucks when it breaks, in case you didn't know. In the attached picture, they used some sort of hard drive part. I used homemade air-dry clay.\n\nStep 10 [For clay base]: Get 5 tsp of flour and 2 tsp salt. Mix it together. Add 2.5 tsp of hot water. Knead it around a little bit, then make a ball and press the bulb on it. Let dry for like, 5 hours.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTa-da! You now have a cool desk ornament.\n\n[Picture of my OP on 4chan's /diy/ board: http://i.imgur.com/i6hPf.jpg ]",

    "body": "##**Lion, the Demon Witch**\n\n##[I've been to hell and back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKAT2tGAInA)\n\n[*When the demon betrayed me, I took its very arm. Imagine what I'll do to a mere hero.*](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/c/ce/Lion_rare_01.mp3)\n\nThe Demon Witch is a strong offensive spellcaster with excellent disabling capabilities. Although his primary attack spell, Impale, deals relatively low damage, it has a long stun at high levels and can hit multiple targets quite easily. The low spell damage of Impale is more than compensated for by Lion's lethal Finger of Death ability, which deals very high damage to a single enemy target. Finger of Death is an excellent finishing spell for injured enemies. Although Impale alone is a good disabling spell, the Demon Witch has a second strong disable: Hex. Hex can transform an enemy hero into a critter for a few seconds, allowing Lion and his allies time to finish them off. Lion's spells all cost quite a bit of mana, but he can quickly regain it using Mana Drain. This spell is effective for draining an enemy hero's mana while they are disabled or giving Lion a quick mana boost from an enemy. This hero is a good choice for newer players, but at the same time he is fragile and must stay on the offensive to emerge victorious.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Lore**\n\nOnce a Grandmaster of the Demon Witch tradition of sorcery, Lion earned fame among his brethren for fighting on the side of light and righteousness. But adulation corrupts. With powers surpassed only by his ambition, the mage was seduced by a demon and turned to evil, trading his soul for prestige. After committing horrible crimes that marred his soul, he was abandoned. The demon betrayed him, striking better deals with his enemies. Such was Lion’s rage that he followed the demon back to hell and slew it, ripping it limb from limb, taking its demonic hand for his own. However, such demonoplasty comes at a cost. Lion was transfigured by the process, his body transformed into something unrecognizable. He rose from hell, rage incarnate, slaying even those who had once called him master, and laying waste to the lands where he had once been so adored. He survives now as the sole practitioner of the Demon Witch tradition, and those who present themselves as acolytes or students are soon relieved of their mana and carried off by the faintest gust of wind.\n\n\n~~==~~\t\n\n**Roles:** Disabler, Nuker, Support, Lane Support\n--\n\n\n~~==~~\n\n\nStrength: 16 + 1.7\n\nAgility: 15 + 1.5\n\n**Intelligence: 20 + 3**\n\n\n~~==~~\n\nDamage: 47-53\n\nArmour: 1.14\n\nMovement Speed: 290\n\nAttack Range: 600\n\nMissile Speed: 1000\n\nBase Attack Time: 1.7\n\nSight Range: 1800 (Day) / 800 (Night)\n\nTurn Rate: 0.5\n\n\n~~==~~\n\n**Spells**\n\n\n~~==~~\n\n**Earth Spike**\n\n\n\nRock spikes burst from the earth along a straight path.

What this does is that if Tide blinks after you have casted hex, Lion will instantly hex him if he blinks into your team, making it seem like you have insanely fast reaction times. I've definitely seen this technique completely flip teamfights before they even started.",

Shouldn't shuriken be better in at least some way to compensate for literally just being a shorter stun of the same projectile?\n\nEdit: thanks for the answers but jesus are people really going to downvote me in a \"stupid questions\" thread? that's certainly going to encourage me to ask more questions later /s\n\nAlso I should clarify that I'm not looking to see shuriken to get better *overall* persay, but just differentiated from another hero's version so it just doesn't look like a hand-me-down version.  In NO way did I imply that shuriken needed to be even more like magic missile by having a long stun duration.  I know that is ridiculous.  I'm merely curious why spells like this, and to a lesser extent, cloned spells like lina/lion ult, can be objectively better or the same.  I figured every spell should be unique and more useful than another one in some way.  The original question posed had nothing to do with the balance of bh or vs at all, but merely why degenerate versions of spells existed ingame.\n\nFor example, in response to some of the people saying its a finisher rather than an opener, shuriken would occupy a much more significantly independent niche if its range was greater, or if it utility that actually made it better fit that role, as currently magic missile could do both quite reliably better than shuriken.",

He is able move mass with extreme force in any direct, as well as control the magnetic pull of the earth move mass and living matter to his whim. The Earth has not completely forgotten him though, he is able to command rocks to form a boulder of immense strength and speed. Due to his connection with the Earth, Kaolin is able to resist a magnetisation process whereas him enemies will slowly falter. Kaolin, however, has no forgotten man's folly and interference with the beauty of nature, while not harbouring ill will, he instead uses stone remnants of his past to enhance his own ability.\n\n\n**Lore**\n\nDeep amid the Upland crags and cliffs there runs a seam of sacred jade long foresworn by highland minders. From this rare material, the likeness of the great general Kaolin was carved and buried at the head of a stone funerary army ten thousand strong--a force of soldiers and holy men, jesters and acrobats, carved by craftsmen and entombed for millennia in the dark embrace of the Earth. \n\nWhat the craftsmen had not known was that within the strange seam of jade flowed the spirit of the Earth itself--an elemental force at one with the planet. When the force within the carved jade found itself cut off from the life's blood of the world, it gathered its strength over the course of a thousand years and dug itself free and into the light. Now the great Kaolin Earth Spirit strides the Upland roads, fighting for the spirit of the Earth; and in times of need calls forth remnants of his buried army still locked in the loving embrace of the soil. \n\n~~==~~\t\n\n**Roles:** Initiator, Support, Escape\n--\n\n~~==~~\n\n\n**Strength: 21 + 2.9**\n\nAgility: 17 + 1.5\n\nIntelligence: 18 + 2.1\n\n~~==~~\n\nDamage: 46-56\n\nArmour: 3.43\n\nMovement Speed: 295\n\nAttack Range: Melee (150)\n\nMissile Speed: N/A\n\nBase Attack Time: 1.7\n\nSight Range: 1800 (Day) / 800 (Night)\n\nTurn Rate: 0.6\n\n\n~~==~~\n\n**Spells**\n\n\n~~==~~\n\n\n\n**Stone Remnant**\n\n*Innate Ability*\n\n\n\nCall a Stone Remnant at the target location. Stones Remnants have no vision and are invulnerable, and can be used with Earth Spirit's abilities. Calling a Stone Remnant consumes a charge, which recharge over time. Earth Spirit can have 6 Stone Remnants active at one time. \n\nMana Cost|Cooldown|Casting Range|Area|Duration|Effects\n:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n0|0|1100|N/A|120|Summons a Stone Remnant at the target location\n\n- Stone Remnant replenishes charges at a rate of 1 per 30 seconds\n\n- Innate ability that doesn't do anything on its own but is used by other abilities \n \n- Kaolin begins the game with and cannot have more than 6 Stone Charges\n\n- When killed, Kaolin will continue to replenish Stone Charges\n \n- Stone Remnants are invulnerable and have zero collision (they can be stacked) \n \n- Is not considered an ability, and therefore does not interact with Magic Stick, Curse of the Silent, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Earth Spirit calls forth a remnant of his stone army, long buried with him in the dark embrace of the Earth.*\n\n~~==~~\n\n**Boulder Smash**\n\n\n\nEarth Spirit smashes the target enemy or ally, sending them in the direction he is facing. If Earth Spirit targets an area, he will smash the nearest Stone Remnant in a 200 radius. The travelling unit or Remnant damages all enemy units it hits. If an enemy is hit by a Stone Remnant, they are also stunned. Stone Remnants travel further than other units.\n\nLevel|Manacost|Cooldown|Casting Range|Area|Duration|Effects\n:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n1|100|22|150|200|0.75|Smashes the target 480 units away from the direction Kaolin is facing, dealing 50 damage.

He will stop if he collides with a hero or is stunned. If he rolls over a Stone Remnant, he will travel further and faster, and enemies hit by the boulder will have their movement speed slowed.\n\nLevel|Manacost|Cooldown|Casting Range|Area|Duration|Effects\n:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n1|50|16|3000|150|2|After a 0.6 second delay, a boulder forms around Kaolin and rolls towards the targeted direction for a distance of 800, dealing 100 damage.

It stops on the opposite side of the first hero it impacts. The Stone Remnant is consumed when used as a boost for rolling. \n\n- Earth Spirit can use abilities and items during the Rolling Boulder animation\n\n- Can be interrupted if Earth Spirit gets disabled during the initial 0.6 rolling charge, as well as while rolling\n\n- Gives Kaolin flying vision \n\n- Does hit invisible enemy heroes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Calling upon his connection to the land, the Earth Spirit draws loose stone to him, which forms a protective ball that he can use to roll short distances.*\n\n\n~~==~~\n\n**Geomagnetic Grip**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarth Spirit pulls the target Stone Remnant.

However, if the ally finishes casting a teleport spell during the grip (such as Town Portal Scroll or Furion's Teleportation), the ally will be teleported and the grip will end immediately.\n\n- The gripped unit can take actions normally during the grip\n\n- Gripping an ally Batrider during Flaming Lasso will not break the lasso and Flaming Lasso's target will be pulled along\n\n- Can pull spell immune allies affected by Enchant Remnant.\n\n- Allows Geomagnetic Grip to pull allied heroes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Like calls to like.

Magnetized heroes cause nearby Stone Remnants to explode, destroying the remnant and refreshing Magnetize's duration on all nearby enemies. This process can repeat multiple times. If an enemy hero is affected by silence or slows as a result of Geomagnetic Grip or Rolling Boulder, all magnetized heroes share the effects.\n\nLevel|Mana Cost|Cooldown|Casting Range|Area|Duration|Effects\n:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n1|100|80|N/A|300|6|Magnetizes all enemies in the radius around Kaolin, magnetized units take 50 damage per second.

If an enemy hero is affected by silence or slows as a result of Rolling Boulder or Geomagnetic Grip, all magnetized heroes share the effects. \n\n- Magical Damage\n\n- When a Stone Remnant is within range of Magnetize, it doesn't immediately disappear, it becomes inert and then disappears after 5 seconds (can still be used by your other spells in the meantime) \n\n- Without any Stone Remnant detonation, total damage of 300/450/600 \n\n- Damages every 0.5 second\n\n- Invisible units are not affected by the initial cast.

I even bothered to report it during that spring cleaning bug round-up shit, and they still can't fix it.\n\nAnyway, if people want to learn how to play him, max Roll first in your starting games. Most of your damage will come from Magnetize if you're gonna miss all your skill shots, and maxing Roll lets you reapply it a lot more on fleeing targets while still being able to escape after you're done.\n\nOnce you are better at the hero, Roll first is still an okay build, but every single other person is going to tell you to max Boulder Smash first because its stun, cooldown, and damage scale with points, and using it doesn't put you in danger (though it still has less DPS at rank 4 than Roll does).\n\nLast minute pointers: Try to conserve rocks. Reapply magnetize early if you're going to be disabled or silenced. Start dropping a rock in your lane if you're sitting at six remnants and you're about to get your ultimate.

    "body": "[Pica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pica_(disorder\\)) is most common among pregnant women, children and people with certain developmental disorders.\n\n**The best, most common and most often recommended first step would be to have your blood work done at a doctor**\n\nPica is often caused by a deficiency. Getting tested means you know what you need to take.\n\nThe second benefit of getting your blood work done is that there might be something else going on with your body. If you just start looking for an alternative without getting tested, you won't find out why your body is craving non edible things.\n\nAlways go for blood work first!\n\n* Once of the easiest ways to address Pica, is by taking a multivitamin. If you're unsure as to what the cause is, simply taking [a multivitamin like this](https://www.amazon.com/Centrum-Multivitamin-Multimineral-Supplement-Vitamin/dp/B003G4BP5G) might be all that's needed to resolve the issue. \n* Another common cause is iron deficiency, [which is also cheap and easy to solve](https://www.amazon.com/Natures-Bounty-Ferrous-Sulfate-Tablets/dp/B006QQRY2O).\n\nIf that resolves the issue, then there's really no need to take any further action.\n\nMore recently pica has also been associated with OCD.\n\n[Here is a short test that will test you for OCD symptoms](https://psychcentral.com/quizzes/ocd-quiz). If you score over 8 it's possible that OCD is the cause, if you score over 12, it's likely. Then you should go to /r/OCD (although we can also give you general OCD advice if needed).\n\nHere is a short list of behavioral interventions for pica:\n\n* Alternative Forms of Oral Stimulation\n* **[Pica Box](https://tipsfolder.com/pica-box-15ca8e25a3fda1df6009b98a64b6f55b/)**\n* Discrimination Training\n* [Aversive Techniques](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-aversion-therapy-2796001)\n* Aversive Presentation\n* Teaching Self Restraint\n\nHere are several healthy replacement foods:\n\n**Ashes**\n\n* Chopping up Kale very finely and throwing it into an air Fryer and BURNING IT UP! The taste needs work but the texture is perfect. Very thin like ashes and have a a melt on your tongue crunch.\n\n**Beads/Pellets**\n\n* peas have a nice round shape like beads and will digest much easier than plastic or wooden beads. Plus the cold temperature of frozen peas gives an extra sensory feedback.\n* Maybe chickpeas? Haven't tried them yet so not sure\n\n**Clay**\n\n* You can buy [nakumatt edible clay](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nakumatt+clay+edible).\n\n**Dirt**\n\n* You can order white dirt or \"kaolin\" online. [Here's an example of a source](https://www.whitedirt.com).\n\n**Drywall**\n\nfor people who crave/eat drywall, those canisters of grits, not the grits that come in packets, [but the 24oz cylindrical container](https://www.amazon.com/Quaker-5-Minute-Grits-Ounce-Canister/dp/B000WHZLMI) are a good alternative\n\n**Graphite**\n\n* [activated charcoal tablets](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=activated+charcoal+pills&t=ffab&iax=images&ia=images). Same taste, almost the same texture and they have health benefits. If you look around, you'll find basically two versions. Capsules (you don't want those) and pills (those are what you want). They sell these at most drugstores, you just have to make sure it's the tablet and not the capsule.\n* You could try the dust as well, [they sell that in jars](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=edible+charcoal). Texture wise, it's slightly different than graphite, but I've noticed that a lot of people with pica really enjoy powdery dry sensations. So it wouldn't surprise me if you enjoy that even more.\n\n\n**Paper**\n\n* Rice/sugar paper can be found in the candy isle of many shops and has a dry ripping texture but it isn't great for chewing and it dissolves in to a gummy paste once in the mouth.\n* Nori sheets can be found in most Japanese shops or in the Asian isle of sainsbury's it is better for chewing like paper and much healthier although it is a bit of an acquired taste.\n\n**Paste/paint**\n\n* Watered down mashed potatoes has a simmilar consistency to wallpaper paste and can be substituted for almost any mashed vegitable.\n* Full fat milk can feel a little like a thin paint or use some flour/chocolate powder to thicken it up\n\n**Plants**\n\n* Chives feel like grass or flower stems and have a nice oniony taste.\n* Raw broccoli has a really good texture and feels a lot like those purple plants that i cant remember the name of.\n* Bok choy has really nice leaves and feels like flower stems or Lilly petals.\n* Sprouts are good if you like the repetitive action of picking your food apart pettle by pettle.\n\n**Rocks/chalk**\n\n* You can order [Belgorod chalk online](https://www.amazon.com/Edible-Belgorod-Natural-Eating-belgorod/dp/B079TB2Y9V) another [example](https://www.amazon.com/Chalkovsky-Premium-Edible-Chalk-Impurities/dp/B08W9PXT88).\n* There are [\"chocolate (river) rocks\"](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=chocolate+rocks&ref=nb_sb_noss_1)\n* And (similar outside texture) [\"school krijt (which means \"school chalk\")\"](https://www.amazon.com/Venco-Schoolkrijt-Zacht-Licorice-Ounces/dp/B00MWHB59E) licorice candy.\n* [Chalk candy cigarettes](https://www.amazon.com/Worlds-King-Size-Candy-Cigarettes/dp/B00VSBKN8E)\n\n**Rubber/Plastic**\n\n* Sweet Tarts ropes. If they're too soft, let them sit out for a day or two to harden. They turn very rubbery.\n* Just bubble gum, that's the closest. Some chewing gums can be really plasticy in sensation (and that's because... Well, there *is* actually plastic in some chewing gum). And you're a chewer, so it could be the perfect solution. Like these: https://www.amazon.com/Bubble-Yum-Gum-Original-packages/dp/B00O5B2XH8 I'm not sure which bubble gum are the closest in the sensation you like. Some chewing gums are a bit grainy, but most bubble gums are quite smooth and plastic like. You might have to try a couple of different brands.\n\n**Sticks/wood**\n\n* [You can get licorice root online.](https://www.amazon.com/Licorice-Root-Sticks-Natural-Glycyrrhiza/dp/B0849Y137X)\n*  There are also [cinnamon sticks](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cinnamon+sticks)\n\n**Sponges**\n\nThere are edible sponges. They are called \"loofa\", \"loofah\" or \"luffa\". And if you can't buy them, you can just grow your own by buying seeds online.\n\n* [loofa recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNoivScHkXU)\n* [Growing and Enjoying Luffa Sponges](https://ngb.org/2021/05/04/growing-and-enjoying-luffa-sponges/)\n\n**Strings/towels**\n\nThere are multiple types of rope like candy, but I don't know all the names of them. Here's a licorice version:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Italian-Licorice-Wheels-Natural-Flavors/dp/B01ENYLJK8\n\nSo you can unwind these and pull then apart and even make knots in them and then nom-nom-nom them into your mouth. I think there's also a strawberry/twizzler like version.\n\nIt's called \"wheel candy\" it seems. Here's a version in different flavors: https://www.amazon.com/FirstChoiceCandy-Faced-Licorice-Wheels-Candy/dp/B07TK5ZLHD\n\nThese are extra long: https://www.amazon.com/Sunny-Island-Bulk-Strawberry-Licorice/dp/B07QNS6YS3\n\nIf you look around, you can find all sorts of different versions in different flavors.",

    "body": "tldr: I like dark ages but maybe needs a more consistent design pass (esp science dark ages) - some are hard to unlock without being really behind while others are super easy to unlock without losing too much  \nbest overall design: dark military exploration  \nworst overall design: dark science modern\n\nI wanted to try out every single dark age, including doing double-dark ages (as in, pick dark age in exploration and modern). They might not be the most optimal civ-leader combos as I had other considerations (I wanted to play Ada and Carthage as they were just released, for e.g.) - just wanted to see how the mechanics would play out..\n\nI'll try to give brief explanations of the dark age mechanics for those completely unfamiliar - if you have specific questions ask me in the comments. Dark ages are basically a legacy option when you transition into exploration and modern, without meeting the first milestone in any of the legacy paths in the prior age. Example - building less than 2 wonders in antiquity gives you the option of a cultural dark age in exploration. When you pick one, you cannot pick any other legacy option, including other dark and golden ages, attribute points, etc. except for change capital\n\nDisclaimer: I played on Sovereign as I find it the most fun difficulty currently.\n\n# First run- dark eco exploration; Ada - Rome - Spain - Great Britain\n\nDark eco exploration - every 2 levels on your naval commander grants you a settle action on that commander (basically Legatus on naval), settlers cost more to train  \n**Unlocking it:** this dark age is really hard to intentionally get - I can see it being an interesting strategy to settle locations focusing a certain terrain type (at the expense of more resources), but if the intention is for this to help players who are behind on resources, I think the first milestone is too easy to get - slotting 7 resources - so players have to be reallly really behind to not get this (esp because you automatically slot valid resources when a settle claims the tile. Even harder if you're trying to do it on purpose (i.e. youre not actually that behind) as it's for e.g. easy to \"not build wonders\" or \"not pick masteries/narratives that give you codices\" even if you're ahead.  \n**Strong/Weak?** It's quite good - if you keep a constant xp stream to two or three naval commanders by independent people (IP) hopping (and eventually, taking AI cities by the coast), I find the settling frequency quite in line with settlement limit increases (through tech/civics), and - you're already at pretty good locations where you got xp (from clearing IPs). It also makes a lot of sense for getting strong treasure fleet settles faster than anyone else as you dont have to build and move settlers - so the penalty doesn't even matter. The only downside is you can't do settles away from coast/navigable rivers  \n**Fun?:** Yes, esp with Spain (I got suppppper lucky with my first conquistador, iykyk); I can see Chola being a fun combo as well.\n\n# Second run - dark culture exploration into dark science modern; Catherine - Han- Shawnee - Russia\n\nDark culture exploration - missionaries get +1 move and +1 charge, -3 happiness in all settles after founding a religion; -6 in settles not following your religion;  \n**Unlocking it:** Pretty easy - just don't build more than 1 wonder (probably just your civs associated wonder or gate of all nations). I picked Han so I could focus entirely on building a humongous great-wall that would basically propel my culture into perpetuity, and wonders would only get in the way, tbh.  \n**Strong/Weak?** Above average - I played this combo (i.e. with Shawnee) because I wanted to see what would happen if I got 100% conversion (spoilers, you only get one more founder belief, and you can't even golden age both in modern). I did get pretty good early yields on my religion and so many relics quickly, but I think it was the big great wall + serpents mound + forbidden city that basically won me the game  \n**Fun?:** yes contingent on you liking religion, which is a pretty underbaked mechanic atm - I thought it was ok to try one time.\n\nDark science modern - unlocks flight with combustion, air units cost more to train  \n**Unlocking it:** this one actually sucks hard - it's very hard to not accidentally get this because it requires a lot of calculation or not placing any specialists at all (also hard, and suboptimal), and you literally cannot get a single tile with >40 yield.  \n**Strong/Weak?** Pretty weak, it basically let's you start aerodrome/trans-oceanic flight earlier, that's it. I suppose unlocking airplanes is good, but the penalty makes it hard to use anyway  \n**Fun?:** Not really, but also I may have been so ahead by modern I don't feel the science struggle very much.\n\n# Third run - dark military exploration into dark eco; Napoleon Emeperor - Khmer - Mongolia - Prussia\n\nDark military exploration - lose all your settlements except your capital (your existing or the one you click change capital to), lose all your existing armies and army commanders (fyi, you keep independent units as much as your settles still!), start with three army commanders packed with cavalry and siege  \n**Unlocking it:** since you're going to lose everything but your capital, this is quite OK to unlock, the plan for me was simply get a couple of food heavy towns to boost my super capital (why I picked Khmer), which spammed wonders and specialists to make sure I could start on slightly better culture/science/gold in exploration  \n**Strong/Weak?** Strong but situational (thats good design I think!) - if you have juicy targets nearby, especially strong cities with horses, this snowballs much faster. It's harder to use it for, ironically, distant land captures for the military golden age. You'll also realize you don't have that much influence for war support (because you'll at max have one monument and villa to start) right from the get go, so the first few picks count for a lot, and previous age bad relationships are good (why I picked napoleon). The very obvious pick for this is mongols. I can see normans as a potentially good one for doing a distant lands version of the strat.  \n**Fun?:** of course (unless you hate war and only like optimal settles where you can plan everything - i.e. not ai/other people settles) I would say it kind of trivializes the antiquity age (though Id argue if you play a super capital/lose territory to other plays actually this is OK)\n\nDark eco modern - 100% Production and Gold towards building or purchasing Rail Stations and Ports as well as +1 Resource Capacity in all settlements, but -25% Culture;\n\n**Unlocking it:** easy - don't get treasure fleet points (or if you did mongolia dark military, don't even conquer/settle outside of your homelands!), very viable  \n**Strong/Weak?** strong - the downside is somewhat harsh but for eco victory types this just makes it that much faster. The fact that there is a viable way of not being behind to unlock it (i.e. don't play treasure fleets) makes it that much stronger (tea and chocolate are the only factory resources you aren't going to get without distant lands), but I found enough coffee/cotton/citrus/quinine/fish/kaolin to not care too much. Also, with prussia, this double dark age strat was more effective because I can trade for more resources even though everyone hates me/is at war! (+ they get railroad bonuses)  \n**Fun?:** it's fun if you like \"speed-running\" type gameplay - it basically made eco victory \"win more/faster\" and was very smooth. I do, so this was fun for me.\n\n# Fourth run - dark science exploration into dark military modern; Augustus - Carthage - Chola - Mughal\n\nDark science exploration - Dark Age: Gain a random technology boost every five turns, but -50% Science.\n\n**Unlocking it:** relatively OK  - you have to intentionally not pick tech masteries that give codices, which for the most part most of the masteries I want don't involve codices anyway  \n**Strong/Weak?** this one just sucks, or I'm not sure how to play around it enough. It's like a weaker civ 6 babylon? I guess the idea is you can randomly get techs you want faster, (or you can purposely play into them), but you are somewhat incentivized to neglect science? I suppose if you have a flexible plan - like if you get wharf early you'll go distant lands faster, if you get machinery maybe you'll do this, etc.  \n**Fun?:** kind of? not really? might need a design pass? maybe if you like random?; My plan ended up being to neglect science in favor of spamming units and commanders (why I picked chola) to set up for my military dark age in modern (so because I had no science, I could spam the less upgraded unit anyway, though im not sure if it costs less), so it worked out.\n\nDark military modern - Dark Age: Gain two levels on all Commanders and new Commanders start out with two levels, but +25% Production cost for all military units.\n\n**Unlocking it:** pretty easy - just don't settle too much distant lands and definitely don't convert them to your religion  \n**Strong/Weak?** strong with setup - I basically had enough settle limit and enough commanders that i could potentially just declare multiple wars and take every city I needed instantly once I hit an ideology - i couldnt because I didnt set up enough denounces early to mass declare formal wars - I actually wanted to do Great Britain (because of my massive setup navy in exploration -> Revenge) but there's a bug so I went for Mughal because I wanted to *buy* the manhattan project (also, fitting because the overused quote is from the bhagavad gita, not exactly mughal but on the subcontinent I suppose)  \n**Fun?:** yes, executing this plan was very fun\n\n# Fifth run - dark modern culture; Friedrich Baroque - Egypt  - Ming - Buganda\n\nDark culture modern - Dark Age: +1 Movement and +50% Excavation Speed for Explorers, but -50% Influence.\n\n**Unlocking it:** easy - ignore religion, very viable to get culture from other sources (why I chose ming)  \n**Strong/Weak?** mixed? I think with the slightly reworked modern cultural victory, it actually does make a difference that your explorer \"gets there first\", but to me it's more about luck and how many explorers you can buy rather than movement, so maybe this needs a slight rework (e.g. unlock free/cheaper explorers after building a wonder or something), the influence penalty is pretty painful, esp when compared to the dark eco modern (-25% culture is much less painful)  \n**Fun?:** \\~eh, because we get less explorers now, and because you can get artifacts through other means, you don't interact with it much, so it's not that fun. Also, I should probably be using railroads more to shift explorers... (my own fault) I picked friedrich - buganda partially to get the artifacts even faster (by conquest, and pillaging for culture)\n\n# Closing thoughts\n\nI *think* the devs tried to design dark ages such that it helps players in weaker positions rubber-band into a golden age for the same-type legacy path - I think this vision was met for all but the science exploration dark age. However, culture, military and eco modern dark ages are really easy to get while *not* behind (ignore religion or distant lands, not that much penalty), so it's a bit weird because it becomes a powerful *all-in* option for a modern victory rather than a Im behind and need to catch up mechanic. (maybe what needs to change is to make those paths stronger, like treasure fleets giving crap-tons of gold and or resources) That said, you do lose out on all the points you did get if you pick it, so the intention is still for you to be behind to pick it. But also, some of them are really fun and I want to pick it even though Im ahead? The science ones are also not as creative or well designed as I think they can be. Also, because you lose all your other points and take a dark-age penalty, it's probably not that good (but of course, you can't make it better than a golden age, otherwise what's the point). I think maybe some of these problems would be addressed by a smarter/more difficult AI forcing me to really consider dark ages in that setting (I don't play on deity so that's partly it)\n\nHow do you feel about dark ages in civ 7?",

It's only 2 ½ inches long, but like I keep telling my wife, size doesn't matter! 🙄 Especially when it has such phenomenal form, and is made from such beautiful material! This one comes out of Weston, Wisconsin, which is in Marathon Co. It's made from a beautiful piece of heavily patinaed, glossy Kaolin Chert! Its loaded with mineral deposits, and is outstanding in every way! The base looks like it has a damaged corner, but thats actually the natural crystal cortex! The maker left it, and made the point around it! So its actually completely intact, and was found exactly as it was when originally made! The craftsmanship on this point leaves me speechless! Like the last Hardin I posted, this one is also early stage, and hasn't seen very many resharpenings. The stem and base are both heavily ground smooth, and I have yet to find a flaw anywhere on it. The colors it exhibits are incredible as well! She's definitely a jaw dropper! \n \nEx Jake Vahle collection (former owner of Heartland artifacts)\n\nEx Troy T. Collection",

        "author": "jQuaade",
        "body": "I've played around with Kaolin, and found some intresting combos.\n\nGeomagnetic Grip is both a point and unit target spell. Using it on an allied, will drag them to you, while using it on an enemy will give an error. Using it on the ground will drag the nearest stone within something like a 200-300 aoe of that stone, meaning you can increase Geomagnetic grips range slightly by using it on the ground near the rock. It does not require vision to geomagnetic a rock, as long as you just ground target within 2-300 aoe of the rock.\n\nYou can cast all your spells, except Geomagnetic Grip while rolling. It is possible to drop a stone in front of you while rolling to speed up the roll after it has started. You can also Magnetize while rolling. Upon hitting an enemy hero while rolling, the roll will stop and you will appear on the opposite side of them, meaning you can do a quick Boulder Smash to knock them back into your team.\n\nYou can Geomagnetic Grip a stone that you have Boulder Smashed while it's rolling, and it will return to your position. This means that you can use that combo to harras in lane (Or just initiate with a little bonus damage) for a nice 325 damage with 5 sec silence and 2.5 sec stun, for 175 mana.\n\n\nYou can build onto this even more, by charging up your roll as the rock is returning and the enemy is stunned. This means you can add an additional 270 damage to the combo, with an 80% attack and movespeed slow. In total for 225 mana.\n\nSo far we have 5 sec silence, 2.5 sec stun, 80% attack and movespeed slow and 595 damage in a powershot-like AOE, all for 225 mana. The longest cooldown is bouldersmash, which has 16 seconds.\n\nWhile rolling, you can use your ult, which will add an additional 300 (600 at level 16) damage over 6 seconds, which can be refreshed up to 7 times (Keeping magnetize up for 6 rocks, which is the highest you can have at any given time, takes 36 seconds. Kaolin's rocks respawns every 25 seconds, meaning you will get one rock ekstra, letting you keep Magnetize up for a total of 42 seconds. In reality, you probably won't have a 42 seconds long chase, but cool nonetheless).\n\n**Level 7 Kaolin is able to:**\n\n*Max Damage (4 ranks in Boulder Smash, 1 in Roll, 1 in Geomagnetic grip, 1 in ult):*\n\n* 505 damage\n* 5 sec silence\n* 1 sec stun \n* 2 seconds of 80% move/attackspeed slow\n* Additionally you can add a total of 300*7 (2100!) damage by refreshing Magnetize. All of this is in an AOE as well.\n\n*Max CC (1 rank in BS, 1 in roll, 4 in Grip, 1 in ult):*\n\n* 360 damage\n* 5 sec silence\n* 2.5 sec stun \n* 2 seconds of 80/80 slow.\n* Again, 7*300 dot damage.\n\nWith that being said, the hero is super amazingly fun to play. A bit like a strength Storm Spirit'ish thing, or a clockwork with less initiation range, but more damage.\n\nI've played him a few games over Garena, and i can safely say that this guy is amazingly fun. He is an amazing \"body guard\". Crystal Maiden getting open wounded and Naix is smashing her? Grip that young lady! Naix switches over to skywrath mage? Roll into him and knock his sorry ass away!\n\nIn laning, i found it useful to rush up before creeps spawn and place some strategic stones. Your stones lasts for 2 minutes, but only have 25 sec cooldown, so you'll be able to get 6 stones ready after one and a half minute, while still keeping the pre-placed rocks. I never felt like i ran out of stones, even though i placed stones in different strategic positions. Stones are actually very rarely needed. Geomagnetic grip works on allied heroes and creeps, so you can use them for the stun (though you will not get the 125 damage they add). Boulders 5 second silence is obviously amazing, but you mostly use the Stone->Boulder Smash combo in teamfights (which, let's face it, rarely happens when playing over Garena). I felt like his roll was incredibly lackluster without a stone to boost the speed and range.\n\n*A few tricks i found while playing:*\n\nIf you have some good damage in your lane, it should be fairly easy to get firstblood when you have roll and smash. Roll + Stone gives you a really good range on your dash (1600 range!), and is not too difficult to aim. If you can hit an enemy, Boulder Smashing them back behind your creeps, and near your laning partner should net you a fairly easy kill.\n\nI mentioned it before, but it's too useful to let it pass. You can Geomagnetic Grip rocks that you have boulder smashed away as it is flying. That way you can get the silence and stun off, with a good chunk of damage. The silence lasts for 5 seconds at all ranks! (you get silence by knocking a stone into an enemy with boulderdash, in addtion to the damage)\n\nYour ult wrecks faces. If you get it off on someone, you can pretty much just chase them around, throwing pebbels near them every few seconds and watch them cry. If they decide to turn around and try to kill you, just knock them away and roll where you please.\n\nYour roll stops when it hits an enemy, and since it takes a little time for the roll to build up, it's a fairly lousy escape if the enemy can see you, as they can just walk in front of you. You're better off knocking them away, or trying to juke and then roll when they can't see you. The rolls hitbox is also big enough, that even if enemies are behind you as you start rolling, you will get stopped.\nEdit: Formatting",

Since the healing effects are double in that duration, Purifying Flames heals a good amount of hp if you used it on an shileded ally. You can cast 2 Purifying Flames in that time.

    "body": "This is my second attempt at writing this post up. Oh boy. I want to explain to folks why it's important to know what your indie/handmade watercolors (or other art supplies!) are made of. Also why they're so similar to the more popular indie loves on this sub - perfume, makeup, and nailpolish!\n\nComplete with illustrative doodles, adventures in questionable paint, and safety advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Do not EAT the paint!](https://preview.redd.it/feqp7w2997j71.png?width=3164&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9f83c18ee1c0b9c97e8073169a0929f91c08d64)\n\n**Image:** the background is painted using the professional watercolor brand Daniel Smith. The colors are pulled across the paper and are overlapping or layered. Here, I believe I mostly used a warm red called pyrrol scarlet (sort of like how tomato soup tastes), and the cool red-pink known as Quinacridone Rose. It's a color that feels elegant - floral or lipstick like. Watercolors are known for their translucency, and they feel like the paint equivalent of a gauze or mesh fabric spread over the paper. In the center, I sketched a paint tube with a label band. The inside of the band is painted using two colors from an indie watercolor brand called Greenleaf Blueberry, The pink and blue mix in the middle to make purple. I outlined the tube with a purple fountain pen ink. The rest of the is colored with white chalk pencil. The page includes my basic rules of paint safety - which I will type out below. \\[End of image description.\\]\n\nPaint safety rules before I continue:\n\n1. **Common sense: DO NOT** ***EAT*** **THE PAINT.** Really. Even though it's a lil bit tempting. We learned this lesson with playdoh.\n2. **Assume the paint or supply is at least mildly irritating.** This means if you aren't using finger paints (or children's paints), quit using your fingers directly. The majority of watercolor paints are low in their toxicity once they are in a paint format. But you never know when skin sensitivities can develop, and professional paints have more irritants than eyeshadows do. They can contain iron oxides, cobalt, cadmium, nickel, and other substances that you might react to.\n3. **Cover your paint and paint water so toddlers and pets don't drink it.** They're unlikely to become fatally ill from an accidental sip of watercolor water, but it's still likely they'll end up pretty sick to the stomach. Oil and acrylic paints can present an even higher toxicity issue. It's good to get in the habit of covering up supplies.\n4. **Look up the Studio Safety Basics for your medium of choice.** My recommendations are:  [Getting Your Shit Together: Health & Studio Safety for Artists](https://www.gyst-ink.com/health-safety). For Watercolor specifically, please see the website **Handprint**. It is by far the best, most thorough watercolors website period. It has almost everything, to the point of being a little overwhelming. For simplicity's sake, this section [here](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/pigmt6.html#toxicity) is the part about \"health & environmental issues.\" For Acrylics, the brand [liquitex](https://www.liquitex.com/us/knowledge/safety-disposal/) has a simple guide. For Oil Painting, I had the opportunity to read Kimberly Brooks' *The New Oil Painting: Your Essential Guide to Materials and Safe Practices*. This is a very good book on minimizing toxicity in oil painting, avoiding an excess of harsh, corrosive, or flammable chemicals. It's also aimed at being solvent free. If you want to know eeeeverrryyything, then I suggest googling \"CPSC Art and Craft Safety Guide,\" which is the US Government's guide. Just remember, the dose makes the poison.\n5. **Practice Safe Disposal -** you'll find disposal advice for paint water or other supplies in any safety guide.\n6. **Have Fun!**\n\nNow, let me explain why I felt compelled to write some...let's say, advice about indie watercolors (specifically).\n\nIt starts with me wanting very badly to order some paints from a small \"indie\" paint maker, but wanting to y'know, pick some paints within a reasonable budget. It ends with a volcano. Bear with me.\n\nWhen you go to buy a watercolor paint in general, you need to know a few things about what you're about to purchase.\n\n**Things to consider when buying watercolors!:**\n\n* Do you care about how lightfast the paint is? That is, do you intend to sell any work you make, or will you be upset if your work changes color later? If the answer is yes, you care if the paint is lightfast.\n* Did the seller give the CI number - that is, the **Color Index Number?** It may look like something like this: PG7, PB60, NBk12, PR102 and so on. This tell you what Pigment (P) or Natural pigment (N) a paint is made with, plus the color - like G = Green, and then the specific *name* of that paint. So PG7 is Pthalo Green, and you can look up what Pthalocyanine Green is made from, how toxic it might be, how light fast it generally is, and so on.\n* If they gave the CI number, did they also give a lightfastness rating? If so, does it seem generally accurate to the rating of the pigment?\n* If they don't use pigments at all, do they use dyes instead?\n* For lack of better terms, are you trying to paint *paintings*, paint calligraphy, or use paint for highlights/coloring/to decorate crafts easily?\n* Are you looking for traditional Western or Eastern watercolors (gum arabic or glue binder, usually) or are you looking for non-traditional watercolors: the sparkly, glittery, neon, or calligraphy/shimmer water colors? Do you actually want to use opaque watercolors - that is, *gouache?*\n* What paint qualities are you looking for? Do you value mixability? Translucency? Granulation? Shine? Does it matter if the neon pink fades if you're just going to digitally scan it?\n\nPaint is like Perfume, Eyeshadow, or Nail polish! The formulas are basically the same:\n\nCOLOR OR AROMA + VEHICLE = YOUR PRODUCT.\n\nThe vehicle can include: base/binders, extenders, solvents/thinners, stabilizers/preservatives other things that determine the properties and longevity of whatever is being applied.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[All doodles painted in with the Greenleaf Blueberry CYMK paint set, and in a St. Louis Art Supply Handmade multi-media sketchbook. Description below.](https://preview.redd.it/558a6j97u7j71.png?width=1421&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d9ab8280610a6dcd952efca5366583d8d5bc131)\n\nSo this image is just showing you how things like paints are composed similarly to other indie faves:\n\n* **Watercolor** = Pigment + Binder (Gum Arabic in western watercolor. East Asian watercolors may use a glue binder) + humectant (honey, clove oil, etc), plasticizer (glycerin), and sometimes fungicide, dispersants, etc. Also water!\n* **Gouache** is opaque watercolor. This is achieved either by using colorless fillers, white pigment fillers, or a higher ratio of pure pigment to watercolor vehicle (considered the highest quality).\n* **Chalk Pastels** = Binder + Pigment + Clay or Chalk. Soft pastels typically don't have any chalk, and are just binder + pigment!\n* **Oil Paints =** pigment + oils + additives (student grade oil paints may have additional fillers, usually chalk/calcium carbonate; some may also have driers, thinners, etc).\n* **Perfume =** base carrier of oil or alcohol + aroma compounds (essential oils, resins, musks, etc) + may have water, preservatives, solvents, and fixatives.\n* **Eyeshadow =** Eye Safe Pigments + base of fillers (often talc, Kaolin clay, and mica) and adhesives (often zinc and magnesium), plus slip (like silica, dimethicone, or nylon) and preservatives. These could technically double as less pigmented/not light fast pan pastels, if you really want to use them up.\n* **Nail Polish =** pigment/dye color with a film-forming polymer vehicle, and the additions of solvents. May have some combo of stabilizers, resins, thickeners, and bishie sparkles.\n\nBut as we all know within these general bounds, there's a million different unique characteristics we can look for! I'm going to show some watercolor ones. I'm just going to copy images from Etsy, but please be advised that unless I state I personally tried the paint, I don't know if the company is any good or not! I just want to illustrate what things look like.\n\nTraditional \"western\" watercolors using earth pigments can look like this [Red Clover Meadow](https://www.etsy.com/shop/RedCloverMeadow?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=789259199) set:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pictured: a watercolor set of 12 in muted earth tones of red, yellow, blue, green, and browns](https://preview.redd.it/esb0576zd7j71.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&s=f56eb287f0411efe7c473aec568a7546b3c60055)\n\nOr they can be brighter and more colorful traditional watercolors, like these [Beam Paints](https://www.beampaints.com/collections/all?page=1) paintstones (I haven't used this specific set, but I have used and loved Beam Paints!):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pictured: 6 paint stones. Left to right, top to bottom: a vibrant pink-magenta, an orange, a pale opaque pink, a pale opaque yellow, a deep blue, and graphite grey. The middle two - which are opaque, are gouaches.](https://preview.redd.it/o6jwz5idm7j71.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=f33b0b1a81553298efa1fc8bcfdf6ca0eb6d5720)\n\nBut less traditional \"watercolors\" might be fluoro/neon like this [Playful Pigment](https://www.etsy.com/shop/PlayfulPigment?ref=l2-about-shopname) set.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I Love the 80's 3D! Pictured: Neon green, blue, yellow, orange, purple, and pink paint swatches, a tin set of the 6 paints, and a cassette tape painted in neon.](https://preview.redd.it/vxqbx13ze7j71.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bc239e967130bd7a948a2fa2174f18a47ff5c51)\n\nKeep in mind: [Neon paints are almost never very lightfast.](https://doodlewash.com/doodlewash-review-neon-lumi-accent-color/) That's why Playful Pigment notes (helpfully):\n\n>Display out of direct light, and use acid free paper and UV protective glass or spray to prevent fading.\n\nOr perhaps you like a mica-based shimmer, metallic, or sparkle watercolor, like this [Rivervale](https://www.etsy.com/shop/RivervaleWatercolor?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=638667884) Paint:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pictured: Ocean Blue Mica paint, which is quite opaque, and very shimmery.](https://preview.redd.it/22c2er9fg7j71.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=891a6fdc8e9892adb44a10f0abc722f0bcbcb6ed)\n\nI want to use this particular paint as a good example of useful paint information listed in the description for a non-traditional watercolor paint:\n\n>**Color:** Ocean Blue Mica**Pigment Color Index Name:** No official name, unaltered mica goes by **PW20**. Mica is a nearly colorless silicate mineral crystal that is usually formed of very thin plate-like layers. Powdering mica produces a natural glitter, and colored mica is usually created by coating mica particles with iron oxides or titanium dioxide. This mica in particular is described as colored by titanium and tin oxides, and Ferric Ferrocyanide.**Lightfastness:** \\- Good - II**Granulation:** Moderate**Translucence/opacity:** Opaque\n\nThis is great, because you know what you're getting!\n\nYou might see a highly granulating traditional watercolor, like from [Mashas Watercolors](https://www.etsy.com/shop/MashasWatercolors?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=885912882):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Picture: This Ultramarine Purple is a pigment mix, very granulating. It's a pinky-purple with a neat, almost bubbly effect. ](https://preview.redd.it/h2capjxvj7j71.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ecc5beadc56933f4bf4dcc9aa2c298b2e0899b8)\n\nPigments can be synthetic or natural - and they can be \"genuine\" minerals instead of synthetic counterparts. The most common swap in paints is the color *Ultramarine Blue*.\n\nGenuine Ultramarine is actually *Lapis Lazuli* and is one of the most expensive pigments around, because lapis lazuli is only mined in Afghanistan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This tiny half pan of Lapis Lazuli blue from Afghanistan is $163.70. Quite understandably, I bought Greenleaf Blueberry's CYMK seashell set for $39.50 instead.](https://preview.redd.it/e1k53zq3q7j71.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaf9276bb255d7b91bdbfdacd586669bc7218197)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday, we substitute with Ultramarine blue \\[[Colors of the Iron Range](https://www.colorsoftheironrange.com/individual-pans) example\\] which is PB29.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pictured: Ultramarine Blue Extra Dark half pan. ](https://preview.redd.it/0ds3tfv0s7j71.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=1644c6292e9609767d802144890f18dd64d6c27a)\n\nWe actually substitute a lot of pigments in 2021. There's a good reason for this: substitutes can be much less expensive, many genuine mineral pigments are actually somewhat unimpressive (at least in watercolors), and sometimes we've got Other Reasons.\n\nWhich brings us to the aforementioned volcano I promised. I've been eyeing paints at this one specific shop, and I found they had an individual store front in addition to their etsy. I clicked over to their historical pigments.\n\nAnd then I let out an aggrieved sigh:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image: Swatch of Cinnabar - Genuine Volcanic Mineral, a fiery blood orange. \\(god she's so pretentious\\). $45.00](https://preview.redd.it/24j59njew7j71.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0168789881a2089e4fa33245e3a9412be363305)\n\nLook, I want to explain to you what Genuine Cinnabar, or Genuine Vermillion paint *is* if you don't already know. I want you to understand that I don't inherently object to professional artists choosing to use Genuine Cinnabar paints - especially in oil painting. It's a gorgeous historical color:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image: Roman mural painting at Pompeii's Villa of Mysteries. Figures standing and seated before a Vermillion red background](https://preview.redd.it/wgph2ic4z7j71.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=40144359dfefb4b2ae8ee8eec88b4f85b6b524d2)\n\nBut Cinnabar is **Mercuric Sulfide**. Today we say \"Cinnabar\" for natural mercuric sulfide pigment, and \"Vermillion\" for synthetic mercuric sulfide PR 106, but they can be used interchangeably. The paint in question is not listed as synthetic PR 106, though.\n\nFrom the shop in question:\n\n>Cinnabar is considered to be toxic because it contains mercury. It's most toxic in its powdered form because it can be inhaled. It's not hazardous in a watercolor form because it's not a powder, but it still needs to be handled with care...\n\nLook, is this *probably* safe-ish to use so long as you don't drink it? Probably!  I know oil painters can use genuine vermillion, and not die, so I assume that watercolor paint is probably fine also if used responsibly.\n\nBut here's my big big problem: No pigment index is listed, so if this *is* genuine volcanic material, I have no way of knowing what *other* impurities are in this pigment. Impurities that make it prone to turning brownish black, and not the color you spend $45.00 for.\n\nAnd if we're just comparing with synthetic PR 106 -- it is, uh. Terrible in watercolor. Awful. It can turn ugly colors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image: Handprint's Lightfastness test of PR 106 Vermillion. The bottom half has been exposed to sunlight, changing it from a bright colorful red to a muddy color.](https://preview.redd.it/s483y3qa08j71.png?width=140&format=png&auto=webp&s=646a21b275dcb98b7429a2d25afe0c23948e1caa)\n\nHandprint says this of Vermillion in watercolor:\n\n>Genuine vermilion PR106 is a **fugitive**, very opaque, heavily staining, moderately dark valued, intense [**orange red**](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/palette1.html#orangered) pigment. The [**ASTM**](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/pigmt6.html#bluetable) (1999) rates its lightfastness as \"fair\" (III), but in my own tests, which allowed for the heat of direct sunlight\\*\\*, I saw its muted scarlet fade to a horrid scabby brown after just two weeks of sunlight exposure ([**BWS 4**](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/pigmt6.html#bluetable)), earning it a \"poor\" (IV) rating. Mercuric sulfide is also poisonous.\\*\\* In addition to these dubious virtues, it is **extremely expensive** ($31 for a 15ml. tube in 2004). \\[...\\]   The color is a bright, opaque scarlet red. **It is not a satisfactory watercolor pigment by modern standards because it is** [**highly toxic**](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/pigmt6.html#toxicity) **(mercury will cause severe metal poisoning) and fugitive (it quickly withers to a dull brown in the presence of light).**\n\nBasically, I cannot recommend  spending $45.00 on this limited edition historical pigment. I can't recommend buying it in a set at Choosing Keeping by what is...basically the paint equivalent of not quite Indie, but Niche - [Vintage Watercolors](https://choosingkeeping.com/collections/painting/products/mount-amiata-natural-pigments-watercolour-set).  And I found other indies selling genuine cinnabar, or strawberry cinnabar paint.\n\nThis shop with the $45.00 paint sells some gorgeous colors and color mixes - stuff I *really* want.\n\nBut I don't know how to feel when you don't explicitly label **Chrome Yellow Light - PY34** as [Lead Chromate/Lead Sulfate.](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/waterfs.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chrome Yellow Light half pans and swatch](https://preview.redd.it/n6dw3ypm28j71.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d838c559e76c0edcf74fd6c028237e71ebef7e5)\n\nLightfastness was listed as \"Medium.\" But Handprint says:\n\n>Chrome yellow PY34 is an impermanent, semiopaque, heavily staining, very light valued, intense [**yellow**](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/palette1.html#yellow) pigment, in hue most similar to hansa yellow medium. Formerly a widely used industrial pigment, it is offered in a very wide range of formulations by 20 pigment manufacturers, mostly for use in metallic coatings, ceramics and plastics; its use is declining because **it contains lead, a polluting and toxic heavy metal**. Note that the [**ASTM**](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/pigmt6.html#bluetable) watercolor tests (1999) gave the chrome yellows an \"excellent\" (I) lightfastness rating, **while my 2004 tests put the Winsor & Newton paints in category IV (\"poor\"): the chroma faded by more than 20%.**\n\nWe replaced this pigment with Hansa Yellow Medium (PY79  *arylide yellow* ). We have a lead-free alternative. Why use lead? Especially if it's less lightfast?\n\nAnother color I admired briefly was labeled PO34. \"Lightfastness: Yes.\" I went to look it up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image of a not-light fast, deeply faded orange color on the bottom half.](https://preview.redd.it/yu7r3d8v38j71.png?width=140&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7842bde87c9a6f094030dd8674191e11e9fa24)\n\nGoing through this made me sure I wanted to explain to other people what they might need or want to know before they bought Indie art supplies. Because you should be able to determine for yourself if that much color shifting is worth the price for you! Or if you want to pay $45.00 for  mercury paint that *might* end up going from red to scabby brownish color! Maybe that genuine Cinnabar had all the volcanic impurities tested for and removed and it's perfect! I want to believe that seller genuinely did do extensive lightfastness testing.\n\nBut I'm torn buying anything from a shop that uses colors that probably aren't as lightfast as claimed, and which use toxic historical pigments without consistently indicating they're toxic. I mean, *I* know what I'd be buying, but would everyone else?\n\nSo to summarize this excessively long post now, here's the top things I advise before you drop $$$ on watercolors or any Indie/Niche art supply. A Caveat Emptor, if you will:\n\n1. If the CI number is listed, cross reference [Handprint](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/waterfs.html) or [Artist Pigment Index](http://www.artiscreation.com/Color_index_names.html). You can look up lightfastness, or toxicity this way. Even toxic paints can be used safely. If there's no CI, assume it's not very lightfast, but don't let that stop you from buying and enjoying the paint! Just don't assume the color will remain vibrant or the same over time.\n2. Remember the color name may not be what the color index says the *pigment* is!\n3. Understand that shimmers, metallics, duochromes, holos, glitters, neons, and so on are probably *unlikely* to mix with multiple other colors as easily as traditional western watercolors. That's not to say none of them will mix, but most are used primarily as single-colors, and the different characteristics mixing may present a challenge.\n4. A lot of \"genuine mineral\" watercolor paints, and even some \"natural pigments,\" are extremely weak pigments. It doesn't matter how much of that all natural malachite you have shoved in that tiny little pan - Malachite is a pretty weak pigment, and it *will* change color over time because it's malachite. Lac Dye is *always* going to need multiple layers to get the color you want. You get the idea.\n5. If you want to only purchase vegan paints, you will need to be extra careful when selecting watercolors of any kind. While gum arabic is vegan, honey is the most popular watercolor humectant because it's *extremely* good at what it does, it's historical, and people think it makes the paint perform better. You will need to research if a shop explicitly *avoids* using honey in their watercolor. Likewise, if you are interested in East Asian watercolors (most especially traditional Japanese watercolors, but I believe this may also apply to some traditional Chinese and Korean paints), be advised that they most commonly use animal glue binder.\n6. On that note: heavily honey-based \"wet\" or \"creamy\" paints may remain much more runny for longer when in humid areas (so be careful packing them up!), but will also remain wetter longer in very dry places. Many shops advise chilling the paints in the fridge or freezer upon arrival if they think the paint may be tacky or gummy.\n7. All paint in pans should be spritzed with water to activate before you try using them, or you may be super disappointed when you don't have to be.\n8. In perfumes, marketing descriptions are part of how you know what you're going to buy! But keep in mind when a paint description says (and shop omitted to protect the guilty): *\"Imagine a shiny Cadillac, a cloud of cotton candy and the feeling of going in a holiday 😄🌈 this is what inspired me this warm pink, perfect for blossoming flowers and sunset clouds.\"* This tells you diddly squat about: what's in the paint, how the paint flows, if it granulates, what pigments are in it, and if you can hang a painting you made with it in a sunny room.\n9. If you do not buy watercolor paper, you will inevitably be disappointed with watercolor. Stop doing that to yourself! To make a long story short, ***ignore*** how many pounds the paper is (150 lb doesn't tell you anything useful) and *only* make purchases based on the GSM weight. 300 gsm Cotton Rag is considered premium. If you saw the price of Arches and thought that was too much, don't worry. Bee Paper sells an affordable 300 GSM 100% cotton rag paper - $[9.48 for 25 sheets at Jerry's Artarama](https://www.jerrysartarama.com/bee-paper-rag-cold-press-watercolor-paper-sheets-and-rolls) in 6x9 inches. To prove my point about why the pound weight is meaningless, this is 140 lb paper. Or hey, buy indie art paper, or indie made sketchbooks!  Mixed Media paper is often okay with light washes of watercolor. Check to see if it can handle multiple layers or heavier washes.\n10. In general, buy a support/paper that makes sense for your medium of choice.\n11. Unfortunately, \"[Painters have no effective control](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/pigmt6.html#toxicity) over \\[these\\] upstream environmental impacts \\[of pigment manufacture\\].\" There's very little ways to tell that all the pigments were sourced in an environmentally friendly manner. Certain things are easier to find, like ethically sourced mica! But you can't know where or how every pigment was obtained and processed.\n12. If it can be made, someone's made it indie, or small-scale niche as an art supply! Watercolor paints are hugely popular in small maker businesses. Some people also make and sell pastels, gouaches, oil paints, fountain pen or calligraphy inks, easels, pochade boxes, paint palettes, or sell unique earth pigments for making your own paints!\n13. [https://blackcatlibrary.wordpress.com/2021/08/25/mostly-indie-watercolors/](https://blackcatlibrary.wordpress.com/2021/08/25/mostly-indie-watercolors/) my list of indies I've tried, or want to try, and some art resources (some are free!!!) plus a super short guide to choosing your basic paint colors for mixing as a beginner. \n\nIf you made it to the end of this...congrats!",

The eyes/whiskers/bowtie is a stamp?\n\nSo you used the (brewed) espresso for the soap, not the coffee grounds themselves? I did the latter once, it looked nice (speckled), but was so awfully scratchy. (Like a cat???)\n\nRegarding palm substitution: babaçu is a great replacement for *coconut* oil or palm *kernel* oil, but totally not for palm (fruit) oil. This is a very common misconception. Yes, it will harden up the soap, but the soap will be very soluble, wear up quickly, won't hold up scents as good, and irritant to the skin (you'd have to add the babaçu to the “skin irritating above 20%” rule of thumb for coconut oil).\n\nTo get rid of palm oil (similar issues with ditching animal fats) you'd rather have to find sources for “hardness/longevity” fatty acids (palmitic/stearic acid). There is no one-fits-it-all solution, and most are not exactly cheap. Time-proven ideas are soy wax, shea butter, and (for the palmitic) replace parts or all of your olive oil by rice bran oil and/or avocado oil.

I do at least one minute of washing with each product.\n\nAfter that I splash some Glow Recipe Cloudberry Essence on. I let that sink in and then use Naturium Vitamin C Super Serum Plus. Then I use either Naturium Multipeptide Mosturizer. Every other day I add Naturium Naturium Barrier Bounce before my moisturizer. Occasionally if my skin is super dry, I will use Good Molecules Hyaluronic Acid.\n\nAt Night La Roche Posay Micellar Water to remove my makeup. Then I do a double cleanse with the face washes listed above. I then use the Paula’s Choice BHA (mostly every night but not if my skin is feeling too sensitive that day). I don’t love the way it makes my skin feel so I just let it sit on for about an hour and the remove it with the La Roche Posay Micellar water. I then add Cocokind Beginner Retinol. Followed by Naturium Multipeptide Serum. Then finished up with either Glow Recipe Plum Pump moisturizer or Naturium Multipeptide Rich Cream. If my skin is dry or particularly sensitive I add the Naturium Marshmallow Root Moisturizer to lock it all it. That is more of a balm and seals in the moisture not unlike when people use Vaseline for slugging.\n\nOn my eyes I use either Laneige Waterbank blue hyaluronic eye cream or glow recipe vitamin C Bright Eye Gel Cream. I’m almost done with these though and plan to switch to the new Naturium one when I’m done.\n\nMy top 3 products are the Paula’s Choice BHA, Naturium’s Super Plus Vitamin C Serum, and the CocoKind Oatmilk Cleanser.\n\nThe Paula’s Choice BHA is amazing! I started using it last year but did not love the way it made my skin feel so I stopped using it. I definitely didn’t see immediate results. In fact, I kind of hated it at first. I then decided to give it another try this year with the “micellar water” system where I remove the product after about an hour. I have been consistent in using this for several months and have seen major improvements. I also think the way that I apply it helps. I rub it up and down once, and sideways both ways on my nose and chin every time I use it. It sometimes makes my skin a little red after I do that but it clears up after a few minutes. I think between the BHA and the oil cleanser my pores have shrunk significantly. I’m on the fence now about buying another bottle though because it’s $35 and I’m considering trying the Naturium dupe for $18 since that brand never seems to let me down.\n\nMy second favorite product I’m currently using is The Naturium Super Plus Vitamin C Serum which has brightened up my skin significantly and reduced dark spots. 10/10 would recommend. I might try the Timeless one next though just out of sheer curiosity.\n\nNext, the CocoKind Oil to Milk Cleanser is an another great product worth mentioning. Every time I wash my face with this, I use it for about 1-5 minutes depending on how much time I have. This combined with the Paula’s Choice BHA has been amazing. I started them both around the same time.\n\nI also use red light therapy and mask my skin regularly. Currently I’m using the Porefessional Deep Retreat Pore Cleansing Kaolin Clay Mask, Loreal Paris Bright Reveal Dark Spot Exfoliant Peel, Fenty Cookies and Clean Whipped Clay Pore Detox Face Mask with Salicylic Acid, and finally I sometimes use the Laneige Firm and Bouncy Mask in place of everything else. \n\nSorry that’s so much information! Feel free to ask me any questions if you have any. ",

The others still break, because they’re not as strong but im so excited to see what they will look like in the future! I cant stop staring at my hands now lol, this is a big change for me. Those two before pictures are NOT the worst my nails were, but i dont have more pictures because i was embarassed, but oh boy they were 10x more horrible than those pictures.

    "body": "Hey All, long time lurker. Only posted a few times, etc etc.  \n\n\nI've been seeing a lot of posts saying people are getting IFAKs as part of their kit and I wanted to step in and mention a few things.  \n\n\n**First of all, qualifications**. I've been a 911 paramedic for 14 years and an EMT 2 years before that in a very high call volume (high trauma) system.  I'm also the trauma coordinator for my EMS system. I interface between my service, 3 level II Trauma Centers and 2 Level I Trauma Centers.  We'll ignore the two level III trauma centers because they don't count. *They know what they did.* I talk to trauma surgeons, nurses, Trauma NP's, etc. daily. I hold all the usual (useless) canned trauma courses as well. That's neither here nor there, though.  \n\n\n**Why am I here?** I wanted to just mention a few things about an IFAK kit. The last few years of prepper shenanigans have peppered (see what I did there?) the market with these overpriced and mostly useless kits that you buy that are supposedly all you need. Well, their kits are made of LIES. You don't need some $200 kit that will likely have items expire before you ever think about the mere possibility of maybe using them in a real situation (someday). \n\nHere's what I keep in my personal IFAK kit. I will try and add links where I can. This is all on Amazon and none of it requires any kind of medical license to obtain in the US.:\n\n1ct [MOLLE pouch](https://www.amazon.com/Monoki-Pouches-Tactical-Water-Resistant-D-Ring/dp/B08CGM64VP/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=MOLLE+Pouch&qid=1618265606&sr=8-5) \\- $8.99 for TWO.

This is another expensive item. You don't really need it and they expire. You also have to know HOW to use it properly. Just wrapping a wound with this will not work, you have to take your fingers and SHOVE it into the wound cavity to activate the kaolin, which is what stops bleeding. It doesn't really work in abdominal/chest wounds anyway because you generally can't get it to where the bleed is  \n\n\n**WHAT YOU'LL NOTICE IS MISSING:**   \n**Splints -** Splints can be made using rolled gauze and/or Coban. They're also very bulky. Useless in a GSW/Stabbing setting. Rolled gauze can be used to stabilize a knife.  \n**Trauma Shears** \\- I'm guessing most of you carry a knife around. Use that. Sure, EMT Trauma shears can cut through a penny but do you really need to? Just cut clothing away carefully.   \n**OPA/NPA** **Airway Adjuncts -** You're not an EMT. You're trying to stop the bleeding until someone gets there, not ventilate them.   \n**CPR Pocket Mask -** Gross. Civilians don't even do mouth-to-mouth anymore. EMS doesn't do mouth-to-mouth anymore either. Pumping on the chest ventilates them plenty (this is backed up by science). Besides, if you're doing CPR on someone who's been shot... they're dead. You're just squishing exsanguinated meat around.   \n\n\n**ACE Bandage** \\- You're not wrapping a sprained ankle on the football green. Stop it.   \n\n\n**Chem Lights, Flashlights, Triangle Bandages, Sutures, or other WooWoo Nonsense:** You don't *need* ANY of that. You're not in a survival situation. You don't need to assess pupils, create a sling, or other bollocks. You're not going to be sewing up spurting arteries in the heat of battle. This isn't Blackhawk down, brodawg. Chuck it!  \n\n\n**Eleventy-Billion Gauze Pads, Bandages, etc.**\\- You really don't need that much for yourself or for one or two other persons.   \n\n\nIf you have questions about a more extensive (and realistic) general purpose first-aid kit (that is also way cheaper), I'm more than happy to create a new thread on it. If you have ANY questions please feel free to let me know either in here or in chat. I'm always down to help out my fellow lib'ruhl gun owners. :D",

But this is like the number 1 life saving thing you can do when a limb is shredded.  Although I dont think people are likely to get blown up and have some explosive amputations happen.  Its certainly not the only way to get uncontrollable bleeding in a limb.  If you dont have time to do it the right way of applying pressure and bandages, slap a tourniquet above the wound for bit does the trick till you can do it the right way.  ....Like when you are in a firefight...   And you can do it to yourself so you can stay IN the fight.  More or less.. mainly less... And the medic can go do more important things.  \n\nYou are probably right about things like a nasal pharyngeal.  Although, its not a bad thing to have if you have some rudimentary training and know all about tension pneumothorax caused by bullet holes though the lung.  AND if help is HOURS away.  Not likely...  Other breathing issues... well, sucks to be you or them.  \n\nQuik CLot and hemcon dressings are a mixed bag...  I would not bother.  These can cause a royal mess and headache when the injured person gets to actual care... or have an allergic reaction on top of being all bleedy.  \n\nAnd does anyone ever tell you that the tradition IFAK is for YOUR ass.  You are supposedly all fucked up on the ground and the guy that pops by to do buddy care is suppose to save your ass with YOURS.  Or self care with the thing...   Its not a first aid kit.

(This post might be half cooked, not very organised and all over the place, but it's my first time, so bear with me :P) \n\nSo as I mentioned, this is my first post here (eeep! :D) and initially I thought of sharing my entire shelfie, but I realised that being the junkie/hoarder I am, it'd end up being a terribly long post , hence after much deliberation I decided to post different categories of products separately  (sunscreens, moisturisers, serums etc) and after I'm done with that, I shall be making a post with only the products I use in my  current skincare routine!\n\nWithout further adieu let's get started! Please do like, share,  subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell icon!... lmao jk\n\n**Skin Type** : Oily - Combination, Comedonal Acne Prone, Rosacea Prone,\n\n**Major skin concerns** : Hypersensitivity, Non inflammatory acne, Sebum Production. \n\n**Age** : Early - Mid 20s, F\n\n**Current Climatic Conditions** : Semi- Arid, Dry winter \n\nSpecie : Homo Sapien\n\nHeight : wait.. I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

    "body": "First of all, these are a list of products available in Boots that I've found, so they're non-exhaustive. Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point.

While I could see the improvements, it would feel like my skin was burning. I'm not sure if it's due to the age of the bottle, or just the ingredients, but I discontinued use.\n\nThen I bought *Boots Skin Clear Deep Cleansing Lotion* which is exactly the same as the Blackhead version just with an extra word on the front. It feels just like[ L'Occitaine's Shea Butter Toner](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8adf20777.html) that's alcohol free, but a month in and I don't really feel like it's doing anything.\n\nI used to use Neutrogena a lot and I really liked their grapefruit range, but the *Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Moisturiser* stopped being effective far too quickly. It goes on really light which I like, but after a while my skin either feels dry, or really oily. I felt it was super hit and miss.\n\nWith the Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment, is that just on acne, do you put it on under moisturiser or as a moisturiser?",

    "body": " There is no question why every home should be well-provisioned with  medical supplies. The importance of this is further stressed by the  onslaught of Covid-19. If you are among those who are wary of going to a  hospital, this article will help in making your home ready for medical  emergencies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n## Why Invest High on Medical Supply\n\nIt pays to be well-prepared during medical emergencies. Not only that  you need to learn first-aid but you also have the proper equipment at  your disposal. Having the right medical supplies is the key. We cannot  stress this any further.\n\nIf we are willing to invest in luxury items such as costly sneakers  or furniture, why scrimp on the essentials. Medical supplies are a  must-have in every household. Cost is a non-issue when we are talking  about the health and safety of your loved ones. That is why it is wise  to invest in a complete set of high-quality medical supplies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## First Aid Kit: First Line of Defence\n\nThink of life as a constant war against sickness. During the battle,  you should always prepare yourself no matter what. It’s your family’s  life that is on the line. In this stealthy warfare, a first aid kit  functions as your first line of defence. During an emergency when no  doctor is available, it is just you and a well-provisioned first aid  kit. The efficiency of your medical supplies will determine the outcome  of the combat.\n\nThere are various types of first aid kits. The contents of these kits  may differ depending on the particular purpose. Of course, the main  purpose of any kit is to provide immediate medical attention. However,  on their particular usage, first aid kit type and contents may vary.\n\nA military medical pack, for instance, may contain provisions  intended for traumatic injuries such as gunshot wounds. In building your  home first aid kit, you may want to consider the most common injuries  or ailments that are most likely to be experienced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Medical Supplies Recommended by the American Red Cross:\n\n* Antiseptic wipes\n* Multiple-size sterile gauze pads\n* Triangular bandages\n* Multiple-size adhesive bandages\n* Cotton balls and swabs\n* Multiple pairs of non-latex gloves\n* Three-inch gauze roll bandage\n* Multiple packets of antibiotic cream\n* Hydrogen peroxide\n* Multiple rolls of medical bandages\n* Compressed dressings\n* Ten-yard roll of cloth tape\n* Four-inch roller bandage\n* Adhesive tape\n* Duct tape\n* Medical thermometer\n* Syringe\n* Medicine spoon\n* Face masks\n* Multiple-size plastic zippered bags\n* Folding emergency blanket\n* Breathing barrier for cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n* Set of tweezers and scissors\n* Eye pads\n* Eyewash solution\n* Tourniquet\n* Dental mirror\n* Magnifying glass\n* Bulb suction device\n* Multiple-size safety pins\n* Needle and thread\n* Medical stapler\n* Staple remover\n* Finger splints\n* Superglue\n* Petroleum jelly\n* Sterile saline solution\n* Multiple instant cold compress\n* Emergency first aid manual\n* Hand sanitizer\n* Large plastic trash bags\n* Sunscreen\n* Insect repellent\n* Waterproof matches\n\n**Note:** It is also advised by the American Red Cross  that you should inspect first aid kits every six months. Discard expired  medicines and supplies. Replace them with new ones as much as soon as  you can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## List of Medications for Your First Aid Kit:\n\n* Antacids\n* Antihistamine\n* Anti-diarrheal medication\n* Antibiotics\n* Aspirin\n* Auto-injector of epinephrine\n* Anti-burn cream or gel\n* Calamine lotion\n* Cold and cough medications\n* Disinfectant mouthwash\n* Electrolyte powders\n* Fiber powder\n* Laxative\n* Lidocaine cream\n* Multivitamins\n* Hydrocortisone cream\n* Pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen\n* Simethicone\n* Vitamin C\n* Vitamin D\n* Zinc\n\n \n&#x200B;\n\n## 8 Additional Emergency Medical Supplies\n\nAside from the list containing standard medical supplies, you can  also invest in other emergency items for more advanced situations.  However, these particular supplies require adequate medical training.  You will never know though when these items would be needed. It is  better to be prepared and safe than sorry.\n\n## 1. Lights\n\n A crucial piece of equipment for medical emergencies, lighting such  as LED flashlights and headlamps is an essential part of your advanced  first aid kit.\n\n## 2. Foley Catheters\n\nThese are flexible and thin plastic tubes designed to provide relief from blockage of the urinary tract.\n\n## 3. QuikClot\n\nThis wound-dressing product contains kaolin which stimulates blood clotting.\n\n## 4. N-100 Respirator\n\nThis respirator that is also a high filtration face mask is an important device especially in a post- COVID-19 world.\n\n## 5. Water Purification Equipment\n\n Water is the universal solvent and when in pure unadulterated form, it also has healing properties.\n\n## 6. Penrose Drain Tubes\n\nThese specialized tubes are designed to drain excess fluids from wounds.\n\n## 7. Extra Sheets of Blankets\n\nThis may seem obvious but you will be surprised how often these items  are overlooked. Blankets have various functions and thus essential.\n\n## 8. Portable Power Supplies\n\nSome of your equipment such as flashlights or LED lamps may need  extra power during long-term medical treatment. Portable power supplies  may come in handy during this situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Basic Medical Know-how\n\nAll these pieces of supplies and equipment though would be useless if  you are not capable of using them. Getting yourself equipped with basic  first aid knowledge is highly advised. A few hours of training will  make a difference during emergencies. You also need not go far or spend a  lot of money. There are excellent online first aid and basic CPR  courses that are now offered online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n In an uncertain world where threats of disease, crime, and natural  disasters are part of everyday existence, you might as well be ready to  face these challenges. Ensuring that your home is well-equipped with  complete medical supplies is one thing but without proper medical  knowledge is more important. Live, learn, and survive! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source](https://survivallife.com)",

He is able move mass with extreme force in any direct, as well as control the magnetic pull of the earth move mass and living matter to his whim. The Earth has not completely forgotten him though, he is able to command rocks to form a boulder of immense strength and speed. Due to his connection with the Earth, Kaolin is able to resist a magnetisation process whereas him enemies will slowly falter. Kaolin, however, has no forgotten man's folly and interference with the beauty of nature, while not harbouring ill will, he instead uses stone remnants of his past to enhance his own ability.\n\n\n**Lore**\n\nDeep amid the Upland crags and cliffs there runs a seam of sacred jade long foresworn by highland minders. From this rare material, the likeness of the great general Kaolin was carved and buried at the head of a stone funerary army ten thousand strong--a force of soldiers and holy men, jesters and acrobats, carved by craftsmen and entombed for millennia in the dark embrace of the Earth. \n\nWhat the craftsmen had not known was that within the strange seam of jade flowed the spirit of the Earth itself--an elemental force at one with the planet. When the force within the carved jade found itself cut off from the life's blood of the world, it gathered its strength over the course of a thousand years and dug itself free and into the light. Now the great Kaolin Earth Spirit strides the Upland roads, fighting for the spirit of the Earth; and in times of need calls forth remnants of his buried army still locked in the loving embrace of the soil. \n\n\n~~==~~\t\n\n**Roles:** Initiator, Support, Escape\n--\n\n\n~~==~~\n\n\n**Strength: 21 + 2.9**\n\nAgility: 17 + 1.5\n\nIntelligence: 18 + 2.4\n\n~~==~~\n\nDamage: 46-56\n\nArmour: 3.36\n\nMovement Speed: 305\n\nAttack Range: Melee (128)\n\nMissile Speed: N/A\n\nBase Attack Time: 1.7\n\nSight Range: 1800 (Day) / 800 (Night)\n\nTurn Rate: 0.6\n\n\n~~==~~\n\n**Spells**\n\n\n~~==~~\n\n\n\n**Stone Remnant**\n\n*Innate Ability*\n\n\n\nCall a Stone Remnant at the target location. Stones Remnants have no vision and are invulnerable, and can be used with Earth Spirit's abilities. Calling a Stone Remnant consumes a charge, which recharge over time.

In my opinion the biggest nerf to him was the swap on the silence and stun for boulder smash and geomagnetic grip. It makes his obvious combo of gripping a remnant over the enemy, rolling over the remnant you pulled, then knocking the enemy into your team a lot harder without the stun being applied when the boulder gets pulled. People just dodge the rolling boulder if they're not completely brain-dead. He's still an awesome lane partner for any carry with a stun or a slow but without the more reliable stun I think the skill ceiling for this hero is way higher now. I still think that he's hella fun to play but from my limited experience he's nowhere near the powerhouse he was. Any tips on getting better with Earth Spirit would be greatly appreciated!",

Increase Smash AoE back to 225, you have hit it on moving targets now, it's really hard.  \n3. Update the tooltip, it says Smash stuns **and** silences (grip too), at least in the German version.  \n4. Prioritize stones over everything else please, I pushed enemies away that I wanted to stun or pulled mates I wanted to help with silence. It's very hard to target stones in crowded fights even if you barely move your mouse between remnant placement and grip/smash.  \n5. Should I max Grip or Smash first, is splitting viable or 3 levels in Smash (for the CD) then full Grip? Or maybe even a level in boulder?  \n6. How viable are you without levels/as a support?",

I don't think he was overnerfed, or at least not overnerfed by much; to me it only makes sense that the harder to land ability (Boulder Smash) give the greater reward (stun). In my opinion the scaling damage should still be on Boulder Smash, though, if only because the sound effect makes it sound like it should do more damage. He needs a bit of outside setup (or MLG no-scope aim) to pull off the roll-kickback combo, but plenty of other heroes require setup for their combos as well, and if he gets a Blink Dagger the kickback is a lot easier to pull off by himself.\n\nIf Refresher Orb doesn't recharge stone remnants (I don't know if it does), I think it should, since the stone remnants are his real cooldowns.",

Post 6.80--I can't tell you how many times I've bouldered past people like an idiot.

Not to say he isn't good solo but the combos are now much more difficult to pull off as in Smash->Grip->Roll or some variation.\n\nHowever as everyone else was saying the remnant cool down can make him very awkward to play as he revolves around them in general. If you're using 2 remnants for each skirmish you now have to wait 70 seconds for your full stack again. That's given you don't use any remnants in the mean time which is pretty unlikely. I constantly find myself having only 2-4 remnants left mid-late game.\n\nBest tip I could give is to treasure every remnant you have. Reposition remnants you already put down with boulder smash or grip. Kaolin with 5 remnants up in a team fight can be devastating if played correctly.",

I decided to look up bentonite clay and discovered that its pH is between 8 - 9.7 (depends on brands: [Living Clay](http://www.livingclayco.com/livingclay1.html)'s bentonite clay is 9.7 and [Garden of Wisdom](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/4032831/4581040.htm) is between 8.3 to 9.1 - I am not able to find pH info on Aztec Secret) which it is slightly alkaline than [baking soda (pH 9)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/195lue/psa_please_do_not_use_baking_soda_on_your_skin_it/). Our skin is between 4.5 to 5.5.\n\nUndiluted apple cider vinegar's pH is between 4.25 to 5 and when it is mixed with bentonite clay, the pH will be neutralized.\n\nDistilled/pure water's pH is 7 (neutral) but the problem is that we all normally use tap water. It might range from 6 to 8 - it depends on county and city. Distilled water or tap water with bentonite clay, it still leans to alkaline.\n\nIt is super important to mix bentonite clay with raw ACV to balance out the pH.\n\nInteresting information on pH scale: [pH 10 is 10 times more alkaline than pH 9 and 100 times (10 times 10) more alkaline than pH 8.](http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/184ph.html) Can you imagine from pH 5 to 9? That's around 400 times or... 100,000 times? Meh, my math might be off. Hope someone here can chime on the difference between pH 5 and 9. (*Answer: 10,000 times*)\n\n---\n\nClay's pH:\n\nCalcium Bentonite (aka Aztec Secret): 8 - 9.7\n\nFrench Green (aka Illite Clay or Sea Clay): 7.75\n\nFuller's Earth: 7.5\n\nRhassoul (aka Red Moroccan or Red Clay): 7 - 7.5\n\nDead Sea Mud: 7\n\nKaolin (all colors): 6\n\nMoor Mud: 4.5 - 5.5",

With acv, I barely had to mix it and it felt like liquid velvet as I applied it to my skin.  \n\nI never experienced a red face post-mask, (when mixed with water) but also didn't have noticeable results.  However, after just one acv mix, my pores are very visibly improved. The skin where I'd applied the mask was pink once I washed the mask off, but pink as if I had just exercised, not irritated or inflamed, and was back to normal and *glowing* 20 mins post mask removal. \n\nAnyhow, internet info can be a crap shoot and this might be the first time I have greatly benefitted from skincare advice.

Unfortunately, it is often put as “kaolin flower” in many fan translations (most likely by way of not very carefully researched edited mtls) to the point that it’s made its way into collective fandom lexicon.\n\nI want to explain why this is a poor translation choice.\n\nKaolin is **already** a word in English. It means a rock or soil that is rich in kaolinite. It is a soft, white clay. Kaolin/kaolinite (高岭土: gaoling + clay / 高岭石: gaoling + stone) both get their names in Chinese from the village Gaoling, which is known for its kaolinite deposits that have been used by the porcelain industry in the region for centuries. The word for the clay came to English by way of a French missionary who documented Chinese porcelain techniques in the 1700’s, which is why it doesn’t reflect modern romanization norms (pinyin).\n\nBringing this all back, the term 高岭花 has nothing to do with clay. MTL incorrectly treats it as 高岭+花 ([type of clay] + flower) when it should be 高+岭+花 (tall/high + mountain ridge + flower).\n\nThere are a lot of ways gao ling hua can be translated: Literally with something like “flower on a high peak,” figuratively with something like “unattainable beauty,” or a combo of both like “the untouchable flower that only grows on the high mountains.” All of these are not only more accurate but are more intuitive in meaning.\n\nSo please, I beg, stop calling danmei characters a flower made out of a specific type of clay.",

This is a big deal in the treatment and management of [mild-to-moderate acne](https://skinolog.ist/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img008.jpg) at home, as it is the only prescription strength retinoid available in every major drugstore (and Amazon!) in the US. Bonus: it's cheaper than most people's co-pays (including mine) used to be. Unfortunately, it's still kind of a mystery on how to use it properly for your skin, as there is a ton of misinformation out there on the world wide web and the tube basically tells you to just use it every day after washing your face. \n\n* * *\n\n##General Retinoid Tips\n\n[In my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/92hhpw/misc_skincare_ingredients_tretinoin_adapalene_and/), I talked a bit about the different types of retinoids available as well as some brief usage tips. In short:\n\n*   Wear SPF 30-50 every day while using any topical retinoid, including Differin.\n*   Avoid the eye area (lid and thin undereye) as well as the lips and areas next to the nasal passages.\n*   Apply a pea-sized amount. Dr. Dray demonstrates this amount in her video. It is quite literally roughly the size of a pea.\n*   Apply after cleansing and moisturizing your skin, once your moisturizer has dried down. Don't use overly occlusive moisturizers before Differin application, like heavy oils.\n*   Do not introduce new products right before or while using Differin. The reason for this is that if you begin to break out from the new product, it can be misinterpreted as breaking out from the Differin.\n*   Retinoids are not pregnancy safe. Please speak with your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant before using Differin or any topical retinoid, including retinol.\n\n[If you do best by watching videos, Dr. Dray has an excellent video on this process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF0Sw_wVqgs). \n\n* * *\n\n##Starting Differin\n\n\nWhen you first start using Differin, you'll want to ween your skin into it. While some skin is very tolerant and can withstand every night almost immediately, for more sensitive skin types this can be a bit more of a process. I've written some general guidelines below, but please note that all skin is different so you may need to tweak this depending on your own skin.\n\n*   **Tolerant Skin. **If your skin is quite tolerant of topical therapies and rarely shows signs of irritation and peeling, feel free to begin applying a pea-sized amount of  Differin once a day, at night, after cleansing and applied over your moisturizer as Dr. Dray demonstrates above. If your skin begins to feel tender or like it is burning, even after application of a bland moisturizer, cut down to usage every other day.\n*   **Normal/Sensitive Skin. **If your skin is sensitive or relatively normal, apply a pea-sized amount of Differin every other night (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, etc.), after cleansing and applied over your moisturizer, as demonstrated above. If your skin begins to feel tender, even after application of a bland moisturizer, cut down to every third night.\n*   **Very Sensitive Skin. **If your skin frequently shows signs of irritation to new products, particularly things like AHA, BHA, or vitamin C serums, or if you have rosacea, you may want to start by applying a pea-sized amount, over moisturized, clean skin every third night. This is where I started. After a few weeks, your skin should be able to tolerate every other night without excessive burning, tenderness, or peeling. If it does, cut back to every third night.\n\nIf your skin starts to feel a-okay with every third night or even every other night, try to bump up frequency. The goal is to be able to use it every night, but if your skin never feels comfortable at that point, that is okay - use it as frequently as you can. Remember that for everything, everyone's skin is different and beautiful. Your mileage may vary.\n\nWhat to Expect\n------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Some tenderness.**My skin is more sensitive to being scratched, hot water, scruffy beards, and chemical filter sunscreens, particularly sunscreens with avobenzone.\n*   **Micro-peels.** Wearing makeup will be a challenge during the adjustment period (about two months) of using Differin. Your skin will look and feel smooth, but application of foundation will show very fine peeling all over the skin. *This is okay and normal.* If your skin is ever showing thick \"sheets\" of peeling, you should back down on usage. *Your skin should not be shedding like a snake from Differin .1%*\n*   **Slightly more breakouts.** Experiencing slightly more breakouts for the first few weeks is normal and fine. They should not be extremely aggressive or much worse than the breakouts you were experiencing before, particularly if your acne is mild.\n*   **Dryness.** Dryness is very typical with any retinoid product, particularly during the first 4 weeks. Apply more moisturizer than usual and more frequently throughout the day, if needed. Do not use occlusives like Vaseline on your skin before applying Differin, as this can inhibit some of the absorption of Differin.\n\n* * *\n\n##Combining Therapies at Home\n\n\n[Referring back to my post I made previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/92hhpw/misc_skincare_ingredients_tretinoin_adapalene_and/) once again, all retinoids (and frankly, all acne treatments) are best when used as a combination therapy all over the affected area (in this case, the face).\n\nBenzoyl Peroxide (BP)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nBP is not a new drug. First shown to be effective against acne in 1934 (though not explored as a treatment for acne until the 1960s when William Pace began to treat patients with a precipitated sulphur cream that contained BP), it is now often prescribed as a treatment for mild-to-moderate acne in conjunction with topical retinoids, particularly adapalene (Differin). The FDA has permitted use of benzoyl peroxide in OTC concentrations of 2.5-10%. \n\n[Details of randomised, double blind clinical studies using BP for the treatment of acne](https://skinolog.ist/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BP_studies.jpg).\n\nIt has keratolytic, moderate comedolytic, and antibacterial properties, \"which include the reduction of *P. acnes* and *Staphylococcus aureus* on skin.\"¹ It is a largely vehicle-dependent drug, meaning that the formulation matters. One journal notes this: \"Many formulations incorporate BP crystals that vary in size and do not necessarily fully dissolve completely or at the same rate. Larger crystals that are not capable of settling into the follicular ostia due to their size may randomly rest on the skin surface for more prolongued periods of time, thus producing scattered foci of 'hot spots' that may present as patches of cutaneous irritation.\"¹ \n\nIn addition, in three double-blind studies 2.5% BP gel was been found to be just as effective as 5% and 10% preparations with fewer side effects due to the lower concentration of the drug. \n\nTo combine with Differin at home, I recommend finding it in a wash, such as PanOxyl, or Differin's brand \"Daily Deep\" Cleanser, which contains 5% Benzoyl Peroxide. Feel free to use BP in this form twice a week or every other night - whichever you and your skin are most comfortable with. This is a form of short-contact therapy (an effective way to use benzoyl peroxide with less side effects) that can also be done with gels or creams as well, especially if cleansers are too drying for your skin. In one study on short-contact therapy:\n\n> *Short contact therapy utilizing a 2 minute skin contact time with BP 9.8% emollient foam used once daily over a 2 week duration was highly effective in reducing the quantity of P acnes organisms on the back and provided comparable colony count reduction to \"leave on\" therapy using BP 5.3% emollient foam. ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22777224))*\n\nFor gels or creams, I sound like a broken record about this brand, but I do genuinely love Paula's Choice BPO formulations. I have a small, travel-sized tube of their 5% formulation (which is not more efficacious than their 2.5%, but I had to test it!) and I love it. Unlike most BP formulations that crust up and sit as a film on the skin, the PC BP spreads easily and sinks in. Acne.org also has a pretty wonderful formulation of 2.5% BP that I used many years ago. \n\nAn additional note about BP is that is must be used *all over* to be effective as a combination treatment. While it is frequently billed a spot treatment product, BP really shines when it is allowed to treat acne *before* it becomes a problem, by blasting *P. acnes* and unseen microcomedones. This is why infrequent short-contact therapy is ideal, as the whole face can become quite sensitized when you're new to Differin. \n\nTo use a cream or gel as short contact therapy, use it over your moisturizer, before washing your face. If this bothers you, wash your face very gently first, removing any makeup or sunscreen, and patting dry with a towel. Apply a thin layer all over, let sit for two minutes, and rinse away. Apply your moisturizer while skin is still damp to prevent TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) and let dry completely before applying a thin layer of Differin (about 20 minutes, if you are using it on the same day you use Differin). \n\nTo use a benzoyl peroxide cleanser, follow the instructions on the bottle, after removing any sunscreen and makeup with an oil-cleanser. Apply your moisturizer immediately after, while skin is still damp, to prevent TEWL and let dry completely before applying a thin layer of Differin. \n\nIf your skin feels particularly raw, painful, or chapped from the introduction of BP, cut down on frequency, use it on the \"rest\" day that you aren't using Differin, or remove it all together to let your skin heal before re-introducing. *Please note that these instructions are not for use with Duac, a prescription topical combining clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide*.\n\nSalicylic Acid (BHA)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSalicylic acid (SA) is in a class of ingredients known as hydroxy acids, which I've referenced before. SA is a lipophilic (oil-friendly, meaning it is ideal for oilier skin types or in conjunction with oily products) compound and found in a plethora of products. While frequently considered as the oil-friendly version of AHA, it differs from AHAs in how it exfoliates the skin (desquamation, keratolytic) as well as it's ability to prevent the formation of comedones (comedolytic). To quote a journal that overviews the many OTC treatments for acne:\n\n> **[On AHA]** *At lower concentrations, AHA functions as an exfoliant, interrupting corneocyte adhesion in the upper SC by interfering with formation of ionic bonds. As a result, AHAs promote individual corneocyte desquamation and decrease corneocyte clumping, both of which lead to smoother skin texture and decreased visible scaling and flaking; a decrease in follicular hyperkeratois promotes resolution and prevents formation of AV lesions, especially comedones. ...* \n\n>**[On BHA/SA]** *Due to its desmolytic properties, salicylic acid promotes individual corneocyte desquamation, thus simulating natural exfoliation, and exerts moderate comedolytic activity. The desmolytic and comedolytic properties of salicylic acid are concentration-dependent. In fact, salicylic acid is not keratolytic. Rather, it exerts its effect on SC desquamation by breaking the bonds created by corneodesmosomes, also called the “rivets” or “staples” of the SC, which sustain the adherence between contiguous corneocytes. ... The “physiological” desquamation provided by salicylic acid provides smoother texture and appearance to the skin and can give the illusion of decreased pore sizes.*\n\nThe journal goes on to add: \"Unfortunately, lower concentrations of salicylic acid may provide only a modest desmolytic [the process of breaking down carbon-to-carbon double bonds, such as between skin cells] activity, thus producing minimal therapeutic effects.\" In shorter terms, your mileage may vary. Some people find great success with BHAs while others feel like it does very little for them.\n\nOver the counter formulations can appear in 0.05% to 5%, while higher concentrations of SA are reserved for prescriptions and chemical peels. \n\nThese features make it less ideal (and much less studied) than BP for combination therapy with Differin, especially in lower percentages or untested formulations, but for some it may prove useful or even better than BP. \n\nTo use it with Differin, look for unscented washes or leave-on applications and use on clean, moisturized skin, before applying Differin or every-other-night, when not using Differin. Many people like Stridex pads due to their wide availability, but the formulation can be irritating to some. My personal favorite is (again - I swear I am not sponsored, I just really love their active ingredients) Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid (Extra Strength, if using her acne line). CosRX also has a couple products, if you prefer Asian beauty products. \n\nFor cleansers, there are fewer options. Clinique has one that is fairly pricey and Dr. Dray loves the classic orange, oil-free Neutrogena cleanser in the pump (not the bar!). Use after removing makeup, following the directions on the bottle, and immediately apply your moisturizer to prevent TEWL. Once dry, apply a thin layer of Differin. \n\nThe risks with BHA combination therapy are largely the same as BP - redness, dryness, tenderness. If you begin to feel any of these effects, cut down on the frequency of usage of BHA before cutting back on Differin. If needed, remove the BHA entirely until your skin heals.\n\nGlycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid (AHAs)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAHAs or Alpha Hydroxy Acids are a group of products that include glycolic, lactic, mandelic, and fruit acids. While the exact mechanism of these ingredients is rather poorly understood, it is known that they exert some effect by thinning the stratum corneum (SC) - the upper most layer of the epidermis - as well as dispersing basal layer melanin and increasing collagen synthesis in higher concentrations. \n\nAs mentioned above, AHAs can be helpful for some conditions of hyperkeratinization where the epidermal thickening impairs the SC permeability, resulting in skin fissures (microfissuring and macrofissuring). The most extreme examples of macrofissuring is usually seen on hands or feet, where the skin may split or \"fissure.\" At low concentrations (below 8%), AHAs disrupt the corneocyte adhesion. To re-iterate from above:\n\n>*At lower concentrations, AHA functions as an exfoliant, interrupting corneocyte adhesion in the upper SC by interfering with formation of ionic bonds. As a result, AHAs promote individual corneocyte desquamation and decrease corneocyte clumping, both of which lead to smoother skin texture and decreased visible scaling and flaking; a decrease in follicular hyperkeratois promotes resolution and prevents formation of AV lesions, especially comedones. Higher concentrations of AHAs (8-10%) can lead to both epidermolysis and thickening of the dermis.*\n\nFor some, this action can prove helpful when used in conjunction with retinoids, which most frequently cause peeling and dryness. \n\nTo use with Differin, look for low percentages to start with (4-8%) in leave-on products. Glycolic, while the most effective form of AHA, is quite irritating to some skin types due to it's ability to work quickly. Mandelic and lactic acid are especially gentle forms of AHAs due to their larger molecules that penetrate slower and may allow some people to use AHAs when they otherwise wouldn't be able to. \n\nTo start, add them to your routine on your off-nights and work up tolerability from there. Some people also find value in using short-contact therapy with AHAs - particularly glycolic - though this limits their efficacy, particularly with forms that penetrate much slower, such as mandelic acid. Some popular brands of AHAs are Paula's Choice (8% Glycolic Gel), Pixi Glow Tonic (note: this contains several plant extracts, which can be very irritating), Nip + Fab pads (also contain fragrance and plant extracts), The Ordinary (7% Glycolic Solution as well as 10% Lactic), Stratia (10% Mandelic), and as CosRX (Glycolic Acid). \n\nIt is not advised to use an AHA in a cleanser, as it is often not on the skin long enough to create noticeable differences.\n\nAs with all of the other above combinations, if you begin to experience redness, soreness, dryness, or irritation, cut down frequency and remove entirely if needed to allow your skin to heal.\n\n\nAzelaic Acid (AzA)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nA natural component of everyone's skin, azelaic acid (AzA) is also a viable combination therapy, and there are increasingly more products available over-the-counter that contain this ingredient. While AzA is not frequently prescribed for acne, it can be very helpful for some skin types, particularly those that are very sensitive. \n\nUnfortunately, there are no good studies around AzA when used with Differin, but there are studies around AzA in comparison to clindamycin and BP. Specifically, one study showed it to be as effective as 5% BP as well as 1% clindamycin in a randomized controlled study with 351 patients (BP gel) and 229 patients (clindamycin).\n\n> *Azelaic acid 15% gel proved to be as effective as BPO and clindamycin with median % reduction of the inflamed lesion (papules and pustules) of 70%, and 71% respectively. The azelaic acid gel was well-tolerated, the side effects (local burning and irritation) were distinctly less than with BPO but more pronounced than with clindamycin. Despite these side effects, the treatment was well-accepted by the majority of patients. (Abstract, [source](http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/16281587))*\n\nAzA is also bacteriostatic, meaning that it can suppress the ability for bacteria to reproduce, which can help inflammation. It also suppresses hyper-proliferation of keratin, which is a factor in acne. \n\nUnfortunately, it does take time to work and the side-effects when initially starting off can be aggravating. The most common side-effects are itching and stinging as well as mild dryness or peeling. This tends to resolve within 4 weeks. This can be difficult to push through. As someone who uses AzA, I can say that the initial itching upon application canfeel very intense and aggravating to deal with, though icing my skin helped me push through the worst days. Your mileage may vary.\n\nTo use AzA with Differin, I recommend trying to use it in your “off” nights, when not using Differin. If your skin tolerates this fine, feel free to use it every night. AzA is typically pretty gentle, but the itching can feel *very* intense if you have never used it before, especially when used on sensitive skin or skin that is sensitized from other ingredients.\n\nThere are a few trustworthy AzA topicals available over-the-counter in the US. Paula’s Choice makes one that contains 10% AzA and 2% BHA, which I reviewed. The Ordinary also makes a 10% AzA, though it feels quite powdery and silicone-y, which some people dislike. Garden of Wisdom is another option, especially for people sensitive to many ingredients. Their product is an 8% serum that receives a lot of love, though I have never used it myself.\n\nAnother option is Melazepam Cream (20% AzA). However, I want to mention that this formula contains two oils, which may inhibit some of it’s efficacy. Specifically, in a study involving 15% AzA, waiting until after moisturizing seemed to result in greater penetration of AzA in all moisturizers tested except for one, which contained an oil (macadamia nut oil). It was surmised that this was due to the occlusivity of the oil. Another potential issue is that Melazepam is made in Israel – something that may concern some consumers.\n\nIf you feel irritation or the itching is incredibly intense, try to back down on usage. I have found that applying a cool ice pack (wrapped in a towel so you aren't pressing such an extreme cold to your skin) can really help soothe some of the \"itch.\"\n\nSulfur\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTopical sulfur is another option, though hard to find and frequently found in masks and other short-contact products. Sulfur exhibits antimicrobial properties and has been used for hundreds of years to treat AV as well as seborrheic dermatitis. It is frequently found in formulas up to 10% in combination with other products, particularly resorcinol, which is thought to be antibacterial, antifungal, and keratolytic.\n\nUnfortunately, topical sulfur frequently causes mild irritation and sensitization, and has limited popularity.\n\nQueen Helene’s Mint Julep Mask is a popular product with sulfur, as well as the ProActiv mask. I would advise anyone using the Mint Julep Mask in particular with Differin to be cautious, as the clay (kaolin) can be very drying to skin that is already dry and peeling, and the fragrance content is fairly high, making it a potentially extremely irritating choice of treatment.\n\n---\n\nWhatever you decide, it is important to be consistent and not treat either the Differin or the combination product as a spot treatment. While this is a popular way to avoid irritation and sensitization, it only treats the symptom, not the disease, which is to say that it is only treating the comedone once it has surfaced as a larger issue rather than treating the root of the problem: the formation of microcomedones. Differin takes roughly twelve weeks to see full results, and products like AzA can take even longer. Whatever you decide, stick with it and listen to your skin by backomg off when it feels a bit more sensitive and moving up slowly in application when you feel you're adjusting.\n\n---\n\n##Sources\n\n\n1.

Because Differin travels so easily to other areas of skin where you don't really want it to go,  it sucks having to choose between using Differin and nothing else,  or doing a full night routine with all your delicious products.   I'll usually oil cleanse or use micellar water to get a clean base,  apply Differin and leave on for at least an hour,  then use my second cleanser to completely remove the Differin,  and proceed with my normal nightly routine.   It can be time intensive if you start before bed,  but if you start when you get home from work and take off your makeup,  you give Differin plenty of time to work until it's time for the bed time routine. \n\nSince using Differin I've actually given up all other acids because I don't need them,  except for alpha lipoic acid,  which I use twice a week on nights I take a break from Differin.   Differin did amazing work clearing my skin, minimizing my pores,  and sloughing dead skin,  so I don't feel super compelled to take unnecessary risks using BHAs or AHAs or volatile l-ascorbic acid forms of vitamin c.   \n\nIt's pretty mind-blowing to me that after all these years,  a product that easily clears my skin is available over the counter at such a low price.   I'd have a LOT less scarring if this had come out 20 years ago,  but I'm too grateful for it to complain.   \n\nJust know that there are a lot of ways to use Differin to get it to work for you,  and it does not need to be left on overnight to work.   You also don't need to cram your night routine into your morning to get all the good things on your face.",

    "body": "So to preface, I've been hiking and camping on my own earnestly for only a few years and worked my way up to solo extended excursions.  That being said I have a military back ground as a former combat medic that I usually fall back on in deciding what is and is not necessary (my first aid kit is quite heavy compared to some I've read on here).  I keep seeing threads here talking about the issues of eliminating redundancy in your equipment, which a GREAT way to reduce your overall pack weight since I'm sure all of us are guilty of taking items we \"needed\" but don't actually need at some point.  However I see ideas for eliminating weight on this sub go to over zealous extremes at times,  I feel there are a few things within everyone's kit that redundancy is a necessity in case the worst should happen and I incorporate these into my gear and I think its important not to skimp on these things since the weight added is minimal for most of them.  \n\n1. Fire starting.\nI carry at least 3 methods of being able to start a fire (flint, lighter and weather proof matches) and practiced to semi proficiency using a fire drill. Occasionally for extended trips I'll even sometimes bring a small dropper bottle of butane, just in case.  It literally doesn't even add up to a 1/4-lb all said and done and affords me both security, warmth and safety at the end of a long day of hiking.  \n\n2. First Aid Supplies \nThis one I'll admit to being a little over zealous on, but some of the packing lists I see sporting the bare minimum here make me shudder.  The big basics a tourniquet, some kind of hemo-static agent (kaolin infused dressings are cheap and ideal here),  compression wrap, and an emergency blanket are literal life savers if something goes wrong.  These can all be picked for less than $30 and again weigh in at under a 1/4-lb and are compact enough to be stuffed into a pants pocket.  This should be in addition to whatever small first aid items you have for treating the normal trail wear and tear that just comes with camping and hiking.  \n\n3. Navigation Aids\nI always carry a map, compass and GPS (with spare batteries).  Knowing where you are is HUGE, just psychologically and in case you need rescue.  I remember seeing a popular post that made me cringe here, where someone literally cut away any navigable landmarks on their map except the route, essentially making it useless. A couple grams from what could end up being the most useful piece of paper on the planet for you should the worst happen is not worth the negligible weight you would save.  My map is always my back up now that I get to enjoy my GPS but its not fail proof it needs electricity and there are any number of reasons why it could crap out on me hence the back up.  Again negligible weight for maximum gain in safety.  \n\nRedundancy can sometimes be useful, I never expect anything bad to happen on my treks into the wilderness and haven't ever had a true emergency where I've needed rescue but that doesn't stop me from planning for one and I don't ever let my self fall into a sense of apathy about what can go wrong.  After nature is absolutely amazing and beautiful, but it doesn't give a flying shit whether you live or die out in it.  \n\n I'll hop off the soap box now though, I'm interested in what everyone else thoughts and gear layouts are like and what added measures you take to ensure you stay safe.",

        "body": "I can't resist the urge to push back on these a little bit. Take it in the spirit of open discourse -- I think that's how we best nail down truth.\n\n1. I think two is probably enough, but my main point of resistance is against the idea of fire as a meaningful last line of defense against hypothermia. In my experience, fires are most challenging when they're most wanted -- i.e., when it's cold and wet. I have trouble imagining scenarios in which I'm alone and wet, my down insulation is wet, I'm immobilized and unable to evac or generate body heat, yet I *am* able to make a fire that will keep me warm (oh, and my lighters don't work). This is very, very far fetched to me.\n\n2. I think we need to do some reality-based risk assessment here. Tens of thousands of people do backcountry hiking each year without hemostatic agents or prepared tourniquets. Are enough people dying of blood loss out there to justify carrying those things? As far as emergency blankets go, is radiative heat loss a significant enough contributor to hypothermia that we should bother protecting against it with a special item? I doubt it, but maybe carrying heat-reflective mylar groundsheets rather than polycryo is a smart move to make. \n\n3. Navigation aids. I don't know the West well enough to argue this point, but a decent number of us are on the East coast. If I somehow lose a trail in a narrow wilderness corridor, I can always pick a direction and go. It's not like I'm gonna get cliffed out or anything. Moreover, even if I had the best maps in the world, they're of limited utility in a dense deciduous forest. I can take bearings off trees as far as 100 feet away and... that's it.\n\nIf I were making recommendations, I'd strongly advise that people carry aspirin and possibly diphenhydramine. Being able to treat a heart attack or allergic reaction is more useful than being able to treat an arterial bleed.\n\nClarifying edit: I'm not saying that fires aren't a good part of the stay-warm toolkit. I'm saying they're unreliable in comparison with insulation, and it's probably bad to assume, \"Oh, I can make a fire if I get cold.\"",

You might shudder at some people but many people aren’t concerned like you are. \n\nFWIW I bring a backup fire starter but a few matches/cotton balls in Vaseline in baggie weighs nothing. Navigation depends on where you are but often paper maps really aren’t necessary (and often they’re incredibly necessary). FAK varies a lot but some people would never think to carry a tourniquet. \n\nIn general, I find most ex-military people fall on the side of packing redundancy for their redundancies.

        "body": "As a vet I understand, and will offer that it can be hard to undo some of the training to relax a little on you pack load ... especially with your first aid kit (FAK).  I've been doing solo backpacking excursions for a couple decades now, and there was a long time where my FAK got lighter every year as I continuously removed unused items.  A tourniquet and hemo-static agents and emergency blankets are all overkill to me ... I have just never needed them on the trail.  You are going backpacking ... you aren't walking into a war zone.  I have never needed any of those things, and most people need to stay far, far away from tourniquets because they don't know how to use them properly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn regards to redundancy, you probably already have some of those things in your pack already and don't realize it.  I carry a bandana or two on every trip ... which makes a great sling, or dressing, or a number of things.  Hiking poles can be used to make a splint.  My FAK has bandages, a tick key, some tweezers, a couple sutures, some antibiotic ointment, a mini bic lighter, and leukotape.  That's pretty much it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor fire starting, I always have a small bottle of hand sanitizer (for my hands, primarily).  I always bring a handful of cotton balls and a lighter (with a backup in my FAK).  If I feel bushcrafty, I may bring my firesteel.  If there's plenty of dry tinder, a pulled apart cotton ball is plenty to get a fire going.  If needed, I can squirt a little hand sanitizer on the cotton ball and get a fire going.  The only time one of those doesn't work is if it's actively raining.  I keep the cotton balls and lighter in a snack sized ziploc bag.  Usually, I have a mini bic lighter in my cook kit too ... just in case one of the other two fails.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor navigation, I have my inReach, my phone and usually a printed copy of the map.  Last year, even though I brought maps, I pretty much used AllTrails on my phone for every hike.  It worked great.  Yes, I know how to use a map & compass ... but AllTrails worked great and was very convenient.  If I'm going out longer than 3 or 4 nights, I just bring my bigger backup battery (15k mah vs. 10k mah).  If I have an emergency (knock on wood ... haven't had one yet), I have my inReach and can make an SOS call on it if needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's hard to get past some of the fear packing we are naturally prone to do.  I know it has taken me a number of years to get down to what I carry now.  In the end, at some point I just decided I was carrying stuff I never use and it wasn't worth figuring out where to put it all.  Every year, I go through my closet and pull out clothes I can't remember wearing to donate.  I've kind of started doing the same thing with my pack.  Some stuff, you leave in.  My emergency whistle ... never used it ... but it will always be hooked to my shoulder strap.  Some stuff you just don't get rid of because it would be stupid.  The hard part is figuring out where that line is for things that have been essential in the past, but really aren't anymore.  If it's light and low profile, it's not as big a target for rejection as things that are heavy or bulky (or both).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you feel more confident and comfortable carrying all that stuff ... go with your thing.  It's your pack, so nobody should really criticize for what's in it.  You're the only one that has to carry it, so if it works for you then hike your hike.  I think, over time, you'll find some of those things are superfluous (or you may not).  My goal, whenever I buy new gear, is to improve the performance of a piece of gear I already have (usually replacing worn out stuff) and/or add one new piece of gear that replaces two or more items I currently carry.  The lighter your pack is, the longer you can carry it ... and really, who doesn't want to go a little farther down the trail?",

Part of the UL methodology is tailoring your pack based on what you are going into. It's the art of learning when you need to bring microspikes and an ice axe for traversing icy Sierra passes and when you can get away without. My pack list changed up until the day before leaving for Yosemite purely because I wanted to be certain what I brought would grant me the ability to complete the walk safely. \n\n1. Fires can be incredibly important in survival situations however, three separate forms can easily be negated by a lack of materials to sustain a usable fire. There are many regions that will often lack sufficient material, such as the first 700 miles of the PCT.\n\n2. Many of the injuries you are likely encounter will range wildly but will often never need anything you've listed. If they do require something more, it can be improvised to the point that actual help is possible. Part of my FAK is my inreach mini; if I can't solve the problem with what I have around me, I will likely not be able to solve it myself. The best course for serious injury, just like in the military, is extraction to the nearest hospital. It's also be noted by other but carrying more technical medical equipment like tourniquets, hemo-static agents, sutures, etc without knowledge of how/when to use them can be just as, if not more detrimental to the injury.\n\n3. Though this comment sounds a bit of a joke, I don't think you are alone with this one, I believe many will still carry that kind of information.\n\nAt the end of the day we pack our fears and it often takes time lugging around items that you may or may not actually use (or need at all really) to learn what is or isn't needed based on your on experience.",

If you need to survive in bad conditions, you need to get out of wet/cold clothes, separate yourself from the elements (tent/tarp/bivy) and get into some insulation (quilt). All possible with what we bring on an average backpacking trip. Assuming you have food, everything can be eaten cold; stove or fire isn't necessary. A fire is nice for lifting spirits, socializing, and warming up, but it isn't a necessity for survival like people think it is.\n\nI am trying to imagine how a fire would make the difference for survival and can't seem to think of any situation unless you lost your pack somehow with all your food, clothes, shelter, quilt (which probably also means all your fire starting kits, lol). So now you are hunting for food with makeshift bows and arrows and traps and fishing rods and need something to cook the meat to not get sick or something. Or maybe its raining and windy and you are hypothermic, so you want to make a fire but you can't because again conditions are fowl and you don't have your pack with your fire starting kit so you can't make a fire.\n\nSo unless you keep your fire starting kit on your person at all times, I don't see the point.

But the level of the first aid kit depends on how remote you are and the conditions you will be in. Very few people actually need a substantial first aid kit because they are so close to getting out or are on a typical/safe trail.",

    "body": "I have very frustrating acne. It's often cystic, and painful. I get maybe one week of clear(ish) skin, followed by 2 weeks of breakouts and a week of rough healing before the cycle starts all over again.\n Well this last breakout, I decided to use on of the clay masks I'd picked up. My cystic acne was nearly gone by the next morning. The newest of the painful cysts had shrunk down significantly, and the ones that had already been around for a few days were flat, painless, and significantly less red.\n The mask is the SHVYOG Vitamin C Face Mask with Kaolin Clay and Turmeric. Tumeric has typically been super useful in the past when I had larger breakouts, but the products were annoying to get off my skin. This product left none of the skin staining my other tumeric products had, and Was easy enough to wash off (for a clay mask).\n I'd highly recommend giving this mask a try if you suffer from bad breakouts that take forever to heal.\n",

Sure, the fact he can't get off more than once in teamfights isn't too bad, but the bigger issue is that he will be slower at farming, especially huge ancient stacks.\n\nAlso, I think you're giving too much signigigance to the bottle crow nerf. It will slow down bottle crowing, but it's still a totally viable option for mid and off-laners. The whole process might take 15 seconds more, sure -- which certainly is a pretty big deal (especially if other teammates need the courier), but it won't totally remove the strategy from the game, which is what was implied in several places in the video.",

Along with titanium dioxide, zinc oxide is considered to have no risk of skin sensitization. As a sunscreen, it is effective in providing protection against sun’s UVA rays in addition to UVB rays. Zinc oxide is also sometimes used in makeup to impart opacity to products like foundations, particularly powder-based makeup.\n\n\n\n[thedermreview.net](https://thedermreview.com/zinc-oxide/):\n>Zinc oxide is an ingredient that is thought to have been used in health and skincare applications for millennia. Although we don’t know when the benefits of this ingredient were discovered for the first time, the oldest and the closest reference is believed to be the description of a healing salve in the Charaka Samhita, called Pushpanjan, used to treat the eyes and open wounds in India around 500 BC. \n\nYou'll find it in some Ayurvedic skin creams listed as [yashad/jasad bhasma](https://abhiramayurveda.in/product/yashad-bhasma-5gm-dhootapapeshwar/). Like in Emami Boroplus, which I consider a great thick, soothing occlusive for dry skin. It's got a lot of others oils and botanicals in there, too. Time was that my skin loved Boroplus, in winter, but malassezia/fungal acne intervened, and alas, now I can only recommend it as an option to others 😅 \n\nAnother common product that contains zinc oxide is the much loved Boroline. I like the night cream version - which is the same as the original, only smoother and therefore, slightly more expensive. \n\n#Benefits of zinc oxide:\n\n✨1. **Mild antibacterial properties** that may help to reduce secondary infections in acneic skin, that occur when blemishes cause open wounds. \n\n✨2. **Reduces skin redness and irritation**, is skin-soothing and supports wound healing. Calms reactive or sensitive skin. \n\nOf course, it's also a major ingredient in sunscreen. \n\nMost of its benefits seem to be because it forms a barrier on the skin, but unlike oils and waxes, it's not greasy. In fact, it's slightly astringent because of it's absorbent qualities, and *removes* oil. I'd say it's about 1/4th as drying as multani mitti (kaolin clay) 🤔 \n\nZinc oxide has been a skin-soothing ingredient that helped break my sensitive skin's inflammatory cycle, and prevented breakouts from becoming severe. I discovered, like many people with sensitive, acne-prone skin, that soothing my skin was in fact far more effective than attacking it with harsh actives 😅 We live and we learn! And zinc oxide is my soothing agent of choice 🥰\n\nThe powder is also something I keep on hand as first aid. I mix it with aloe or plain water and use it as a spot treatment, or for cuts and scrapes. You can sometimes find it at local chemists. I use the [Heilen Biopharm brand off Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B077BM3QLF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) at the moment. It's been almost three years since I bought it 😂 Did I mention it's cheap? It's cheap 😂🙏🏽\n\nI use the powder in two basic ways: face packs, or mixing with moisturiser. \n\n+ **Face packs**:  In face packs, it's nice to use mixed with honey, (any humectant, even sugar, will work, it's just easy to mix honey) to counteract the astringency and add hydration, and a bit of water. Add a little water at a time, the honey dissolves and loses thickness immediately! I use about a quarter teaspoon of zinc oxide for this method. \n\nI do a thin layer, and spray my face or re-wet it a couple of times whenever it gets dry, before finally washing it off, just so that the effect is maximised... This mask dries fast (goes back to a sticky honey layer), so I do it to \"re-activate\" the effect of the zinc. \n\nYou can also just wash it off fast, it still works 🤷🏽‍♀️ Or make a thick mask that won't dry as fast- oats, honey, zinc oxide, and enough water is a mask I'd recommend to *anyone*. \n\n+ **Mixed into moisturiser**: the lazy way 😂 But it works! Just add a pinch to your night cream. I usually use a little extra cream and/or add a bit of aloe gel, to counteract the slight drying action. You can also add a drop of any oil that suits you. Rub your hands together, use cream on your face. One pinch shouldn't leave a stark white cast if you've used enough cream - the whiter the cast, the more drying the action. Sometimes, in summer, when my skin is oily, I add more than a pinch, and sleep in a white cast. The oil control is an added bonus  🤷🏽‍♀️\n\nYou can play around with the amount of zinc oxide powder, moisturiser, oil, etc. I sometimes add a bit to Boroline (which already has some zinc oxide) and use that as my last step, on a damp face. \n\nIt works overnight to soothe the skin. I do this every night the week before my period, when my skin is the most sensitive ☺ \n\nHope this is helpful to some of y'all! I'd definitely recommend it to those with redness, pustular or irritated or recurrent acne, rosacea, sensitive skin.. anyone, really! It's believed to be non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, so it's safe for all skin types. \n\nK, byee! ❤",

    "body": "I have seen a fair few folks talk about Lemon Aid and it had my interest piqued. It has been a long time since I wrote any sort of viable review for a LUSH product: long gone are days of yore on a Blogspot, talking to my three probably-bot followers about some bath art. But, in an already contentious Kitchen box, this one seems to have people either confused, intrigued, or listing it on Vinted faster than you can say \"soapgate\". So, you bet I decided to use it as soon as possible after arrival.\n\nVisually, it looks like a mix of grainy marzipan, or squashed brown bread. The jelly layer is high contrast. It reminded me of the oil layer on top of peanut butter - like, good peanut butter, but if you forgot to stir it all together so it settles and turns solid and a bit dry.\n\n\"Lovely\", I hear you cry in unison. \"Really selling me on the product.\" The reality is it is not aesthetic. Inside of an otherwise vibrant box, this is a multi-textured brownish orange blob, so it scores a goose egg for visuals. \n\nInstructions given by customer service state you should rip up the jelly into fragments and mix it with the brown cleanser, which is a mix of kaolin, almond, tahini, carrot, lemon zest, cocoa butter, lemon oil, and seaweed (carrageenan) as well as some naturally occurring oils and some not so naturally occurring ingredients (see: propylene glycol and some artificial colourings).\n\nThe above ingredients mean the cleanser smells savoury. It really does smell of tahini to me, quite viscerally. Not a whiff of lemon, which is contrasting to the fact that my WHOLE BATHROOM smells of Sexy Peel right now, so that can either be a win or a loss depending how you view things. Glass half empty, glass half full of soapy packing pellets.\n\nThe actual product is a bit clumsy to use. The jelly does not break down or melt like some shower jellies do. I was left with awkward slippery nuggets of orange on my palms and fingers that did very little. I had been hopeful they might pill, similar to some jelly cleansers I have used before, but was just left with sad, luminous jelly islands in my bathwater.\n\nThe base of the cleanser is the bit that surprised me. The brown, majority of the product melted into quite a pleasant consistency and left a noticable layer on my face after washing off without feeling greasy or heavy. It exfoliated very gently, which is also great news for someone with sensitive skin - this didn't irritate me personally, although obviously your milage may vary. The only bit that threw me off was the odd chunk of lemon zest but this was easily disposed of.\n\nI haven't tested this on makeup removal yet as it is flipping boiling and I do not trust myself to have any makeup on at the end of the day, currently, but it seems to be just oily enough that I think it could be part of a two-part cleansing routine. The smell in the pot takes getting used to but it didn't leave a lingering smell on my face.\n\nOverall, it's a 1 for visuals, 4 on smell, 5 on practicality but 9 on result. Don't ask me to make an average out of that; I write funny things on the Internet, which probably implies I am not as smart as I think I am (and you'd be right).\n\nI also have one tiny gripe with the name, as this product is only tangentially lemony, and I fear Lemon Aid could have been the name of the shower gel (which is DIVINE, btw), or the lip scrub, or even a different product altogether. A lemon scented aftersun lotion? Call me, Lush.\n\nAnyway, hope this has been (a) helpful, (2) funny, or (iii) both.\n\nAlso also final note: mix Cherry Pop and Lemon shower gel together in your next bath/shower. You're welcome.",

Some crystals were even surprisingly euhedral. I have the weight percentages of the samples but I don't know more than it could possibly be some spinel group mineral?

My insurance required a prior authorization, but my dermatologist got it cleared through my insurance.\n\nI get Botox injections every three months and it has made a HUGE difference in my confidence. My white shirts no longer turn yellow and no longer have wet sweat on my t-shirts. \n\nI still use antiperspirant just to feel fresh. \n\nI highly recommended talking to a dermatologist about your issue. Will probably be a game changer for you! \n\nNatural deodorants have never ever worked for me. Before Botox antiperspirant didn’t work for me either :-( \n\nEdit: pro tip- bleach doesn’t rid yellow pit stains. I found OxyClean White detergent works wonders. Soaking shirts in OxyClean White over night also helps on those stubborn stains.",

As soon as I saw shea butter I was taken aback, that shits a HEAVY moisturizer for a deodorant!

Whether you're a haircare newbie or a pro, you all will find this post helpful.\n\n# **HAIR TYPE:**\n\nKnowing your hair type is crucial for choosing the right products and styling techniques.\n\n# 1. Straight Hair\n\n**Characteristics**:\n\n* Lies flat from root to tip.\n* Naturally shiny due to the even distribution of oils.\n* Can be prone to looking greasy quickly.\n\n**Care Tips**:\n\n* Use a lightweight shampoo to prevent excess oil buildup.\n* Avoid heavy conditioners; opt for lightweight, leave-in conditioners if needed.\n* Regularly trim to avoid split ends.\n\n# 2. Wavy Hair\n\n**Characteristics**:\n\n* Has a natural wave or curl pattern.\n* More volume than straight hair.\n* Can be prone to frizz and dryness.\n\n**Care Tips**:\n\n* Use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner to combat dryness.\n* Apply a leave-in conditioner or curl-enhancing cream to define waves.\n* Avoid over-washing; 2-3 times a week is sufficient.\n\n# 3. Curly Hair\n\n**Characteristics**:\n\n* Defined curls or ringlets.\n* More prone to dryness as natural oils struggle to travel down the hair shaft.\n* Can be prone to frizz.\n\n**Care Tips**:\n\n* Use a sulfate-free, moisturizing shampoo to retain natural oils.\n* Deep condition weekly to maintain moisture levels.\n* Use a curl cream or gel to define curls and reduce frizz.\n\n# 4. Coily Hair\n\n**Characteristics**:\n\n* Tight curls or coils.\n* Often very dry and prone to breakage.\n* Shrinks significantly when dry.\n\n**Care Tips**:\n\n* Use a hydrating shampoo and a rich, creamy conditioner.\n* Regularly apply leave-in conditioners and oils to maintain moisture.\n* Avoid heat styling; embrace protective styles like twists or braids.\n\n  \n# **HAIR CONCERNS:** \n\nHere are some specific hair concerns and the active ingredients that can help address them. Understanding which ingredients to look for can make a big difference in tackling your hair issues effectively.\n\n# 1. Dryness\n\n**Concern**: Hair lacks moisture and appears dull and brittle.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Argan Oil**: Rich in fatty acids and vitamin E, deeply moisturizes and adds shine.\n* **Shea Butter**: Provides intense hydration and helps lock in moisture.\n* **Glycerin**: Attracts moisture to the hair and scalp.\n\n# 2. Frizz\n\n**Concern**: Hair is unmanageable and has a rough texture, especially in humid conditions.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Silicones (e.g., Dimethicone)**: Smooth the hair cuticle and reduce frizz.\n* **Keratin**: Strengthens and smooths the hair shaft.\n* **Oils**: Penetrate the hair shaft to provide moisture and reduce frizz.\n\n# 3. Damage\n\n**Concern**: Hair is weak, breaks easily, and may have split ends.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Protein (e.g., Hydrolyzed Keratin, Silk Protein)**: Rebuilds and strengthens the hair structure.\n* **Amino Acids**: Repair and reinforce hair fibers.\n* **Panthenol (Provitamin B5)**: Penetrates hair to provide moisture and improve elasticity.\n\n# 4. Hair Loss\n\n**Concern**: Thinning hair or excessive shedding.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Minoxidil**: FDA-approved treatment that stimulates hair growth.\n* **Biotin**: Supports hair health and growth.\n* **Caffeine**: Stimulates hair follicles to promote growth.\n\n# 5. Dandruff\n\n**Concern**: Flaky, itchy scalp caused by dryness, irritation, or fungal infections.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Pyrithione Zinc**: Reduces fungal growth and scalp inflammation.\n* **Ketoconazole**: Antifungal that helps treat dandruff.\n* **Salicylic Acid**: Exfoliates the scalp to remove flakes.\n\n# 6. Oily Scalp\n\n**Concern**: Scalp produces excess oil, making hair greasy and limp.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Tea Tree Oil**: Antibacterial and antifungal properties help balance scalp oil.\n* **Charcoal**: Absorbs excess oil and impurities.\n* **Clay (e.g., Kaolin, Bentonite)**: Absorbs excess oil from the scalp and hair.\n\n# 7. Scalp Irritation\n\n**Concern**: Itchy, red, or inflamed scalp.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Aloe Vera**: Soothes and hydrates the scalp.\n* **Chamomile Extract**: Calms and reduces inflammation.\n* **Peppermint Oil**: Provides a cooling sensation and soothes irritation.\n\n# 8. Thin/Fine Hair\n\n**Concern**: Hair lacks volume and density.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Biotin**: Strengthens and thickens hair.\n* **Collagen**: Improves hair elasticity and volume.\n* **Niacin (Vitamin B3)**: Increases blood circulation to the scalp.\n\n\n\n# **How to Use Active Ingredients through Hair Products:**\n\n* **Shampoos**: Look for shampoos formulated with specific active ingredients to address your concern.\n* **Conditioners**: Complement your shampoo with a conditioner that contains beneficial ingredients.\n* **Leave-in Treatments**: For ongoing benefits, use leave-in products with active ingredients.\n* **Hair Masks**: Use weekly masks for an intensive treatment.\n* **Serums and Oils**: Apply serums or oils with targeted ingredients to problem areas.\n\n  \n# **BRANDS THAT I USE AND RECOMMEND:**\n\n* Olaplex\n* Forrest Essentials\n* The Body Shop\n* Lush\n* Kama Ayurveda\n* Love, Beauty, and Planet\n* Simrasa\n\n  \n# **LINKS:** I've used AI to help me compile the content. \n\n[Link 1](https://www.vogue.in/topics/hair-care)\n\n[Link 2](https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/mens-hair-types/)",

Even though I cover much of it up, many little orange/red flecks and tones show through my layers giving my paintings a unique energy and movement that I like. I prefer this warm red/orange ground because it compliments my earth and sky palettes.\n\nWhat pen are you using to sketch?\n\nI’m using alcohol markers in various shades of Light Umber. These marker lines won’t wash away with subsequent layers, but hide nicely under my subsequent layers. I love the brush tips on these markers as I can do quick broad strokes or fine detail.\n\nWhat surface do you paint on?\n\nMy favorite surface is Claybord from Ampersand. These are archival hardboard panels with an ultra smooth kaolin clay surface which is slightly absorbent. I like to work on a smooth, rigid support.\n\nWhy do you use acrylics and not oils?\n\nI like to paint quickly in many layers. Because acrylics dry so fast, I prefer them over oils. I don’t mix wet paints on my panel, but prefer to use layers of broken color to get the effects that I want. My favorite paints are Fluid Acrylics from Golden Paints.\n\nHere’s my palette:\n\nAzo Gold\nPyrole Red\nPyrole Orange\nRaw Sienna\nBurnt Sienna\nLight Umber\nCobalt Blue\nUltramarine Blue\nTeal\nCadmium Yellow\nNaples Yellow\nWhite Gesso\nCarbon Black\n\nTOFINO SKY, 16x16”, Acrylic ©2024 Jim Musil 🎨 SOLD, Prints Available",
