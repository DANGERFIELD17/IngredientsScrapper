    "body": "**Introduction (stop using 2 in 1 or 3 in 1 shit)**\n\nI've been putting off writing this because of the stigma that \"knowing\" or caring about your hair is \"gay\", I had to deal with this stigma as I tried to grow out my hair when I was 14. I don't think this is right and any male should be able to care about his hair without being having to worry about stigma. Everyone wants to have good hair; hair is a source of confidence for many men.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a professional, I'm just a normal guy who's done a lot of research because I was sick of having bad hair days.\n\nNatural hair and promoting your natural genetic tendencies is what I'm aiming to promote with this guide. [See this picture of me aged 14 vs aged 21.](https://i.imgur.com/RI4ejCj.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Basics (boring information stuff)**\n\nEven though hair cells are dead, your hair should be treated like a living organism. Certain things can be more damaging then beneficial; this means damaged hair will take time to repair.\n\nThe purpose of shampoo is to remove oil and dirt that is in your hair. Conditioner's purpose is to put back some oils to make it soft and managable for combing and styling. However, naturally your scalp produces oils that naturally condition your hair. These oils also become striped when you use certain shampoos ^(psst it's sulphates). Certain shampoos can be more damaging than others (as I will explain later).\n\nIf you shampoo too often your scalp will produce more oils in an attempt to restore equilibrium (balance). This means if you shampoo daily and stop suddenly, you will experience a rebound effect where your scalp is producing too much oil. The result can be oily hair, dandruff or an itchy scalp. In this case, it may be worth while to slowly reduce the amount of shampoo you use over a longer period of time. It's kinda like a drug in which you will experience withdrawals, you can go cold turkey and deal with an itchy scalp and dandruff for awhile or you can reduce your usage over time.\n\nConditioning hair seals in moisture and is normally used if your hair is too dry. This is why most brands recommend you use their conditioning product if you use their shampoo product.\n\n1. You can use a shampoo and conditioner\n2. You can use shampoo and not use conditioner (use as needed e.g. when you feel your hair is too dirty or too much build up)\n3. You can use conditioner and not use shampoo (called co-washing)\n4. You can use no shampoo at all (no shampoo relies on your scalp to reach that eventual balance, however this doesn't work for everyone)\n\nI use a combination, I shampoo when needed and I condition when needed. This is entirely up to you and **overall it can be all boiled down to**:\n\n* Use shampoo if your hair is too oily (build up)\n* Use conditioner if your hair is too dry\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Temperature**\n\nThe temperature of the water while you shower can dry out your skin, including your scalp. This can worsen dandruff and dry out your hair (loss of those oils my dude). Thus cold showers are actually better for your hair and skin, but who's going to do that? If you still want a warm shower, just adjust the temperature until it's as cold as you can manage. Just avoid hot and steamy (although relaxing) showers. If you do turn up that heat, just don't get your hair wet, I'm fucking serious.\n\nScientific reasoning is:\n\n1. hot = more energy\n2. more energy evaporates more stuff\n3. therefore dryness and itchy hell\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Shampoo and Conditioner Products (it's all a scam)**\n\nOkay so most shampoo and conditioner products are a scam. They use the same chemicals.  L’Oreal, Aveeno, Garnier, Herbal Essences, Pantene, Dove, Head and Shoulders...ect. all use the same shit. Most shampoos use  **Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Sulfates)** while most conditioners use **silicones (ingredients ending with “-cone”)**.\n\n* Sulphates are bad because they strip natural oils, causing your scalp to become itchy and dry.\n* Silicones are bad because most silicone chemicals are not water soluable. This means that they build up in your hair.\n\nSulphate products are designed so that they can remove silicones from your hair. They are strong chemicals in that regard, thus this is why they are effective at treating dandruff. However it is in your best interest to not be held back by these hair drugs and you should only use every so often, with the goal of no usage *evennnntually.*\n\n* If you are making the switch from Sulphates/Silicones, you should do a reset wash by using a ***sulphate product that has no silicones***.\n\nYou will need to go to a pharmacy or a supermarket and look at products' ingredients list. Yes, this is where the effort comes in. Generally natural products will advertise that they are sulphate or silicone free. This will vary from location, country and region. It really just depends what you can find or order online. I will refer you to this [ultimate guide from /r/curlyhair](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6Dj9WAZxlfBhJSyS5on2rw3-if5cOV3oV-dQ3B0AHA/edit#heading=h.exb4a3d58zp), it has some suggestions but I just used the the first natural product I could find.\n\nGood products will cost more money, although if you use less (as I'm suggesting) you will only need to buy hair care products every 3-6 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hair Styling Products**\n\nThis is getting fucking long so you get dot points now.\n\n* Your natural oils act as product, style while your hair is wet and let it naturally dry.\n* Look for water soluable products\n* If you use a hair dryer; a hair diffuser is an option to reduce further frizz (it's like naturally drying it but quicker)\n* Becareful of non-water soluable products as they might not be easily removed from your hair (only sulphate products may be able to remove them)\n* Touch your hair less as this produces more oils\n* Consider that different hair products are tailored to different hair types (curly, dry, damaged, voluming... ect)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know if this is general knowledge, so if it is... My bad lol. I didn't know most of this until recently. If there is anything to add comment it below. This guide will help any hair and promote a natural healthy style but it's more important the longer your hair is.\n\n**EDIT:** Another tip is not to go crazy on your hair with a towel when it's wet, but rather to pat dry it, as this can damage it.",

I have naturally wavy/curly hair but I wasn’t aware of that until recently. Usually it turned into frizz after I washed it. This was due to me using shampoo every single day.\n\nAll I do now is use a scalp brush to get rid of any sort of build up, then I co-wash it, I use the brush again to spread the conditioner, and my hair is finally looking better. I blot my hair with a tshirt to get the excess water out and occasionally use the Umberto Giannini No More Frizz to help settle it down. This also helps the curls stay after I curl them with my fingers. After that, I just let it air dry. And if not, I use a hair dryer from far away, so the curls don’t get disrupted.",

I work out every morning and shower right after, but I also do jiu-jitsu a couple times a week which involves a lot of rolling around, getting squished and lots of sweat. I kinda just shampoo twice a week, but idk the how to tell if my hair is getting gross from buildup in-between.\n\nShould I brush, and if so how often? My hair is kinda wavy to slightly curly, fine and pretty thick. Right now I'm just kinda pushing it back. I've been told by a couple people that I should try to go for the Jon Snow look.\n\nWhat's the best way to restyle it after it's been messed up? I said before, it's kinda thick. It'll tend to stay in whatever weird way it dried. Most of the time, it stays good, but sometimes I'll have some clump of it stick up on top of my head and I can't get it back down easily. Would a sea-salt spray be good for that, I hear people mention those a lot.\n\nI don't really systematically take pictures of my hair, sometimes just take a selfie if I have a day I feel like I'm looking good. [But here's an album of such shots over the past two months.](http://imgur.com/gallery/kxK8CmH) I know they're not really close ups of my hair so it might not be that useful lol, but figured I'd include them.\n\nI've been using American Crew shampoo and conditioner, the conditioner daily and the shampoo twice a week. I checked and the shampoo does have sulfates so I'll have to look for another one. I'm not sure anything listed in the conditioner was a silicone, but I might look for something else anyways.",

    "body": "Hello all! So I was answering a question on r/AsianBeauty, but I thought maybe it will help some other people out who is dealing with dehydrated skin.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was a dumbass and used vitamin c crystals and mixed with water and used that for my \"vitamin c serum\" and completely overexfoliated my skin/got a chemical burn basically. And before and after that too, I thought exfoliating more was better (using AHA/glycolic acid/lactic acid), and did that everyday, which caused my skin barrier to get reck'd.\n\nIt took me a good year/year-and-a-half to fix my skin. This is what worked for me personally:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what I do is use a very gentle, non-foaming cleanser (I use [LRP Gentle Hydrating](https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Toleriane-Hydrating-Gentle-Cleanser/dp/B01N7T7JKJ/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538877830&sr=8-1&keywords=la%2Broche%2Bposay%2Bhydrating&th=1)) and while my face is still wet, put on all my hydrating toners and serums. Then go into lotions and creams RIGHT AWAY. Putting on occlusives right away after you wash and put on humectants is super important. Otherwise they can actually dry your skin out more.\n\nWhen my skin was SO full of pain, from extremely dry, tight skin and irritated acne-like cysts everywhere, the only thing that didn’t hurt like a mf was Vanicream. It took me hundreds of dollars and tons of trial and error and babying my skin to get it back to normal. Now I can use AHA, azelaic acid, vitamin c, and even tretinoin and hydroquinone without a problem!!!\n\nNo one or two products fixed my dehydrated skin. It took a TON of research over the years learning which ingredients were the most healing, moisturizing, how they work, etc.. And an entire routine around hydrating and moisturizing as much as possible. \n\n**I always make sure to include ingredients like:** panthenol (derivative of vitamin b5), allantoin, urea (a HUGE factor in getting my skin back to normal), hualuronic acid, glycerin, aloe, colloidal oatmeal, ceramides (important!!!), niacinamide (especially useful for brightening and healing your skin), petroleum (studies show that there is NOTHING out there that reduces transepidermal water loss like petroleum can. I tried to be all \\~natural is better\\~ for a while, but realized it wasn't doing anything to help fix my skin), etc.\n\nAnd not just adding these helped fix my skin, but **leaving things out** was a YUGE step in finally letting my skin heal. I avoid these like the plague: fragrance, natural (essential oils) or synthetic, alcohol anywhere other than sunscreen, sodium lauryl sulfate (sodium LAURETH sulfate is the gentler one, but I avoid that for my face too anyways. Surfectants can be aided to be milder by adding cocamidopropyl betaine), **LAY OFF all acids** until my skin could handle them (interestingly enough, vitamin c serum actually helped my skin hold more water instead of hurting me), and things that I know irritate my skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things that were/are biggest contributors of keeping my skin moist and hydrated, in no particular order:**\n\n[**Thayers Unscented Alcohol-Free Witch Haze**l](https://www.amazon.com/Thayers-Alcohol-free-Unscented-Witch-12-oz/dp/B0045PCAI6/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871279&sr=8-1&keywords=thayers+unscented) \\- the first thing that goes on my skin after washing. It's just water, aloe, glycerin and witch hazel. It's so simple but idk why my skin likes it so much, lol. It's HG for me.\n\n[**Hadalabo Premium Lotion**](https://www.amazon.com/Hadalabo-Skin-Institute-hyaluronic-solution/dp/B013HHJV0C/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871410&sr=8-1&keywords=hadalabo+premium) \\- HG, must have. **Hyaluronic acids**, urea, algae. This is my one non-negotiable skin care item.\n\n[**Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Eczema-Therapy-Moisturizing-Sensitive/dp/B003O7IBZC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-3&keywords=aveeno%2Beczema&th=1) \\- Super moisturizing. **Colloidal oatmeal**, glycerin, panthenol, petrolatum, a ceramide, dimethicone. (People demonize silicones, but they are not bad ingredients. They are actually really helpful in keeping in moisture, providing slip, and smooth feel for skin and hair. And no, they don't prevent other things from reaching the skin. [More on silicones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXHA7_dBRJY&t=12s).) And [Aveeno Eczema Therapy Night Time Balm](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Baby-Nighttime-Colloidal-Dimethicone/dp/B01HI7VY84/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-4&keywords=aveeno+eczema) for something heavier but has same ingredients. You can use both.\n\nAnd of course, [**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871829&sr=8-3&keywords=cerave+cream) \\- **ceramides, cholesterol, must have skin-identical lipids** that dehydrated skin lacks, hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, dimethicone. This by itself didn't help a whole lot, but with an army of all the different gentle, soothing things, it helped tremendously. There are lots of other \"golden ratio\"/fragrance-free ceramide stuff out there, CeraVe isn't the only one. Some of them are: [Stratia Liquid Gold](https://www.stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold), [Meishoku CeraColla gel](https://www.ebay.com/itm/JAPAN-MEISHOKU-CERACOLLA-MOISTURIZER-CREAM-50g-FACE-SKIN-CARE/173351832927?epid=1541103247&hash=item285c930d5f%3Ag%3AjbkAAOSweEFbFoJ-&LH_BIN=1) (they have toners as well), [Superdrug Hydrating Serum](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face-Skin-Care/Face-Serums/Superdrug-Simply-Pure-Hydrating-Serum-50ml/p/342700), [Curel Fragrance-Free lotions](https://www.amazon.com/Cur%C3%A9l-Fragrance-Comforting-Lotion-Sensitive/dp/B00171ETM6?th=1), [Ziaja Med Atopic Dermatitis Regenerating Face Cream](https://yanca.co.uk/product-eng-16098-Ziaja-Med-AD-Atopic-Dermatitis-Regenerating-CREAM-oiling-the-skin-atopic-for-infants-children-and-adults-50ml-5901887027942.html), among many others.\n\n[**CeraVe PM**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-Lightweight/dp/B079H99466/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1538872080&sr=1-1&keywords=cerave+pm)\\- same as the cream, but much, much lighter and has 4% **niacinamide** I believe. Niacinamide has been key to helping my dry-ass skin. It does SO many things. Heals and mends, fades spots,etc. etc. I DIY 6% niacinamide and 5% **n-acetyl glucosamine** to boost the niacinamide even further. (Commercial version [Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)) But you can find this ingredient in loads of Asian Beauty things and Olay products. Make sure the Olay stuff is fragrance-free if you get them. I like the [Olay Anti-Aging Face Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Olay-Anti-Aging-Moisturizer-Micro-Sculpting-Fragrance-Free/dp/B007M81B4M/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872043&sr=8-3&keywords=olay+fragrance+free) a lot. It really helps refine texture, as well. You can use the CeraVe moisturizing lotion if you for some reason can't tolerate niacinamide, but want something lighter than the cream. Really, any one of CeraVe products is good, they have loads.\n\n[**Aquaphor Healing Ointment**](https://www.amazon.com/Aquaphor-Advanced-Therapy-Ointment-Protectant/dp/B0107QPFBU/ref=sr_1_5_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872144&sr=8-5&keywords=aquaphor) \\- SLUG LIFE is a MUST if you have dehydrated skin. You can use Cerave healing ointment too, but it's redundant if you use the cream or lotion. It's not as occlusive as aquaphor. Aquaphor isn't just a more pricier Vaseline as people suggest. It does have white petrolatum that is oh-so helpful, it also has healing ingredients like panthenol and bisobolol, and also lanolin alcohol and glycerin for humectants.\n\nIf you wanna go a step further and go super saiyan, and you aren't sensitive to lanolin, you can use [**Lasinoh Lanolin**](https://www.target.com/p/lansinoh-hpa-lanolin-tube/-/A-92544) before or after Aquaphor. I can't stand the smell of lanolin, but this one is medical-grade and doesn't have a smell. Lanolin is SUPER helpful because of it's crazy humectant properties but it also acts as an occlusive.\n\nFor just uber **Panthenol** healing, you can get something that stars it as the main star ingredient, like [**DML Forte Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/DML-Forte-Panthenol-4-Ounces/dp/B000052YN6/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872923&sr=8-3&keywords=forte+cream) or [**Timeless Skin Care Vitamin B5 Serum**](https://www.timelessha.com/products/vitamin-b5-serum-1-oz)**.** I don't use the cream anymore, but I do still use the serum. It looks expensive, but if you get the refill sale, it's about $7/oz (this is the price for me in the U.S.). I HIGHLY recommend their [vitamin c, e, ferulic acid serum](https://www.timelessha.com/products/20-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-acid-serum-1-oz) as well when your skin can handle it. It works out to **about $8 an ounce** if you get it during refill sale. It stays good for a while in the fridge. I wrap it in foil to keep more light out and transfer some to a 1 oz dropper bottle for using it in my bathroom. It gives glow to your skin like ***NOTHING ELSE***, and boosts your sunscreen (the antioxidants slow the degradation of sunscreen ingredients) and has helped me with water retention. If you can't get it on refill sale, use the HotandFlashy (I also recommend her Youtube channel) code hf5off to get $5 off. It's a forever coupon code.\n\n**Urea** is **SO, SO,** **SO** helpful for healing dehydrated skin. It's an amazing humectant but also a mild exfoliator if you have a high enough %. [**Eucerin 5% Urea Face Cream**](https://us.feelunique.com/p/eucerin-dry-skin-replenishing-face-cream-night-5-urea-50ml?utm_source=googlebaseus&utm_medium=gen&gclid=eaiaiqobchmi4cftgp3z3qivc39-ch3qhgiheakyaiabegjud_d_bwe&gclsrc=aw.ds&curr=USD) is awesome for this. I don't use that anymore simply because it's more of a hassle to get (not available in the U.S.). My skin looks AMAZING with the [**TriDerma MD Eczema Fast Healing Cream**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991) used as a sleeping pack. It's full of skin-healing goodies, like urea (of course), 1.5% Colloidal Oatmeal, aloe, allantoin, arnica extract (a flower thingy that helps heal wounds), beeswax (beeswax and lecithin have great skin-identical components much like ceramides), shea butter, zinc and sodium PCA, and squalane.\n\n**Squalane** is another skin-identical ingredient that you can incorporate into your skin care. I use [this](https://www.timelessha.com/products/squalane-100-pure) one for now, but you can also get the oil at [gardenofwisdom.com](https://gardenofwisdom.com) or [lotioncrafter.com](https://lotioncrafter.com). The GoW one is a little bit more thinner more astringent-feeling to me for some reason than Timeless's.\n\nAnd while you're at it, mix in some other healing oils that help heal skin. Linoleic acid is very important in skin health and wound healing. Oils that tend to be high in these go off faster, however. So you may want to keep them in the fridge. Add in 1% mixed tocopherols (vitamin e) to extend the shelf life of your oils. I like hemp seed, wheatgerm, chamomile/calendula, rosehip oils (can aggravate acne if you're acne-prone). My choice of oils for my facial oil serum: 50% borage seed oil (the best healing), 29% squalane oil, 10% seabuck thorn BERRY oil (very different fatty acid profile to the seed oil), and 10% pomegranate (filled with antioxidants), 1% mixed tocopherols.\n\nSomething that really helps is layering a ton of humectants/watery steps in my routine. You can experiment with this, but right now I'm using the Thayers witch hazel, my vitamin c serum, timeless vitamin b5 serum, [**innisfree aloe gel**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Innisfree-Aloe-Revital-Soothing-Gel-300ml/302699871225?epid=4002960484&hash=item467a517bf9:g:gy4AAOSwsTday~0A) (unscented, aloe, centella stuff), CosRX Snail, and Hadalabo Premium. I plan to get [Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495) (way cheaper on eBay- like \\~$12).\n\nYou don't **need** a shit load of expensive things to heal dehydrated skin. In fact, a lot of the expensive stuff I see are filled with tons of unnecessary, possibly skin irritating plant extracts and essential oils, super fragranced. Many people go, oh it's fine bc it doesn't irritate my skin, but it's not just \"I'm sensitive to this\" vs \"I'm not\". It's likely that you can develop an allergy or sensitivity to a certain ingredient the longer you use it.  Like how some people develop sensitivity to latex after using eyelash glue with it in it for a while, or people developing sensitivity with lavender after prolonged exposure to the essential oil or something.\n\nAnyway, I hope that was helpful to anyone out there who struggled like I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: Also, I realized throughout my journey and research, a lot of things that look like \"break outs\", pimples, acne, aren't actually acne. Yeah, you can have acne due to bacteria or fungus or whatever else, but the stuff I'm talking about isn't really acne. Inflammation doesn't just manifest as rashes and thelike. A lot of things that look like acne are actually your skin saying \"no, this is irritating! Get it off me!\", like after you try a new thing for example. But that doesn't mean it will irritate it forever. You can use things that used to irritate your skin after your barrier heals. But some things you may be sensitive to forever..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDITED TO ADD 06/26/2019: AMINO ACIDS are also very important! They make up 40% of our stratum corneum (according to Susan from swiftcraftymoney)! If you want to fix your barrier, you want ingredients like amino acids, sodium PCA, sodium lactate, urea, and sugars like glycerin, fructose, what-have-you! For fatty acids, you want things like linoleic acids, oleic acids, and linolenic acids. Beeswax, lecithin, and lanolin are all great for rebuilding your barrier.\n\nI have not tried this, but The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA is a really good product with all of these NMFs. A pricy one is Paula's Choice Omega+ Complex (the serum, the moisturizer is okay too, but the serum has a lot more skin rebuilding goodies).",

I'm gonna switch out those two for something else because I love those creams and would like to have the choice to use it.\n\nThe La Roche Posay cleanser actually washes off clean, unlike the CeraVe Hydrating.\n\n(For people who are worried about parabens and hydroquinone, there is no need, we eat FAR more parabens and hydroquinone than we would ever put on our skin. Hydroquinone is not \"banned\" in other countries. It's just prescription-only because it's a very strong active so governments decided that people will need to use it under a doctor's supervision to avoid abuse.)",

Do you think that I need to find a heavier moisturizer, or do watery layers just not work for me?\nI’m using CeraVe Baby Cream and Vaseline as an occlusive.",

I picked up some vegetable glycerin to mix with the honey and I'm going to try that tomorrow. But as I've been trying to research this stuff, I've read some things about how using too much glycerin can make your skin drier? Honestly, I'm so overwhelmed and confused.\n\nI'd love to incorporate more moisture layers into my new routine, because I definitely feel like my moisture barrier is damaged and I'm trying not to freak out. I'm hoping it won't take me super long to recover, since it's really just the past week that I went overboard and hurt my skin. But who knows, maybe I have made my skin upset over time with fragrances and actives over time :/\n\nhow did you go about introducing new products when your issue started? I want to start using the cetaphil moisturizer if possible, and other products with ceramides, urea, etc etc BUT i can't seem to find any that are totally free from the ingredients that seem to be irritating me now... I dont want to buy products that will just sting and irritate me further, but I also don't want to prolong healing by not giving my skin everything it needs?\n\nsorry this is so long ashdsgkhflj thank you if you read this far\n\nEdit/update: I can tolerate the cetaphil Moisturizer now and it helps me feel hydrated, but I’ve started breaking out with some whiteheads, which is atypical for me (usually I get cystic pimples and CCs)",

I'm curious.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWow, the response on this was incredible! Thank you all so much!\n\nSo the general consensus that I gathered from all of your comments is that even though only spitting the toothpaste out of your mouth (with no rinse) is the recommended method, especially for those prone to poor diets, cavities and weaker teeth....there's an overwhelming number of people who rinse not just because of preference but because that's how they were taught (it just seems logical - like washing soap off your body when you shower).\n\nThere are also a segment of people who prefer to rinse due to health implications such as mouth / canker sores from the Sodium laureth sulfate in toothpaste or the alleged long term negative effects of fluoride in your body (FYI - I don't personally believe that the amounts of fluoride in toothpaste is enough to be harmful even if you only spit and leave it on your teeth, but I would advise whoever reads this to do their own research, consult with their own dentists or physicians and make their own decisions).\n\nGoing forward, I think I'll try the spit method, but only at night before bed. That would look like this: Floss, water / mouthwash rinse, brush for 2 mins, spit.",

    "body": "Du skal bruge en solcreme og der er 445 produkter at vælge imellem, så hvad hulen skal man vælge? Til at løse dette problem har jeg konstrueret et lille program der kan læse ingredienslisterne på Matas hjemmeside og efter lidt manuel oprydning i data er jeg nået frem til en lidt mindre liste og tænkte jeg ville dele mine resultater her.\n\nJeg har været ret striks i mine krav, da jeg er af den opfattelse at solcremer o.l. bør beskytte mod solen og derfor ikke bør indeholde parfume, farve, smag(!?) og lignende skrammel der ikke tilfører nogen værdi.\n\nI alt var der 445 produkter på det tidspunkt jeg hentede data (mindre end 2 uger siden).\n\nAf disse havde 103 ikke opført ingredienser og er derfor ikke med.\n\nAf de resterende havde 135 hormonforstyrende stoffer, mere specifikt er produkter med følgende ingredienser sorteret fra:\n\n* avobenzone\n* octocrylene\n* lavendel\n* benzophenone-3\n* benzyl salicylate\n* bht\n* bha\n* butylparaben\n* methylparaben\n* propylparaben\n* ethylparaben\n* homosalate\n\nAf de resterende 207 produkter havde 73 opført parfume/fragrance/aroma o.l. som vitterligt kan dække over hvad som helst inklusiv skadelige stoffer og er derfor sorteret fra.\n\nAf de resterende 134 produkter havde 2 opført parfume blot under deres kemiske betegnelse, mere specifikt:\n\n* limonene\n* linalool\n* citronellol\n* geraniol\n\nAf de resterende 132 produkter havde 42 opført ingredienser som jeg vil betegne \"problematiske\". Der er ikke helt enighed om de er skadelige eller ej, men jeg valgte at eksludere produkter med:\n\n* sodium lauryl sulfate\n* sodium laureth sulfate\n* methylisothiazoline\n* denatureret alcohol\n* propylene glycol\n* benzyl alcohol\n* benzyl alcohol citral\n* benzyl benzoate\n\nAf de resterende 90 produkter havde 12 farver i. Dvs. enhver ingrediens der starter med CI efterfulgt af et nummer, dog ikke zink og titanium dioxid da de fungerer som solfiltre.\n\nHerefter sorterede jeg alle produkter fra med en SPF værdi mindre end 30 og så er der 66 tilbage fordelt på følgende 4 kategorier sorteret efter billigste pris pr. liter/kg:\n\n**SOLCREMER/OILER:**\n\n|Produkt|Pris pr. liter/kg|Url|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Matas Striber

        "body": "Personligt hader jeg apps som kemiluppen af personlig holdning, for mig er det fearmongering  og får mig til at tænke på interesseorganisationen EWG 😅\n\nJeg går med solcreme dagligt i fjæset, det er SPF 50+ og 1/4 tsk af det. På denne tid af året bliver jeg nemt solskoldet, resten af året er det for min huds skyld + jeg bruger hudpleje der gør huden endnu mere sensitiv overfor solen (glykolsyre). \n\nDet mest vigtige for mig er at det er behageligt at bruge, hvis det ikke er det så får jeg det ikke taget på... I den forbindelse er jeg glad for Niveas ansigts solcremer bl.a. deres spf 50 face til sensitive hud (dog er den dårlig under makeup) og dem fra Garnier til ansigtet, de har bl.a. en tyndtflydende solcrememælk der tørrer mat på huden. \n\nJeg har prøvet Matas egen solcreme, men jeg kan slet ikke deres konsistenser! \n\nTil kroppen er enten et apoteksmærke, som f.eks. La Roche Posay, Bioderma, Avene osv. gode og ellers så laver Garnier og Nivea hæderlige solcremer til gode priser. \n\nI forhold til din liste af ingredienser du valgte også at ekskludere, synes jeg især det er interessant at sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, denatured alcohol og propylene glycol er inkluderet. De er alle fire totalt almindelige ingredienser i hudpleje (Dog er sodium lauryl sulfate og sodium laureth sulfate mest almindelige i sæber og renseprodukter) og jeg forstår ikke hvorfor du har skåret dem væk? Denatureret sprit fordamper efter applikation (og kan hjælpe med at solcremen tørrer ind) og ja det kan være udtørrende i nogle formularer, men ved hudpleje er det altid vigtigt at tage højde for formularen og ikke de individuelle ingredienser kun. Du kender jo selv at du kan bruge vand, mel, sukker og æg til at lave en del forskellige opskrifter, hvis du varierer metode og forhold... \n\nPropylene glycol i solcreme kan hjælpe solcremen med at sprede sig bedre på huden og hjælper med at opløse andre ingredienser i solcremen, da det er er godt solvent til mere hydrofobe stoffer. Det eneste jeg ved til kan være problematisk ved propylene alcohol er at det kan være irriterende for huden i høje koncentrationer (50% eller mere), men du vil sjældent se det brugt så koncentreret :p\n\nMichelle Wong, som er kosmetisk kemiker og har en PhD i kemi har skrevet på hendes blog om både [propylene glycol](https://labmuffin.com/what-are-propylene-and-butylene-glycol-and-are-they-safe/) og [SLS](https://labmuffin.com/whats-wrong-with-sls/).",

As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

I will say though that there is one part you should seriously consider editing:\n\n\"Do not use hydroxy acids with retinoids/retinol/Retin-A/Accutane or Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) products. Speaking from personal experience, this is way too much irritation to most people's skin. It can create more breakouts, redness, and inflammation, which is what you're typically trying to fix with these topicals.\"\n\nThis is very incorrect. While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

    "body": "About four years ago, I wrote the currently sidebar'd post, [\"Evaluating Your Current Routine\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1x1ubd/evaluating_your_current_routine_read_me_before/). In that, I recommended things to ask yourself and consider before buying new products or changing your routine entirely.\n\nI recently began blogging, but I wanted to bring these posts to Reddit as well for people who did not want to click out of the sub. \n\nLots of this is content that has been referenced over the years on this subreddit, as well as elsewhere. However, I understand the frustration for new users stumbling in, seeing product recommendations and terminology being thrown around, as well as an enormous sidebar. It's pretty anxiety-inducing. I also see a lot of people skipping from products to products, asking what to try next. \n\nMy goals with this series is to break down *what* goes into your cleansers and how it affects your skin so you are empowered to make better choices as well as understand some of the science that gets passed around.\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down your average, general cleansers as well as oil cleansers (or the oil-cleansing method aka OCM) and micellar cleansers. Let's dive right in!\n\n---\n\n**Introduction to Cleansers**\n\nCleansers work by dissolving or binding to things on the skin that aren't normally rinsed away by water, such as the waxes or oils produced by our skin.\n\nWithout getting too into the weeds, they are able to do this with surfactants  (or \"the thing that makes cleansers sudsy\"). The most common surfactants, and the ones you may have heard of are SLS and SLES (sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate). These ingredients work by binding to the lipids (oils such as jojoba oil or silicones like dimethicone) and then being whisked away by their water-loving properties. Once mixed with water, surfactant molecules cluster together into little spheres known as micelles. Some surfactants molecular size allows them to penetrate deeper into the skin (namely SLS), where they can bind to skin cells. As you can imagine, this is very irritating to skin, and is what causes the eventual drying that you may experience after using some products.\n\nSo by increasing the size of these molecules or adding additional ingredients, we get a gentler cleanser.\n\nIf you've hung out in any beauty circle, you've probably also heard chatter of pH - \"What is the pH of that cleanser? Have you tried the CosRx Low pH Cleanser?\". The pH value of a cleanser can have an impact on how harsh your cleanser is on your skin as well, and simply put, it's because the surface of your skin is naturally pretty acidic.\n\nGoing back to Chemistry class really quickly, you'll probably remember something called the \"pH Scale.\"\n\nThings on the left side of the scale (1-6) are considered acidic. Things on the right side (8-14) are considered basic or alkaline. And of course, there is what is considered neutral, or pH 7. Skin has a pH of around 5.5, but becomes more basic the further down into the dermis you go, reaching a pH of about 7. Why is this important, you may be asking? Well, if you think back to your high school Chemistry course, you may have remembered the good ol' baking soda and vinegar reaction. When this reaction -- called an acid-base reaction -- occurs, the baking soda and vinegar exchange atoms and form different compounds, namely water and carbon dioxide. This is because bases are compounds that generally want to donate atoms and acids are compounds that generally want to accept atoms.\n\nAs skin comes in contact with other ingredients, even water, the pH temporarily raises and other compounds are created. Fatty acids (read: acidic components) of the skin are removed.\n\nHealthy skin can usually re-balance itself within an hour or so. Some skin takes longer to do this, especially skin that is prone to irritation, such as skin with acne, rosacea, eczema, or psoriasis. This is why your boyfriend can cleanse his face with a Dial soap bar and have glowing skin an hour later, while you're busily slathering on layer after layer of moisturizer.\n\nUsing a cleanser that is closer to our skin's natural pH is the obvious solution to this problem, and most modern cleansers are formulated much better than those of the past.\n\nSo now you're probably asking yourself: *Well, how can I test the pH of the cleanser I would like to buy? And how do I know the surfactant isn't going to irritate my skin?*\n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate.\n\nYou should also look for moisturizers, like oils, ceramides, cholesterol, and humectants (water-binding ingredients such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, or squalane). Avoid saponified oils (please don't use Dr. Bronner's on your skin) and bar soap.\n\nNow I know you're asking: What about oil cleansers then?\n\n---\n\n**Oil Cleansers**\n\nWhat if I told you that your grandmother was ahead of the game?\n\nNearly all of us have seen a tub of Pond's Cold Cream hanging out in our grandmother's bathroom or on her vanity. You might've seen her dab some all over her skin and wipe away all of her makeup with a tissue. She may have sworn by it as the thing that kept her looking young, and she's not entirely wrong.\n\nI like to think of oil cleansers as being broken down into two types of cleansers -- wipe-off cleansers like your grandmother's Pond's, and emulsifying cleansers like the translucent oil cleansers that come in a pump or tub.\n\nThe former -- wipe-off cleansers -- are the most common mixtures in the cosmetics industry. They are usually simple mixtures of oil and water, and are high in water content, which makes them inexpensive.\n\nThey spread easily and often leave an oily or richly moisturized feeling behind. They're typically purchased by people with mature skin, but are a great alternative for people with dry skin.\n\nThe latter -- emulsifying cleansers -- are also mixtures of oil and water, but are higher in oil content, which makes them more expensive. They contain emulsifiers that bind well to water, which allows them to rinse away in water.\n\nThe benefit of these cleansers is there is no real \"sudsing\" action on the skin. Indeed many of them can actually feel \"moisturizing\" due to their ingredient makeup. They are also excellent for breaking down make-up and other waterproof things, such as mascara, due to the high oil content.\n\nWhen picking out an oil-cleanser, look for shortened ingredient lists. Don't be swayed by extracts or other frills that will wash away. The oil itself will be the biggest point of irritation (or not) for your skin, so don't be afraid of \"boring\" oils like mineral oil or petrolatum, which is one of the blandest, most non-reactive molecules around.\n\nJust one more to go...\n\n---\n\n**Micellar Cleansers**\n\nMicellar water is quite literally made up of micelles, or the molecular bunches of surfactants that group up, their water-loving butts faced outwards. These larger bunches of molecules, diluted in combinations of water and hydrating ingredients (such as glycerin), are the most mild of cleansers.\n\nThe percentage of surfactant to other ingredients is generally so low that micellar water does not need to be washed away. This allows the hydrating ingredients, such as glycerin, to stay on the skin after the debris has been removed.\n\nThis makes micellar water ideal for sensitive skin or prepping the skin for product application, when cleansing with a standard cleanser and water will be too drying.\n\n---\n\n**All Wrapped Up**\n\nSo what does this all mean? Here are some general skin cleanser guidelines to follow:\n\n* **Cleanse your skin at least once a day.** At the end of the day, your skin not only has a build-up of oils, but also debris and particulates in the air.\n* **Don't pile it on.** Your non-sudsing cleanser does not need to suds to work.\n* **Two-step cleanse for removing make-up.** Most make-up is waterproof and does not easily cleanse away. Use an oil cleanser to break down the make-up and remove it.\n* **Use cottons to remove cream cleansers like Pond's.** The friction will help to remove grime and dirt. Splash with water after to remove any leftover emulsifiers.\n* **Use cool water when cleansing.** Hot water can make surfactants penetrate deeper by reducing the size of the micelles, which is why your hot shower is more irritating and drying to your skin than the less-fun cooler shower.\n* **Moisturize.** Even water strips away the valuable fatty acids in your skin. Using a moisturizer on your skin after will help your skin to re-balance itself quicker.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Kind of Stephen](https://kindofstephen.com/)\n* [DermaScope](https://www.dermascope.com/ingredients/surfactants-and-emulsifiers)\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

I'll be posting other pieces that I think will be useful too and linking them here so there's a comprehensive but approachable body of information to help people out.\n\nIf you have comments or suggestions, I'm very happy to receive them either here or in private message! \n\n# No-Poo Quick Start Guide\n\n## Clarifying wash\n\nAn extremely large number of hair and body products have silicones in them including but not limited to: shampoo, conditioner, commercial ‘oil’ blends, serums, curl creams, gel, mousse, pomade, dry shampoo, etc. The silicones coat your hair, completely sealing the hair strand, are not water soluble, and therefore are utterly incompatible with no-poo, low-poo, and true soap (saponified oils). They must be removed before starting, and can only be removed reliably by sulfates, specifically sodium lauryl sulfate or (SLS) or sodium laureth sulfate(SLES). If any of the products you have been using have silicone in them, or you have been using ingredients that can build up on your hair, the first step must be a clarifying wash.\n\nYou will need a cleanser that contains SLS/SLES but does not contain silicones or plastics. The two most popular are the ultra inexpensive Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo or any VO5 Shampoo that is not a 2 or 3 in 1. They are both around $1-2 at any common store in the USA. If you do not live in the USA and don’t have access to these products, you can check your local products using the tool at [www.isitcg.com](http://www.isitcg.com/) to see if they are suitable. The tool needs to find SLS/SLES, but if it finds any silicones the product is not suitable.\n\nWash well, massaging it into your scalp and along your hair to be sure to completely remove all silicone and product buildup, then rinse very well. You only have to do this once, as the assumed intention is to never use silicone or water insoluble ingredients again. If you do unintentionally get silicone on your hair, you will have to repeat this wash.\n\n## Mechanical Cleaning: Scalp Massage, Preening and Brushing/Combing\n\nBy choosing no-poo, you have decided to exchange low effort chemical stripping for the work of mechanical cleaning. This needs to be performed regularly and properly to be effective. During transition, you’ll most likely need to perform it daily and the tools you used like brush or comb need to be cleaned. They are a vital part of mechanical cleaning and need to be clean so they can help you clean your hair again tomorrow, instead of just spreading old oils and debris back through your hair. \n\n**If you are not getting the results you expect, then step up your mechanical cleaning.** During transition this won't necessarily make you look better, but it will help keep your scalp and hair healthy.\n\nTools made from natural materials like boar bristles, sisal, wood or even metal will be far more effective at moving your oils than synthetic materials like plastic or nylon, but if all you have is synthetic, it's far better than not using them at all. \n\nAs transition eases and passes, the work required becomes less, but never disappears. \n\n### Detangling Your Hair\n\nHair is delicate, and grows slowly, so you want to be gentle with it and cause the least amount of damage while taking care of it. Use a wide toothed comb for this, not a boar bristle brush as they are too soft to detangle efficiently. Start at the tips of your hair and gently detangle the first few inches. Move up a few inches and detangle that, continuing until you reach the roots. Use your fingers on stubborn tangles rather than yanking through them and breaking the hair. Realize that the parts you detangled earlier could get tangled again as you draw new tangles down or the strands get wrapped around fuzz or other debris in your hair. Slow, gentle strokes will prevent pulling or breakage. If you have dense hair, work in sections if possible. \n\n### How to Perform Mechanical Cleaning\n\nMechanical cleaning is the mainstay of no-poo so you need to learn to perform it properly. During transition it usually needs to be performed **daily** and **obsessively** or you will not have the results you need. Spending quality time each day gently massaging your scalp, preening and brushing will keep your scalp healthy and your hair smelling nice, even if it doesn’t look nice during transition. It can be difficult to take time out for personal grooming these days, but it can be very soothing once you learn to slow down. It also doesn’t need to be performed in a vacuum. Put on some music, listen to or read a book, browse the net, watch some tv, or even hang out with another person.\n\nThis guide from Just Primal Things does an outstanding job of explaining the whats and hows of performing mechanical cleaning. \n\n[https://justprimalthings.com/2014/10/20/the-ultimate-water-only-hair-washing-routine-no-shampoo/](https://justprimalthings.com/2014/10/20/the-ultimate-water-only-hair-washing-routine-no-shampoo/)\n\nA small addition is needed to explain how to preen either short hair or curly hair, as both require slightly different techniques. \n\n#### Preening Short Hair\n\nFor extremely short hair, like a buzz cut, you might not need to preen at all. Gently massaging your scalp with the pads of your fingers might be sufficient. If you find you need to preen, it is performed with the palm of the hand. Gently but firmly rub your palm along your scalp, following the general grain of the hair. You should not be pressing very hard, or irritating the scalp with quick, random, painful movements. Smooth, firm motions to spread and lift the oils are best.\n\nFor hair that is a little longer, make the motion like you are running your fingers through your hair, but instead of finishing the motion, close your fingers firmly so strands are caught between them and gently pull your hand away from your scalp. Continue until all your hair has been nicely preened.\n\n#### Preening Curly Hair When Dry\n\nHere is a short video that includes an explanation of the process. It involves separating out a curl clump and drawing it around and through the fingers while using the thumb and first finger to do the main preening. Wet preening can often be done like the guide shows, drawing the fingers straight down the section of hair, usually with water running through your hair. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/gm9v6k/preening\\_curly\\_hair/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/gm9v6k/preening_curly_hair/)\n\nIf you have coily or kinky hair, you can still do water washing, but you might need to modify your routine even further. There are quite a few videos on YouTube about how to work with this kind of hair too!\n\n### Cleaning your tools\n\nCleaning is easy, but needs to be done shortly after you've used the tool, so it has time to dry before you use it again. Sometimes they can even just be dry cleaned with another brush or comb. Cleanser can be anything that cleans. Dish soap, shampoo, clay, baking soda, etc. Just make sure your cleanser doesn't have silicone in it either! \n\nFor a bristle brush, pull all the shed hairs out of the brush, and then get it wet and spread some cleanser across the bristles. Ground the tips of the bristles in the palm of your hand and gently move the brush in a circular motion so all the surfaces of the bristles get cleaned. Use a fine toothed comb between each row of bristles, combing up through the bristles on either side to remove lint and fuzz. Rinse really well so all of the cleanser is removed from between the bristle clumps and let the brush dry in a ventilated area with the bristles pointing down so water doesn't collect in the bristle plugs. \n\nFor combs or pin brushes, spread some cleanser on the item and then use a soft scrub brush to clean between the tines or pins of the item, making sure you scrub at multiple angles to get everything clean. Rinse well and place the brush in a ventilated area with the bristles pointing down so that it can drain and dry properly. \n\nYou can clean wooden or horn items the same way you clean plastic. The brief exposure to water won't damage them, but don't let them soak. \n\nLet everything dry in a ventilated area. Don't put them in a cupboard or drawer or bag when wet as that will slow the drying and encourage the growth of mold. \n\n## Customize Your Routine\n\nSpend a few weeks settling into your new water only routine and practicing your mechanical cleaning techniques. Massage and preen, both dry and wet, **with cool or warm water running through the section of hair you are preening under the shower**, which is very effective at cleaning out excess oils and debris like lint and dust**.** If you are massaging your scalp when wet, do that under the water also, but **be very sure that you are being gentle** so you don’t damage it or unnecessarily loosen hair, causing it to come out before it’s ready to shed. When your hair is dry, detangle and then brush properly **in sections at multiple angles**. Keep the oils moving so they coat your hair, doing their job of conditioning, sealing and protecting it and so they don’t start to smell. If you've ever heard the old saying about brushing 100 strokes a day for healthy hair, this is why. \n\nAfter a while, you might run into some problems. Solve them as they actually happen, rather than anticipating and applying a solution you might not need. This will keep things simple, and allow you to slowly build your customized no-poo routine, developed specifically for your individual environment, biology, needs, presentability and preferences.\n\n## Simple Tests, Valuable Information\n\nYou need to learn some valuable information about your biology and environment that will help you choose proper methods and ingredients to care for your hair and avoid damage.\n\nThere is more information on all of these later in the guide. \n\n### Porosity\n\nYou need to learn the porosity of your hair because it affects how your hair reacts to almost everything in no-poo. The two most popular tests that you can find on the internet, the float and strand tests, are both notoriously inaccurate. Here is an easy quiz to help you figure it out. \n\nhttps://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/\n\n### Protein\n\nYou need to learn how to test for protein so you can know if your hair needs protein to be strong and supple, or if protein needs to be avoided so it doesn’t become dry and brittle. \n\nWhen you are in the shower and your hair is wet, take a shed strand and stretch it. Hair with the proper amount of protein should stretch about 20% before it stops, and should return to its original length when released. If it stretches more, it needs protein. If less, you want to avoid it.\n\n### Hard Water\n\nYou need to learn whether you have hard water, because it makes almost everything no-poo more difficult, and knowing what you have to work with will help with expectations. If there is mineral build up around your sinks, faucets, kettle or coffee pot, you have hard water. You can look up a hard water map of your area for a general idea of whether your dwelling has it. Your water provider’s web site should have it posted, if not you can call and ask.. If you want to spend a little money, there are at home test strips that you can buy.\n\nContinue to the next part: Transition: a Small Step to a New Lifestyle [https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/hu7q2r/transition\\_a\\_small\\_step\\_to\\_a\\_new\\_lifestyle/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/hu7q2r/transition_a_small_step_to_a_new_lifestyle/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(old) ~~What is Transition?~~ [~~https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/hk5zr3/what\\_is\\_transition/~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/hk5zr3/what_is_transition/)",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "Over the years, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the hair care advice I've come across. Things never seem to work the way they're supposed to, and people seem to exclusively rely on anecdotes and personal experiences when giving their recommendations, often repeating things they read in a beauty mag or blog where the main goal is often to sell hair product or push dogma.\n\nSo I've done some digging, to learn a little bit about the real chemistry and science behind your hair care products, to dispel some myths and get to the truth of what's going on with your hair.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458934/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19467087\n\n#What is hair?\n\n>*Hair is an integrated system with a peculiar chemical and physical behavior. It is a complex structure of several morphological components that act as a unit. The hair shaft of mammals is divided into three main regions: Cuticle, cortex and medulla. The medulla is present in corser hair like grey hair, thick hair and beard hair, and it is absent in fine hair of children. There is more medulla in the coarser hair of Asians than Caucasians. The medulla may be involved in the splitting of hairs since it provides an area of weakness as a pathway for the propagation of cracks along the axis of the fiber.*\n\n>*The cuticle is a chemically resistant region and consists of flap overlapping scales (keratinocytes) like shingles on the roof. The shape and orientation of the cuticle cells are responsible for the differential friction effect in hair. The cuticle is generally formed by 6–8 scales thick for Asians, slightly less in Caucasians and even less in African hair. A thinner cuticle layer makes African hair more prone to breakage.*\n\n[Image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1083/7638/files/Hair-Anatomy-e1421050694589.png?v=1505924657)\n\n\n#Why do we shampoo? Is it necessary?\n\nOver time, your hair will develop a build up of dirt and other pollutants (eg: campfire smoke, minerals from hard water) as well as sebum, sweat and dead/peeled skin.\n\nPrior to the 1930's we simply used bar soap to wash our hair. The issue with this is that it would often leave a residue/soap scum on the scalp and hair, which is uncomfortable and aesthetically unpleasing. Shampoo was the answer.\n\nIn recent years, you may have heard that you don't need to shampoo, and that it causes your hair to produce more oils. This is untrue- there is no evidence to support the claim that using shampoo stimulates production of sebum on the scalp, including shampoos that contain sulfates and silicons.\n\nMost proponents of no-poo substitute shampoo with an alternative such as ACV or a specially formulated conditioner that effectively serves the same purpose.\n\n#How does shampoo work?\n\nThe main active ingredient in shampoo is a type of molecule called a surfacant. This is typically a sulfate, with the most common being Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. You may have heard that all sulfates do is \"create suds\" and damage your hair, this is incorrect.\n\n>*Residues are nonsoluble fats (sebum) that do not dissolve with water. In order to be removed from the hair shaft, surfactants present a hydrophobic molecular portion, and another hydrophilic. The former will chemically bond with the fat, while the latter will bond with the water. The surfactants are generally composed of a chain of fatty hydrocarbons (tail) and a polar head. The polar extremity is capable of giving this portion of the molecule hydrophilic traits that allow it to dissolve in water and wash away the residues.* \n\nWhat this basically means is that one end of the surfacant will attract water, and the other will repel it and attract sebum, allowing it to be washed out of the hair along with the shampoo.\n\nSurfacants can be classified into four groups: Anionic, cationic, amphoteric and nonionic.\n\n[Here's a classifications chart of common surfacants.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/bin/IJT-7-2-g001.jpg) \n\n* **Anionic detergents:** Among the most popular surfactants, they are named for their negatively charged hydrophilic polar group. Derived from fatty alcohols, they are very good at removing sebum from the scalp and hair. However, the excessively cleaned hair is harsh, rough, dull with frizz and prone to tangling. Among them, different classes of detergents are available with certain selective properties.\n 1. **Lauryl sulfates:** Popular primary cleansers, they work well in both hard and soft water, produce rich foam, and are easily rinsed. They are excellent cleansers, commonly used in shampoos for oily hair. As the hair becomes harsh and rough, careful selection of a secondary detergent and possible use of a conditioning agent is always required as part of the shampoo formulation. Examples of this class include: Sodium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and ammonium lauryl sulfate\n 2. **Laureth sulfates:** These are another class of excellent detergents with good cleansing ability and foaming property which are useful for normal-to-dry hair. Examples of this chemical class are: Sodium laureth sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate\n 3. **Sarcosines:** They are generally secondary detergents, as they do not remove sebum well from the hair to justify as primary cleansers. They are listed as the second or third on ingredient list of detergents. Excellent conditioners are used in conditioning shampoos and dry hair shampoos. Examples are: Lauryl sarcosine and sodium lauryl sarcosinate\n 4. **Sulfosuccinates:** These are strong detergents commonly used as a secondary surfactant in oily hair shampoos. Examples are disodium oleaminesulfosuccinate and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate.\n\n* **Cationic Detergents:** In contrast to anionic detergents they have a positively charged polar group. They are poor cleansers and do not lather well and are not compatible with anionic detergents, limiting their utility. However, they are excellent at imparting softness and manageability to chemically damaged hair and so are primarily used as daily shampoo for damaged hair such as in case of permanently dyed or chemically bleached hair. Examples are: Long-chain amino esters, ammonioesters, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.\n\n* **Amphoteric Detergents:** Having both positively and negatively charged polar group, they behave differently at lower pH (as cationic detergent) and at higher pH (as anionic detergent). Subgroups include the betaines, sultaines, and imidazolinium derivatives. They are used in baby shampoo and for those with fine and damaged hair because they don’t cause stinging in the eyes in children, foam well and leave hair in manageable state. Examples are: Cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium lauraminopropionate.\n\n* **Nonionic Detergents:** They have no polar group and are among the mildest of all cleansers and aid to improve the antistatic qualities of a shampoo. They can be combined with ionic detergent as a secondary cleanser. Examples are: Polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters and alkanolamides.\n\nAll shampoos contain some variation or combination of these substances to wash your hair. Some sulfate-free shampoos may contain none, but this means that they are basically not effectively cleansing your hair. (most sulfate free shampoos will simply use a surfacant that doesn't contain the word \"sulfate\", though)\n\nHigh end shampoos from salons contain these same ingredients, with the main difference being perhaps nicer smells and a much stronger concentration that requires dilution in water before use.\n\n#####How often should I shampoo?\n\nYou probably do not need to shampoo every day, and you do not need to go weeks without shampooing. Shampoo your hair when it is oily or dirty. Experiment with different shampoos and take a look at the active chemicals that are doing the heavy lifting. \n\n#The benefit of conditioner\n\nModern shampoos are extremely effective. Unfortunately, heavily cleansed hair is not desirable to most, as it is harsh, hard to manage, prone to tangling, and looks dull.\n\nThe solution to this is a conditioner, which are sometimes included in the shampoo itself. \n\nA conditioner is any substance which is intended to enhance feel, appearance, fullness, lubricity, shine, and general manageability of hair. \n\n>*Conditioner molecules contain cationic surfactant which gives a positive electric charge to the conditioner. The negative charge of the hair is attracted to the positively charged conditioner molecules, which results in conditioner getting deposited on the hair, especially on areas where there is degree of weathering. This is true for damaged hair as they are even more negatively charged. Thus, conditioners reduce the static electricity. They also flatten the cuticle scales over the hair shaft, reducing the friction between hair fibers, increasing the reflectance of light which improves shine and color. The smooth feel resulting from conditioner use gives easier combing and detangling in both wet and dry conditions. Conditioners temporarily seal split ends and mend trichoptilosis.*\n\nConditioners will contain a wide variety of ingredients:\n\n* **Cationic surfactants:** Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behentrimonium or propyltrimonium, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine. They are considered the backbone of a conditioner\nPolymers: Mono and polypeptides like hydrolyzed proteins (amino acids), polypeptides derived from collagen and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)\n\n* **Bodying agents and thickeners:** Fatty alcohols (e.g. cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), waxes (e.g. carnauba wax and paraffin wax), or gums (e.g. guar gum) and salt (sodium chloride)\n\n* **Emollients/oily compounds:** These include natural or synthetic oils, but also esters and waxes. Natural oils used in conditioners are, for example, jojoba oil, olive oil, or grape seed oil. The most frequently used synthetic oils are silicone (e.g. dimethicone, dimethiconol, amodimethicone and cyclomethicone) which are even superior to natural oils in terms of film formation, shine and luster. Asian countries have large hair diameters, therefore a higher concentration of silicone is used as compared to that for Caucasian hair (3-5% vs 0.5%)[1]\n\n* **Auxiliary emulsifiers:** Ethoxylated fatty alcohols (e.g. polysorbate-80 or ceteareth-20) which are non-ionic agents seem to be particularly effective at providing emulsion stability if it cannot be acheived by catiionic agents alone in a conditioner.\n\nThe big bogeyman you may notice is silicons. It is not bad for your hair, and not all silicons are equal. If you use a good shampoo with a good surfacant, build-up is not a concern and you likely don't need to worry too much about this. The backlash against silicons cropped up when people decided to eschew sulfates in their shampoo. Many people quickly realized that without proper cleansing, some silicons would build up in the hair over time.\n\nLike all things related to hair care, the key is balance. A fairly comprehensive resource for different types of silicons and how they behave is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) on /r/HairCareScience*, keep this in mind when deciding on which hair product to purchase for your hair.\n\n*while /r/HairCareScience has some good information on it and the moderators know their stuff, be wary of basically every comment from the users, as most of them are simply giving others anecdotal advice and spreading bogeymen.\n\n#How to wash and condition your hair.\n\nThe way you apply these products to your hair is undervalued, and doing it properly may have more benefit than you might suspect.\n\nShampoo should be applied starting from the front and working your way to the back. Applying it directly to the top of the head will create friction and cause tangling. \n\nOnce the shampoo has been rinsed from your hair, it's recommended to gently towel dry your hair before applying the conditioner. Conditioner should be applied on the length of the hair, avoiding the scalp.\n\nLeaving conditioner in your hair is not necessary, once the product has been spread over the surface of your hair it has done its job and may be rinsed out completely.\n\nAfterwards the hair may be gently towel dried. \n\n(If your hair is curly, there may be extra steps such as applying a leave-in product while hair is still wet. Using such products on straight thin hair may result in it looking oily and dull.)\n\n#TL;DR?\n\n* Wash your hair when it's dirty/oily. \n\n* There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.\n\n* Sulfates are not bad for your hair, but may cause it to look dry and become hard to manage. \n\n* Use conditioner or use a less effective surfacant to combat the above problem.\n\n* Silicons are not bad for your hair, most good shampoos will prevent any build up from happening.\n\n* The key to good hair care is not going \"no poo\" or \"sulfate/silicon free\", it's finding the right balance of chemicals to wash your hair and keep it looking good. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": ">There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.\n\nI would like to add some more information about this, because that part of your post can be interpreted wrongly, as in \"it doesn't matter how much you wash your hair with shampoo, it wont affect the rate at which your hair gets greasy anyways\". I believe your statement to be true that sulfates themselves wont stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil. However, washing your hair too often will substantially raise the rate at which your scalp produces oil and thus the rate at which your hair gets greasy. There are two main reasons for this. The first reason is that when you wash your hair and scalp, you'll also inevitably stimulate the skin in that area, creating friction which results in more blood flow that will make the sebaceous glands \"work better\". The second reason is that by washing your hair you'll also remove the oil from your scalp. Leaving your skin in a dry condition. Dry skin will make your sebaceous glands work overtime to fix exactly that problem, as their main function is to lubricate and waterproof your skin. \n\nTldr: Don't wash your hair too often, it will get your hair greasy fast. It can also cause dandruff in the long term by overstimulating the sebaceous glands.\n\nSource: Studied hairdressing and am a barber.",

    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove.

Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

    "body": "This is now in the wiki section of the sub! \n\n[Quick Start Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/wiki/index/quickstart)\n\nThis is part of something larger I'm working on with the help of the community at large and several other users. I thought this section would be useful as is until my crazy life settles down and I can actually dedicate time and attention to finishing it. I've taken too long to work on this and reddit automatically archived my previous post so I can no longer edit it and people can't comment.  I'm reposting so we can all interact with it again.\n\n# No-Poo Quick Start Guide\n\n## Clarifying wash\n\nAn extremely large number of hair and body products have silicones in them including but not limited to: shampoo, conditioner, commercial ‘oil’ blends, serums, curl creams, gel, mousse, pomade, dry shampoo, etc. The silicones coat your hair, completely sealing the hair strand, are not water soluble, and therefore are utterly incompatible with no-poo, low-poo, and true soap (saponified oils). They must be removed before starting, and can only be removed reliably by sulfates, specifically sodium lauryl sulfate or (SLS) or sodium laureth sulfate(SLES). If any of the products you have been using have silicone in them, or you have been using ingredients that can build up on your hair, the first step must be a clarifying wash.\n\nYou will need a cleanser that contains SLS/SLES but does not contain silicones or plastics. The two most popular are the ultra inexpensive Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo or any VO5 Shampoo that is not a 2 or 3 in 1. They are both around $1-2 at any common store in the USA. If you do not live in the USA and don’t have access to these products, you can check your local products using the tool at [www.isitcg.com](http://www.isitcg.com) to see if they are suitable. The tool needs to find SLS/SLES, but if it finds any silicones the product is not suitable.\n\nWash well, massaging it into your scalp and along your hair to be sure to completely remove all silicone and product buildup, then rinse very well. You only have to do this once, as the assumed intention is to never use silicone or water insoluble ingredients again. If you do unintentionally get silicone on your hair, you will have to repeat this wash.\n\n## Mechanical Cleaning: Scalp Massage, Preening and Brushing/Combing\n\nBy choosing no-poo, you have decided to exchange low effort chemical stripping for the work of mechanical cleaning. This needs to be performed regularly and properly to be effective. During transition, you’ll most likely need to perform it daily and the tools you used like brush or comb need to be cleaned. They are a vital part of mechanical cleaning and need to be clean so they can help you clean your hair again tomorrow, instead of just spreading old oils and debris back through your hair.\n\n**If you are not getting the results you expect, then try increasing the time you spend on mechanical cleaning.** During transition this won't necessarily make you look better, but it will help keep your scalp and hair healthy.\n\nTools made from natural materials like boar bristles, sisal, wood or even metal will be far more effective at moving your oils than synthetic materials like plastic or nylon, but if all you have is synthetic, it's far better than not using them at all.\n\nAs transition eases and passes, the work required becomes less, but never disappears.\n\n## Detangling Your Hair\n\nHair is delicate, and grows slowly, so you want to be gentle with it and cause the least amount of damage while taking care of it. Use a wide toothed comb for this, not a boar bristle brush as they are too soft to detangle efficiently. Start at the tips of your hair and gently detangle the first few inches. Move up a few inches and detangle that, continuing until you reach the roots. Use your fingers on stubborn tangles rather than yanking through them and breaking the hair. Realize that the parts you detangled earlier could get tangled again as you draw new tangles down or the strands get wrapped around fuzz or other debris in your hair. Slow, gentle strokes will prevent pulling or breakage. If you have dense hair, work in sections if possible.\n\n## How to Perform Mechanical Cleaning\n\nMechanical cleaning is the mainstay of no-poo so you need to learn to perform it properly. During transition it usually needs to be performed **daily** and **obsessively** or you will not have the results you need. Spending quality time each day gently massaging your scalp, preening and brushing will keep your scalp healthy and your hair smelling nice, even if it doesn’t look nice during transition. It can be difficult to take time out for personal grooming these days, but it can be very soothing once you learn to slow down. It also doesn’t need to be performed in a vacuum. Put on some music, listen to or read a book, browse the net, watch some tv, or even hang out with another person.\n\nThis guide from Just Primal Things does an outstanding job of explaining the whats and hows of performing mechanical cleaning.\n\n[https://justprimalthings.com/2014/10/20/the-ultimate-water-only-hair-washing-routine-no-shampoo/](https://justprimalthings.com/2014/10/20/the-ultimate-water-only-hair-washing-routine-no-shampoo/)\n\nA small addition is needed to explain how to preen either short hair or curly hair, as both require slightly different techniques.\n\n## Preening Short Hair\n\nFor extremely short hair, like a buzz cut, you might not need to preen at all. Gently massaging your scalp with the pads of your fingers might be sufficient. If you find you need to preen, it is performed with the palm of the hand. Gently but firmly rub your palm along your scalp, following the general grain of the hair. You should not be pressing very hard, or irritating the scalp with quick, random, painful movements. Smooth, firm motions to spread and lift the oils are best.\n\nFor hair that is a little longer, make the motion like you are running your fingers through your hair, but instead of finishing the motion, close your fingers firmly so strands are caught between them and gently pull your hand away from your scalp. Continue until all your hair has been nicely preened.\n\n## Preening Curly Hair When Dry\n\nHere is a short video that includes an explanation of the process. It involves separating out a curl clump and drawing it around and through the fingers while using the thumb and first finger to do the main preening. Wet preening can often be done like the guide shows, drawing the fingers straight down the section of hair, usually with water running through your hair.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/gm9v6k/preening\\_curly\\_hair/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/gm9v6k/preening_curly_hair/)\n\nIf you have coily or kinky hair, you can still do water washing, but you might need to modify your routine even further. There are quite a few videos on YouTube about how to work with this kind of hair too!\n\n## Cleaning your tools\n\nCleaning is easy, but needs to be done shortly after you've used the tool, so it has time to dry before you use it again. Sometimes they can even just be dry cleaned with another brush or comb. Cleanser can be anything that cleans. Dish soap, shampoo, clay, baking soda, etc. Just make sure your cleanser doesn't have silicone in it either!\n\nFor a bristle brush, pull all the shed hairs out of the brush, and then get it wet and spread some cleanser across the bristles. Ground the tips of the bristles in the palm of your hand and gently move the brush in a circular motion so all the surfaces of the bristles get cleaned. Use a fine toothed comb between each row of bristles, combing up through the bristles on either side to remove lint and fuzz. Rinse really well so all of the cleanser is removed from between the bristle clumps and let the brush dry in a ventilated area with the bristles pointing down so water doesn't collect in the bristle plugs.\n\nFor combs or pin brushes, you can use a soft scrub brush to dry clean them and lift the built up sebum and fuzz. Or you can wash them by spreading some cleanser on the item and then use a soft scrub brush to clean between the tines or pins of the item, making sure you scrub at multiple angles to get everything clean. Rinse well and place the brush in a ventilated area with the bristles pointing down so that it can drain and dry properly.\n\nYou can clean wooden or horn items the same way you clean plastic. The brief exposure to water won't damage them, but don't let them soak.\n\nLet everything dry in a ventilated area. Don't put them in a cupboard or drawer or bag when wet as that will slow the drying and encourage the growth of mold.\n\n## Customize Your Routine\n\nSpend a few weeks settling into your new water only routine and practicing your mechanical cleaning techniques. Massage and preen, both dry and wet, **with cool or warm water running through the section of hair you are preening under the shower**, which is very effective at cleaning out excess oils and debris like lint and dust. If you are massaging your scalp when wet, do that under the water also, but **be very sure that you are being gentle** so you don’t damage it or unnecessarily loosen hair, causing it to come out before it’s ready to shed. When your hair is dry, detangle and then brush properly **in sections at multiple angles**. Keep the oils moving so they coat your hair, doing their job of conditioning, sealing and protecting it and so they don’t start to smell. If you've ever heard the old saying about brushing 100 strokes a day for healthy hair, this is why.\n\nAfter a while, you might run into some problems. Solve them as they actually happen, rather than anticipating and applying a solution you might not need. This will keep things simple, and allow you to slowly build your customized no-poo routine, developed specifically for your individual environment, biology, needs, presentability and preferences.\n\n## Simple Tests, Valuable Information\n\nYou need to learn some valuable information about your biology and environment that will help you choose proper methods and ingredients to care for your hair and avoid damage.\n\nThere is more information on all of these later in the guide.\n\n## Porosity\n\nYou need to learn the porosity of your hair because it affects how your hair reacts to almost everything in no-poo. The two most popular tests that you can find on the internet, the float and strand tests, are both notoriously inaccurate. Here is an easy quiz to help you figure it out.\n\n[https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/](https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/)\n\n## Protein\n\nYou need to learn how to test for protein so you can know if your hair needs protein to be strong and supple, or if protein needs to be avoided so it doesn’t become dry and brittle.\n\nWhen you are in the shower and your hair is wet, take a shed strand and stretch it. Hair with the proper amount of protein should stretch about 20% before it stops, and should return to its original length when released. If it stretches more, it needs protein. If less, you want to avoid it.\n\n## Hard Water\n\nYou need to learn whether you have hard water, because it makes almost everything no-poo more difficult, and knowing what you have to work with will help with expectations. If there is mineral build up around your sinks, faucets, kettle or coffee pot, you have hard water. You can look up a hard water map of your area for a general idea of whether your dwelling has it. Your water provider’s web site should have it posted, if not you can call and ask.. If you want to spend a little money, there are at home test strips that you can buy.\n\nHere's a thread with lots of information about hard water and how to deal with it.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/mtm6te/faq_hard_water_wax_and_natural_nopoo/\n\n# Transition: a Small Step to a New Lifestyle\n\nNow that you’ve started your no-poo routine, you’re going to experience what is called transition. This is the period of time in between the point when you slowed or stopped using shampoo and other products and finally stabilize into your customized no-poo routine. Depending on your product history, biology and approach to transition, it can typically last from 2-6 months.\n\nIt is a time of healing, finding a natural balance, and retraining your sebum production to be in sync with that natural balance. This is also often a difficult time because of all the new things you are experiencing and learning. It doesn’t help that your scalp kinda freaks out during this process and might become excessively oily, waxy, smelly, dry, flaky, and could break out a little too. This will pass as transition does, even if it takes longer than you really want it to, and your scalp and hair will be healthier for it.\n\n## A Natural Kind of Clean\n\nNo-poo isn’t just about learning to wash your hair with only water or your kitchen cupboard, it’s about embracing your bodys’ natural functions and environment. Modern society and advertising has us convinced that horrible things will happen to us if we don’t spend tons of money on their products. If we don’t use antibacterial soap, we will get horribly sick. If we don’t use highly fragranced shampoo, body wash and deodorant we will be rank and offensive. If we don’t use tons of styling products, our hair will be dry and ugly.\n\nSo we destroy our bodys’ natural protections, both the acidic oily lipid barrier and the beneficial symbiotic microflora, in favor of something that kills everything but the most resilient pathogens, which are then free to multiply because they have nothing left to compete with. Those highly fragranced body products are filled with chemicals and we have very little understanding of how they affect us and our planet, and quite a few people spend their lives battling irritation and sickness because of them. We wash our hair with shampoo, which is too drying, and then try to compensate for that with conditioner, which is filled with things like silicone and liquid plastics that can only be removed by the shampoo. Then we add even more product with texturizers and styling creams, hair spray, mousse, gel, pomade...all in the attempt to replace what the shampoo stripped away in the first place.\n\nHair that is allowed to be itself is textured, interesting, healthy, easy to manage, and properly moisturized. Getting it there can be a bit of a trial, and part of that trial is modifying your ingrained expectations about what ‘clean’ is and how it feels.\n\nModern society defines ‘clean’ as stripped and sterile. But sterile is impossible in a living environment. There is quite a lot of research being done on how vital our microflora is to the health of our skin and the overall wellbeing of our bodies. Microflora is being used to treat chronic conditions like eczema, psoriasis, allergies, and many other conditions, and is having remarkable results.\n\nNo-poo defines ‘clean’ as healthy and comfortable. Being clean is **not** having dry, chapped, stripped skin that must be soothed by a multitude of creams and products, nor hair that is stripped and beaten into submission with chemicals and coatings. Clean is having a healthy body with its natural protections in place, and hair that is properly supported by those natural protections. Clean is knowing how those protections work, and what to do to support them and maintain your own personal sanitation. Clean is encouraging your symbiotic bacteria and understanding that they fight pathogens for you, that they are not the enemy but your allies. Clean is understanding the purpose of sebum: that it conditions, protects, seals in moisture, and learning to love the feeling of it in your hair, and embracing the comfort of knowing it’s doing its job.\n\nSebum is **not** bad or unhealthy, it is the best thing for your skin, scalp and hair. Transition is **not an endurance contest or a race.** It is a small step towards a more natural, healthy lifestyle. Choosing to embrace transition will help you modify your expectations and make it much easier in the end. You could look at the excess sebum as a new product you’re trying out and learn to work with it instead of just wishing it away. If you get some on your hands, just rub it in like lotion. Or you could rub it somewhere you’re dry, like your elbows or forearms. You might find that you enjoy the result of having your natural conditioning oil on your hands and body, protecting you from the things you interact with. It is a customized product that is just for you. And best of all: free!\n\nYou might also consider exploring washing your body with only water and experiencing the benefit of a body that is entirely naturally clean, but discussing that in detail is beyond the purpose of this wiki.\n\n## Things That Affect Transition\n\nThe kind of transition you have is dependent on so many variables it’s difficult to know what each individual will experience. We do know that the type of product you’ve been using and the frequency in which you’ve been using it will greatly affect the duration and severity of transition. How hard your water is can also affect it, but only because hard water makes everything no-poo more difficult.\n\nSurfactant cleansers (detergent based shampoos and conditioners) are classified by how stripping and drying they are:\n\n* Dandruff Shampoo: extremely stripping, drying, and harshly exfoliating. It is trying to remove everything that the fungus might feed on and starve it out as well as using medication to kill it. Using it is often a vicious cycle because of its drying and exfoliating properties. When you quit using dandruff shampoo, the scalp often explodes in a cloud of flakes because it is dry and irritated and no longer being exfoliated. This often prompts the user to start using it again, which suppresses the flakes again. Often the only way to quit dandruff shampoo is to accept that flakes will happen while your scalp heals and give it the support and moisture it needs to do so.\n* Sulfate shampoo: defined by the inclusion of sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate. Sulfates are known to be very stripping of oils in the skin and are also irritants that cause dry, damaged skin.\n* Low-poo: defined by the lack of sulfate surfactants, but still containing other surfactants. Because it lacks sulfates, it cannot reliably remove silicones and product buildup caused by liquid plastics. A proper low poo also does not have parabens, water insoluble silicones or drying alcohols in it. Much gentler than sulfate shampoo, but still stripping because of the surfactants.\n* Co-wash: a conditioner that contains no sulfates, parabens, water insoluble silicones or drying alcohols. Classified as low-poo. Still contains surfactants, but also contains moisturizers which reduces the irritation caused by stripping greatly, and so is much gentler than any shampoo.\n\nThe duration between washes also plays a big part in how bad transition will be. If you’ve washed every day, transition will be worse than if you’ve only washed once a week.\n\nHard water turns oils into ‘wax’. This will make your hair stiff, sticky, difficult to brush and comb, and can dry out your hair because the wax coats it and doesn’t let moisture in.\n\nAll of this can allow you to make some intelligent choices about things you can expect and how you want to approach transition. **In the end, however, the best way to handle transition is** **any** **way that gets you through it.** Too many people treat it like that endurance contest that was mentioned earlier, and this often causes them to give up and quit. Don’t worry about how long it will take. Don’t worry about whether doing something will set you back. It all evens out in the end, and if you keep pursuing it, you will get there eventually! It’s better to do what you feel you need to rather than believing you have to just tough it out and then giving up because you can’t.\n\n## How to Handle Transition\n\nIf you’ve been doing something that will make transition more intense, the best way to approach it is slowly and intentionally. A nice low-poo or co-wash can greatly help during the difficult parts of transition by removing the extreme overproduction of oils while your scalp heals from the dryness and irritation of dandruff shampoo or sulfate over-use while still looking and feeling presentable. r/curlyhair has an extensive list of good low-poo and co-wash products that will all be suitable for this. There is also an ingredient checker linked in the sidebar there, and another one at [www.isitcg.com](http://www.isitcg.com/) that can help you find products that aren't on their list.\n\nHere's a broad overview of steps that can ease transition.\n\nIf you haven't been using something that will make your transition more intense, you can step into this list at any point that looks comfortable to you.\n\n* Begin with a clarifying wash, as low-poo cannot reliably remove silicones.\n* Choose not to worry about how long this will take, just take each step when it feels comfortable to do so. Part of no-poo is about learning to listen to what your body needs and taking responsibility for your own individual needs.\n\n1. Wash as often as you need with your new product. Add in moisture treatments, healing herbal drenches and scalp massage if needed to deal with dryness and flakes. If you're quitting dandruff shampoo, there will likely be a time of oiliness and flakes that even the low poo won't help with completely. Submerging your hair and gently swishing it around can be very effective at removing them. You will also need lots of moisture during this time, and gentle scalp massage can help lift the flakes and stimulate healing. This step might take several months, because dandruff shampoo or daily sulfate use are both quite damaging and there could be a lot of healing involved.\n2. Start keeping a cup in the shower and use it to dilute your low-poo. Use only as much as you need to get clean. Products are often far too strong, and that’s part of what makes them so stripping.\n3. Start doing water only washes in place of some low-poo washes to learn and practice your new mechanical cleaning skills. Slowly phase out the use of your low-poo.\n4. If you choose to pursue sebum retraining, start spacing your washes out. Wait until you feel you would normally wash, and then wait another day.\n5. Start always doing water only washes. You might need to wash more frequently when you reach this step, and that’s ok. Wash as often as you like. If you want to pursue alternative washing, this is a good time to start experimenting with that also. Don’t be afraid to use your low-poo to help clean up experiments either. During this step, pay attention to the health of your scalp. If you need to clean it a little more, try gently massaging it under the water, just like you’ll be preening under the water. But it can be delicate, so be gentle when you do. You might also need to add in some moisture treatments as your scalp heals from the low-poo you’ve been using.\n\n* Address any problems that develop, like dealing with hard water waxiness or needing more moisture in your routine.\n\nThis is a simple, methodical approach that will allow you to ease into no-poo while still feeling clean and looking presentable. There is no need for the discomfort of feeling endlessly disgusting, and struggling through that will only make it more likely that you won't make it through transition at all.\n\nYou also don't ever need to worry about doing something that will ruin your transition, it can't happen. Even if you end up with silicone on your hair and have to do a sulfate wash to remove it, you still won't ruin your transition. You have been healing and rebalancing, that is progress that doesn't disappear with one mistake. The only thing you could do to ruin your progress is to go back to full overuse of damaging products again, and even that would take a while.\n\n## Straight to Water Only\n\nThe quickest approach to transition is cold turkey, where you do a final clarifying wash and then just go straight to water only washing once a week. If you haven’t been doing something that will make your transition more intense, you might choose to try this approach, but don’t feel like you are locked into it. Remember, **any approach to transition that gets you through it is completely valid.** With this approach, transition typically lasts 2-4 months. This is also the most difficult for a variety of reasons.\n\nMost people are not experienced with mechanical cleaning and are learning a whole new skill set. Most people are used to the ease of using shampoo and are not used to the work that mechanical cleaning requires, so often don't perform it properly or sufficiently. Added on top of those is the fact that transition itself is difficult because your scalp is freaking out, your sebum is weird, oil is pouring down like it will never stop, and you're only 'allowed' to wash once a week.\n\nThe only way to deal with this is excessive dry mechanical cleaning every single day, with lots of quality time spent with your boar bristle brush (and then be sure to clean the brush!) **Even if you do this, you will probably still look oily for 2-3 months.** Washing can help, but it's difficult to remove a weeks' worth of oils, especially for people who are just learning how to perform mechanical cleaning in the shower.\n\nScalp health is key in no-poo, but most especially during this approach. All the oils that your scalp is flushing so that it can heal are sitting on your scalp and in your hair all week and can cause a lot of problems if they aren't dealt with. They can create an environment for fungal, yeast or bacterial infections, and under the right circumstances, hair loss. If you have a huge excess of oils on your scalp, you absolutely must do the gentle scalp massage frequently to keep them moving.\n\nThis approach can be softened and made significantly easier by water only washing more often than just once a week, especially in the beginning. This allows you to practice your in shower mechanical cleaning and will help remove oils, keep your scalp clean and allow you to be more presentable. There are even reports of people who washed every day during their transition and they say they believe it was easier for them because of it. Adding in alternative washing methods when needed can be helpful also, to break up transition wax, or just to remove large quantities of sebum and allow you to have a break from the super oily hair for a few days. Washing more often will extend the retraining aspect of transition, but will make the early part much easier to deal with.\n\nNo-poo is not a short term project, it’s a long term lifestyle choice. It is not a race to see how fast you can finish transition, the ultimate goal is to make it through transition so that you can enjoy your healthy no-poo hair.\n\n## The Two Pieces of Transition\n\nThere are two main things that happen during the time we call transition. There is the time of healing which is the main part of transition, and there is the intentional retraining of sebum production.\n\n## Flushing and Healing\n\nYou have spent years putting things on your scalp that harshly strips your natural oils away, and then put more things on your hair and scalp to try to compensate for this. These things contain many different chemicals that react with you, your environment, and each other in a vast variety of different ways, often causing irritation at the minimum and sometimes serious damage. They have also unbalanced the natural environment of your scalp and hair in serious ways. All of this needs to be corrected and healed, which takes a while and can cause weird things to happen to your scalp and sebum while it works itself out.\n\nThis is a healing time for your scalp. If you have been seriously sick for many years and finally found a treatment that made you better, you would expect it to take a while to heal. Your scalp has the same needs. We aren't talking weeks here, we are talking **months**.\n\nExpectations are powerful. We are trying to supply you with information that is as accurate as possible, so that you can form your expectations based on that. When you see a video on YouTube saying that they did water only for two weeks and showing how awesome their hair is, it's extremely likely their transition hasn't even gotten started yet. Sometimes it can take up to a month or longer for the weirdness to start. But it sets up expectations that transition isn’t such a big deal, which isn't true at all for the vast majority of people.\n\nThere are also people who try no-poo for 4-6 weeks, and then post how horrible it is and how it doesn’t work because their hair is terrible. Even if they have been performing mechanical cleaning properly (many of them haven’t), they are still in transition, and shouldn’t be expecting anything different. But it is probable that they turn a lot of people who were interested in no-poo away from trying it, because ‘it didn’t work for that YouTuber so it’s a scam’.\n\nSome potential milestones during transition, especially if going straight to water only:\n\nAfter the first few washes when your sebum is starting to become weird, you will probably encounter the waxy stage. This is where your hair is stiff, sticky, tangles easily, is difficult to comb or brush and leaves white or grey sticky residue on your tools. This also happens if you have hard water, because it turns oils into ‘wax’. A warm applesauce mask applied for about 30 minutes and then combed out under the shower water can help lift the waxiness. You may have to apply it several times to fully lift the wax. Brushing excessively over the course of several days will also lift it.\n\nThe super oily stage is almost universal, where your hair is saturated with sebum and looks wet and limp and everyone must think you’re a grease monster, but it’s surprisingly soft and easy to comb or brush. Keeping the oil moving with preening and brushing is important so that it doesn’t build up and smell.\n\nYou might encounter the “my wash method is making me lose all my hair” stage where you learn how much hair you actually shed every day but have never noticed. Shedding about 100 hairs a day is normal, but when you’re using shampoo they usually drift away during the day. When you go no-poo and your hair is oily, they stick together instead and only come out during a brushing or washing session, so you see them all at once.\n\nAfter a while of trying no-poo and dealing with the overproduction of sebum for weeks on end, you might reach the point where you want to quit because you feel it’s never going to get better, and you’re going to need encouragement to push through. Find a friend or come post on r/nopoo and share your frustrations, the community is very supportive and encouraging!\n\n## Retraining Sebum Production\n\nOften people have been stripping their hair and scalp with harsh chemicals every day for years. Your scalp compensates by producing a large quantity of sebum, attempting to do its job of protecting and conditioning your hair. It has been trained that this over production needs to happen because of the daily stripping, and so needs to be retrained that it's not going to be harshly stripped any more and can start producing a more balanced amount of sebum. This is done by delaying washes that remove sebum from the scalp in any way, including dry shampoo, allowing your natural biofeedback to realize that there is plenty of sebum on your scalp and eventually it will stop producing so much.\n\nIf you choose to be less intentional about retraining, there are some reports that sebum production will eventually reduce even if you wash with a no-poo method every day. It will just happen at its own pace instead of being encouraged to happen more quickly.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHere is a FAQ that is in the works.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/lt9c9z/nopoo\\_faq\\_and\\_general\\_information/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/lt9c9z/nopoo_faq_and_general_information/)\n\nHere's the links to the previous postings.

How much mechanical cleaning should I expect to do once fully transitioned?\n\nI’ve been working on going no-poo for about three months and I’ve got to a stage where my scalp feels pretty good and clean (not clogged and “wet” with oil like in the beginning), and my hair, especially the roots and crown, feel oily and dense and flat in the evenings, but when I wake up in the mornings it’s much better.

        "body": "Thank you for writing this! I realized that back when I was around 12 years old, I was already doing no poo and it was fantastic for my hair. I would shampoo my hair maybe once or twice the whole month and I grew my hair so long then. But as I got a bit older and started watching youtube + discovering social media, as someone with semi kinky curly hair, I fell for so many marketing fads. Thinking certain products would grow my hair better than my routine I had for a couple years of water only washing and the occasional shampoo. I think that I will return back to water only washing because of this chunk of info you wrote! So I appreciate it so much. I always thought I was just gross and crazy for doing this at one point even though my hair never showed signs of damage. I swam everyday too. I would cowash sometimes but never really on a schedule. I remember my mom being so grossed out by the fact that I used to rarely use soap, even less than I do now. I would use soap on the days where I was super sweaty and felt gross after a work out but I still find myself just using water on my body because my skin gets so sensitive and just cannot handle soap sometimes, especially ones with sulfates as I’m slowly trying to use up these products in any ways other than on my body such as cleaning items like hair brushes. I find that using soap on my armpits is the only place I apply soap if my skin is feeling a bit dried out.\n\nI was wondering about some aspects though.\n\n1) You mentioned ACV and I currently do use ACV once a week diluted with water and peppermint + tea tree oil on the day where I’ve been exercising and sweating heavily. Do you think that I could use ACV in place of a shampoo or would that affect my scalp just as badly as a shampoo? Because I wash my hair once a week with shampoo, could I just use ACV that day in its place? \n\n2) Is it actually bad to go no poo but then occasionally use a shampoo? Like once or twice a month as I mentioned? I switched to “sulfate free” shampoos this past year which I only use the ones without silicones (which has always been a big thing for me because silicones tend to irritate my skin for some reason) (and i even cut out sulfates in my toothpaste because they would cause me canker sores very often and ever since i switched to sulfate free cruelty free brand i only get a canker sore from my other triggers like oranges) and normally have the cocamidopropyl betaine in it. You said that there’s no proper way to transition but I was just wondering can it set back your process in any way after you’ve already transitioned? Or even right now, I like to do hot oil treatments and need a shampoo to rinse avocado oil off my scalp because I don’t want my scalp suffocated by oil. Do you recommend just using up the rest of my oils + shampoos and then going no poo or only doing hot oil treatments every two weeks or what is your opinion on this? I’ve seen hair growth from using hot oil treatments and massaging my scalp when I do them once a week but I feel like I can’t do them anymore if I go no poo because I feel the need to use a shampoo. Felt better asking rather than being sorry down the line. \n\n\n3) Would a brush similar to the tangle teaser be good for spreading the sebum on the hair? specifically the detangling brush by crave naturals. it’s my favorite hairbrush!\n\nThank you for helping us all out!",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

    "body": "I got my first pimple at age 9, actual acne/breakouts at age 10, and suffered a lot from it since. But I've learned a lot of great things along the way and there seems to be so many misconceptions from beauty magazines and the internet, so I wanted to share you things I know. Here we go!\n\n1. **Dermatologists are not always the best source.** Most dermatologists specialize in serious skin issues such as skin cancer. Many don't really understand acne as well as you would think. I went through three separate dermatologists who were all considered the top of their practice in my city (a large metropolitan city). But it's usually a painful cycle of trying this anti-biotic then that anti-biotic. Then they'll try whatever prescription creams they can on you as if its just a laundry list. I know too many acne sufferers who wasted their money. *If you choose to go to a dermatologist or any other licensed skin specialist, make sure they are specifically specialized in acne.* \n\n2. **Quit dairy.** Get your calcium from non-dairy options or vitamins. Milk should be substitued with almond, NOT SOY, milk. Almond milk tends to have less sugar (and calories!) and soy has potential to make acne worse. Goat cheese is your best cheese option, or dairy-free cheese. Lactose-free dairy products could still be dairy products. \n\n3. **Regularly change your pillowcase.** This is a VERY important tip! It does make a difference!\n\n4. **Do NOT use face washes and shampoos with sodium lauryl sulfate/sodium laureth sulfate** ammonium lauryl sulfate is okay, I've never heard of anybody break out specifically from it. *Cetaphil face wash is an acne nightmare.* Don't use it! Avoid fragranced products as well. \n\n5. **Do not overeat eat anything with iodine** This includes certain supplements and seaweed. Iodine triggers acne. \n\n6. **Birth controls, particularly Yaz or Ortho-tri cyclen, can help** But some can harm, so ask an expert before using it. \n\n7. **Use benzoyl peroxide starting with no more than 2.5%, then if necessary upgrading to 5% after a while.** Never go over 5%. 10% can be used but only for spot treatment, and use a q-tip to treat. \n\n8. **Eat dark chocolate to stop sweet cravings, but avoid other sweets as much as possible.** I shoot for 80% dark. \n\n9. **Use powder face makeup.** Powders as foundation can give adequate coverage and are far less likely to cause breakouts. Liquids and creams are usually too heavy and can clog pores, even if labeled oil-free or non-comedonegenic. I recommend Almay face powder or even Bare Minerals which has good coverage. \n\n10. **You MUST wear sunscreen every day, even if it's cloudy or winter-time.** I recommend Elta sunscreens, they are lightweight and don't cause breakouts, I personally use them. Don't use a moisturizer if your skin is oily, a sunscreen can double as one.  Look for sunscreens with physical blocks, like zinc oxide. Invest in a good sunscreen so you don't spend hundreds on anti-aging products later. ",

I went on it before I lost my virginity b.c I had super irregular periods and pretty bad pms, including moderately bad acne.  IT WAS MAGICAL.  My skin cleared up in a month and my periods were light and regular with almost no bloating, cramps etc.  Then all of the sudden (3 years later) I started having these weird mood swings at night.  I would be totally fine all day and then just get really sad or angry or giddy or vacant or just plain old miserable.  every night.  So I went to the dr. they told me it was stress (totally wasn't my life was going amazingly well at the time).  It progressively got worse to the point that I was miserable or numb 24/7 with random interjections of hysteria, both crying and laughing, for no reason whatsoever and also completely, 100% lost my sex drive. didn't want to be touched.  every doctor i went to told me it was stress and i needed to do yoga or something.  I thought I was manic depressive and was freaking out.  This had been going on for two months.  till finally my thoroughly fed up bf at the time did a lot of research and told me it could be my pill.  went off it immediately and my mood elevated in a day.  It took almost 6 months for my mood to totally even out again and to get my sex drive back. \nMoral of the story? Yaz has way too much estrogen in it which over long periods of time will FUCK YOU UP.  Don't do it girls!\n\nTL;DR : Yaz was awesome till it made me go crazy.  Estrogen pills=bad news bears",

    "body": "Добрейший денёчек! Вот и снова я со своим добром. Буду писать сегодня о самом наболевшем. Сульфаты.\n\nСульфаты, как мы их привыкли собирательно называть- это соли серной кислоты, по сути своей, это достаточно агрессивные и дешманские вспенивающие компоненты, которые производители косметики пихают то тут, то там. Добавляют их в косметику, так как они удешевляют состав, образуют обильную пену, промывают «до скрипа», ну и уменьшают расход средства. Сейчас можно подумать что я просто описала «идеальный продукт», но как бы не так. \n\nСульфаты, а пока что я буду называть их так же собирательно, для удобства, они смывают все под чистую с кожи головы и волоса, а соответсвенно, вызывают привыкание кожи головы, так как из-за излишнего промывания сальные железы начинают работать ещё активнее, очень часто косметика с сульфатами вызывает аллергию, зуд, раздражения, ну и кучу ещё разных недугов. Именно по причине слишком усердного промывания их нельзя после процедуры кератинового выпрямления, ботокса или ламинирование волос. \n\nОбычно такие вспенивающие ПАВы стоят в первой половине состава в косметике, то есть достаточно много их там содержится, что не есть хорошо. Самы противные и нежелательные из них: SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate Лаурилсульфат натрия), SLES (sodium laureth sulfate лауретсульф натрия), а так же ALS и ALES вот эти ребятки прям максимально агрессивны, их вообще лучше стороной точно обходить, канцерогены, соединения аммония. \n\nКак же выбрать правильный шампунь? Смотрите в первую очередь на вспенивающие компоненты, мягкими, которые например используются в натур косметике, являются ПАВы на основе кокосового масла (узнать, как правило, можно по слову COCO в компоненте), на основе глюкозы (ищите слово: glucoside), изетеонаты (isethionate) и саркозинаты (sarcosinate), ну и мыльный орех, корень, кора мыльного дерева или сапиндуса (ищите sapindus или soapnut).\n\nОдни из самых вредных компонентов так же напишу сейчас, но поясню, там не все вспенивающие есть и кондиционирующие, для примера. \n\nCetrimonium и Etrimonium Chloride (кондиционеры Gliss KUR, как минимум, L’OREAL Paris, ежедневный спрей-кондиционер против ломкости), Lauramide DEA(lauric acid, вспениватель, в очищающей пенке Алоэ вера Nature republic), PEG-150 Distearate, ALS, ALES L’Oreal Elseve шампуни достаточно большая часть), SLS, SLES (очень часто встречаются в косметике, возьмите почти любой шампунь в супермаркете). Старалась найти конкретные примеры, но не всегда это осуществимо, так же хочу сказать стоит избегать TEA, MEA, DEA, они в бОльшей части являются канцерогенами, не все конечно, но большинство, ибо если это расписывать будет уже простыня и не очень понятно, сама уже запуталась. По поводу них стоит гуглить, так как их наименований действительно очень много, на сколько знаю не все из них вреднючие. \n\nХотелось бы сказать, что самого слова «sulfate» боятся не стоит, надо смотреть какой это именно компонент, он не обязательно будет являться агрессивным ПАВом, в общем, надо смотреть не на слово, а на компонент в целом. \n\nТак как агрессивные ПАВы вызывают привыкание кожи головы, то слезать с них достаточно трудно, голова начинает быстро жирниться и так далее, но оно того стоит, это нужно лишь немного перебороть себя)).\nТем более сейчас натур косметика сделала уже достаточно для того, чтобы мягкие ПАВы точно так же работали как сульфаты, то есть давали большую пену, хорошо промывали, так что особой разницы можно и не заметить даже, только это будет безопаснее, а так же не наносит вред окружающей среде. \n\nДумаю что написала вроде как все, стараясь особо не нагружать, буду ждать ваших отзывов предложений про что написать, замечаний. \nПост носит лишь рекомендательный характер и основан на опыте,  только личном. \nА ещё я хз про что в следующий раз написать)",

    "body": "I have wasted sooo much money on hair products over the years!! I think that the demonization of sulfates has lead to reformulations that have been detrimental to my greasy mop.\n\nMy hair is pin straight, very silky, and fine. I have a lot of it, but it gets easily weighed down. It also gets easily tangled. My scalp is also EXTREMELY greasy! I would shampoo my hair twice a day if I could, I feel like daily isn't quite enough.\n\nSulfate-free shampoos give me dermatitis, and they actually give me headaches because they make my hair so tangled and weighed down that it tugs on my scalp. So I have been using shampoos with sulfates still, but my hair still has had that tangled/weighed down feel to varying degrees. And I felt trapped by conditioner, because I couldn't detangle my hair, but all conditioners weigh down my hair and make it greasy even faster, and don't detangle it very well to be honest. So I'd put conditioner on my hair first, to untangle my hair enough to reach my scalp, then shampoo it, then put a bit of conditioner on the ends to try and make it so I could detangle it, but I couldn't strike the balance between detanglable but greasy, or not using enough and trying to not rip my hair.\n\nMy hair has been increasingly flat, itchy, and gunky, and has only looked good (for a bit, but felt awful) when I blow dried it with many products for volume.\n\nSo I was using: a detangling serum, which weighed down my hair but helped it not be so matted, mousse, and then I would NEED to use dry shampoo after my hair was blow dried, because my scalp couldn't ever get completely clean.\n\nAnd I was using: Kerastase blond absolu shampoo and the conditioner, Bumble and bumble Sunday shampoo (which cleaned better than much else I'd tried, but not perfect, and left my hair a tangled mat), Amika purple conditioner. So I WAS using shampoo with sulfates! I will say, it's infuriating that seemingly every shampoo is sulfate free, or only has mild sulfates now, and every conditioner is VERY HEAVY! (I also used: Oribe, Aveda, Davines for conditioner. None of them would rinse out.)\n\nFinally, last week I had ENOUGH of spending hours on trying to make my hair look decent, and never feeling clean. I thought that since the products have sodium laureth sulfate, they should be cleaning well enough!\n\nI did research, and discovered that sodium lauryl sulfate is a stronger surfactant. So I made my way to the drugstore, with my only criteria being that the shampoo contained sodium LAURYL sulfate, and chose based on smell, which felt fun and lighthearted and not stressful. I chose Herbal Essences Body Envy shampoo, and the matching conditioner. \n\nThe first wash with the shampoo, which went easily into my hair without tangling it, removed so much of the weird gunk feeling from my hair. The second wash removed it ALL! My hair felt squeaky clean, but not tangled. I used the conditioner, which easily rinsed out. My hair easily brushed out after the shower, no other products needed!\n\nAnd...my hair has air dried, it feels so much lighter and better! I can't believe it. My hair was so weighed down. It is so shiny, and has so much more body, and isn't tangled in weird areas. I can't believe how easy and stressless it was.\n\nTL;DR: I love sodium lauryl sulfate.\n\nEDIT: I want to update by saying, I tried out my Kerastase mousse again, and it actually added body without making my hair feel disgusting!",

Where they were talking about how sulfates were bad because it dries out your hair and to use sulfate free shampoos because they had “cleaner ingredients” and are less harsh for your natural hair and I ate it up ngl.\n\nI started using sulfate-free shampoos ever since then for about 2+ years, and my hair NEVER felt clean enough. Even after washing my natural hair over 4 times and literally wasting the shampoo, I would scratch my hair and there would STILL be product buildup under my fingernails. No matter how many times I shampooed my hair, my hair was still dirty. \n\nSo then I came across a post on Reddit about how someone had the same experience that I had to where they would use Sulfate-free shampoos, and it would not get their hair as clean as sulfates would so they went back to their sulfates and their hair has been thriving ever since. i decided to purchase a shampoo with sulfates in it after years of not using sulfates. i felt like i was going into the natural hair jail cell at the moment in time, it felt like a crime picking up a bottle that had  “Sodium Laureth Sulfate” in the ingredient list. I did my wash day routine and used the sulfates and i wash shocked.\n\n*when i tell you my hair hasn’t felt this clean in years, my scalp FINALLY felt like it was clean.*\n\nthat shampoo got every single buildup from my scalp it wasn’t even funny, it was truly liberating and one of the best shampoos my hair had in *years*. so I guess it’s safe to say that my hair needs the sulfates in order to be clean.\n\nI write this post to say that I believe that sulfates get a bad rep and sometimes i feel as if it’s some misinformation going around. of course, there are some naturals that don’t have a positive experience with sulfates in their shampoos because it dries out their hair and scalp, but for me, unfortunately sulfate free shampoos did not work out for me like I had hoped it too, and I stuck with it for years.\n\nbut it had me wondering, what if some naturals NEED sulfates in their hair and can’t get away with being sulfate-free?  for context, i have low porosity, very dense and thick, 4a hair that is super prone to buildup and an oily scalp so I believe that sulfates in this case are needed for me. but I truly feel like we cannot push this “sulfate-free” movement to everyone when everybody has different hair and scalp types. it’s not a one size fits all.",

The natural hair community often promotes sulfate-free shampoos as the gold standard, but the reality is that everyone’s hair and scalp have different needs. If you have low porosity, dense hair with an oily scalp, it makes perfect sense that you’d need a stronger cleanser to fully remove buildup. Sulfates aren’t inherently bad—they just need to be balanced with proper moisture to prevent dryness. At the end of the day, what matters most is listening to your hair and doing what actually works, rather than following trends that may not suit your unique texture and scalp condition.",

Even longer, preferably. \n\nI found a hairdresser in my city who specialises in long hair. His entire schtick is long hair: growing it, maintaining it, etc. He was trained by this late great world renowned long hair specialist called George Michael. It all sounded perfect.\n\nThe cut was fine, but he said something that made me sceptical: \n\n*Hair should all be one length with no shorter fringe or layers because otherwise it 'focuses' on trying to even out the different lengths.* \n\nIs this true? It sounds like nonsense to me. \n\nThe second thing that made me doubtful was the shampoo he recommended I use contains sodium laureth sulfate. \n\nI shelled out for this three step set of products (George Michael brand) that he insists on his clients using. It wasn't cheap at around £70 for the set, so I expected them to be full of good things and stupidly didn't bother checking what was in them until a few weeks later when I noticed my hair was feeling dry - in my defence, his website claimed the shampoo was 'free of detergents' so I assumed there wouldn't be any SLS! \n\nThe ingredients are as follows:\n\n*Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, PEG 80 Sorbitan Laurate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Disodium Lauroampodiacetate, PEG 150 Distearate, Sodium Laureth 13 Carboxylate, Citric Acid, Gylcol Stearate (and other ingredients), Propylparaben, Diazolidinyl Urea, Mathylparaben, Propylene Glycol, Color (FD&C Red#33 & D&C Orange #4) and Fragrance*\n\nI thought SLS was meant to be a big no no for maintaining healthy hair, especially if it's wavy which mine is. \n\nAs for the rest of the ingredients, I have no idea whether they're bad or good. Sodium trideceth sulfate sounds like it could be similarly drying but I wouldn't know. \n\nThis whole thing has left me doubtful of his advice. I'm meant to be going back to see him at the end of the month but I currently feel like he's taking me for a ride with these expensive products. He has loads of good testimonials so I feel stupid for doubting him. What do you guys think? \n\n(P.S. Sorry for the essay!)",

Also only apply shampoo on the roots and nowhere else.\n\n>Hair should all be one length with no shorter fringe or layers because otherwise it 'focuses' on trying to even out the different lengths.\n\nSince its harder to always cut layered hair equally much I'd say thats decent advise. It's easier to maintain healthy hair when it's all one length as you can easily always cut a tiny bit off the ends  meanwhile with layers it's hard to get every piece. Also long hair will thin out at the ends by default so no reason to make it worse with layers. Weird wording though.\n\n\nOverall I believe fancy hairdressers are a waste of money and so is a lot of the fancy hair products. You can literally use any shampoo and it will be alright, the only actual difference is conditioners as professional ones (which you can buy for cheap on amazon) are higher concentrated. Hairdressers will always charge you extra for products and will try to sell a certain line of products. Personally I'd recommend to just buy L'Oréal professionals or redken from amazon, you can get a saloon grade shampoo and conditioner for $30 and it will legit last for ages.\nOtherwise, if you want to grow your hair long, ANY hairdresser can cut your ends from time to time, and that's all you need.\nNo hair product can change the speed at which hair grows, or how well it does, the only thing you can do is use lots of conditioner and get regular trims to keep the ends healthy and with no breakage. And you know, don't use heat and use a tangle teaser brush.",

I've yet to hear an argument from any of them on how the length of a strand in relation to others is known by the follicle.  The obsession with boar bristle brushes mean his advice was really only considering straight hair, and the product range is incredibly limited. It is so very rigid in the ideals, which just match the founders personal ideals for women's hair.\n\nI think the George Michael affiliated salons or stylists are loved because they will generally not over-trim hair beyond the minimum and time is meant to be spent on snipping off individual splits throughout the hair. They are also gentle in their drying technique etc to accommodate extreme length. \n\nHowever, I think the one size fits all approach massively lets them down. If you don't get on with the products, their ramge doesn't have alternatives for you and those ingredients look more stripping than I'd expect from a company built on the idea of handling hair like fine silk!\n\nI think what your hair needs is too different to what George Michael's system is willing to provide.",

Secondly you need to ask him to explain. It is important to build a relationship with your hairdresser/stylist, where you can feel comfortable to ask him questions about your hair or what he is teaching you. \n\nSLS is not necessarily bad, it is bad to people who have an allergy or irritation. It is one of the ingredients that can really cleanse the hair. Some SLS free products are not effective cleansers or may dry the hair more than an SLS shampoo does. The whole composition of the shampoo is important as there are ingredients that in low dosages can do tremendous work. So using SLS is not a no-no to maintain healthy hair, this is something some people came up with because a lot of SLS shampoos happen to be drying, or they are using the wrong one for their hair.\n\nThe shampoo you shared has nothing special to cost $70 though. Since this stylist seems to have this own routine or methods to grow hair, it could be the reason why he pushes this technique. After all, if you do not use what he suggests he might not be able to get the results he wants or expects for your hair. Know that whenever you go to a branded store, like Paul Mitchelle Salon, Wella Salon, Deva Curl salon etc...all these type of salons have their products and will most likely suggest you products in their product line. It is easier to not get that only if you go to a salon that isn't affiliated with a single hair care brand.",

If not that's okay too as long as your scalp is healthy \n\nAnd most importantly!: get a baby trim every 2 to 3 months to avoid split ends.\n\nFor someone with previously bleached hair I would suggest trying a biotin supplement at over 10,000 mgs a day, which is often twice the suggested dose for actual results. \n\nYou want to have a nice haircut while growing it out and you can absolutely have pretty and long hair that is layered and or has bangs \n\nThis guy's sounds like I would pass on him and his philosophy",

In addition it sounds like you put your hair through a absolute torture series with the chemicals so it might still be thinner on the ends. If your density on the ends isn't as thick as it should be keeping it all one length would infact help it look longer and fuller. However.... the shampoo and conditioner ect. making your hair feel dry should not happen. SLS is not the devil depending on what other ingredients are involved however it is a cheaper and harsher surfactant. If your hair is not reacting well to the product and considering the ingredients, it is probably not the correct products for you. If you haven't used much of it I would see if the salon has a return or exchange policy for products ( some salons do considering amount of usage). Kevin Murphy or Davines or Aveda are amazing wonderful brands that I've seen envoke wonderful improvements to hair, you might check some of those brands out. It seems like this hairdresser has gotten sucked into a product/ brand culture which I've seen happen a lot in the industry ( kinda cult like ). I doubt the stylist is purposely trying to divert you from your goal, but you should find someone who makes you feel comfortable, understood and informed. ( sorry for the novel ) *hairdresser*",

It can be a good thing to use every once in a while to remove product and hard water buildup, especially if you use products with silicones. I use a SLS-free chelating shampoo to remove hard water buildup. I think the best thing you can do to grow your hair long is reduce physical stress on your hair from styling and to get to know ingredients. It takes time and some scientific literacy definitely helps but in the end, it’s worth it. Finding the right balance of moisture and protein in products will help to keep your hair manageable while it grows.\n\nI use to obsess about keeping my hair long and wanted to only use “natural products.” I have fine, porous, low density hair that’s a mix of 2a - 2c textures. I used apple cider vinegar and baking soda to wash for almost 10 years, brushed with a boar bristle brush and applied straight jojoba to the ends daily. It was a mess and didn’t grow at all due to the breakage that I had no idea I was causing. Now I use a variety of products based off their ingredients and my hair is the healthiest it’s ever been. It grows at least 1/2” a month which is pretty common. Different things work for everyone so I’m not gonna say that you should or shouldn’t use specific products based off my own experience but learning ingredients will help you avoid wasting time and money.\n\nThe only universal hair truth I believe in is don’t buy hair care products from Amazon and Ebay.

        "body": "My understanding is that at lower concentrations it's used as an emulsifier or a solvent, not a surfactant. Above 2% is when skin irritation occurs:\n\n>Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), also known as sodium laurilsulfate or sodium dodecyl sulfate, is an anionic surfactant commonly used as an emulsifying cleaning agent in household cleaning products (laundry detergents, spray cleaners, and dishwasher detergents). The concentration of SLS found in consumer products varies by product and manufacturer but typically ranges from 0.01% to 50% in cosmetic products[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651417/#b1-ehi-9-2015-027),[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651417/#b2-ehi-9-2015-027) and 1% to 30% in cleaning products.[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651417/#b3-ehi-9-2015-027),[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651417/#b4-ehi-9-2015-027)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Dermal toxicity studies demonstrate that 24-hour exposure to a 1–2% (w/w) solution of SLS can increase the transepidermal water loss of the stratum corneum – the outer most layer of the skin – and cause mild yet reversible skin inflammation.24,25 Human patch tests (typically a 24-hour exposure) confirm that SLS concentrations >2% are considered irritating to normal skin.2,26,27 Dermal irritation also tends to increase with SLS concentration and the duration of direct contact.2 In reality, dermal exposure to SLS in cleaning products is more likely to last a matter of minutes rather than hours.9\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651417/#:\\~:text=The%20concentration%20of%20SLS%20found,to%2030%25%20in%20cleaning%20products.&text=SLS%20can%20be%20synthetic%20or%20naturally%20derived](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651417/#:~:text=The%20concentration%20of%20SLS%20found,to%2030%25%20in%20cleaning%20products.&text=SLS%20can%20be%20synthetic%20or%20naturally%20derived).\n\nSo I assume the concentration is less than 2% so maybe they get away with \"not a sulfate\" in the sense of it not being at the levels of a skin irritant. I am allergic to sulfates but could still use Cetaphil, which also contains SLS in low concentrations and was told it was used as an emulsifier. It does seem like a weird advertising loophole though...\n\nEdit: I just saw you said SLES, I'll look it up now but it might be the same idea as they're so similar?",

Since other products like Buffy or Coco Loco are causing the same issues, some people were complaining why Lush doesn't change the formula. I want to emphathize that I totally get everyone's dissapointment. I also think that Lush's customer service response some people got is not optimal. But I will try to explain why clogging happens and why changing the formulas of the products isn't as easy as it seems:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe clogged drain ist just because of the Scrubee & Co. ingredients. If you look at Scrubee, it is a pretty natural product. Excpet fragrance, it doesn't contain any synthetic ingredients. The main ingredients are Shea and Cocoa butter. That's what leaves the nourished feeling on the skin. As you know, oils don't dissovle in water, they just melt by the heat and get carried away. That's what's causing the clogging. The oil is floating in hot water, passing through cold metal drains, therefore sticking to the cold metal. To resolve this issue, one would need to add an emulsifier. That's a substance that makes oil and water connect. These can be ingredients such as Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearic Acid or Glyrecyl Stearate. As you can probably guess, these are synthetic ingredients. . Compare Scrubee and the naked body conditioners: They both have Shea and Cocoa butter as their main ingredients. Scrubee is very butter and rich and creates an oily film, while the solid body conditioners create a white, creamy liquid. That's because the body conditioners contain synthetic emulsifiers that help to dissolve the product in water. Adding emulsifiers would fundamentally change Scrubee, Buffy & Co. They would make the products less natural. They would also change the consistency and effect of the products.\n\nSo the fact that they can clog narrow drains like the one's many people in North america have is unfortunately in the \"nature\" of these products. What would be an awesome solution if Lush would make a solid scrub with a base similar to the body conditioners but exfoliants like almond, rice or coconut shells.",

Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

Although in reality, the dimethiconol mostly gets rinsed away too.\n\nIn the conditioner, the ingredients that are having the greatest impact include the Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethiconol/Silsesquioxane Copolymer, and Behentrimonium Chloride.\n\nThese are all ingredients you can find in other formulas. \n\nThe idea that the smoothing performance is unlike anything on the market is debatable. There are likely lots of products that can give you the smoothing effect of these products. However, using a combination of very good formulas (these are), an appealing fragrance, and solid marketing, you can come to believe it is the best you've ever used.

I was reading this 2020 article called “[Are Beauty Brands Intentionally Hiding Their Ingredients?](https://jessicadefino.substack.com/p/are-beauty-brands-intentionally-hiding-their-ingredients-694b38f0f11d?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true)” by Jessica Defino, and she lists some examples of beauty brands who have hidden their ingredients online in the past or still today.\n\nI have also noticed this happen in the “Clean Beauty” space. I find this to be very sketchy and will not support brands who engage in these practices personally. Here are some examples from the article\n\n* **La Prarie:** *“In my opinion, brands who do not display their ingredients are most definitely doing this intentionally”… Sometimes, it’s to protect profits. “If you’re going to spend $300 on a single product, you are more likely to read all the information provided because it’s not an impulse buy,” Parr explains. If said product includes, say, possibly-carcinogenic butylated hydroxytoluene and potentially-hormone-disrupting parabens (as is the case with* [*La Prairie Skin Caviar*](https://www.laprairie.com/default/gift-guide-2019/luxe-cream/95790-01251-94.html?ncr=true&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6Lm-ue_t5QIVA6SzCh11QAO1EAQYASABEgIoNfD_BwE)*, $510, the ingredients of which are not available on La Prairie’s site), consumers may be quicker to ask questions and slower to spend money.*\n* **Beauty Blender:** *“The brand has chosen not to disclose the contents of its* [*Bounce Foundation*](https://beautyblender.com/collections/foundation/products/bounce-1-40-n) *on its site, save to say they’re made with “all of the good” and “none of the bad.” This gives the impression that the products are very nice and safe. In reality, Beautyblender formulates with talc (*[*asbestos*](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/talc) *contamination is a concern, leading many cosmetics corporations to “*[*quietly move away from*](https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/beauty-brands-moving-talc-cancer-lawsuits-mount-200609194041998.html)*” formulating with the ingredient), PEGs (created through ethoxylation, a method that uses ethylene oxide, a known carcinogen, and can result in contamination from 1,4 dioxane, another known carcinogen), and fragrance”* (update: BB appears to now be listing the ingredients for this foundation!) \n\nI also noticed that this sub’s [recent villain](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/1f6whjk/comment/ll3bor8/), **Sahi Cosmetics**, touts a “[Clean Beauty Promise](https://sahicosmetics.com/pages/clean-beauty-promise)” with ingredients that will “NEVER” be in their products. A redditor commented a couple weeks ago that  lots of the products on the Sahi Cosmetics site don’t have ingredients listed, so I used the wayback machine and found that the ingredients *used* to be listed. Many contain ingredients that they say they \"NEVER\" use, which makes me suspect that the ingredients might have been hidden for this reason? Some examples:\n\n* **Carbon Black** appears present in the 'Snatched and Glowing' Eye & Face Kit -- the Precise FeltTip Liner specifically \n* **Aluminum Salts** appear to be present in the Under Eye Creamy Concealer (Aluminum Hydroxide  is an emulsifier and pH adjuster, and can fall into the aluminum salts category. Additionally, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate falls under aluminum salts)\n* **Aluminum Salts** also appear to be present in some of the baked blushes ( Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, and Calcium Sodium Borosilicate all contain aluminum compounds)\n* **SLES** (Sodium Laureth Sulfate) and **Mineral Oil** are present in the Waterproof Mascara (Paraffin is a type of mineral oil; plus Microcrystalline Wax (Cera Microcristallina)).\n* Many of these products contain **Phenoxyethanol** (okay if it’s less than 1%, but the concentration is not listed) and **Titanium Dioxide**, which if in neoparticle form would also be a violation of the clean beauty initiative (but it’s unclear what form it is in). \n* **Talc:** it’s also worth noting that the Baked Blushes, which do not have ingredients currently listed on the website, also contain Talc. I think most of us are aware of the risk of Talc contamination (even if small) when it comes to private labeled goods, and this is an ingredient that many consumers will want to know is in the products or not. \n\nDoes anyone have other examples to share that I can add to my list of brands who appear to have hidden their full ingredients from consumers, or brands claiming to be “Clean” but still using ingredients that are no-nos? Please share if so",

    "body": "**Skin Type:** dry, sensitive, easily dehydrated; not acne-prone\n\n**Climate:** Dry, Northern California weather\n\n**Ingredients that I found out I’m allergic/sensitive to:** lanolin, nickel, triethanolamine, methylisothiazolinone, chemical sunscreen, macadamia nut oil, and snail ☹ (I can’t believe how sensitive my skin is, considering I don’t even have pollen/food allergies that I know of).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI ventured into AB last year due to my very dry and dehydrated face. I’ve always had dry skin but when I moved from SoCal to NorCal last year, my face became more dry, itchy, and flaky especially when the weather got colder. I loved the sun in SoCal and never used sunscreen on my face (I know it’s bad). I also did not care much about my face and only used water or shower gel for cleansing after using make up remover wipes. I also did not use lotion/moisturizers.\n\nIn the past months of trying out products and reading this subreddit, I have learned so much and realized the importance of low pH cleansers, patch testing, moisturizing, etc. Despite dealing with contact dermatitis a couple times and more whiteheads or pimples than before, and having to restart my routine again and again, I am enjoying this trial and error process.\nHere are some mini-reviews of the products I’ve used so far. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Current Products:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Epielle Facial Cleansing tissues** – I have been using this make up remover wipes for years without realizing that it is made in Korea. It works well with removing most of my waterproof eyeliner before I wash my face. The one in white packaging does not contain alcohol and sodium laureth sulfate. It has cucumber extract, green tea extract, and aloe vera extract, but I think that gets washed off anyways. I use it because it is cheap ($1-$1.50) and it is easily available in Big Lots, Grocery Outlet, and online. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Innisfree The Minimum Cleansing Lotion** – This is my current first cleanser. I put it in cotton pads and soak my eyeliner with it. It easily removes the remaining eyeliner residue without making my eyes burn. It leaves an oily feel on my skin, so I use a second cleanser after this. It is great for sensitive and dry skin since it is alcohol and sulfate-free, but it has cetearyl alcohol, which some people are sensitive to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Cow Brand Gyunyu Non-Additive Cleansing Milk** – This cleansing milk is advertised as a make up remover that contains natural palm oil and olive squalene. It is alcohol-free, sulfate-free, and fragrance-free. It is non-foaming and very gentle. It feels “silky” on my skin but does not leave an oily feel. However, it does not easily remove my eyeliner (and that’s why I use make up remover wipes first). This also works as a morning/second cleanser and that’s how I prefer to use it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti-Trouble Cleansing Gel** – I have only been testing this cleanser for 2 weeks and so far, I haven’t noticed any problems from it. I use this as a second cleanser after Innisfree the minimum cleansing lotion. My face does not feel dry or stripped of oil after using this. It does have a strong “pine-like” smell if you are sensitive to fragrances. Is this really discontinued or not?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kikumasamune High Moist Lotion** – This watery toner smells like sake at first but that smell dissipates quickly (I actually like that sake smell). This is my first ferment product and my skin seems to like it. My skin just seems to absorb the product easily. I use 3-5 layers of this depending on how lazy I am. The ceramides in it must have helped my skin recover post contact dermatitis from Rosette ceramide gel and Cosrx snail cream. It was amazing to see my skin change from dry, red, flaky and itchy to smooth, moisturized skin. As you know, it comes in such a huge bottle so you get so much of the product for the price. The pump on the bottle sucks, so I put it on a spray bottle. I use it on my body too and my legs are no longer flaky this winter. I also just started using this on my scalp after washing my hair as suggested by some on this subreddit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Oil-Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap** – I actually suggested this to my boyfriend who has oily skin and hates using spatula for moisturizers. He loved it! I tried it because I did not have another moisturizer after dealing with contact dermatitis. Thankfully, it is gentle and did not cause burning on my dry, dehydrated, red skin. This and the Kikumasamune high moist lotion helped my face recover and my flaking itchy skin is gone. It is also not as light as I thought because it really keeps my skin moisturized for several hours. I’ve only been using this for 2 weeks, so I’m still keeping an eye for possible breakout from cetearyl alcohol (I haven’t used much products with it) but so far so good. Take note that it is not entirely oil-free. It has lemon peel oil and tea tree leaf oil at the end of its ingredient list (most likely in small amounts).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch and Nexcare 3M Acne dressing** – These pimple patches just work so well! I love seeing how it absorbs the pus out of pimples and whiteheads. Cosrx is more expensive than Nexcare 3M but I think they are both very similar and effective.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Beauty Treats face masks** – I got these sheet masks from Daiso for $1.50 each. These masks have no alcohol, parabens, or fragrance and have minimal ingredients. These are soaked with essence, fit well on my face, and very soothing. Honestly, I think there’s not much difference between the different masks of this brand. The ingredients are mostly similar – all of them have hyaluronic acid, arbutin, cucumber extract, green tea extract, aloe vera extract and vitamin E. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**[non-AB] H&B Oils Center 100% unrefined, cold pressed rice bran oil** – I bought this to make sure that I am not going to have a bad skin reaction from rice bran oil since I want to buy the Kuramoto Bijin rice bran oil. So far, I am using this on my scalp and hair after washing my hair. This helps the ends of my hair look silky and less dry.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Products I will not repurchase:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n•\t**Cure Natural Aqua Gel** - My very first AB product purchase since my first visit in Japan. I wanted to see if it really removes dead skin or if it was just a gimmick. Turned out that it was just a waste of money and I finally stopped using it after realizing that it makes my skin dry and itchy afterwards. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Foam** – This was my first AB cleanser without enough research. My face felt so dry and stripped after my first use and I immediately stopped it. I later found out that it is a high pH cleanser. Everyone should definitely avoid this product.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Mizon Water Volume EX first essence** – I bought this without knowing what a first essence really is. It is a watery essence and it feels refreshing when you pat it on your face. It did not really cause me any problems but I stopped using this because I don’t think it was really doing anything for my skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Secret Key Aloe Soothin Moist Toner** – I thought this was going to be a gentle toner since it really felt like water. It did not feel refreshing, soothing, or moisturizing. It was just like tap water. I stopped using this when I started having mild itching every time I used it. I later found out that it contained snail secretion filtrate, which my skin is allergic to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Dear by Enprani Moistfull Booskin** – I am so glad that I did not buy the full size of this toner (which is huge!). It contains so much plant extracts that I don’t even know what my skin reacted to. I only patch tested it for a week but it caused my skin to have red bumps, itching, and whiteheads. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion** – This passed my patch testing but when I used it on my full face after 1 week, my face was the most dehydrated it had ever been. I used this on damp face and layered a moisturizer on it but it gave me whiteheads, dry, flaky, and itchy skin. I’m guessing my dry skin did not like the amount of hyaluronic acid in this. I was very disappointed that it didn’t work for me since a lot of people rave about it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**O Hui Miracle Moisture Skin Softener moist** – This hydrating toner was actually amazing. I found out through this product that my face loves ceramides. It made my skin smooth and bouncy, but it is pricier than other toners with ceramides, highly fragranced (like a strong perfume, which I don’t like), and I found out that denatured alcohol was 3rd on its ingredient list. If you don’t mind its price and fragrance, I think it is a good hydrating toner for dry skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Etude House Moistfull Collagen Emulsion** – This was the first AB moisturizer I bought because it was highly recommended by Sokoglam. It actually made my face moisturized, my face felt smooth and did not have flaking. However, something in this emulsion was causing me multiple whiteheads around my lips and on my chin (possibly hydrogenated vegetable oil, alcohol, or fragrance?). It also smelled too “perfumey” and there are so much more better AB moisturizers that I wanted to try.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**O Hui Miracle Moisture Emulsion** – Something in this product caused my face to feel like it was burning and made my skin flushed whenever I used it. It also left me with dry, itchy skin on the few days I used it. Unfortunately, I cannot find its ingredients anywhere.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Mizon Water Volume EX cream** – This is a blue colored gel moisturizer instead of a “cream” consistency. It was refreshing to use and felt “cool” on my face. It did not provide me with enough hydration though. By mid-day, my face was already dry again and craving for some moisture. I gave it to my boyfriend who has oily face and he liked it as a day moisturizer. It has high alcohol content, so it is probably not good for people with dehydrated skin. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Rosette Ceramide Gel** – This gel felt sticky when I applied it on my face but absorbed after 5-10 minutes. You don’t need to apply a lot of product for your whole face and neck. It initially made my face feel smooth and nicely moisturized. After almost 2 weeks of using this, I thought I already have my HG moisturizer. Then, I noticed that my jaw got itchy. I ignored it, and then my forehead got itchy. The more times I used it, my face got increasingly itchy, but I was in denial that it was the culprit. “My face loves ceramides, so it can’t be this!” Until, I applied it once more and my face got red and itchy just a few minutes after. I developed contact dermatitis possibly from the macadamia nut oil in it. My face was red, flaky, and dehydrated and I was so devastated because this gel has so much ceramides and I love its packaging. YMMV for sure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Advanced Snail 92 All in One cream** – I was hesitant to use snail products because I was worried that I am allergic to it. Despite not knowing if I am allergic to dust mites, I just had a feeling that my skin won’t like snail but everyone raves about snail! So, I bought this and applied it on my right cheek. This is like a thick gel that has a slimy texture. A little amount goes a long way. My face absorbed the product easily too and I was really hoping that this would work for me. After one day, my nose felt very dry and I felt like I’m going to have a cold. I thought it was weird because I spent the past few days at home and was not exposed to anyone who was sick. The next day, I have full on runny nose. Four days later, I still had a runny nose (with clear drainage which is unlike a common cold where you get yellow snot – sorry if this grosses you out) and I had red bumps, redness, and itching on my right cheek after applying cosrx snail cream. I stopped using it immediately and felt relief from Benadryl cream. My “cold” also miraculously disappeared after I stopped using it. Well, looks like no more snail products for me ☹\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Shiseido Senka Aging Care UV sunscreen** - The first day I used it, at the end of the day, my face felt dry and it already gave me red bumps on my cheek, where I don’t usually get pimples. Those red bumps disappeared the next day when I stopped using the sunscreen, so they were not even pimples. This sunscreen actually felt nice to apply on my face though and dried matte, but I honestly won’t try it again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Canmake Mermaid UV gel** – I thought I’d give an alcohol-free sunscreen a try thinking that maybe the high alcohol content in Shiseido Senka sunscreen made me dry and broke me out. This did not feel oily on skin and also dried matte. There was a very slight white cast but not that noticeable on my skin. On day 2 of patch testing it, my cheek had red bumps that did not look like pimples. These bumps also disappeared as soon as I stopped using this. So, I think I might be sensitive to chemical sunscreen. The search for a face sunscreen continues.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Products I look forward to testing:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Matsuyama Hydrating Toner** – It contains 5 types of CERAMIDES! and fermented soybean! I got this from Amazon global japan and I just started patch testing it. It is watery but has a thin slimy feel to it. So far, my left cheek is feeling very smooth without flaking, even without a moisturizer on top of it. I really like its packaging too. It comes in a nice glass bottle that makes it feel more expensive than how much I paid for it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Innisfree Perfect UV protection triple care cream** – This sunscreen only has physical filters. This just arrived so I haven’t tested it on my face yet. Luckily, I work night shifts and rarely go out during the day so I can avoid the sun for now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Hakumai Ferment Milk** – I have only seen good reviews on this emulsion and I just truly hope this works for me. To be honest, I really want this not only because of the sake ferments but also because of the sake bottle packaging.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Lotion** – I read that this is a better sake toner than the Kikumasamune high moist lotion, so I can’t wait to try it.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Rice Bran Oil** – 100% cold pressed rice bran oil from a Japanese brewery. I haven’t used other oils on my face but I read that rice bran oil is an occlusive. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Serum** – I haven’t really tried any other serums but heard good things about this beauty serum. If it will keep my face from getting dry, then I’m all for it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Spa Mask** – I obviously just want to try more rice beauty products right now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Matsuyama Cleansing Gel** – This is a first cleanser with minimal ingredients and contains soy extract and hydrolyzed soy protein. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Muji seaweed shampoo and conditioner** – Well, since I love Japanese products so much, I might as well try a Japanese sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. I will have to drive 1 hour to get to the nearest Muji, but I will definitely get this. ",

    "body": "So let me keep this brief if at all possible. I have been experiencing itching, swelling, discomfort, and this crawling nerve issue in my vulvar region since September. I went to the gyno and she took a sample, lost it, and didn't give a freak about me and trying to make me feel better. At first my symptoms were mimicking a yeast infection, with thick discharge and everything. but once i did the second culture my yeast came back negative. Thinking about how I have had that issue in my past I just concluded that it was cytolytic vaginosis and was careful about my probiotic intake. I did the whole baking soda baths and it seemed to get a little better but it never went away. Then the crawly, creepy, almost vibrating feeling ramped up over the last few months. Pads made it sooo much worse as well. I finally decided to try Evvy - they said I was L. iners dominant and that I needed to increase good bacteria but I was hesitant so I took it slow. I started taking them and increased my good bacteria but I was still having symptoms. I then thought about it sooo hard like why did this just start, I was fine...what happened. I believe for the past few years I have had CV and I didn't know it but it always went away and came back around the week before my period. This wasn't going away!! What the heck could it be?!?!\n\nI realized around the time that this started I switched detergents and was using the huge Costco tub of powder detergent. It has \\*\\*\\*sodium lauryl sulfate\\*\\*\\* which a lot of women are allergic to down there!! It is also in ALL of the free and gentle and clear detergents! They're all a crock - it contains a \"less\" irritating version of SLS called \\*sodium laureth sulfate\\*. And beware of creams for itching, look at the ingredients!!!!! The main ingredient in one my Dr prescribed had SLS in it and made me 10x worse!!\n\nThen I thought okay I will buy a detergent with nothing in it. So I did..and my symptoms definitely improved but not the way I thought. Then I got this crazy idea to look into my vitamins. I started taking Vitex (chasteberry) for acne the same month I switched to Costco...what are the odds...and Vitex causes ITCHY VULVA!!! It was also in my multivitamin!! Everyday I was covering myself with panties that are making me itch and ingesting something to make me worse. I could not believe it. LADIES! All these multivitamins nowadays have \"hormone support\" but that stuff really messes you up if you don't really need hormone support. Be vigilant!!! I stopped all the vitamins, all the detergents, and wear no panties when I can. Even vitamins that I need that have \"added herbs\" or added concoctions of vitamins I avoid bc you dont know what these herbs are capable of. Nevertheless, I say all this to help warn you gals and let you know that since making these changes I feel a lot better, and I hope I can help just 1 person.\n\nJust go back to the basics ladies. Simple detergent, and simple supplements.",

    "body": "Keratosis pilaris (also known as KP) is a common, harmless skin condition where a protein in the skin known as \"keratin\" forms hard plugs within the hair follicle. It is usually referred to as \"goose bumps\" and appears as hard bumps. It is most commonly found on the backs of the arms and thighs, but can appear anywhere on the body, including the face (where it is commonly mistaken for acne).\n\nThe bumps will be very rough, sometimes appearing [completely skin colored](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-geh0uxMLnX4/TqYUVqUIqEI/AAAAAAAAAI8/fGQJQo5xpmw/s1600/keratosis-pilaris+arms.jpg) and other times appearing a [bit red or pink in appearance](http://www.skincare4uonline.com/keratosis_pilaris_up_close.jpg).\n\nThis is best diagnosed by your skin care professional -- the Internet is no substitute for your doctor's medical advice.\n\nHowever, if you have been diagnosed with keratosis pilaris and have struggled to manage it, here are some of the best, at-home ways I've learned how to cope with the condition.\n\n\n**CLEANSE**\n\nThis is actually surprisingly important with KP. On a whim one night, I decided to do some research about SLS-free products, being as SLS toothpaste can irritate the mouth and cause canker sores in some individuals. Since SLS is in near everything we use, I figured, \"Why not KP?\"\n\nSLS, also known as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, or SLES, also known as Sodium Laureth Sulfate, are common sulfates that add the 'suds' to some of your favourite household products -- from common toothpastes, body washes, and shampoo to dish soap, Prell shampoo, and laundry detergent. While there are health concerns over the effects of SLS, this post isn't to discuss that. However, it should be noted that some people are more sensitive to the potentially drying effects of SLS and SLES than others, and experience things such as dry skin and dry mouth (which leads to canker sores). \n\nWhile this evidence is anecdotal, I have noticed a tremendous difference in my skin by switching to SLS-free body washes. My KP has all but disappeared and there is nothing but extremely soft, supple skin where the chicken skin bumps used to reside. Your mileage may vary, but I highly recommend trying it for a couple weeks. \n\nYou may find SLS-free body washes at a health food store like Whole Foods or Trader Joe's. I have not found one yet at the common grocery store.\n\n\n**MOISTURIZE**\n\nWhen shopping for a moisturizer for KP, look for ingredients such as urea, lactic acid, glycolic acid, or salicylic acid. Your experience with each may vary -- while I do well with glycolic acid and urea, other KP sufferers do not notice any difference when using these ingredients. Some favourite products with these ingredients (US bias):\n\n* [Eucerin Intensive Repair](http://www.eucerinus.com/products/repair/eucerin-intensive-repair-very-dry-skin-lotion.html). This lotion is very thick. Some have described it's consistency to that of elmer's glue. It is very thick, goopy even, and can be difficult to spread. To use, apply a generous amount and work it into the skin, utilizing your body's own warmth to make it a more maneagable consistency. Recommended you apply it before bed.\n\n* [CeraVe SA Renewing Skin Lotion](http://www.amazon.com/Cerave-Renewing-Skin-Lotion-Ounce/dp/B0071XPQQ2). Contains vitamin D and SA, which may be helpful for some KP sufferers. \n\n\n* Coconut Oil. Some KP sufferers have found relief in coconut oil. Note that coconut oil should not be used if you have a coconut allergy and should never be used on the face without first spot testing, as it can be very comedogenic. Please be aware that there is only refined coconut oil and VIRGIN coconut oil. There is no such thing as extra virgin coconut oil. \n\n* [Amlactin](http://amlactin.com/) products. Smell a bit \"odd,\" but contain lactic acid. Smooth consistency. Don't recommend applying it to freshly shaved bits, since the lower pH can be irritating. \n\n\n**SOAKING**\n\nWhen I began running, I began soaking regularly in epsom salt baths. A surprising, unexpected bonus was that my KP began to disappear. I'm not sure why this is -- some KP sufferers think it is due to the moisture-rich environment epsom salts promote in the bath tub -- but it definitely diminished significantly. Of course, YMMV, but I felt it was worth noting.\n\nI also recommend against taking scalding hot showers, which can dry out the skin and aggravate any skin condition.\n\n\nHopefully this helps some of you out there. Please let me know if you have any questions, and *please consult with a doctor before diagnosing yourself over WebMD.*",

It wasn't until one fateful day in the grocery store that I ran across \"Vaseline petroleum jelly cream deep moisture creamy formula\". Now, I'm not saying that this is a miracle worker...but it might be. By the time I discovered it, I was 18 and had \"grown out of\" the worst of the KP. It was still noticeable (when the bf would touch my arms he'd wonder why I was so cold in the Summer?! Referring to my \"goose bumps\"). Anyways this cream eradicated what was left of my KP. Presumably, because of the Vaseline? But it melts right in, is crazy moisturizing, no scent AND dirt cheap ($3!). Hope this helps!",

Same ingredients as their regular face wash, just without the fragrance.\n\nAlso tested: The Ordinary Squalane cleanser as this has a stated pH of 5.50-6.50, so gives a better idea of the pH of everything else. https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-squalane-cleanser-50ml\n\n\n- - -\n\n**Foaming**\n\nI wouldn't recommend these as they contain Sodium Laureth Sulfate which can be stripping or drying, but wanted to test the Aldi and Simple reformulations against the old versions and Lidl to show what the acidity is doing. \n\n-\n\nAldi Lacura “moisturising” foaming [old formulation](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8947438252.html)\n\nAldi Lacura “moisturising” foaming [new formulation](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2fd6438253.html) Always 85p from [Aldi](https://www.aldi.co.uk/lacura-moisturising-face-wash/p/055176005044600) —now has the leaping bunny logo on the tube. New formulation is more acidic than the old one and Simple.\n\n\n\nLidl Cien [“moisturising” foaming](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_c86c439285.html) (discontinued?) 85p in Lidl\n\nTesco also has a [foaming version](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/301360723) of their face wash, also £1.50. Didn’t buy or test this one.\n\n- - -\n\n**Misc.**\n\n-\n\nAlso tested some the Nivea non-foaming gel, pricier Superfacialist and cheapo “Beauty Formulas” (99p in Savers) face washes to compare https://imgur.com/a/de0AYyG one Savers wash is really acidic while the other two are neutral/alkaline. Nivea one doesn't have bad ingredients but is a little too neutral (not \"pH balanced\").\n\n-\n\n\nYou can always trust supermarkets and *usually* well known brands (some like Nivea are a little off though not harmful), but I’d steer clear of the weird shit Savers sell, unless it’s something you’ve heard of elsewhere.\n\n\nEdit: more info, fixed stray bracket that was breaking the Waitrose link",

The packaging states \"No sulfates.\" but also lists sodium laureth sulfate as an ingredient.\n\nThe company finally offered this explanation:\n\n>*There was a misprint on the sample package as it should say \"no harmful sulfates\". The sulfates in the formulas are an extremely low amount and are non-harmful!*\n\nPutting aside the definition of the term \"harmful\" and whether not sodium laureth sulfate falls under any definition of that term, I find it questionable that they would knowingly sell mislabeled product without at least a disclaimer about the mislabeling on the webpage where it is sold. I get that formulations change, but this feels lazy at best, deliberately deceptive at worst.\n\nFrom a customer service standpoint, things didn't really get any better from there. I wanted a sample of the current formulation of their Ghost shampoo (which *is* free of sulfates, including sodium laureth) sent to me at no additional charge. I was told that:\n\n>*I completely understand how the sample fails its purpose since it is a different formula, so sorry about this. Unfortunately, we cannot track the exact samples we are giving and if the formulas are the same as the current ones on our website. We completely understand if this solution does not work for you and so sorry for the confusion.*\n\nStill not sure what \"solution\" they're referring to as at that point they hadn't offered me one -- just an explanation. It took an additional 4 emails (out of 8 total) and me clearly stating that I wanted new product or a refund, before they finally just issued me a refund.",

In terms of safety, my understanding is that both products are  safe and both are at risk for the same type of contamination during processing but studies have shown that high concentrations of SLS over time can cause irritation(this may be the \"unsafe\" they're referring to). That said, SLS is largely safe and widely, widely used as a detergent. I've seen companies also say their sodium coco sulfate is \"cleaner\" because it's derived from coconut but SLS can also be derived from coconuts(and palm oil and petroleum) and it's highly dependent upon where the formulators are purchasing their products from and where those distributors are sourcing them.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the company is allowed to write \"free of\" on their packaging but that just goes to show you how the guidelines can be easily blurred. A lot of \"clean\" brands rely on free-of-marketing or faux-actives to make their products look superior to traditional ones or make you think that a certain ingredient is dangerous. That's not to say that you shouldn't use them if you like them, but there is significantly more R&D that goes into products produced by large corporations to avoid lawsuits.",

    "body": "So it was you, SULFATE SURFACTANTS!!\n\nI've had two patches of dyshidrotic eczema on my right palm for... I don't even know how long now, a couple months? And I've been using steroid cream on it for a while (betamethasone dipropionate in the form of Fobancort cream at first, and later Gentriderm cream which is slightly stronger) but every time it got a bit better, it would soon relapse again. It was extremely frustrating and I couldn't figure out the cause... until now.\n\nBoth my toothpaste and my shampoo contain sulfate surfactants in the form of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES). Aside from causing my dyshidrosis to constantly relapse, I'm also suspecting that SLS/SLES caused the dyshidrosis in the first place. I only have two patches of it on my right hand, but none on my left hand or anywhere else. So if it's a contact allergy, it would have to be something that only comes into contact with my right hand. I use both hands to wash my hair, but I only hold my toothbrush in my right hand, and toothpaste gets on it pretty easily. Thus, my right hand is in contact with more SLS/SLES than my left.\n\nI happened to get two sample packets of shampoo while buying stuff from The Face Shop (it's a K-beauty store, but I'm not a fan of most of their products for face - too many fragrances) recently, and noticed that it was free of sulfate surfactants. Instead, it used disodium laureth sulfosuccinate (DLSS), which tl;dr [isn't a sulfate and is very gentle on the skin](\nhttps://slsfree.net/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate/).\n\nI had also started noticing some itching on my right palm after washing my hair, so I decided to try the sulfate-free shampoo for a couple nights to see if it made things better.\n\nIt did. The redness and inflammation has gone down a lot in just two nights without relapsing, when previously it would keep coming back even though I was using steroid cream and Permasol (potassium permanganate solution, prescribed by the doctor to be diluted 1:8 with water and used as a wash, for drying out the blisters) daily.\n\nI also did a bit more experimenting by using another shampoo we have at home, which has ammonium lauryl sulfate and ammonium laureth sulfate instead of SLS and SLES, but my dyshidrotic eczema started itching immediately. (ALS/ALES are supposed to be less irritating than SLS/SLES, but evidently they're still too irritating for me.) \n\nI went out and bought the full sized sulfate-free shampoo, which is the Dr Schwarz Shampoo for Damaged Hair. It's normally priced at $21 (Singapore dollars) here, with the hair treatment conditioner being the same price, but due to a promotion I got both for $30, which is nice. I'm hoping that my dyshidrosis will finally recover without relapsing now that I've gotten rid of sulfates. I'll also be holding my toothbrush in my left hand for the time being... may look for sulfate-free toothpaste in the future as well.\n\nSo yeah, if you've also been playing whodunnit with your skincare / shower ingredients to find the potential cause of a contact allergy... it might be sulfates.",

    "body": "\nBackground: my fair hair is fine, but very dense, prone to dryness and tangles, and slightly wavy (2a, low porosity, for those who follow these things). \n\nI know there’s a lot here, but my perspective is that each one of these tips will give you a tiny boost to your hair growth and prevent breakage (which will eventually need to be cut off and count against your growth). If you do all of them, I think they add up to a big difference.  **Also, first post here so please let me know if I did anything wrong or should make edits!** \n\nLastly, s/o to the natural hair community for providing tons of education online. Turns out a lot of natural hair tips work well for extra long hair too! \n\n1. **Pre-shampoo.** When your hair gets wet, the internal shaft swells up and causes cracks in the cuticle, which = frizz, tangles, breakage. To prevent this, you can saturate your hair with product/oil before you wet it, similar to how blondes may saturate their hair before going in chlorinated pool to prevent turning green. I use olive oil because it’s easy and I buy it anyway, but Jojoba is supposed to be best because it is closest to our natural hair oils and can get into the hair shaft. You can pre-shampoos from Living Proof and Aquis. \n2. **Comb your hair BEFORE you get it wet.** Once hair is in the weakened wet state, it will break much more easily. Never comb wet hair.\n3. **Wash (and wet) your hair as infrequently as possible, and  with sulfate-free shampoo.** Sulfates, specifically sodium laureth sulfate, strip all the oils from your hair. Follow with silicone-free conditioner. If you take hot showers, turn the water down to lukewarm or cold before wetting your hair, and only wet it to wash it (don’t stand under the showerhead soaking your hair). \n4. **Dry hair with a tee shirt or microfiber towel.** These are much softer and gentler on your hair then regular Terry, which can raise the cuticle, which again leads to breakage and tangles. \n5. **Skip heat styling as much as possible.** I know heat styling is necessary for a lot of cute looks, but at least while we’re in quarantine it’s a great opportunity to skip heat styling. If you must heat style, use a heat protectant before you begin. \n6. **Sleep on a satin pillowcase.** No need to buy the expensive pure silk ones. \n7. **About 1x weekly, use a clarifying/scalp exfoliating shampoo** to stimulate your scalp. This helps eliminate any built up from product use and infrequent washes and keep your hair follicles healthy. \n8. **Day to day, try to wear your hair in a ‘protective’ style as much as possible** (especially during quarantine). Women with natural textured hair use this term usually to mean braids and other styles, I’ve interpreted this for my white hair as keeping it in two long braids, or a bubble **pony. The twisting involved in a bun can put strain on here.** \n9. **1x weekly, use Olaplex or another hair mask**. I’m low porosity, so I stay away from proteins and use a hydrating mask. To find out if you’re low porosity or high porosity, simply try floating a strand of hair in water. The more it floats, the lower porosity it is. \n10. **Consider a scalp serum**, or minoxidil (the active in Rogaine) if you have hair loss. In scalp serums, look for ingredients like plant stem cells, peptides, caffeine and rosemary oil. Even if a scalp serum is out of your budget (given many here are buying skincare as well), gently massage your scalp (without nails) for a few minutes each day to bring nutrient-rich blood to the follicles and stimulate growth.  These ingredients help to stimulate follicles and prevent 'miniaturization' -- basically the idea that every time you lose a hair, the next hair grows in a little bit less thick.\n11. **\\[SEE EDITS\\]** **Take biotin**, but only if you’re prepared for hair growth…. everywhere. Again, might be worth it during quarantine to get an extra inch even if it means prickles.\n12. **Get trims every few months**, but be VERY clear to your stylist that you’re actively growing out your hair. \n13. If your hair growth is still very slow, or your hair is dry and coarse persistently, ask your doctor for a blood test for **hypothyroidism**. \n\nHope this helps some people and please let me know if this is an okay post for this space! Hair growth requires a lot of patience, especially if you have slow-growing, difficult hair like me, so chin up!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDITS** Thanks for the awesome comments guys! A few things I learned\n\ni) Biotin definitely seems to cause skin issues for many. I have dry skin and have never had an issue, but there's great info below for anyone acne-prone.\n\nii) For truly curly hair, combing dry hair is a big no! See the comments for more info.\n\niii) ACV rinses are great for shine and detangling! I use white vinegar if my hair is starting to get really matted (cute, I know).",

    "body": "Hey everyone -- there's a lot of detail below, but it's organized as favorite to least favorite. And [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)'s a link to my last post, where I speak to some of the products that I skip mentioning here.\n\n**Product reviews**\n\n* **iS Clinical Active Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is my HG exfoliant. It's the perfect strength for my skin. p50 was perfect before I started using retinoids (although I never tried the lower strengths), but this formula is the perfect formula to purify my oily T-zone while not causing irritation on dry-tending cheeks.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* Either in the AM or PM, every other day (alternating with a retinoid). I use 5 drops on face and neck, applied with my hands on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of common suspects: glycerin, butylene glycol, alcohol denat., phenoxyethanol. None of these are terrible worth going into, although super sensitive folks may have trouble with the alcohol denat.\n      * Arbutin: skin-lightening ingredient that [works differently](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8632348/) than Vit C or licorice, so their effects can be complementary.\n      * Salix Alba (willow) bark extract: natural source of salicylic acid.\n      * Saccharum Officinarum Extract: natural source of glycolic acid.\n      * Bilberry extract: blueberry-like fruit with soothing and anti-aging properties. It's a [strong antioxidant](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vaccinium-myrtillus-fruit-extract.html) due to the anthocyanins in the fruit (which give the skin its dark blue color).\n      * Polyporus Umbellatus Extract: source of kojic acid, which has skin brightening properties. It is also antimicrobial, according to the iS Clinical [website](https://isclinical.com/ingredient/view/index/id/5778).\n      * Menthol: this one is controversial. It's listed as an irritant, and I certainly don't want to dispute that. I also know that menthol is used in a wide variety of formulas (e.g., IcyHot), so I think it's worth trying and maybe backing off if you have trouble. \n* **Tata Harper Superkind Softening Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* It feels like washing your face with floral honey, and it really does calm the skin. A 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 125mL\n   * *How I use it:* Everyday once (try to minimize since it's pricey). In the shower and rinse. Sometimes on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * A powerful suite of emollients (which I'm OK with as an oily-combo skin type since it's a cream cleanser): evening primrose oil, apple seed oil, castor oil, jojoba seed oil, squalane, grape seed oil, and sunflower oil. Note these are all mid-low comedogenicity.\n      * Lactic acid serves as a very gentle exfoliant, although % is not listed.\n      * Olivem 1000, which is a combo of ingredients used to emulsify the formula. However, Olivem 1000 puts the products into a liquid crystal structure, which is supposed to absorb into the skin with increased efficacy. *To look for Olivem 1000 in a product, look for Sorbitan Olivate and Cetearyl Olivate.*\n      * Soothers in this formula are abundant (hence \"Superkind\"): prickly pear, calendula (#1 ingredient), and chamomile are the stars.\n      * Magnolia extract is another ingredient worth mentioning in this formula: it's a popular addition [for Nivea](https://www.nivea.com.au/advice/skin/magnolia-extract) as well. It has antioxidant, antimicrobial, and softening effects.\n      * There are a number of natural surfactants (it is a cleanser after all): decyl glucoside, and shea butter glycerides as the primary ones.\n      * As for all of Tata Harper's products (that I know of): there is fragrance. If you're super sensitive, proceed with caution.\n* **Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix and is loaded with natural goodies in classic Tata fashion. It works well with the resurfacing mask, and is an effective formula for increased shine and deeper subsequent product penetration.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 120mL\n   * *How I use it:* Twice a week, once with the resurfacing mask (see below for details).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix: physical exfoliants include kaolin clay, apricot seed powder, and rice extract. These are quite small and I have found to be pleasant as a compounding abrasive agent. For chemical exfoliants, we have Salix Alba extract and pomegranate enzyme.\n      * Some more under the radar ingredients: Olivem 1000, radish root extract, superoxide dismutase, which is an effective antioxidant for protecting against reactive oxygen species (ROS). \n      * Aloe juice is near the top of the list and is soothing (as we know).\n      * Plenty of other good emollients in this formula as well (sunflower seed oil, olive oil). \n      * Lots of powerful fruit extracts in here, too (classic Tata): elderberry extract, alfalfa, and meadowsweet are the major ones. These are mostly antioxidant and antimicrobial actors in the formula.\n      * There are a few potential irritants in this formula, so maybe try the small size first to see if it agrees with your skin.\n* **Obagi Professional-C Serum 10% 5/5** There are only 5 ingredients in this formula, with AA as one of them. It's a good alternative for me vs. SC CE Ferulic since it's less comedogenic. It will oxidize quickly (as I've heard) so I usually keep this in the fridge. Retro-fitting a pump (vs. dropper) is a good idea, too. It smells good, too. It's $94 for 1oz. I use it after cleansing in the AM.\n* **EltaMD UV Clear Broad Spectrum SPF 46 5/5** Enough has been written about this brand and formula, so I'm not going to dive deep here. That said, it's physical/chemical and broad spectrum, has niacinamide, lactic acid, and is oil-free. It's a great option for sensitive, acne-prone skin. The tint was too obvious for my skin, so I prefer the clear version.\n* **Tata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* If you have very oily skin, I would maybe avoid this formula. There are a number of somewhat comedogenic oils, but it may still be worth a try as comedogenicity is not always 1:1. It's a gorgeous formula and truly unique. My skin is oily-combo, and it works (and smells) like a charm. 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $130 for 1.7 fl oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I absolutely love this moisturizer. I use it everyday during my morning routine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Same idea as the mask. I can't speak to everything in this…you'd have to be a cosmetic botanist to do that…\n      * A number of interesting oils in this formula which tend to not be comedogenic: sandalwood oil, squalane, apple seed oil, evening primrose oil, sea buckthorn oil. Sandalwood oil is high in Ximenynic acid, [which is a potent anti-inflammatory agent](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/Detail/1777/556915/Pure-Australian-Sandalwood-Seed-Oil). Evening primrose has a lot of [antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as well](https://www.byrdie.com/evening-primrose-oil-for-skin-5215964), although it falls in the middle of the comedogenicity rating. Sea Buckthorn oil is also an-\"it\" oil recently. It's also high in antioxidants incl. vit C., regulates sebum production, has antimicrobial properties, and obviously moisturizes ([source](https://www.byrdie.com/sea-buckthorn-oil-5210082)). Since this is a formula for blemish-prone skin, the formula is sebum-conscious. That said, if you have very oily skin, I would test before committing to the full bottle.\n      * Lots of soothing agents in here: Aloe, calendula, lactobacillus ferment, arnica, multiple types of HA, tremella extract (mushroom with outstanding humectant properties).\n      * The antioxidants in this formula are powerful (including the oils mentioned above): borage leaf extract, Tasmanian pepper extract, fermented bamboo, sea fern extract. \n      * As far as anti-acne agents, Zinc + Salix Alba bark extract are the main factors. \n      * There's also Alpha-Glucan oligosaccharide, which is [supposed to be](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/eu/PersonalCare/Detail/2510/74697/BioEcolia) beneficial for the skin microbiome.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Gel:** **5/5**\n   * *Summary:* So this serum is a go-to for me as someone with combination skin that tends toward redness. A 100% RP. 5/5.\n   * *Cost:* $78 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* The serum is something I put up to augment any active I use, and I love it for that reason. It’s hydrating, calming, and smells good, and it ultimately is the most frequently used product in my routine. \n   * *Ingredients:* There are a number of interesting ingredients in this formula: \n      * Olea Europaea Leaf Extract is olive leaf extract, and it’s shown some promise in [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32333467/) study (although it’s a small group, not double blind or randomized, and technically doesn’t meet statistical significance thresholds). That said, PC has [great things to say](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredients/ingredient-olea-europaea-leaf-extract.html). Major benefits are improvement in skin texture, some photoprotection, and antioxidant properties (high in catechin and rutin, both bioflavonoids). \n      * There’s also cucumber fruit extract, which has moisturizing (no surprise, it’s 95% water), antioxidant (some Ascorbic Acid, some flavonoids), and conditioning properties. Cucumber is one of the rare instances of a non-sensitizing fragrance. \n      * This formula also has grapefruit extract and thyme extract — consensus from outside SkinCeuticals seems light to mid on both of these. \n      * The formula has a small amount of Morus Bombycis Root Extract, which is derived from mulberry and has arbutin in it, which as we know is good for skin lightening as it’s a hydroquinone derivative. \n      * There are a few icks in this formula (fragrance, linalool, etc.), but overall I have found it to be very calming and pleasant. \n* **Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass Sleepair Intensive Mask 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a thick, non-comedogenic formula with intense soothing effects. It will likely pill, but it's intended for night use, so that shouldn't be an issue. I prefer this to the SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque. Will RP.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 110mL\n   * *How I use it:* I only use this for irritated skin, which it promptly resolves over night.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * As far as moisturizing factors, this product has over ten humectants: propanediol, glycerin, trehalose being the highest on the ingredient list\n      * There are a smaller number of emollients: only true oil being moringa seed oil, which is far down the ingredient list. Point being: *this product is thick but has not been comedogenic in my experience.*\n      * The real power of this product is in the soothing ingredients it offers: gotu kola (cica) being the featured #1. Gotu Kola contains a number of active compounds, including madecassoside, which has been shown to work as a [wound-healing agent](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18503551/), an [anti-hyperpigmentation agent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6290557/), and a soothing ingredient [potentially effective](https://www.seppic.com/en/clean-moisture-lotion-as40140a) for atopic dermatitis (eczema). There are more soothing agents in this formula—without listing them all, suffice it say that Dr. Jart+'s chemists know what they're doing.\n      * There is also Niacinamide, Curcumin extract, Adenosine, Cacao seed extract, and other antioxidant ingredients for a nourishing blend.\n* **CeraVe SA Cream for Rough and Bumpy Skin 5/5** \n   * Summary: It's a standard (not lux) product which is effective for KP. It works.\n   * Cost:\n   * How I use it: I use it on the body (esp. on the thighs). 2x/day.\n   * Ingredients:\n      * It's a thick formula (lots of ceramides, corn oil, paraffin, mineral oil, cholesterol), but it's interestingly not comedogenic (also because it's indicated for body use vs. face). \n      * In terms of actives, we have lactate, vit E, salicylic acid, niacinamide, and phytosphingosine.\n* **SkinMedica TNS Advanced+ Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* A multi-tasking superformula with growth factors derived from human fibroblasts. It's very expensive, and it's something that I don't think I will repurchase (not because it doesn't work) but because anti-aging isn't my #1 priority. While my skin is young, I'm focused on anti-acne and hyperpigmentation, but for folks who want to improve collagen and elastin production, this is it.\n   * *Cost:* $295 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* After microneedling at home, once or twice a week. \n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * TNS (total nutrient system): this is a medium that is harvested from propagated human fibroblasts. This medium is rich in nutrients and signaling compounds that trigger collagen and elastin production.\n      * Lots of other goodies: peptide complexes such as whey, lactococcus ferment, algae extract, usual suspects for humectants, fruit extracts such as apple and grape, pullulan, lecithin (for creating liposomes which deliver actives deeper into the skin).\n* **SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel: 5/5 — with caution**\n   * *Summary:* This is a strong cleanser and should only be used for folks with oily skin. It has a cooling effect, which is pleasant, but the combination of actives in this is no joke. If you have really congested, clogged pores, I would recommend it. It's cheap enough, and strong enough, that I only need a bit and can use it as a semi-regular purge. It's an RP for me.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 240mL\n   * *How I use it:* I usually only use it in my T-zone, leave it on for no more than 3 minutes and rinse.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Sodium Laureth Sulfate: Chief Bubble Officer. [Less irritating](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12641575/) than Sodium *Lauryl* Sulfate.\n      * Glycolic acid: most researched and effective AHA. We know this sloughs off the top layer of dead skin cells. \n      * Salicylic acid (SA): an HG for acne treatment. Is lipid soluble so it can penetrate more deeply into the sebaceous gland and provide a better decongesting effect. This is in addition to exfoliating properties acting at the skin surface (although inferior to glycolic in that respect).\n      * Capryolyl Salicylic acid (LHA): this is a compound developed by L'Oreal to be a more lipophilic version of SA, providing better penetration. The study is from 2007 and 100% sponsored by L'Oreal but you can read it [here](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(06)03022-2/fulltext) if you're interested. There is some hubbub about pregnancy safety; do your own research on that front if that's applicable to you.\n      * Menthol: provides a nice cooling but can be sensitizing. [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-menthol.html) is pretty adamant against it, but I don't really give it too much stead. They cite pretty old research. I don't think my skin has been sensitized from it. There is [some newer evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8620938/) of it promoting wound healing.\n      * [Sorbitol](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-sorbitol.html): A sugar substitute that acts as a humectant. Interestingly, it can also act as a prebiotic. Certain bacteria on your skin can convert sorbitol into beta-glucan, which calms the skin. Beta-glucan is partially responsible for the calming effect of oats and seaweed\n* **PCA Clearskin Lightweight Moisturizer:** **4/5**\n   * *Summary:* Overall, I find this product to be hydrating and non-offensive. To be honest, I don't know that it surpasses my OG in this category (non-comedogenic moisturizer) which is Neutrogena HydroBoost Water Gel. Although, if you need something more emollient than that, this is a very good option.\n   * *Cost:* $57 for 1.7oz\n   * *How I use it:* This is a good option for night time for those with oily skin. It might be too thick to put under an occlusive sunscreen during the day esp. if you run oily. Otherwise, daytime fine, too.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Ethylhexyl Isononanoate (say that 5 times fast) is the primary emollient here, and to be honest I can’t find much in the way of research on this compound. That said, I really trust PCA because your ingredients must really be top notch if you’re going to have the most bland packaging known to man. Murad and EltaMD also seem to be fans of it, which is a good sign. There are a number of other emollients, preservatives, and viscosity controlling agents which are probably not worth mentioning (they're pretty inert as far as those go). \n      * Borage seed oil has a comedogenicity rating of 2 (out of 5, 5 being instant pimple) and is very high in GLA (gamma linolenic acid) which [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-gamma-linolenic-acid-gla.html) considers to be a \"best\" rating. There is some good consensus that it has skin regulating properties (eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, etc.). \n      * Other calming ingredients: aloe, calendula, cucumber, chamomile (bisabolol). Has glycerin as well (although not too much). \n      * There is retinyl palmitate, which is a bit confusing to me, to be honest. If you're making a moisturizer for oily skin, I don't know why you would include one of the least active forms of vitamin A. \n* **SkinMedica HA5 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I think this is probably a miracle product if you have deep wrinkles. The five different types of HA are going to sit on various levels of the dermis, provide different hydration profiles, and sustain moisture in different ways. For me, as a younger person without deep wrinkles, it's nice but not worth the $ for me right now.\n   * *Cost:* $184 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Usually replaces a proper (?) moisturizer during daytime for me and put sunscreen on over.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * 5 types of HA. I'm not going to go through them, but there is crosslinked (bigger HA, which sits on top of skin cuz there's no way it's penetrating any deeper), hydrolyzed (smaller version but SkinMedica doesn't give the weight so hard to say exactly where it's going to land in the skin), plus the regular HA. I actually see 3 obvious HAs in the ingredients, not 5. Someone help.\n      * Texturizing compounds (HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Cross-p, polymethylsilsesquioxane) which give it a really nice slip feel\n      * Pullulan (mentioned this [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)) but this is the compound that tightens the skin and is used to create the Listerine sheets.\n      * Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape seed), which [PC loves](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vitis-vinifera-grape-seed-extract.html). It's antioxidant containing and many of them at that (resveratrol, anthocyanins, flavonoids, etc.)\n      * Vibrio alginolyticus ferment filtrate: This is actually a pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium, but this is obviously not a live form of it. Hard to find a lot of info on it, but[ it seems like](https://trulux.com.au/products/vibrio-alginolyticus-ferment-filtrate#:~:text=Vibrio%20Alginolyticus%20Ferment%20Filtrate)%20organizes,exopolysaccharide%20synthesized%20by%20kopara%20microorganisms.) it claims to be helpful in epidermal organization. \n      * Porphyridium cruentum extract which is a red algae derivative that has zeaxanthin, which is in the vitamin A family and has photoprotective properties. Jury seems to be out on efficacy.\n      * Moisturizing factors: Serine, Urea, Trehalose. Urea is interesting because it does have a function in rejuvenation (by breaking down a protein called filaggrin which helps organize the keratin in the skin at the top layer). This is thought to free up amino acids in the ECM.\n      * Skin communication ingredients: Whey protein, Plankton extract\n* **Tata Harper Repairative Moisturizer 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's not for me since my skin is oily, but it's a fab product if you're OK with emollients and fragrance (very well harvested and preserved via pump).\n   * *Cost:* \n   * *How I use it:* Since my skin is oily/combo, I don't often use this to be honest. This would be perfect for daily use for dry skin types or those that can get away with a product that gives some more shine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Simply too many to list. Check them out [here](https://incidecoder.com/products/tata-harper-repairative-moisturiser). \n* **SkinMedica TNS Ceramide Treatment Cream: 4/5** Also not going to go super in depth here. TNS is the same as mentioned above, but this formula is a lot cheaper and has a much more emollient feel. I only use it post-procedure. Will RP when I have another procedure (esp. microneedling or Morpheus).\n* **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic: 4/5** Not going to say a whole lot here. But I did figure out that the Vit E in this way causing some closed comedones, so I had to stop using it on the face. Won't be RP for that reason.\n* **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream: 4/5** Want to revise the record and say that I do believe this broke me out a few times on the face. Great for dry areas on the body, eczema, or post-procedure. Not great for face if oily.\n* **SkinCeuticals AGE Eye Complex:** **4/5 since I am 26 and advanced glycation end products probably not a huge issue for me**\n   * *Summary:* I wrote a review of this in my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/), and I don’t think much has changed, although I do think that I can effectively minimize any irritation from this product with applying a small amount. I’ve taken a deeper dive into some of the ingredients. \n   * *How I use it:* Just a little bit below the eyes in the morning\n   * *Cost:* $105 for 15mL\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * First off, like 7/10 first ingredients are about viscosity and skin-feel and that definitely comes through when you apply the product. It’s hard in the jar but slips on the face very nicely. This is also good for ensuring it lasts a long time. \n      * There are also a number of compounds that scatter light such as Nylon-12, reducing the appearance of fine lines. \n      * It also obviously features Pro-Xylane (thanks L’Oreal). I tried to find some independent research on this (and [this](https://www.wcd2019milan-dl.org/abstract-book/documents/late-breaking-abstracts/45-wound-healing/proxylane-a-plant-sugar-derivative-9.pdf) is the closest I could find). Basically L’Oreal claims that it helps restore the ECM (extracellular matrix, which is where collagen, elastin, and many of the other things responsible for skin appearance lie). \n      * We also have Ascorbyl Glucoside (AG) in this formula, which makes sense regarding skin firmness and lightening. Jury is still out on in-vivo skin penetration of AG but it does create a reservoir of Vit C in the skin because it takes time for it to be converted into ascorbic acid (AA). \n      * There is caffeine in this formula as well, which we know is an antioxidant and helps with circulation.\n      * There is some UV protection from titanium dioxide. \n      * There’s also Hesperdin Methyl Chalcone which is derived from citrus and has blood vessel protecting properties. It’s at minimum an antioxidant and at maximum can help reduce dark circles due to its effect on vasculature. \n      * There’s anthocyanins in the form of bilberry extract but it’s far down on the ingredients so who knows how impactful that is. \n      * There are also a number of peptides in this formula which should help contribute to a firming effect. \n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a cult favorite from an iconic brand in the Green Beauty space. \n   * *Cost:* $68 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I use this once a week with the Regenerating Cleanser ([as Tata suggests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfrVxpoG_Nw)), which I use on dry skin and then layer with this mask. Leave on for 5 minutes, rinse, and my face feels great.\n   * *Ingredients:* If I had to write a complete summary of ingredients for all of her products, we'd be here all day & I would hit the word limit. So I'm going for an abridged approach.\n      * The primary active in this product is Salix Alba Bark Extract (willow bark) which is a natural BHA source. \n      * Despite being a resurfacing mask, there are a number of effective soothing complexes in this formula, namely 2 types of aloe. You could argue that Beet Root is a soother as well, although it's primarily a source of antioxidants and functions as a humectant.\n      * There is lactobacillus ferment, which Estee Lauder introduced in 2009 as a DNA repair enzyme and an antioxidant. There's also pomegranate enzyme which is extract using lactobacillus, although this functions more as an exfoliant.\n      * Radish Root Extract, which you'll find in Dr. Barbara Strum products + some (all?) versions of p50. This works both as a preservative in the formula but also as an antimicrobial on the skin.\n      * Kaolin clay — a gentler alternative to Bentonite which work as a mild abrasive and oil-wicking agent.\n      * Note there are a number of irritants in this product, so if you're sensitive to fragrance, be cautious.\n* **Maya Chia The Straight A Gentle Retinol Treatment 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I used this for 2 weeks. For the first week, my skin had a glow like no other. For the second week, I broke out. It's comedogenic for folks with more oily-type skin.\n   * *Cost:* $125 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night, after cleansing and a serum (optional).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of strong emollients which are plant derived and serve double duty as antioxidants as well: Chia seed oil, Rose hip oil, Raspberry seed oil, Buriti oil, Sunflower seed oil, Vitamin E\n      * Encapsulated retinol optimizes the retinol delivery system into the skin, and keeps it fresh for longer\n      * Natural retinol alternatives: Moth bean extract and bakuchiol which promote cell turnover (retinol's main mechanism of action)\n      * Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate (THDA) is a form of vit C which has [shown promise](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrahexyldecyl-ascorbate) but is less proven than straight up AA. \n* **Neocutis Lumiere Firm Eye Cream 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I really like this eye cream and I might RP. I love the pump, and I love the packaging. It does make a difference and my sensitive eyes tolerate it well. I wonder if it has been slightly too thick for my oily skin even though the eyes and cheeks run drier.\n   * *Cost:* $108 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* In eye area (not above) once a day, very small amount gently rubbed in\n   * *Ingredients:* Not going to go into too much detail here: it has caffeine, vit C (as THDA, AA, and ascorbyl palmitate), beech tree bud extract, lecithin, HA, licorice extract for brightening, peptides, growth factors, and chamomile. It's a multi-pronged formula with a lot of promise and gentle but effective actives.\n* **Consonant Hydrextreme 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is an excellent humectant product. It's very simple. I will not be RPing at this time because it's a bit too simple for me + feels like it doesn't go as far as some of the other options in this space.\n   * *Cost:* $112 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* After actives, before moisturizer, with wet hands.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Glycerin: it's probably the least offensive and most popular humectant. You probably already know it :). This is a high concentration formula that is not tacky or sticky.\n      * Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide: this is a plant sugar with emollient properties and is a good source of antioxidants ([source](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-cassia-angustifolia-seed-polysaccharide.html)).\n* **Aveeno Tone and Texture Renewing Night Cream 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's a good product. The PHA exfoliant is not quite strong enough for my KP so I will not be RPing, but it's a good choice if you have more sensitive skin on the body.\n   * *Cost:* $10 for 8oz on Amazon\n   * *How I use it:* On the body, roughly twice a week.\n   * *Ingredients:* I love the way that Aveeno breaks down the ingredients so see [here](https://www.aveeno.com/products/tone-texture-gentle-renewing-night-cream) if you're curious.\n* **Tata Harper Body Revitalizing Oil 3/5** Not going to do a deep dive here. The ingredients are quality, but it's too small of an amount for the price (considering that it goes on the body so you need much more).\n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Body Serum 3/5** Same thing here. It's a fabulous formula but it's way too expensive for how much you'd need to use on the body. The bottle might give you 15 uses on the full body, which is just hard to justify.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque: 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a calming masque and SC claims it decreases your skin surface temperature by something like 5 degrees (ok). It's been sitting almost full in my cabinet for a while — it's nice but won't RP unless it's for post-procedure for something majorly irritating (phenol peel?).\n   * *Cost:* $66 for 60mL\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never lol. Would be great for post procedure.\n   * *Ingredients:* There is not a whole lot of extra detail to add here as compared with the gel described above. There are a few additional ingredients that are worth mentioning: Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester is a dipeptide that has skin calming and fibroblast protecting properties (PC agrees but [here's](https://www.activepeptide.com/product/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester/) the link to buy it raw if you want to experiment yourself yikes).\n* **SkinMedica AHA/BHA Cream 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It is confused about what it is and who it's for. I don't understand why there's so much more bilberry extract than exfoliants. I understand that these can be irritating products, but it feels like SM is putting the cart before the horse here. It should exfoliate first and foremost, and for me, it doesn't. No RP.\n   * *Cost:* $48 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never. It's probably fine to use morning and night, but depends on your face + wear SPF always but esp. in the AM if using AHAs.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of Bilberry extract (2nd ingredient)\n      * Moisturizing/calming: Aloe, Glycerin, Squalane, Chamomile (2 types), B5\n      * Natural AHAs: Sugar Cane Extract, Orange Fruit Extract, Lemon Extract. To me, these are not astringent enough to be effective. Perhaps it's the rest of the moisturizer and emollience of the rest of the formula, but I just don't feel that this sloughs off the dead skin in the way that I want it to.\n      * There's also BHA (Salicylic acid), Vit E, and Vit C (as ascorbyl palmitate). Like I said — confused.\n* **Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay 2/5** Not going to go in depth here. I don't think I'll ever \\*have\\* to RP (since it's huge), but I don't think I would. It's very good for removing sebaceous filaments and pulling oil from the skin. It's a bit strong, but it's a good option if you struggle with oil control.\n* **Avene Eau Thermale 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's just water. \n   * *Cost:* $20\n   * *How I use it:* On my face\n   * *Ingredients:* Mineral water. Be careful — it's pH 7.5. If you put this on immediately after any actives that require a narrow pH range (e.g., AA, AHAs/BHAs), you are going to inactivate them. \n* **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask: 1/5** Not going to go in depth here. Will not RP. It works but so does Aquaphor.\n* **Darphin Intral Inner Youth Serum 1/5**\n   * *Summary:* No change noticed during 2 months of use. Fragrance is a bit sickly-sweet. Will not RP.\n   * *Cost:* $50 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night after an irritating product (retinoid or exfoliant).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Chief function of the serum is soothing: it has panthenol, chamomile, and Alteromonas ferment (which is used across the cosmetics industry as a soothing agent).\n      * There is moisturizing action here, too: glycerin, glycosaminoglycans, castor oil (low comedogenicity). This is obvious from the serum nature of the formula, but it's certain not a moisturizer in and of itself.\n      * Peony extract is one of the chief ingredients and scents. Cannot find anything about the benefits of this.\n\nIn the queue next for me: is Clinical Cleansing Complex, Herbivore's Nova and Bakuchiol, Chebula Serum by True Botanicals, SkinCeuticals Retexturing Activator, Glytone Brightening Cleansing Powder, and UltraCeuticals Vitamin A serum, Vivier V-Stat Scar Gel — any experiences or thoughts are welcome!!",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

This might seem a bit silly, (but I'm trying to educate myself on the issue rather than avoiding products in fear entirely) since shampoo is primarily focused on the scalp does the silicone deposit on it?\n\nAqua/Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Dimethicone, Coco-Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Chloride, Ci 42090/Blue 1, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Mica, Coconut oil, Eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, Steareth-6, Acetic acid, Peg-100 stearate, Peg-45M, Argilla/Magnesium Aluminium Silicate, Trideceth-10, Trideceth-3, Salicylic Acid, Limonene, Fumaric Acid, Menthol, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Salicylate, Linalool, Montmorillonite, Amodimethicone, Kaolin, Fragrance,  Carbomer, citric acid, Bht, Hexylene glycol, Hexyl cinnamal, Glycerin.\n\n\n[I'm well aware a question similar to this has been posted by someone else but I didn't see a satisfactory answer and thus I'm posting this]",

        "body": ">Conventional shampoo technology using anionic surfactants and cationic conditioners results in charge interaction and complexing of he ingredients. Neither shampoo nor conditioner achieves the desired result. The successful solution was to incorporate charge neutral dimethicone conditioning ingredients, suspended as microfine droplets within complex crystal lattices, into anionic surfactant shampoo technology. The same solultion has also been applied to amphoteric surfactant systems. This provides complete cleaning, and hair conditioning fully equal to separate conditioners without the problems of build-up. This was achieved by keeping the dimethicone in suspension throughout the shampoo process. During rinsing, excess water breaks the crystalline lattice and allows deposition of the dimethicone droplets onto the hair. Full cleaning and conditioning are, therefore, achieved in one application. Dimethicone build-up is not encountered as subsequent washes first remove soil and previously deposited dimethicone. Neither do neutral dimethicones show any interactions with sebum. \n\n[(Rushton, Gummer & Flasch, 1994)](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/211278)\n\nOne of the authors is affiliated with Proctor and Gamble.\n\nAs to why it doesn't appear to leave build up, the same article states that \"no significant shift compared to untreated hair was found showing that dimethicone does not build-up on the hair surface with continued washing\" and that \"the level of dimethicone deposited onto virgin hair was found to plateau after 5 washes...and remained constant for in excess of 50 washes.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> since shampoo is primarily focused on the scalp does the silicone deposit on it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure, but I would guess that it might. Silicones are used in skincare though, so I am not sure why that would be a concern:\n\n>The major drawback to pure petrolatum as a moisturizer is its greasiness, which most patients find unaesthetic. This can be minimized by lowering the petrolatum concentration and adding dimethicone, known as an astringent moisturizer,to improve product aesthetics. **Dimethicone is the second most common active agent in moisturizers today** because it too is hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, and nonacnegenic.4 Dimethicone is one of a family of silicones that form the basis of all oil-free moisturizers and facial foundations......Dimethicone can provide many other skin benefits as an active agent besides moisturization. It can function as an emollient, making the skin smooth and soft to the touch by filling in spaces between the desquamating corneocytes.\n\n(emphasis mine)\n\n[(Draelos, 2010)](https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/2010/02000/Active_Agents_in_Common_Skin_Care_Products.38.aspx)",

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nI have accumulated a great deal of different shampoos from various indie companies throughout my time here and I thought it might be helpful to share my thoughts on them!\n\nSince everyone's hair is different, your experiences might differ from mine, so just keep that in mind! For reference, My hair is a little past my shoulders and heavily layered. It is generally limp, fine, and very straight. I find that my hair gets easily weighed down by a lot of products. I dye it red about every 5 weeks with henna and, a few times a year, I will have balayage highlights added in or touched up. My hair gets oily at the roots, in my bangs, and around my face, but the bleached ends become very dry. I wash the bangs and top of my head every day and the full length every 2 to 3 days. I blow dry, straighten, and/or curl my hair several times a week. The water in my house is on the “softer” side.\n\n**[ Cocoa Pink ]**\n\n**Shampink Conditioning Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  A favorite amongst the IMAM community, Shampink (formally Princess Poo) provides gentle cleansing without stripping or drying. The absence of sulfates means that it won’t be as likely to pull dye prematurely out of your hair. I find that this shampoo does not lather very much unless you use a generous amount, but it still cleans well enough. It is highly moisturizing, which unfortunately means that it does not provide me with a lot of lift or volume at the roots; my hair looks a little limp when I use this product, so I have to coax it more with the blow dryer to keep it from falling too flat. I tend to use this shampoo on days when I know I am going to be putting my hair up, braiding it, or doing some sort of up-do where a lot of slip is required. This is also nice to use for washing my bangs every day, as it doesn’t dry them out.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 6 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and clear. Minimal lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $7.50 for 6 oz. ($1.25 per oz.) and $14.00 for 10 oz. ($1.40 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Shampink comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Cereal Killer (fruit loop type scent) and Cake on Mondays (delicious cinnamon almond cake, but beware if you are sensitive to cinnamon).\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Dry hair types, frequent washers, color-treated hair, damaged hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Glucose Carboxylate and Lauryl Glucoside (natural surfactants), Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Lemon Grass Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance, Mica, Phenoxyethanol and Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (Paraben Free Preservation System).\n\n**Squeaky Clarifying Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This is a nice alternative to CP’s Shampink if you have oily or limp hair, but still desire more gentle cleansing than most sulfate-based shampoos. I find that this formula lathers a bit better than its counterpart. It is more clarifying than Shampink, but I still would not consider it a \"clarifying shampoo\" as it is quite moisturizing. I like this when my hair is feeling a little oilier at the roots, I previously used hair spray or a scrunching product, or I got sweaty from working out at the gym.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 4.5 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and light pink in color. Medium lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 4.5 oz. ($1.44 per oz.) and $13.00 for 10 oz. ($1.30 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  Squeaky comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Lychee Rose Macaroons (sweet rose with a hint of coconut).\n\n*I recommend this for:* All hair types, gentle clarifying.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Lauryl Glucoside, Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium, Modified Cornstarch, Fragrance, Mica, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (preservatives).\n\n**[ Savor Soaps ]**\n\n**Creme Fraiche Whipped Soap**\n\n*Overview:*  I have found that a lot of people use Savor’s Whipped Soap in place of shampoo. I find that it lathers very well and clarifies my hair, leaving it feeling light, bouncy, and smooth; however, I experienced a lot of dryness on my scalp and some frizziness on the ends of my hair. Many people have had great success with this and I may end up giving it another try this summer, when my scalp is especially oily. A little bit goes a long way and it is definitely a multi-use product (shampoo, body soap, shaving cream, etc.), so it is a great value! I did find a lot of unblended pieces of what looks like shea butter throughout the mixture, although this is not listed in the ingredients so I'm not sure what it is. Didn’t really bother me as it dissolves in water, but I thought I would note this. The scent lingers for quite a while after it's rinsed out!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 2 oz. and 8 oz. plastic jars with attractive labeling. Soap is thick with a butter-like texture. Interestingly, the sugar scrub soaps had a softer texture. Generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $4.50 for 2 oz. ($2.25 per oz.) and $10.00 for 8 oz. ($1.25 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  There are a variety of scents to choose from, most of which are sweet and fruity, but there are also more masculine options available. I did not find an unscented version of the whipped soap, but you may be able to request it. Generously scented and remains in hair after rinsing. I have this in Honey (perfumey honey floral).\n\n*I recommend this for:* Normal-Oily hair types, thick hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Distilled water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium cocoyl isethionate, Disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate, Sodium chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium edta, Sweet almond oil, Fragrance, Color\n\n**[ Fortune Cookie Soap ]**\n\n**Shampoo Bar**\n\n*Overview:*  I have not had much success with sulfate-free shampoo bars in the past, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well Fortune Cookie’s shampoo bar worked for me! It lathers easily, smells great, and doesn’t leave a weird film on my hair that I sometimes get with other shampoo bars. This product provides gentle cleansing and it is very economical as a little bit goes a very long way. I find the scent to be quite long lasting as well. I use this when traveling as it takes up very little room in my bag.\n\n*Product details:*  Couldn’t find the size dimensions on the website. Bar is square and colored/decorated according to scent. Generous lather. It seems that it will last a long time.\n\n*Cost:*  $8.99 for one bar.\n\n*Scents:*  There are a small handful of scents available and good portion of them change with the seasons. They are mostly sweet, fruity, and fresh scents. I did not see an unscented version. I have this in Oh Hair (peach nectar, grapefruit, sprig of thyme) and it is pleasant and long lasting.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, travel.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Sodium Coco Sulfate, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Kokum Butter, Cosmetic Grade Silicone (Moisturizer), Shea Butter, blend of Palm and Coconut Oils (Saponified), Purified Water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Fragrance and/or Essential Oils, Cosmetic Color\n\n**[ Toadstool Soaps ]**\n\n**Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This shampoo provides superb lather and great cleansing power without leaving my hair parched. It removes any kind of product or oil build-up easily. It is more clarifying than many other indie brands, so I always make sure to follow up with a conditioner. It is fantastic at removing grime, styling products, and skin oil. The foaming power is very impressive considering this is a sulfate-free product. A little bit goes a LONG way. The shampoo leaves my hair super clean, fluffy, and full of volume. The packaging is very basic. The larger bottle size is definitely the way to go as it is the most economical of all of the shampoos I’ve tried.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 3 oz. and 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and clear (type of fragrance may alter color). Very generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 3 oz. ($2.17 per oz.) and $9.75 for 10.5 oz. ($0.93 per oz.) Some of the shampoos containing essential oils are a little more expensive.\n\n*Scents:*  The shampoo comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Most are very generously scented, but more subtle scents are available as well. Also available in unscented. I have this in Milk and Honey (comforting almond milk and honey) and it is one of the more subtle scents.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Oily hair types, limp hair.\n\n*Ingredients:* Distilled Water, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Saponified Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil & is enhanced with 100% Raw Honey and Lemon Juice for a healthy shine, Fragrance Oil & Potassium Sorbate as a preservative. *Note: There is lemon juice in the ingredients, but I do not find that it lightens my hair color at all. I have read on other message boards that this is because when it is \"cooked\" the lightening quality is diminished.*\n\n**Wheat and Oat Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  I love the ingredients in this shampoo! My hair really likes marshmallow root and the slippery elm was a nice surprise (both give a lot of natural “slip” to the hair). This is a great formula that would suit most hair types, particularly if your hair likes protein. Protein can be somewhat drying if it’s used in excess, so keep this in mind when deciding what conditioner to pair it with. Toadstool also has an accompanying rinse-out conditioner that works very well with this, but if you have especially dry hair, you may want something more intense. This shampoo isn’t scented; it has its own natural scent from the ingredients, which pretty much smells lightly of grain. Not unpleasant, but I’ve just become so accustomed to crazy-scented products that it was a little bit of a surprise!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and light yellow. Good lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $10.50 for 10.5 oz. ($1 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Natural scent of wheat.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, protein lovers.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Aloe barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Vegetable Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Avena sativa (Oat) Extract, dl-Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Camellia sinensis (Organic Green Tea) Extract, Urtica dioica (Organic Nettle Leaf) Extract, Stellaria media (Organic Chickweed) Extract, Ulmus fulva (Organic Slippery Elm) Extract, Silybum marianum (Organic Milk Thistle) Extract, Althea officinalis (Organic Marshmallow Root) Extract, Aphanizomenon flos-aqua (Blue Green Algae), Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n**[ Winner ] Toadstool Soap's regular shampoo because of the affordable cost, excellent lather, and availability of scents.**\n\nStay tuned for my review of indie conditioners!\n\nWhat shampoos have you tried? How did you like them? If you would like to share your thoughts, that'd be great! It would also be helpful if you included your hair type so that people with similar hair can decide if that product will (or won't) work for them.",

Give me your thoughts and suggestions!\n\n# Transition: a Small Step to a New Lifestyle\n\nNow that you’ve started your no-poo routine, you’re going to experience what is called transition. This is the period of time in between the point when you slowed or stopped using shampoo and other products and finally stabilize into your customized no-poo routine. Depending on your product history, biology and approach to transition, it can typically last from 2-6 months.\n\nIt is a time of healing, finding a natural balance, and retraining your sebum production to be in sync with that natural balance. This is also often a difficult time because of all the new things you are experiencing and learning. It doesn’t help that your scalp kinda freaks out during this process and might become excessively oily, waxy, smelly, dry, flaky, and could break out a little too.  This will pass as transition does, even if it takes longer than you really want it to, and your scalp and hair will be healthier for it.\n\n## A Natural Kind of Clean\n\nNo-poo isn’t just about learning to wash your hair with just water or your kitchen cupboard, it’s about embracing your bodys’ natural functions and environment. Modern society and advertising has us convinced that horrible things will happen to us if we don’t spend tons of money on their products. If we don’t use antibacterial soap, we will get horribly sick. If we don’t use highly fragranced shampoo, body wash and deodorant we will be rank and offensive. If we don’t use tons of styling products, our hair will be dry and ugly.\n\nSo we destroy our bodys’ natural protections, both the acidic oily lipid barrier and the beneficial symbiotic bacteria, in favor of something that kills everything but the most resilient pathogens, which are then free to multiply because they have nothing left to compete with. Those highly fragranced body products are filled with chemicals and we have very little understanding of how they affect us and our planet, and quite a few people spend their lives battling irritation and sickness because of them. We wash our hair with shampoo, which is too drying, and then try to compensate for that with conditioner, which is filled with things that can only be removed by the shampoo. Then we add even more product with texturizers and styling creams, hair spray, mousse, gel, pomade...all in the attempt to replace what the shampoo stripped away in the first place.\n\nHair that is allowed to be itself is textured, interesting, healthy, easy to manage, and properly moisturized. Getting it there can be a bit of a trial, and part of that trial is modifying your ingrained expectations about what ‘clean’ is and how it feels. Being clean is **not** having dry, chapped, stripped skin that must be soothed by a multitude of creams and products, nor hair that is stripped and beaten into submission with chemicals and coatings.\n\nClean is having a healthy body with its natural protections in place, and hair that is properly supported by those natural protections. Clean is knowing how those protections work, and what to do to support them and maintain your own personal sanitation. Clean is encouraging your symbiotic bacteria and understanding that they fight pathogens for you, that they are not the enemy but your allies. Clean is understanding the purpose of sebum and that it conditions, protects, seals in moisture, learning to love the feeling of it in your hair, and embracing the comfort of knowing it’s doing its job.\n\nSebum is **not** bad or unhealthy, it is the best thing for your skin, scalp and hair. Transition is **not an endurance contest or a race.**  It is a small step towards a more natural, healthy lifestyle. Choosing to embrace transition will help you modify your expectations and make it much easier in the end.  You could look at the excess sebum as a new product you’re trying out and learn to work with it instead of just wishing it away. If you get some on your hands, just rub it in like lotion. Or you could rub it somewhere you’re dry, like your elbows or forearms. You might find that you enjoy the result of having your natural conditioning oil on your hands and body, protecting you from the things you interact with. It is a customized product that is just for you. And best of all: free!\n\nYou might also consider exploring washing your body with only water and experiencing the benefit of a body that is entirely naturally clean, but discussing that in detail is beyond the purpose of this wiki.\n\n## Things That Affect Transition\n\nThe kind of transition you have is dependent on so many variables it’s difficult to know what each individual will experience. We do know that the type of product you’ve been using and the frequency in which you’ve been using it will greatly affect the duration and severity of transition. How hard your water is can also affect it, but only because hard water makes everything no-poo more difficult.\n\nSurfactant cleansers (detergent based shampoos and conditioners) are classified by how stripping and drying they are:\n\n* Dandruff Shampoo: extremely stripping, drying, and harshly exfoliating. It is trying to remove everything that the fungus might feed on and starve it out as well as using medication to kill it. Using it is often a vicious cycle because of its drying and exfoliating properties. When you quit using dandruff shampoo, the scalp often explodes in a cloud of flakes because it is dry and irritated and no longer being exfoliated. This often prompts the user to start using it again, which suppresses the flakes again. Often the only way to quit dandruff shampoo is to accept that flakes will happen while your scalp heals and give it the support and moisture it needs to do so.\n* Sulfate shampoo: defined by the inclusion of sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate. Sulfates are known to be very stripping of oils in the skin and are also irritants that cause dry, damaged skin.\n* Low-poo: defined by the lack of sulfate surfactants, but still containing other surfactants. Because it lacks sulfates, it cannot reliably remove silicones and product buildup caused by liquid plastics. A proper low poo also does not have parabens, water insoluble silicones or drying alcohols in it. Much gentler than sulfate shampoo, but still stripping because of the surfactants.\n* Co-wash: a conditioner that contains no sulfates, parabens, water insoluble silicones or drying alcohols. Classified as low-poo. Still contains surfactants, but also contains moisturizers which reduces the irritation caused by stripping greatly, and so is much gentler than any shampoo.\n\nThe duration between washes also plays a big part in how bad transition will be. If you’ve washed every day, transition will be worse than if you’ve only washed once a week.\n\nHard water turns oils into ‘wax’. This will make your hair stiff, sticky, difficult to brush and comb, and can dry out your hair because the wax coats it and doesn’t let moisture in.\n\nAll of this can allow you to make some intelligent choices about things you can expect and how you want to approach transition. **In the end, however, the best way to handle transition is** **any** **way that gets you through it.** Too many people treat it like that endurance contest that was mentioned earlier, and this often causes them to give up and quit. Don’t worry about how long it will take. Don’t worry about whether doing something will set you back. It all evens out in the end, and if you keep pursuing it, you will get there eventually! It’s better to do what you feel you need to rather than believing you have to just tough it out and then giving up because you can’t.\n\n## How to Handle Transition\n\nIf you’ve been doing something that will make transition more intense, the best way to approach it is slowly and intentionally. A nice low-poo or co-wash can greatly help during the difficult parts of transition by removing the extreme overproduction of oils while your scalp heals from the dryness and irritation of dandruff shampoo or sulfate over-use while still looking and feeling presentable. r/curlyhair has an extensive list of good low-poo and co-wash products that will all be suitable for this. There is also an ingredient checker linked in the sidebar there, and another one at [www.isitcg.com](http://www.isitcg.com/) that can help you find products that aren't on their list.\n\nHere's a broad overview of steps that can ease transition.\n\nIf you haven't been using something that will make your transition more intense, you can step into this list at any point that looks comfortable to you.\n\n* Begin with a clarifying wash, as low-poo cannot reliably remove silicones.\n* Choose not to worry about how long this will take, just take each step when it feels comfortable to do so. Part of no-poo is about learning to listen to what your body needs and taking responsibility for your own individual needs.\n\n1. Wash as often as you need with your new product. Add in moisture treatments, healing herbal drenches and scalp massage if needed to deal with dryness and flakes. If you're quitting dandruff shampoo, there will likely be a time of oiliness and flakes that even the low poo won't help with completely. Submerging your hair and gently swishing it around can be very effective at removing them. You will also need lots of moisture during this time, and gentle scalp massage can help lift the flakes and stimulate healing. This step might take several months, because dandruff shampoo or daily sulfate use are both quite damaging and there could be a lot of healing involved.\n2. Start keeping a cup in the shower and use it to dilute your low-poo. Use only as much as you need to get clean. Products are often far too strong, and that’s part of what makes them so stripping.\n3. Start doing water only washes in place of some low-poo washes to learn and practice your new mechanical cleaning skills. Slowly phase out the use of your low-poo.\n4. If you choose to pursue sebum retraining, start spacing your washes out. Wait until you feel you would normally wash, and then wait another day.\n5. Start always doing water only washes. You might need to wash more frequently when you reach this step, and that’s ok. Wash as often as you like. If you want to pursue alternative washing, this is a good time to start experimenting with that also. Don’t be afraid to use your low-poo to help clean up experiments either. During this step, pay attention to the health of your scalp. If you need to clean it a little more, try gently massaging it under the water, just like you’ll be preening under the water.  But it can be delicate, so be gentle when you do. You might also need to add in some moisture treatments as your scalp heals from the low-poo you’ve been using.\n\n* Address any problems that develop, like dealing with hard water waxiness or needing more moisture in your routine.\n\nThis is a simple, methodical approach that will allow you to ease into no-poo while still feeling clean and looking presentable. There is no need for the discomfort of feeling endlessly disgusting, and struggling through that will only make it more likely that you won't make it through transition at all.\n\nYou also don't ever need to worry about doing something that will ruin your transition, it can't happen. Even if you end up with silicone on your hair and have to do a sulfate wash to remove it, you still won't ruin your transition. You have been healing and re-balancing, that is progress that doesn't disappear with one mistake. The only thing you could do to ruin your progress is to go back to full overuse of damaging products again, and even that would take a while.\n\n## Straight to Water Only\n\nThe quickest approach to transition is cold turkey, where you do a final clarifying wash and then just go straight to water only washing once a week. If you haven’t been doing something that will make your transition more intense, you might choose to try this approach, but don’t feel like you are locked into it.  Remember, **any approach to transition that gets you through it is completely valid.** With this approach, transition typically lasts 2-4 months. This is also the most difficult for a variety of reasons.\n\nMost people are not experienced with mechanical cleaning and are learning a whole new skill set. Most people are used to the ease of using shampoo and are not used to the work that mechanical cleaning requires, so often don't perform it properly or sufficiently. Added on top of those is the fact that transition itself is difficult because your scalp is freaking out, your sebum is weird, oil is pouring down like it will never stop, and you're only 'allowed' to wash once a week.\n\nThe only way to deal with this is excessive dry mechanical cleaning every single day, with lots of quality time spent with your boar bristle brush (and then be sure to clean the brush!) **Even if you do this, you will probably still look oily for 2-3 months.** Washing can help, but it's difficult to remove a weeks' worth of oils, especially for people who are just learning how to perform mechanical cleaning in the shower.\n\nScalp health is key in no-poo, but most especially during this approach. All the oils that your scalp is flushing so that it can heal are sitting on your scalp and in your hair all week and can cause a lot of problems if they aren't dealt with. They can create an environment for fungal, yeast or bacterial infections, and under the right circumstances, hair loss. If you have a huge excess of oils on  your scalp, you absolutely must do the gentle scalp massage frequently to keep them moving.\n\nThis approach can be softened and made significantly easier by water only washing more often than just once a week, especially in the beginning. This allows you to practice your in shower mechanical cleaning and will help remove oils, keep your scalp clean and allow you to be more presentable. There are even reports of people who washed every day during their transition and they say they believe it was easier for them because of it. Adding in alternative washing methods when needed can be helpful also, to break up transition wax, or just to remove large quantities of sebum and allow you to have a break from the super oily hair for a few days. Washing more often will extend the retraining aspect of transition, but will make the early part much easier to deal with.\n\nNo-poo is not a short term project, it’s a long term lifestyle choice. It is not a race to see how fast you can finish transition, the ultimate goal is to make it through transition so that you can enjoy your healthy no-poo hair.\n\n## The Two Pieces of Transition\n\nThere are two main things that happen during the time we call transition. There is the time of healing which is the main part of transition, and there is the intentional retraining of sebum production.\n\n## Flushing and Healing\n\nYou have spent years putting things on your scalp that harshly strips your natural oils away, and then put more things on your hair and scalp to try to compensate for this. These things contain many different chemicals that react with you, your environment, and each other in a vast variety of different ways, often causing irritation at the minimum and sometimes serious damage. They have also unbalanced the natural environment of your scalp and hair in serious ways. All of this needs to be corrected and healed, which takes a while and can cause weird things to happen to your scalp and sebum while it works itself out.\n\nThis is a healing time for your scalp. If you have been seriously sick for many years and finally found a treatment that made you better, you would expect it to take a while to heal. Your scalp has the same needs. We aren't talking weeks here, we are talking **months**.\n\nExpectations are powerful. We are trying to supply you with information that is as accurate as possible, so that you can form your expectations based on that. When you see a video on YouTube saying that they did water only for two weeks and showing how awesome their hair is, it's extremely likely their transition hasn't even gotten started yet. Sometimes it can take up to a month or longer for the weirdness to start. But it sets up expectations that transition isn’t such a big deal, which isn't true at all for the vast majority of people.\n\nThere are also people who try no-poo for 4-6 weeks, and then post how horrible it is and how it doesn’t work because their hair is terrible. Even if they have been performing mechanical cleaning properly (many of them haven’t), they are still in transition, and shouldn’t be expecting anything different. But it is probable that they turn a lot of people who were interested in no-poo away from trying it, because ‘it didn’t work for that YouTuber so it’s a scam’.\n\nSome potential milestones during transition, especially if going straight to water only:\n\nAfter the first few washes when your sebum is starting to become weird, you will probably encounter the waxy stage. This is where your hair is stiff, sticky, tangles easily, is difficult to comb or brush and leaves white or grey sticky residue on your tools. This also happens if you have hard water, because it turns oils into ‘wax’. A warm applesauce mask applied for about 30 minutes and then combed out under the shower water can help lift the waxiness. You may have to apply it several times to fully lift the wax. Brushing excessively over the course of several days will also lift it.\n\nThe super oily stage is almost universal, where your hair is saturated with sebum and looks wet and limp and everyone must think you’re a grease monster, but it’s surprisingly soft and easy to comb or brush. Keeping the oil moving with preening and brushing is important so that it doesn’t build up and smell.\n\nYou might encounter the “my wash method is making me lose all my hair” stage where you learn how much hair you actually shed every day but have never noticed.  Shedding about 100 hairs a day is normal, but when you’re using shampoo they usually drift away during the day.  When you go no-poo and your hair is oily, they stick together instead and only come out during a brushing or washing session, so you see them all at once.\n\nAfter a while of trying no-poo and dealing with the overproduction of sebum for weeks on end, you might reach the point where you want to quit because you feel it’s never going to get better, and you’re going to need encouragement to push through.  Find a friend or come post on r/nopoo and share your frustrations, the community is very supportive and encouraging!\n\n## Retraining Sebum Production\n\nOften people have been stripping their hair and scalp with harsh chemicals every day for years. Your scalp compensates by producing a large quantity of sebum, attempting to do its job of protecting and conditioning your hair. It has been trained that this over production needs to happen because of the daily stripping, and so needs to be retrained that it's not going to be harshly stripped any more and can start producing a more balanced amount of sebum. This is done by delaying washes that remove sebum from the scalp in any way, including dry shampoo, allowing your natural biofeedback to realize that there is plenty of sebum on your scalp and eventually it will stop producing so much.\n\nIf you choose to be less intentional about retraining, there are some reports that sebum production will eventually reduce even if you wash with a no-poo method every day. It will just happen at its own pace instead of being encouraged to happen more quickly.",

It's a bit more complicated than just identifying one ingredient.  But ultimately, water itself will make your hair fade more than most shampoos, so the best way to minimize color fading while washing the hair is to minimize the number of rinses.  This could be done by using a moisturizing shampoo or co-wash, and then skipping the rinse-out conditioner and only using a leave-in.  Decreasing the frequency of washing will help as well, but that might lead to more scalp issues, so keep an eye on that if you're prone to dandruff or other scalp issues.\n\nAlso keep in mind that UV rays from the sun are also quite damaging and contribute to color fading, so protect the hair from sunlight as well.",

It is a work in progress. Please feel free to post corrections and additional information so we can have a resource that is beneficial and helpful to those who need it!\n\n**The biggest recommendation: Shower Filter**\n\nIf you're having skin problems, perhaps one of the best and easiest things you can do is get a shower head filter.  They are relatively inexpensive and are threaded to attach to your existing shower plumbing, so will fit almost anywhere. A decent filter will remove many contaminants that your skin is reacting to like heavy metals, silt and other particulates, other chemicals and residues. Chlorine is great for delivering clean water to populations, but not so awesome for skin. It is drying and irritating and often removing it can have dramatic effects if you are struggling with chronically unhappy skin.\n\n## Flakes and Scalp Conditions\n\nFirst off, none of us here are doctors, so if you have a serious condition and nothing here helps, then you need to go see one and get some professional help.\n\nOur bodies are amazing ecosystems that have functions in place to keep us healthy. One of them is the acidic lipid barrier (oily sebum) that our skin produces. The mild acidity of healthy skin that is coated in sebum helps kill pathogens and support an environment for our symbiotic microflora to thrive and out compete the pathogens that can survive. When that sebum is chronically removed by harsh detergents, problems start to arise. Our symbiotic microflora dies off and the only thing that can survive is the unwanted pathogens. Our skin has lost its protection that helps seal in moisture and can dry out, causing damage like cracks and dead layers of cells that couldn't survive the dry environment. It doesn't help that the 2 most common types of detergent surfactants in body products, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) are known skin irritants and only exacerbate the damage the dryness is already causing.  All of this can accumulate and cause skin to become dry, chapped, cracked and even get so bad that bleeding and infection occur.\n\nManufacturers know this and try to mitigate it by adding in moisturizers like aloe and glycerine and sealers like oils and silicone, but the cause of the damage never goes away. Shampoo also dissolves and suppresses the flakes that are dry, dead skin cells.\n\n## Small white flakes, like snow = dry scalp/skin\n\nThe result of all of this is that flaky dry scalp are quite common when beginning natural no-poo.  The shampoo that suppresses the damage that is already there is no longer being used, and it finally is able to be expressed. The good news is that it will be temporary until the scalp heals.\n\nRemoving the causes of the dryness is the first priority. If you are no longer using product, that's a great first step.  Even choosing to use a low-poo or a conditioner meant for co-washing will help the irritation caused by the harsh sulfates heal.\n\nGentle scalp massage for 5-30 minutes every day will help warm and stimulate circulation in your scalp, allowing more nourishing blood to the damaged skin so that it can heal. Use the pads of your fingers in back and forth motions all over your scalp. Try not to use circular motions as that can tangle and pull hair out.\n\nHot water is very drying. It opens all your pores and the moisture and sebum stored in them are rinsed away, leaving the skin dry and without it's protective oil until more can be produced. It is better to use warm or cool water when you are trying to heal dry skin.\n\nMoisture treatments will help the skin heal by finally giving it the moisture it needs. There are many, many natural options that can help moisturize both skin and hair. Do some research and experimentation to find one that works well for your situation. Here is a thread with lots of information on various moisture treatments.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/mtp0wc/tell\\_me\\_aboutmoisturizing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/mtp0wc/tell_me_aboutmoisturizing/)\n\nHere are some popular options that help a lot of people.\n\nAloe - juice from the digestive aid section of a pharmacy with 3 ingredients or less or store bought gel that has no drying alcohols or gel directly from the plant. To prepare fresh aloe juice, cut the leaf off the plant as close to the body of the plant that you can. Set the leaf cut side down in a container for a while to allow it to drain. Discard the drained liquid and rinse the leaf off. Slice it open and scoop the insides into a blender. Add enough water to blend smoothly, and then blend until smooth. Strain the solids out and refrigerate. Use within 3-4 days, or freeze in portions and use as needed.\n\nCoconut water - the liquid that is inside a coconut. It can often be found with sports drinks, or bottled water. Use the kind that is a single ingredient with nothing added.\n\nCoconut milk - canned, single ingredient, fat removed or homemade. Take fresh or dried, unsweetened coconut flakes and put 1 cup into a blender. Add 3-4 cups hot but not boiling water and blend until creamy. Strain out the solids and refrigerate. Remove the fat that has solidified on the top and use the milk within 3-4 days or freeze in portions and use as needed.\n\nHoney - 1 teaspoon (5 ml) in 1 cup water (250 ml). Wet your hair and pour the honey mixture in sections over your scalp, catching it and massaging it into each section. Once it is all applied, gently massage all over your scalp in back and forth motions. Circular motions can catch and pull hair. Allow to sit for 5-10 minutes, then rinse out. Honey is a humectant, meaning it draws moisture to itself. If the air is dry, it will draw moisture out from the lower layers of your skin, so it should always be used with water to give it moisture to bind to. Not every type of hair likes honey, and not every type of honey is good for hair. Raw unfiltered honey can have unfiltered beeswax still in it and it can leave an odd, not quite greasy coating on the hair. If honey is doing this to you, try a different kind. If it persists, your hair just might not like it.\n\nMoisture Treatment for hair and scalp:\n\nDilute aloe juice or coconut water by half, apply til dripping (I use a spray bottle), gently massage into scalp for a few minutes, scrunch into your hair if you have enough hair to do so, then wrap in a towel for at least an hour before rinsing it out. Do this as often as you like. If you have low porosity hair or very dry hair, gentle heat can help this absorb better. Throw a heavy towel in the dryer before you apply the treatment, then use it to wrap your head and hair. If it starts cooling, heat another towel and swap them out. There are also various heated caps available that can be more convenient.\n\nHerbal infusions can also help soothe and heal your scalp. There is a list of herbs that are good for hair here.\n\n[https://www.chagrinvalleysoapandsalve.com/blog/posts/herbs-for-hair-care/](https://www.chagrinvalleysoapandsalve.com/blog/posts/herbs-for-hair-care/)\n\nYou can read the list and see what might be helpful for your situation. Rosemary and/or Lavender are always good choices for soothing and healing infusions. Marshmallow root is also moisturizing and soothing. A guide for making infusions is below.\n\n## Larger, yellowish flakes, usually accompanied with other symptoms = Fungal infection/dandruff\n\nIf you have larger, yellowish flakes, you probably have a fungal infection. No-poo does have treatments for this that can be very effective, or you can use main stream treatments and return to no-poo once the issue has cleared up. Refer to the section of the guide on transition to understand how this might affect your scalp and issues it might cause.\n\nApple Cider Vinegar, organic with the mother (ACV, Apple Vinegar) - When using vinegar for mitigating the effects of hard water or as an acidic rinse after an alkaline wash, any type will work. When needing it for medicinal purposes, live unfiltered ACV is far more effective. It is a good anti-fungal and can help treat many skin conditions. For fungal infections start with a standard 1:16 dilution which is 1 tablespoon (15 ml) in 1 cup water (250 ml). Apply it as a leave on treatment at the end of your wash, gently massage it in and allow it to dry. If it doesn’t seem to be soothing or helping, slowly increase the concentration up to a 1:1 dilution. The stronger it is, the more potential for damage to your hair, but a healthy scalp can regrow healthy hair.\n\nThere are also some effective herbal treatments. Black Walnut, Calendula and Cloves are all strong anti-fungal herbs. Cloves can be irritating though, so use with awareness. You can make an infusion with them and use it to either dilute your ACV or by itself. A guide for making infusions is below.\n\n## Eczema, Psoriasis, Seborrheic Dermatitis, etc\n\nThere are many people who want to try no-poo to see if it will help their chronic skin conditions, and many people have found relief. There are others who unfortunately haven’t. But those who found relief have given reports of things that have helped them. Here are a few of the most common.\n\nRaw, unfiltered, living vinegar is very effective at helping skin condition breakouts. This vinegar can be in a variety of forms, but Apple Cider Vinegar, Organic with the Mother is the most readily available. Other people use kombucha vinegar from brewing their own kombucha or coconut vinegar, or wine vinegar, but it must be living. It can be applied undiluted to skin, but should be diluted for use on hair if you are trying to not damage it. The standard dilution is 1 tablespoon (15ml) in 1 cup water (250ml). You can slowly increase it up to a 1:1 ratio, but understand that the stronger it is, the greater risk of damaging your hair, but a healthy scalp can regrow healthy hair.\n\nPeople find high mineral salt rinses to be effective at treating breakouts also, especially SD. Salt like Himalayan, Dead Sea, high mineral sea salt like Redmonds are all reported to be extremely good at helping to heal breakouts in a short amount of time. Start with 1 teaspoon (5ml) in 1 cup (250ml) water and increase gradually until you find a concentration that helps. Be aware that salt is drying, so you might need to do some moisturizing after treatment is finished.\n\nThere are a very few companies that are producing skin probiotics that aren’t gimmicks. Mother Dirt is the main one, and there are a few others whose products can be found occasionally. Mother Dirt’s parent company is using the proceeds from their AO+ Mist and other products to fund real scientific research into using these types of microflora to treat eczema specifically, with plans to branch out into other conditions later. Many people have reported extremely favorable results from using AO+ Mist on their skin. There are also reviews on Amazon for the other skin probiotic sprays that report excellent results.\n\n## Herbal Infusions\n\nInfusions are different than teas. They are stronger and take longer to make. The process also allows a greater spectrum of the nutrients in the plant to be transferred to the water, including the essential oils inherent in it. It is a mostly cold process so that the delicate nutrients won’t be destroyed by heat.\n\nIt doesn’t require a large amount of herbs to make an infusion. A total volume of a tablespoon (15 ml)or two of dried herbs will make a nice strong infusion. Put the dried herbs into a pot with a lid or a jar with a lid. Stainless steel or glass is preferred as herbs can react with things and those are mostly non-reactive. Add 2 cups (500ml) of water to the pot and bring to a boil then immediately turn off the heat, or pour boiling water into the jar. Put the lid on whichever you used, then allow to sit for 8-12 hours at room temperature. Strain and use either to dilute other treatments or by itself either as a treatment or as a leave on finishing rinse. If you don’t use it immediately, it can be refrigerated for several days.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFeel free to post comments, questions or clarifications.

So here I am trying to give back something. Thank you to everyone who posts here!\n\nSkin details: oily/combo skin, bengaluru, teenage\n\nHair details: 2a/2b/2c (mostly 2b), dry scalp in winters, wavy, low porosity I think, kinda virgin (except the times I hair-dried my hair like twice in an year or when until half an year ago I would occasionally fail to regulate the shower heat properly and put really hot water on my hair lol)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Cleansing oil:**\n\n***Johnson’s Baby Oil*** (not in pic coz in the bathroom):\n\n*Usage Period: past few weeks on and off*\n\nNon-emulsifying fragranced mineral oil. I wanted to oil cleanse since my skin felt congested and this was the cheapest option; I got 50ml for 62rs. Fragrance did not irritate me (smell wise wasn’t irritating too). Idk how it works on removing stuff since I am not using sunscreen yet. Skin felt soft and clearer after using. Wiped with a tissue before moving on to cleanser.\n\nNo issues/5. WRP\n\n**Cleanser:**\n\n***Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash*** (not in pic coz I do not have it anymore):\n\n*Usage Period: 2 years until a few months ago*\n\nUsed a long time ago. Helped me alot initially when I was trying to fix my skin (this is obviously better than using body wash/soap).\n\n2.5/5 since I noticed my pimples decreased when I switched to the next cleanser on the list. WNRP\n\n***Simple Refreshing Facial Wash*** (have my backup bottle in the pic; one I am using right now is in the bathroom):\n\n*Usage Period: an year i think*\n\nA GAME CHANGER in my routine. I used to switch b/w creams and serums wondering where I was going wrong, but ignored the cleansing part. Acne-proneness reduced significantly once I started using it. Never leaves skin stripped even in summer. Affordable. Removes sweat and dirt well. It's all you could ask from a cleanser.\n\nHG\n\n**Toner:**\n\n***TONYMOLY WONDER Ceramide Mochi Toner:***\n\n*Usage Period: Past few weeks regularly*\n\nYes I did buy this during the recent nykaa sale. I was looking for toners within budget but seeing u got to pay 300-500 rs for 100-150 ml, I decided to buy this based on reviews. I just wish I had read the ingredient list before, coz it has macadamia oil (trying to avoid oils since my skin gets oily). I honestly dk what to feel about this toner. It cannot be used on its own for sure, since my skin starts making more oil. Layered with other products however, it does a nice job, in fact it made my skin SUPER SOFT so ig it satisfies what it claims to do. It gives that dewy look to skin (which could get oily but tbh I am bad at figuring out the difference). But for the quantity and ingredients you get (excluding the macadamia, rosewood, lemon peel oils and added fragrance like limonene and all), it is a really nice toner. If you use only one layer (don't try layering it unless u have really dry skin coz it gets sticky, no 7skin technique with this one which is a shame considering the quantity), then it is pretty nice. Using both in the AM and PM. No breakouts caused. Secure packaging.\n\n3.75/5, Maybe Repurchase (another toner from the same WONDER range might suit oily skin ppl more) (i think ill buy smthn else totally next time) (pls drop reccs for economic toners)\n\n**Serum:**\n\n***DermaCo 2% Salicylic Acid Serum*** (not in pic coz empty in the bin):\n\n*Usage Period: An year or two on and off*\n\nFirst serum I ever used. Really helped me decrease my pimples, but considering I used it with a body moisturizer (vaseline ice cream) or no moisturizer at all back then, that too inconsistently, I do not think it was able to do its job properly hehe. Lightweight. The earlier dropper sucked but the second one was pretty good. Emptied 2 bottles. Has a weird smell at first which fades away after a couple weeks (my suggestion: do not put it directly under ur nose (moustache area) during that period).\n\n3.5/5 WRP\n\n***Pilgrim Oil Control Salicylic acid and Niacinamide Serum:***\n\n*Usage Period: Since a few months ago on and off, regularly for the past few weeks*\n\nI bought this when dermaco ran out and this was on sale (despite the gimmicky k-beauty marketing, but now I realize it is just their company's theme to focus on different locations for different lines). 4% niacinamide and 2% salicylic acid in this one. It does help soothe pimples and prevent them, but this is wayy more oily and tacky than the dermaco one. Dermaco had just witch hazel while this has green tea, neem, willow bark, aloe vera, tea tree, etc. in the formulation, which must explain the oiliness, but no problem using it in the PM. Other than that pretty good serum. This has a herbal scent which does not go away with time; idk what tea tree oil smells like but I imagine it to be like this, but it is not a very bad smell (imo). Normal dropper packaging.\n\n3.51/5 WRP\n\n**Aloe Vera Gel** (putting this here coz now I use aloe vera gel at the essence stage):\n\n***Patanjali Aloe Vera Gel:***\n\n*Usage Period: once*\n\nBought this in a hurry for 60rs coz I had just waxed and the local aloe vera gel (colored and fragranced but didn’t irritate but idk which brand) I had used last time which was lying around in the house had expired. You would use aloe vera gel for soothing irritated areas, but I put this heavily colored and fragranced sh1t on my body and face AND IT BURNED. So no. ABSOLUTELY NEVER AGAIN (it is half empty coz I ended up using some for a hair experiment and idk how it went)\n\n0/5 HOLY FAIL\n\n***Innisfree Aloe Revital Soothing Gel:***\n\n*Usage Period: Regularly for the past few weeks*\n\nGot this for B1G1 at rs475 during nykaa pink summer sale (steal imo). Colorless clear gel. Has a faint chemical smell which is not even noticeable unless u try really hard (common in non-fragranced products methinks). Some ppl on the internet say it has very little aloe in it, while I read somewhere that Innisfree confirmed to a customer that ingredient lists work differently in Korea than in other parts of the world and their gel has got 93% aloe, but idk. Really soothing. I was using it at the essence stage simply coz heyy I have 600ml of aloe vera gel might as well use it, but this morning I had what i call reyHasIrritatedSkinForNoRealReasonOnlyInMornings without even putting a single product on my skin and even after my usual moisturizer, something that was pretty common for me in the daytime (hormones? Hard water? No sunscreen? The possible reasons are plenty), but this gel is really helpful for it. It feels like it does not do anything but I cant got without it now. Obviously cannot be used as a standalone moisturizer. Will use it the next time I get a wax, if I have not come back here to update just assume that it worked really well. No complaints. Easily spreadable. Tube came sealed, small nozzle which is really convenient and I get only the amount of the product I need.\n\n4.75/5 WRP/HG\n\n**Moisturizer:**\n\n***Dr. Sheth’s Ceramide and Vitamin C oil free moisturizer:***\n\n*Usage Period: few months on and off*\n\nFirst moisturizer I bought a couple of months back instead of just using whatever random cream my mom bought. 50g for 300 something rs (it is 327 right now on amazon and i think 279 on flipkart). Usual tube packaging. Ashwagandha smell (coz it has ashwagandha). And it has to be one of the best moisturizers. EVER. It just sank into my skin, didn't feel like anything was on, but really moisturized very well, I could tell my skin did not like going without it. Later with the ceramide mochi toner ISTG THE SOFTNESS? It has 1% vitc. I think my face glowed a little bit (or was it just finally getting into a consistent routine?) Did sometimes feel like it made my skin too stuffy/moisturized tho (it says it has coconut alkanes, which ik is not the same as coconut oil so it is not comedogenic, but idk). Did not break me out. I finished the tube, and I have never finished any moisturizer in my life. Highly recommend as long as ur not sensitive to any of the ingredients.\n\n4.5/5 WRP\n\n***Dot and Key Cica and Niacinamide oil free moisturizer:***\n\n*Usage Period: twice yesterday (am and pm)*\n\nGot the 50g tube delivered this morning and used it. 5% niacinamide and centella in this one. I bought htis coz i thought i did not need vitc and niacinamide better targets my skin concerns. 5% niacinamide serums are pricey (10% is too strong i fear even if i wanna try the 15ml 300smthn rs plum one), and I wanted to get smthn centella (my toner has it but still) so i bought this one, seeing it had really similar ingredients (same ceramides and all) to the dr.sheth’s one, and is literally almost the same price for 50ml. Ik i have not used this long enough, just once, but I can tell you it is REALLY STICKY. So sticky I put a tissue paper on my cheek and it STUCK. It also smells like glue/paint/i dont remember what but it is really familiar. It formed this film on my skin which was light and subtle and did not look bad, but it did not sink in like the dr.sheth’s one (have they increased my standards?). I looked at the ingredients and thought it must be the dimethicone, but even dr.sheth’s has dimethicone. I am not an ingredient/chemistry person (not even a science student lol), but the whatever makes a moisturizer sticky or layery/ silicones are really siliconing in this one. Kinda soothing to wear (not soothing enough to calm down my morning irritation, I needed to use innisfree aloe for that). Feels like it's pulling my face taut. But now I gotta finish this before buying another product. It does not seem like it is breaking me out or clogging my pores \\*yet\\*, but if it does not, ill just use it till it gets over.\n\nHave not used enough to rate, but first impression 2.0/5\n\nOKAY here is my 2nd impression; it is not that bad. I just realised I was using it the same way I used the dr.sheth’s moisturizer, which is cream/gel like and is easily spreadable. This is also cream/gel like but more solid? I read the instructions and it asked to be dotted and then spread in upward motions. I ended up doing it and realised maybe I am also using more quantity, so I swiped some off. And it worked pretty well (and is not that sticky)! Still doesn't leave a silky smooth finish like the dr sheth’s one, but I think this is decent. I woke up this morning and usually every morning if I do not cleanse my face within 30 mins to 1 hour of waking up it would feel really irritated as though it were saying “gEt ThIs GuNk OfF mE”, but it did not feel like that today! I’ll take that as a win. Second impression 3.25/5\n\nEDIT: 3rd impression: No. I was just trying to gaslight myself into thinking it is okay it makes skin look really oily. Will use it till it gets over as long as I am not going out anywhere. 2.5/5\n\n***NIVEA Soft*** (no pic coz with mom):\n\n*Usage Period: very rarely here and there*\n\nThis is my mom’s absolute HG moisturizer. Back when I was younger and had parched dry absolutely-not-taken-care-of skin in the winter, she suggested it to me too. So I put it on but it had a really burning sensation. My mom said it was probably coz of extreme dryness, and that had made sense coz I would feel the same sensation on my dryy legs when I put a different lotion. Fast forward a couple years and when dr.sheth’s got over and I was still deciding which moisturizer to buy next, I took some of this for a night. And it still BURNED! After a layer of toner, serum, and aloe vera gel! I had been pretty diligent with moisturizing so WHY? Then I checked the ingredients list and found \\*drumroll\\* *alcohol.* So ig my skin does not like alcohol. You might like it if it suits you. I can finally stop dreaming about someday getting one of those lightweight japanese alcohol sunscreens like skin aqua or nivea super water gel (I am happy for my wallet but sad in general). On top of that it became quite oily like I had literally put oil on my skin (it does have jojoba oil).\n\nI do not think I am eligible to rate this/5.\n\n**Lip balms:**\n\n***SUGAR lip balm*** (05 Irish Coffee):\n\n*Usage Period: Past few months regularly*\n\nMy mom gave this to me since she did not really use it and ig it is okay. Obviously better than nothing on lips at all. Using this right now. Convenient typical twist lip balm packaging. No color. 3/5.\n\n***Himalaya Cocoa butter lip balm***(not in pic coz i chucked it):\n\n*Usage Period: Almost 6 months*\n\nThis is just outright bad, sits on ur lips and does nothing. No color. 1/5. WNRP\n\n***McCaffiene Coffee Lip Balm*** (not in pic coz it is with my mom):\n\n*Usage Period: once*\n\nI used it only once coz this one is also my mom’s and it healed my lips and made them so soft? I was really surprised. I think it is pricey tho for the amount u get (but lip balms in general are pretty pricey)Still tryna steal it from her hehe. Not used long enough to review, but 4/5. No color.\n\n**Sunscreens:**\n\n***Lacto Calamine Lacto Calamine Sunshield Matte Look Sunscreen SPF50 PA+++***(not in pic coz in the bin):\n\n*Usage Period: Twice or thrice*\n\nImmense white cast that goes away (kinda) with a lot of rubbing. Really tacky feeling. Would never wanna reapply. No. 2/5. WNRP (idek about the protection)\n\n***Satthwa SPF 50 PA+++ water based sunscreen***(not in pic coz in the bin):\n\n*Usage Period: Twice or thrice*\n\nGot this coz good reviews on amazon and 100g for the usual price of 50g. First red flag shoulda been this came in a transparent tube which was wrapped in packaging sticker (that was uncovered in the top and bottom area) like as tho this was not a sunscreen lol. Yeah no white cast as the reviews said but made my skin greasy and disgusting as hell. Broke me out in small pimples. My poor self did not even know that I needed oil/micellar water to remove sunscreen so I did not even clean it properly and it hurt my face :( 0/5. HF\n\nAll the sunscreens I wanna buy seem expensive :( I am not using any right now since I am mostly indoors for the holidays and natural light in the new house we moved to is really low, but ik i need to figure this out before college starts in mid july. I also hate siliconey/layery sunscreens (I did post asking for help don't worry I got good replies , you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/12x40lq/non_silicone_pharma_sunscreen_reccs_please/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) ). Right now deciding b/w Aurelderma UV edge spf 50 pa+++ but idk if it is photostable (Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Benzophenone-3, Avobenzone combo) and Eunyul Dailycare Fresh Sunscreen Spf 46 pa+++ (nice ingredients, new gen photostable filters, 1500 rs for 300ml on amazon so 250rs for 50g which is cheap but I spend my own savings money for skincare/haircare other than cleanser and shampoo and I’ll have to break the bank for this (I have already spent recklessly on skincare and pre-ordering a kpop album) and also if it does not suit me I’ll end up with 300ml of product I will not use/ will hate using so idk). I hope to figure it out by next month (praying I will not go broke) coz I have hyperpigmentation issues and healing acne scars which might be worsened by sun damage and also I do not want old me complaining coz I am not using sunscreen now lol.\n\n**Hair Oils:**\n\n***Bajaj Almond Drops:***\n\n*Usage Period: All my life i think*\n\n79% mustard oil and 21% sweet almond oil which my mom buys. Nice. Not really willing to buy any oil myself so this does the job for dry detangling. Helps my scalp not get too dry since I use a cleansing shampoo every wash. Idk about hair growth and stuff (I do not think it helps). 4/5 for my use.\n\n**Shampoo:**\n\n***Ayur Coconut Shampoo*** (not in pic coz in bathroom):\n\n*Usage Period: All my life till I think 8 months back*\n\nMy mom still swears by this. I have used it most my life. And considering it is just some gel base, coconut oil (which is comedogenic), and 20% sodium laureth sulfate, ig it is not a surprise that when I switched from this, my hairfall INSTANTLY decreased by almost less than half. No thank you. 0/5 ew\n\n***XHC Argan oil Shampoo*** (not in pic coz in bathroom):\n\n*Usage Period: 8 - 12 months (till now)*\n\nUse this right now. My uncle initially bought it and I happened to use it, and my hair was immediately less dry and fell less. Idk if this is due to this being good or my ex-shampoo being bad tho. Cleans decent. 3/5 WRP\n\n**Conditioner:**\n\n***Himalaya Dryness Defense Detangler & Conditioner - Hibiscus & Blue Water Lily*** (not in pic coz over):\n\n*Usage Period: Do not remember exactly how long, but finished the bottle (the small one)*\n\nFirst conditioner, best in the drugstore ones i have tried. Does the job. Silicone based. 3/5. Looking for smthn better\n\nI’d also used a ***dove nutritive solutions conditioner*** but i dont remember the variant. But it was not nice i would say. 2/5 WNRP\n\n***Kesh King Conditioner*** (not in pic coz in bathroom):\n\n*Usage Period: 3-4 times*\n\nMost recently used conditioner. Big no. Just dries ur hair. 1/5 WNRP\n\nJust bought True Frog’s everyday conditioner (finally pursuing a wavy hair routine? maybe but idk considering the money I have), might review after a couple of uses.\n\n**Hair Gel:**\n\n***Set Wet yellow color:***\n\n*Usage Period: 3-4 times*\n\nNice hold but very strong nauseating men’s perfume/ a car’s inside in really hot weather smell that I do not want in my hair. 2/5 WNRP\n\nChoosing b/w FMC flaxseed gelly or true frog’s styling gel. I also need to buy a leave in conditioner (tho I might just use regular conditioner as a leave in lol)(choosing b/w true frog’s leave in or styling cream (the cream has more protein and ig my hair is okay with protein but it is not really damaged and i do not want to protein overload it). This is obviously gonna be months later IF i get birthday money from relatives.\n\n*Bonus*: Toothpaste is not skincare but Paradontax is my HG. Life changing. Never going back to colgate again. Cleans plaque and have not had bad breath problems (i did get my teeth cleaned last october)(idk who needs to hear this but GUMS BLEEDING IS NOT NORMAL even if ur parent with gum problems themselves tries to gaslight u into thinking it is (my gums were on the verge of crisis)) I also use a 2+ colgate toothbrush instead of a regular one. It is softer and smaller so I focus on brushing each side and part of my teeth more properly.\n\n*Extra* tip which I already commented on someone else’s post, do not use ur regular towel to wipe ur face, air dry it or use a fresh tissue. Also change ur pillowcovers regularly. Also drink plenty of water (I say while drinking only 500-1000 ml of water in a day).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnd THAT is almost everything I have ever used. Now that I have let out all this stuff here, I hope my brain will stop running that imaginary youtube channel of me reviewing my skincare and stuff as I do it. Wish me luck for figuring out sunscreen and haircare (and also bodycare which I do not even have a routine for yet, I just use whatever bodywash my family buys (i hate my body skin feeling greasy or sticky any time of the year coz this is india) (my keratosis pilaris cries in agony), pls drop reccs).\n\nThank you for reading this longgg post (or atleast parts of it) with the worst grammar and thought flow known to humankind! (and the most unnecessary details in brackets) Here is to everyone in this subreddit finding their HG’s while not going broke! Until next time! (if there is a next time that is)\n\nwow this is 6 pages in google docs arial size 11 what have i done\n\nI added a review and a second impression and usage periods and it is 7 pages now hehe",

So here goes, and sorry bc it's a long one: \n\n*the alcohols to be concerned about in skin-care products are \n\nethanol, \n\ndenatured alcohol, \n\nethyl alcohol, \n\nmethanol, \n\nisopropyl alcohol, \n\nSD alcohol, and \n\nbenzyl alcohol (when it’s among the main ingredients; tiny amounts aren't a problem). \n\nthese types can be extremely drying and irritating to skin, as well as capable of generating free radical damage and disrupting skin's protective barrier.\n\nsome companies use cleansing agents (a type of ingredient) that can be so drying and irritating. the biggest culprits to avoid in a face wash are:\n\nsodium palm kernelate,\n\npotassium hydroxide,\n\nsodium hydroxide\n\nsodium cocoate\n\nsodium lauryl sulfate\n\nTEA-lauryl sulfate\n\nsodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate\n\nsodium palmate\n\nthere are so many good cleansing agents, too many to list, but heres some common ones that are good to see in your first few ingredients…\n\nlaurie acid\n\npalmitic acid\n\nisohexadecane\n\nammonium lauryl sulfate\n\nsodium laureth sulfate\n\nsodium laureth-13 carboxylate\n\ndisodium cocoyl glutamate\n\nglyceryl behanate\n\npotassium cetyl phosphate\n\nPEG-10 rapeseed sterol\n\nsoapwort\n\nsodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\npolysorbate 20\n\ndisodium lauraminopropionate\n\nsodium myreth sulfate\n\nlaureth-7\n\ncocamidopropyl betaine\n\nammonium laureth sulfate\n\nsodium methyl taurate\n\nsteareth-20\n\nmagnesium oleth sulfate*",

    "body": "Skin type: Oily, acne-prone  tho years of skincare I think my skin is now normal to oily (esp in t-zone).\n\nI already have a solid routine from my trial and error journey but I can't help myself to try new things out. After all, skincare for me is therapeutic and I don't wanna get bored doing it.\n\n**TL;DR** I love the Oxecure Ultra Gentle Moisturizer.  Oxecure cleanser irritated my skin. I still love Human Heart Nature Nourishing  Cleanser.\n\n**Oxecure Ultra Gentle Moisturizer***Ingredients:*  Water,  Glycerin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, C15-19 Alkane,  Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/vp Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polydecene,  Propanediol, Glyceryl Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, PEG-100 Stearate,  Squalane, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin,  Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA,  Panthenol, Alpha-glucan Oligosaccharide, Potassium Hydroxide,  Maltodextrin, Polymnia Sonchifolia Root Juice, Ceteareth-25, Propylene  Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Cetyl Alcohol, BHT,  Lactobacillus, Pantolactone, Behenic Acid, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol,  Ceramide NS, Ethylhexylglycerin, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract,  Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS, Caprooyl Phytosphingosine,  Caprooyl Sphingosine, Ascrobyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Glyceryl Oleate,  Lecithin, Tocopherol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Calendula  Officinalis Flower Extract, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Chamomilla  Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hypericum Perforatum  Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Tilia Cordata Flower Extract\n\n*Notable ingredients:* 5 types of ceramides - Ceramide NP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS paired with Cholesterol and fatty acids - Caprooyl Phytosphingosine & Caprooyl Sphingosine to mimic skin's barrier function.\n\nAlso has glycerin, panthenol, pantolactone, lactobacillus, squalane, and aloe extract.\n\nFor reference I've tried the well-loved **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream** which unfortunately broke me out. I also hate its texture and how it sits on top of my skin. Then there's the **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Soothing Gel** which gave me a more pleasant experience than the cream. I have gone three bottles of it already. So yea, I loved it but I also found it boring. Like it's just your regular moisturizer - *Oh no, OP discovered how moisturizer works.*\n\nAnd oxecure moisturizer came into the picture. From the list of ingredients above it is way moooore extensive than the ceramide gel so I was afraid it would break me out. Fortunately, it didn't. In fact, I like it better than the ceramide gel! It is lightweight but you'll know you have applied it unlike with the gel which absorbs completely with my skin. Nevertheless, I still like it for that coz I feel like the previous products I have applied are sealed. It also doesn't pill with my sunscreen. One drawback - it is expensive. 700 pesos for 75 ml.\n\nAlso soothes my skin when it is irritated especially when the horror of using the Oxecure cleanser happened.\n\n**Oxecure ph 5.5 Gentle Cleanser***Ingredients:*  Water,  Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine,  Glycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate,  Cocamide MEA, Citric Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Potassium  Sorbate, Disodium EDTA, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Ethylhexylglycerin,  Ceramide 3, Garcinia Mangostana (Mangosteen) Peel Extract, Centella  Asiatica Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Sctutellaria  Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinesis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla  Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root  Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Aloe  Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\nSurfactants: Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), Cocamidopropyl Betaine (CAPB), Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids\n\nFrom the first week of using it, I really liked it. It didn't dry my skin out. However, days after my skin started to turn red and patchy whenever I used it. I don't know which ingredient/s sensitized my skin. I'm pretty sure not the SLES and CAPB as they are present to Celeteque cleanser (which I liked). And considering it has lot of hydrating and moisturizing ingredients, kinda bummer this turned out to be a holy fail for me. My body enjoys it now tho. Still, for me it is worth trying coz who knows it might work perfectly for you.\n\nA hunt for a cleanser started. I was using Celeteque Hydration Cleanser for years already. I didn't have any problems with it except that sometimes I feel like it kinda dries my skin especially when my skin is retinizing from tretinoin use. Still I should've stuck with *if ain't broke, don't fix it* mantra.\n\nSo one day I was at Watsons, just the usual window shopping of products. And I stumbled upon Human Heart Nature products and saw the **nourishing** variant cleanser. It brought back memories when I was just starting with skincare. When I was hopeless and felt like every products I used were not helping with my skin concerns, that cleanser gave me hope. I experienced the real definition of gentle cleansing after trying harsh scrubs and whatnot on my face.\n\n*Ingredients:*  water, decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, glycerin, Solanum lycopersicum  (tomato) fruit extract, carrageenan, tocopherol, sodium lactate, sodium gluconate, dicaprylyl ether, glyceryl oleate, hydrogenated palm  glycerides citrate, parfum, levulinic acid, sodium levulinate, phytic  acid, p-anisic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid\n\n*Surfuctants:* decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside - derived from coconut so be warry if you're sensitive to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo fast forward I bought a bottle of it. I used it for a week before giving my verdict. And now I can say that it is still the gentlest cleanser I have ever used. My skin feels supple whenever I use it. Although it has now a different packaging from what I can remember, it's still my first love. That feeling when everything feels right.\n\n*Hoy vevs iba na 'yan.*",

Whatever causes my CCs are particularly invisible but my then derm insisted it was dandruff and following her regimen did get rid of the CCs without any skincare topical or prescription.\n* **Age/age range** \\- 25 to 35\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Current Haircare routine:**\n\n1. Pre Shampoo - Some homemade oil concoction (I add a lot of tiny oil bottles, I needed to empty, so I just mixed them all together.) or Plum Avocado Hair Mask\n2. Anti dandruff - Scalpe pro (I got L'oreal pure clay a while ago, to see if that will work instead of this, but haven't fully tested it out yet)\n3. Scalp shampoo - Alpecin Double Effect\n4. Length of the hair - Dove hydrating shampoo for curly hair (early days, haven't formed any impression yet.)\n5. Protein conditioner - Plum Olive and Macadamia Hair Mask (as and when necessary)\n6. Conditioner - Garnier Hair Food Papaya variant or Banana variant ( I like Papaya way better than banana, but neither of them are worth full price and Im still mourning the discontinuation of Matrix biolage purple cap)\n\nI've reviewed quite a few of the products I use, including Alpecin [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/vqot48/my_current_haircare_routine_reviews_reequil/), but Alpecin deserves its own review.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Climatic conditions under which the product was tested:** All. Summer, What passes for winter in the south, Monsoon.\n* **Usage timeline:** 1.5 years atleast. Almost done with my second bottle. And I've purchased it in Mid-September, this bottle has lasted me 8 months.\n* **Ingredient List:** [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n* **Price:** MRP 699 for 200 ml. Never seen this on discount. :(\n* **Texture, Consistency details:** Normal shampoo consistency, A blueish grey colour, so definitely added colour. You can see a hit of the colour and consistency [here](https://imgur.com/CVTsVhO.jpg)\n* **Fragrance:** HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n* **Usage:** I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply **on scalp only (Never below nape)**. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp. If I've oiled twice, I shampoo twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Effect on hair issues and result of using the product:** Shiny frizz free hair, but definite loss of volume. If I had to use 1 word to describe it \"sleek\".\n* **Experience and thoughts in detail:**\n\n***Old Review, copied from my previous post and slightly edited***\n\nThis shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation.\n\nAlpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (obvious conflict of interests. I remember reading the study but can only find the [abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17396054/) now) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit this for it. Maybe it'll work for others but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Updated Review***\n\nBarely anything to update if I'm honest. I stand by everything I said above, and they still hold true.\n\nAbout hairfall, I definitely don't think it helps. SO still thinks it helps, but acknowledges that he likes the user experience of it so much that he may be biased. Don't trust him.\n\nIn 2018, the UK Advertising Standards Authority ruled that caffeine shampoo Alpecin must no longer advertise that it can \"help to reduce hair loss\" as there was no adequate evidence to support the claim.  ***I definitely don't recommend buying this hoping it'll cure your hairfall issues.***\n\nThe main reason, I wanted to re-review this, is to post [this video](https://imgur.com/pt98TCe)\n\nI took these too [Pic 1](https://imgur.com/Sb7u13B.jpg), [Pic 2](https://imgur.com/fZMkSHb.jpg), but even though they are from back cam, quality is super bad. The video is a decent representation of what it looks like.  I'll update this post with better pics when I'm able to take them.\n\n**Other things to add**\n\n* The whole time I used Alpecin, I also used Scalpe pro. ie I used scalpe pro every few washes most of the year, but peak summer and winter or if I see signs of CCs, I used it every single wash and followed it up with Alpecin.  So every wash I used Alpecin but every few washes I used Scalpe pro + Alpecin.\n* u/santa96 has commented below that it didn't work for them, so I was running over possibilities. And one theory is the AD shampoo was actually stripping than I thought (I have used it alone, only for experimenting / testing purposes.  I originally thought it wasn't as stripping as most other AD shampoos but still drying compared to regular shampoos. Which is why I followed it up with Alpecin. But it could be that continued usage, caused dryness and the protein in the Alpecin was immediate damage control and THAT's why I love it so much.\n* This is just a hypothesis and is of now, untested. But my scalpe pro is almost over and I should know in a couple of months if I right.\n* Anyone for now, I obviously need to test it out under more conditions. This review is moot. I mean I still love it, but it needs to have more information for anyone else to judge if it'll work for you and I currently don't have that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ETA on 10/02/24: \n\nI had previously tagged this as OP-ED because I wanted to test out the following.\n\na) If I use Alpecin with no stripping products will it cause protein overload\n\nAnswer: No. It doesn't. 9 months later I still use Alpecin every single wash.\n\n* I've used it with the following variables affecting it\n   * Oiled hair\n   * Oiled hair + Clarifying shampoo (Loreal Pure Clay)\n   * Oiled hair + Normal shampoo (Loreal Hyaluronic acid)\n   * Unoiled hair\n   * Unoiled hair + Normal shampoo (Loreal Hyaluronic acid)\n\nand no protein overload. In fact except for a couple of months in the middle where I damaged my hair in beach vacations, my hair is way way way more healthier now than it was before.\n\nb) If I use it with a garden variety clarifying shampoo instead of a stripping anti-dandruff shampoo, will I still rave about it.\n\nAnswer: Yes. I would and I am. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Anything that you think others might find a con:** Price probably\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Holy Grail, Forever repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;",

I originally looked into them because they asked me to be their spokesperson and, as I do with everything, I began doing my research and realized not only did I not agree with their product ingredients, their marketing made them look like they were doing something positive when really they put lots of toxins into their ingredients. When I said this to them they didn't respond to me. Ultimately it is the responsibility of the consumers to do their research, but I wanted to put it out there since I know that Lush is one company that I can say with confidence that I do not support. I'm all about products that don't have packaging, but not at the expense of my health or the health of the environment. For this reason, I do not recommend shopping at Lush Cosmetics North America\nYou can have effective cosmetics without ANY toxic chemicals or ingredients.\n. \nLush uses toxic and synthetic ingredients and are not sustainable. Some of their toxic ingredients to name a few to look out for and stay away from: propylene glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, sodium lauryl sulfate, Hydroxycitronellal, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Alkyl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, lilial, alpha-isomethyl ionone, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, glycerin... all of these ingredients are in their products.\nThey list their synthetic ingredients on their website and use petrochemicals, SLS, other sulfates, and synthetic fragrance. Before you purchase products, be sure to look at the ingredient lists.\nThat company really makes me sad because they trick people into thinking they are doing something good, when really they sell products with toxic ingredients. https://www.lushusa.com/ingredient-finder They say \"Our fragrances are made up of approximately 60% natural oils, resins and absolutes.\" which means at least 40% of their ingredients are not natural and they don't state what their \"perfume\" or \"fragrance\" is.\nIf you are wondering about ingredients, look them up. I always love ewg.org as a resource.\n\nI can see on this subreddit the popularity of Lush because of their package free products. I love their products as well so I find this a little upsetting from Lauren. As you can see from the post, she seems to put down one company to promote her own shop and products which screams suspicion and \"holier than thou\" to me. She is also getting some fair critique on her stance as well.\n\nPersonally, I have never seen Lush advertise their products as 100% all natural, but \"Fresh Handmade Cosmetics\" and they have always clearly stated what is synthetic and what is natural in each of their products. (I don't know where that rumour came about).\n\nAlso, what does she mean by toxic? Everything can be toxic at a certain amount, but of course we need to also be conscious of the environment and not everything synthetic is particularly bad for the environment. I will continue to use Lush because I don't think that ALL their products are bad when you can research the ingredients yourself and make an informed decision. Lush has always promoted sustainability for their products and donating money from their profits to charitable costs to both fair trade workers and the environment. This, I believe, is 100% better than 90% of the cosmetic market. At least they are using most fresh fruit and oils instead of chemicals! \n\nWhat are your thoughts? I'd love to have this conversation with the rest of you as Lauren is a big voice in this community. ",

But I can make it to their store without driving, the products I enjoy are effective and package free, and at the end of the day, I don't have any more mentally capacity to stress about the quality of my attempt to do a good deed.\n\nI don't think we should be spending our time bashing companies that don't align 100% to our vision of a perfect example. We should spend our time applauding the parts that people get right while campaigning the brands we enjoy to improve.

If I can’t easily find package free shampoo, then I’ll buy the same stuff as everyone else, sending no economic signals that I want something different.

I've been taking all the easy precautions like wetting my hair with clean water before getting in the pool and wearing a swim cap, but now I'm looking to specific products that help with removing buildup from chlorine and other pool chemicals. In my research, the only ingredients I've found that are good for this purpose and commonly found in clarifying shampoos and some conditioners are:\n\n* Sodium Thiosulfate ([neutralizes chlorine](http://curiouschemeng.blogspot.com/2014/01/chlorinated-hair.html))\n* Disodium/Tetrasodium EDTA ([chelating agent](http://curiouschemeng.blogspot.com/2014/01/chlorinated-hair.html))\n\nWhich brings me to my question, which is a little silly and neurotic, but I hope someone can help me. I've really fallen in love with this [L'Oreal Kids 2-in-1 Swim Shampoo](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/products/hair-care/products/shampoo/loreal-kids-extra-gentle-2-in-1-swim-sport-shampoo.aspx?shade=extra-gentle-2-in-1-swim-sport-shampoo). I just love how it smells, I love the bottle, I love how cheap it is, and I love how it reminds me of when I was a kid! Upon looking into the ingredients though, I found neither Sodium Thiosulfate nor EDTAs among them. Here they are listed out:\n\n>AQUA/WATER/EAU • SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE • DISODIUM COCOAMPHODIACETATE • PEG-200 HYDROGENATED GLYCERYL PALMATE • POLYSORBATE 20 • SODIUM CHLORIDE • PEG-7 GLYCERYL COCOATE • HEXYLENE GLYCOL • DISODIUM RICINOLEAMIDO MEA-SULFOSUCCINATE • PARFUM/FRAGRANCE • SODIUM LAURETH-8 SULFATE • POLYQUATERNIUM-10 • SODIUM METHYLPARABEN • MAGNESIUM LAURETH-8 SULFATE • MAGNESIUM LAURETH SULFATE • SODIUM OLETH SULFATE • DMDM HYDANTOIN • MAGNESIUM OLETH SULFATE • CI 47005 / YELLOW 10 • CI 14700 / RED 4\n\nBasically I want to know, am I missing something? How can L'Oreal confidently claim that this shampoo \"removes chlorine\" if there are no ingredients that are specifically capable of that? I like this product a lot and want to continue using it but I also want to make sure I'm getting all the pool chemicals out of my hair after I swim.\n\n^(In before \"just use it if you like it,\" I know my question is kinda silly, I just want to understand how these ingredients work!)",

Should I use some strong soap and shampoo to get the chlorine off or mild Cetaphil kind to avoid doing further damage to skin and hair?\n\nI have had knee and wrist surgeries and swimming is the best form of exercise for me. Yet I don't because I have a sensitive skin and I am worried about chlorine affecting it.\n\nThanks. It would be great if you could share what worked for you.",

    "body": "Hi all! I have recently gathered all the info on Salicylic Acid that I have in my personal knowledge base and decided to publish it as a guidelines that can be referenced in the future.\n\nI decided to do this because question about Salicylic Acid appear from time to time in the sub and I also see some wrong information from YouTube videos when people are trying to formulate it. Hope this information would be helpful for you!\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nI AM NOT A CHEMIST!\n\nI AM NOT A DOCTOR!\n\nI DON'T HAVE ANY SKINCARE, CHEMISTRY, MEDICAL OR BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION!\n\nAll the information is gathered over the internet sources and some is referenced (+ a bit of personal DIY experience). I am open to any corrections and additions. Please leave them in comments and I'll include them in this article.\n\n# General info\n\n>**BE CAUTIOS! IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY TO ASPIRIN THEN YOU MOST LIKELY HAVE ALLERGY TO SALICYLIC ACID**\n\n**INCI:** Salicylic Acid  \n**Type:** Acid, BHA  \n**Functions:** Exfoliation, Anti-inflammatory  \n**Treats:** Acne, Blackheads, Keratosis Pilaris, Sebum production  \n**Usage rate:** 0.5 - 3.0%  \n**Usable pH range:** 3.5  \n**pKa:** 2.97  \n**Solubility:** Alcohols, Glycols, Oils, Surfactants  \n**Molar mass:** 138.121 g/mol (Daltons)\n\n# Usage rate\n\nDue to possible poisoning, based on European regulations ([SCCS - Final Opinion on Salicylic acid](https://health.ec.europa.eu/latest-updates/sccs-final-opinion-salicylic-acid-2023-06-09_en)) maximum usage rates of Salicylic Acid in skincare products are:\n\n* 3% in wash-off hair products;\n* 2% in other leave-on products, excluding the mentioned below;\n* 0.5% for body lotions, eye shadows, mascaras, eyeliners, lipsticks, oral products and non-spray deodorants.\n\n>**!DANGER!**  \nBetter to avoid formulating sprayable products due to possible inhalation. Also, special attention is required for the use of SA in eye products, as it shows potential of causing serious damage to eyes.\n\nUSA most likely has the same regulation on SA. It is also an OTC drug in USA and should be labeled in a special section of the product packaging.\n\nSouth Korea has even stricter rules for direct SA. The maximum usage rate is up to 0.5% for any product type ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2d613u/maximum_bha_in_korea_05/)). That's why Korean skincare products often use **Willow Bark Extract** and/or **Betaine Salicylate** as active ingredient instead.\n\n# Solubility\n\n# Water\n\nAlthough Salicylic Acid is a polar molecule it is poorly soluble in water (which is also a polar molecule), because the polar parts of the molecule attached to the bigger non-polar part of it, affecting the properties. ([Chemical Book](https://www.chemicalbook.com/article/the-polar-and-non-polar-characteristics-in-the-structure-of-salicylic-acid.htm)).\n\n# Depending on temperature\n\nSolubility in water depending on the temperature ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_acid)):\n\n|Water temperature (°C)|Solubility (g/L)|Solubility (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|0|1.24|0.124|\n|25|2.48|0.248|\n|40|4.14|0.414|\n|75|17.41|1.741|\n|100|77.79|7.779|\n\nWhich means if you take 100ml of water under room temperature (25 °C) you can dissolve up to 0.248g of SA in it. If you boil the water it will take up to 7.779g of SA, but precipitates when you cool the solution down.\n\n# Depending on pH\n\nSolubility increases with increasing pH, because part of SA becomes \"neutralized\" and therefore more soluble in water. Can be estimated for any given pH using the pKa of Salicylic Acid:\n\n* At a pH of 2.97 (pKa): 50% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form\n* At a pH of 4: 90% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form.\n* At a pH of 5: about 99% is in \"neutralized\" form.\n\nHere is a free acid calculator (not only for BHA) at any pH level: [LabMuffin Beauty](https://labmuffin.com/free-acid-calculator-for-exfoliants-at-specific-ph-levels/). WIth this spreadsheet you can calculate how much Salicylic Acid will be in protonated form (not neutralized, free acid) under any pH.\n\n# Betaine\n\nDue to strict regulation of SA in Korea and high popularity of Korean skincare products, new ingredient has been researched and introduced as a gentler alternative to SA called **Betaine Salicylate**.\n\nBetaine forms a hydrogen-bonded complex with Salicylic Acid rather than a salt, which increases its solubility. Formulated with it at pH 3.0-3.5, with a 2:1 molar ratio (1.7g to 1g) of Betaine to Salicylic Acid and it remains relatively soluble. Betaine mixed with Salicylic Acid at the right proportion results in a liquid ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/do-sodium-citrate-or-betaine-react-with-salicylic-acid/)).\n\n# Surfactants\n\nGreat solubility in many surfactants, especially the ones that start with \"Sodium\" (Sodium Laureth Sulfate etc). That's why formulating a face wash or shampoo with Salicylic Acid is not a big problem and won't be covered here.\n\nAccording to [\"The solubilization of salicylic acid by a series of non-ionic surfactants\"](https://academic.oup.com/jpp/article-abstract/23/Supplement_1/241S/6200573) the likely mechanism is somewhere between incorporation into the micelles and encapsulation.\n\nBased on [\"Solubilization of Salicylic Acid by Polysorbate 80 as Determined by Solubility Titration\"](https://jpharmsci.org/article/S0022-3549(15)33858-2/abstract), to completely solubilize SA in water the ratio between SA and:\n\n* **Polysorbate 80** should be 0.15\n* **Polysorbate 20** should be 0.13\n\nTherefore to solubilize 2% of SA in water required around 13.4% of Polysorbate 80 or around 15.4% of Polysorbate 20.\n\n# Ethanol (Alcohol)\n\nSalicylic Acid is highly soluble in **Ethanol**, that's why many companies use Ethanol as a main solvent or a co-solvent of the product.\n\nUnder normal conditions the solubility is 291.3 g/L or 369.2 g/kg Ethanol, which means 36.92g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Ethanol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Propylene glycol\n\n**Propylene Glycol** is often used as a solvent and penetration enhancer in skincare formulations. Solubility rate of SA in Propylene Glycol is 248.63 g/L or 257.64 g/kg Propylene Glycol, which means 25.76g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Propylene Glycol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Sodium Citrate and Sodium Lactate\n\n**Sodium Citrate** and **Sodium Lactate** are salts of weak Citric Acid and Lactic Acid respectfully. Since SA is a stronger acid, when mixed it can replace Citric or Lactic acid and gives **Sodium Salicylate**, which is highly soluble in water:\n\n>Sodium Citrate + Salicylic Acid -> Sodium Citrate + Sodium Salicylate + Citric Acid + Salicylic Acid\n\nMentioned salts are not usable as solubilization enhancers since they basically neutralize SA, but they are good buffering agents to prevent SA recrystallization in case of pH drift or temperature change.\n\nSuggested ratio of salt to SA is 1:10 ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/precipitation-and-gel-incompatibility-salicylic-acid-serum/)), meaning for 2% of Salicylic Acid include 0.2% of the buffer.\n\n# Mixed solvency approach\n\nAccording to [Hydrotropy, mixed hydrotropy, and mixed solvency as trending concept for solubilization of lipophilic drugs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128144558000050) and [\"Mixed-solvency approach\" - Boon for solubilization of poorly water-soluble drugs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44298504_Mixed-solvency_approach_-_Boon_for_solubilization_of_poorly_water-soluble_drugs), a mix of different solvents usually gives better solubility than if one pure solvent is used of the same content. This allows to decrease the content of each individual solvent in the formula leading to a more elegant product.\n\nSolubility in mixes of Water, Propylene Glycol and Ethanol was studied in [Solubility prediction of Salicylic Acid in Water-Ethanol-Propylene Glycol mixtures](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16649546/). The study defined a formula to determine how much Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in a custom mixture of this solvents and also proves mixed solvency approach.\n\nHere is a calculator spreadsheet that I made based on the study: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MqJaMGAa1Wu3BKck55dkqUWt4ACU_FPo). Fill in percentage of Ethanol and Propylene Glycol in the mixture (water will be calculated automatically) and you'll see the solubility calculated.\n\n# Substitutions\n\nThere are alternative ingredients that are readily soluble in water and can be used to avoid the hassle with Salicylic Acid itself:\n\n* **Sodium Salicylate**. Salt of Salicylic Acid. Very soluble in water. There is a publication in cosmetic journal ([Exfoliation for sensitive skin with neutralized salicylic acid](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x)) showing that Sodium Salicylate is as effective as actual Salicylic Acid in terms of exfoliation. But the methodology of studies are not disclosed and anti-acne effect is not tested. Used in [Revox Just Salicylic Acid 2% For Scalp](https://incidecoder.com/products/revox-just-salicylic-acid-2-for-scalp)  and [Keve Salicylic Acid 2% Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/keve-salicylic-acid-2-serum)\n* **WIllow Bark Extract**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Pyunkang Yul Acne Dressing Mask Pack](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-dressing-mask-pack);\n* **Betaine Salicylate**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Cos De BAHA S2 Salicylic Acid BHA 2% Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cos-de-baha-s2-salicylic-acid-bha-2-liquid);\n* **Salicylic Acid in Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine** solution. Used in [The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-salicylic-acid-2-solution)  and [Revolution 2% Salicylic Acid Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/revolution-2-salicylic-acid-serum);\n* Spray dried **Salicylic Acid with Acacia Senegal Gum**. Used in [Somethinc 2% BHA Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment](https://incidecoder.com/products/somethinc-2-bha-salicylic-acid-acne-treatment) and [Attivi Puri Salicylic Acid + Niacinamide Lotion](https://incidecoder.com/products/attivi-puri-salicylic-acid-niacinamide-lotion)\n\n# Formulation strategy\n\nBased on the data above, the strategy of formulating a stable SA serum is:\n\n1. Formulate with not more than 2% of Salicylic Acid to meet requirements for skincare products;\n2. Formulate at pH 3.5 to meet FDA requirements for skincare products. At this pH if you add 2% of Salicylic Acid only 0.46% will be in free form (and hence less solvents needed);\n3. Use several solvents (glycols, ethanol) for better solubility based on mixed solvency approach;\n4. Include some mild non-ionic surfactants (Polysorbate 20, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate etc) to form micelles and encapsulate part of the acid;\n5. Use Betaine to convert part of SA to Betaine Salicylate and adjust the pH;\n6. Add some weak acid salt (Sodium Citrate, Sodium Lactate) to prevent precipitation in case of pH drift or temperature change;\n7. Since our target is low pH, maybe Ethanol content and maybe high salt content be sure to use a tolerant gelling agent. Sepimax Zen, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethylcellulose or HMW Hyaluronic acid are good choices, while Aristoflex, Carbomer, Lecigel won't thicken the solution.\n8. Avoid natural extracts (or add at 0.01% amount for marketing claims) and ingredients that in low pH will hydrolyze over time and shift the pH level up (Niacinamide, Urea etc).\n\n# Example of a commercial product\n\n[Dermarium \"Tricky Duet 2% Salicylic Acid\" toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/dermarium-tricky-duet-2-salicylic-acid-2):\n\n>INCI: Water, **Ethanol**, *Salicylic Acid*, **Propylene Glycol**, **Betaine**, **Sodium Lactate**, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, **Polysorbate 20**, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Menthol, Methyl Lactate.\n\n* Used Ethanol and Propylene Glycol as solvents\n* Used Polysorbate 20 and PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil to boost solubility (but most likely to solubilize the extracts)\n* Used Betaine as a hydrotrope tp boost the solubility;\n* Used Sodium Lactate as a buffering salt.\n\n# Example of formulas\n\n# Very basic waterless solution\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Propylene Glycol|98%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n\nThe easiest and fastest approach is to dissolve Salicylic Acid directly in Propylene Glycol.\n\nPros:\n\n* No water - no solubility and recrystallization problems;\n* No water - no pH;\n* No water - no need for preservation;\n* Easy and fast to prepare;\n* Damn strong since whole SA content is in free acid form.\n\nCons:\n\n* Unpleasant to wear, PG has very oily texture (can be balanced with Ethanol to some degree);\n* Runny texture, hard to thicken;\n* Damn strong. Yes, it is not a typo, this can be both - advantage and disadvantage.\n\n# Basic one-solvent serum\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Optional: preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Propylene Glycol|50%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1. Mix Salicylic Acid with Propylene Glycol until it is completely dissolved;\n2. Add Sodium Hydroxide solution and water;\n3. Add the preservative of choice and stir until dissolved;\n4. Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n5. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nPreservative is optional because the formula has a lot of humectant (Propylene Glycol) that binds water and also low pH.\n\nUsed much more PG as required because no other co-solvents or buffering agents used, so higher amount is required to maintain the stability and prevent recrystallization of SA.\n\n# Basic two-solvent serum\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Ethanol|20%|\n|Propylene Glycol|20%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1. Mix Salicylic Acid with Ethanol to dissolve quickly;\n2. Add Propylene Glycol and mix it together;\n3. Add Sodium Hydroxide solution and water;\n4. Add the preservative of choice and stir until dissolved;\n5. Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n6. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nMix of 2 solvents allow to add less of it (40% total comparing to 50% of PG in previous formula). Also, Ethanol makes the serum less oily.\n\n# Advanced serum with surfactant and buffering agent\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Sodium Citrate|0.5%|\n|Polysorbate 80|5%|\n|Propylene Glycol|30%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1. Mix Salicylic Acid with Propylene Glycol to dissolve;\n2. Mix water with Sodium Hydroxide solution, Sodium Citrate and Polysorbate 80\n3. Combine both solutions;\n4. Add the preservative of choice and stir until dissolved;\n5. Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n6. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nPolysorbate 80 lowers the surface tension and boosts the solubility, but adds a bot of foaming to the product.\n\n# Ultimate all-in-one serum\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Sodium Lactate|0.2%|\n|Polysorbate 80|2%|\n|Betaine|2%|\n|Ethanol|10%|\n|Propanediol|10%|\n|Propylene Glycol|10%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1.

Combine both solutions;\n4. Add the preservative of choice and stir until dissolved;\n5. Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n6. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nThis formula utilizes all the formulation suggestions I gathered from different sources. It has several glycols and Ethanol as a mix of solvents, uses surfactant and Betaine plus buffer with Sodium Lactate.\n\n# Formulas from YouTube bloggers\n\nExample of good formulas:\n\n1.

[TaraLee: DIY Paulas Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant](https://youtu.be/LIubTz7QIW8) \\- too little of solvents, too high pH (because lower pH will lead to more free acid and recrystallization due to lack of solvents).\n4. [Cosmateur: DIY Salicylic Acid 2% Serum | 4 ingredients](https://youtu.be/RFBUwxkrkaU) \\- although the amount of solvents seems right, the formula is written in volumes, which means SA content is higher than 2% allowed (ethanol is lighter than water). Also, part of the ethanol evaporates during extensive mixing, so the concentration gets even higher. Moreover, the pH is not adjusted at all.\n\n# Community formulas\n\n* [Cleansing pads](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/vywxmu/super_simple_salicylic_acid_cleansing_pads/)\n* [Paula's Choice dupe](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/jav3qq/i_made_a_2_salicylic_acid_toner_loosely_based_on/)",

Feel free to disregard them :)\n\n>Under normal conditions the solubility is 291.3 g/L or 369.2 g/kg, which means 36.92g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Ethanol.\n\nI would add \"**g/kg ethanol**\", otherwise this can be confused with g/kg solution (which is the more common use of the unit). \n\n>2. Formulate at pH 3.5 to meet FDA requirements for skincare products. Under this pH if you add 2% of Salicylic Acid only 0.46% will be in free form (and hence less solvents needed)\n\nAs you decrease pH, more acid will be in the free-acid form (that is, protonated). However, above pH 3.5, you'll reduce the amount of free acid (increase the ionized form). It should be updated to read \"**Above** this pH, if you add...\".\n\n>4. Include some mild surfactants (Polysorbate 20, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate etc) to decrease surface tension and boost the solubility;\n\nI don't see that the article comments on the mechanism of solubilization. However, the likely mechanism would be somewhere between incorporation into the micelles and encapsulation. Surfactants decreasing air-water interfacial surface tension is an intrinsic property of surfactants, and doesn't really pertain to boosting solubility. It's a nit-picky suggestion, but it's just because I work with surfactants.\n\n>[Dermarium \"Tricky Duet 2% Salicylic Acid\" toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/dermarium-tricky-duet-2-salicylic-acid-2):\n\n>INCI: Water, **Ethanol**, *Salicylic Acid*, **Propylene Glycol**, **Betaine**, **Sodium Lactate**, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, **Polysorbate 20**, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Menthol, Methyl Lactate.\n\n>1. Used Ethanol and Propylene Glycol as solvents\n\n>2. Used Polysorbate 20 and PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil to boost solubility (but most likely to solubilize the extracts)\n\n>3. Used Betaine as pH adjuster;\n\n>4. Used Sodium Lactate as a buffering salt.\n\nBetaine (also called N,N,N-trimethylglycine) isn't a pH adjuster because it's largely zwitterionic in solution, and has a pKa of around 2.33, and so won't be appreciably protonated (i.e. taking up protons to buffer the solution) until after you've protonated a >50% of the salicylic acid. However, triethanolamine is a pH adjuster, and will form a small amount of triethanolammonium salicylate (which does increase solubility, albeit by neutralization). \n\n  \nAll in all, a lot of great, helpful information! Thanks for putting this together!",

SLES is like... a lesser demon. (SLS = Sodium Lauryl Sulfate,  SLES = Sodium Laureth Sulfate)\n\n* Gave no-poo a very short attempt and couldn't stand the smell no matter how much no-poo advocates insist it won't smell (I believe that their hair doesn't smell because bodies are all different, but my hair obviously did).\n\n* Most no-poo shampoo or conditioner alternatives I've seen suggested are either straight-up bad or extremely questionable (apple cider vinegar, baking soda, etc.)  I'm open to wacky alternatives but I want to know they're not going to fuck my shit up.\n\n* Every conditioner I can find that doesn't have fatty alcohols has coconut oil and/or olive oil (both of which honestly I've never put on my skin because I'm terrified of them).\n\n* I could live without a conditioner if I could find a super gentle shampoo, but that's basically what I'm trying to accomplish with the co-washing (a \"super-gentle shampoo\").

I have sort of the emo/scene haircut, so I understand the struggle with the bangs and the hair coloring. What I found helps is for you to pull the bangs out of the way when you sleep. Also, as far as no-poo. I thought it was horrible too at first. My hair smelled like a dead skunk after a few days. The solution is to use conditioner every day you wash it, as well as leave-in conditioner every single day. But the secret ingredient, is dry shampoo. Its a bit expensive, but you dont need much. A bottle of spray last me about 6 months. Now my hair smells great.\n\nFinally, as far as the coloring, remember to take extra care of your hair. Unfortunately I made the mistake of fucking up and never taking care of it. Now its all dry, poofy, and awful. Im probably going to just cut it off once i have enough replacement hair. You can buy some oils to put in your hair, but only do it once a week, since you already arent washing it!\n\nNow as far as actual shampoo, I would recommend baby shampoo, but it can be a bit expensive. However, if you do decide to go the no-poo method, any shampoo will do, as you will only be shampooing in the shower every so often.\n\nMy suggestions may seem redundant since I told you my hair is awful, but that was not due to my regime, but due to the fact that I used the straightener way to much and I fried my hair.\n\nHope this helps",

Figure out what you want to focus on first, and try introducing that.\n\n2) Hada Labo is pretty well known for basic ingredients and a focus on hyaluronic acid, which if used properly can help with hydration. I love HL foaming face wash in the pump.  I have combination skin, and while it dries out my dry parts, it is the same pH as your face should be, and I compensate with layering various of moisture-promoting products with key ingredients to address my problems.\n\n3) cosdna is your friend.  I'm pretty sure you've used it, but if you compare what you're using now for potential triggers (outside of the pH of your cleanser), you might be able to look for products that will not have your triggers.\n\n4) unfortunately AB products are YMMV to the umpteenth level, and it's understandable why you feel lost.  For example, I love Mizon all-in-one snil (I use as an essence) and my skin hates Mizon's returning starfish cream (allergic response).

It was very drying for me. The Hadao Labo Arubtin line (whitening) also has HA in it but just not to the same extent and that one works wonders for me. It provides moisture and whitening/brightening and does not dry my out like the other one. Just FYI because I was where you were months ago and tried a bunch of stuff for \"dry/dehydrated\" skin and many things that people recommended were still not enough my poor face! The Hada Labo HA milk (thin \"western-style\" lotion) really helped moisturize. I still apply a heavy cream and a facial oil after it though.",

    "body": "How I cured my blepharitis by cutting out sodium laureth sulfate (SLES)\n\nAfter struggling with “incurable” blepharitis on and off for years — dry, itchy, inflamed eyes, crusty lashes, the whole lot — I finally found the culprit: Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES).\n\nIt’s a common ingredient in tons of everyday products — especially anything that foams. SLES (and its close cousin, SLS) is a detergent/surfactant that helps products lather, but it’s also a known irritant, especially around the delicate eyelid area.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat made me suspicious?\n\nI’d tried all the usual stuff: warm compresses, lid scrubs, tea tree oil, antibiotics, even steroid drops. Nothing worked long-term. I started noticing that my symptoms flared after showers or face washing. That got me thinking: what’s in my shampoo, face wash, and toothpaste?\n\nA quick check of the ingredient lists, and bam — Sodium Laureth Sulfate was in almost everything I was using near my eyes.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat I cut out:\n\nI went through my entire routine and home products and swapped out anything with SLES (or SLS). This included:\n\t•\tShampoo (many brands like Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Herbal Essences contain it)\n\t•\tFace wash and body wash\n\t•\tToothpaste (yes, some brands foam with SLS/SLES!)\n\t•\tHand soap and shaving foam\n\t•\tEven my dish soap and laundry detergent\n\nBasically, if it lathered or foamed, I checked the label.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat happened after I cut it out?\n\nWithin a week, my eyes were significantly less irritated. The redness reduced, and my eyelids stopped feeling gritty and sore. After two weeks, the crusting and flare-ups stopped altogether.\n\nIt’s been a couple of years now, and I haven’t had a single flare. I still do basic lid hygiene (occasional warm compress, gentle eyelid wipe), but nothing intense.\n\n⸻\n\nWhy it matters:\n\nSLES isn’t the cause of everyone’s blepharitis, but if you’re sensitive to it — and a lot of us with blepharitis probably are — it can be a constant source of low-level irritation, especially if it’s getting near your eyes every day.\n\nSLES can:\n\t•\tDisrupt the eyelid’s lipid barrier\n\t•\tIrritate the meibomian glands\n\t•\tWorsen dry eye symptoms\n\t•\tContribute to eyelid inflammation\n\nAnd since it’s so widespread, you might not even realise how often you’re being exposed.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat to look for:\n\nCheck your product labels for:\n\t•\tSodium Laureth Sulfate\n\t•\tSodium Lauryl Sulfate\n\t•\tSodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate\n\nLook for products labeled “SLS-free” or “for sensitive skin.” Baby products are a good place to start, but always double-check — even some baby shampoos still sneak it in.\n\n⸻\n\nTL;DR:\n\nBlepharitis gone after cutting out SLES. If you’ve tried everything else, check your labels — your shampoo or face wash might be sabotaging your eyes.",

As long as the clarifying shampoo contains one of the higher up surfectants on the list, it should remove silicones. \n  \nDo keep in mind that some silicones are more difficult to remove than others. For example, silicones starting in peg-# are usually water soluble and will rinse off, requiring no shampoo. Some also supposedly don't build up on themselves and only bond to damaged hair, such as amodimethicone and bis-aminopropyl dimethicone. This list compares different silicones and how difficult they are to remove: http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/silicone-ingredient-solubility-list.html\n\nI personally sometimes use amodimethicone and bis-aminopropyl dimethicone, and I use products that contain water soluble silicones pretty much daily.

I am also concerned about the potential effects of getting my sunscreen stuck in my hair next to my skin.\n\nI no longer think that dimethicone is a bad or dispensable ingredient. I understand the difference between sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate, as well as the difference between cyclomethicone, cyclopentasiloxane, dimethicone and amodimethicone. I just bought a shampoo containing the mild surfactant sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate and a conditioner containing dimethicone after spending an hour reading the back of haircare products at the shops. Crazy, man! This is a huge deal and I'm totally jittery.\n\nI think that no-poo can work well for some people, mainly those with short or curly hair. I have long, semi-straight hair, and no matter how much I used my BBB I could not get my hair smooth. I had frizzy, split ends just a short time after getting my hair cut. I kinda succeeded for a long time while telling myself that this was what healthy hair looked like, then I reassessed my needs and here I am. I got all of the damaged hair cut off today and I'm ready to try this shit out.\n\nGood luck everyone!",

        "body": "Hey, do what works for you! No poo works literal wonders for some people, some people never find the perfect method that works for them. Even so, everyone can learn and benefit from at least some of the techniques and knowledge of no poo, that they can take with them even if they don't stick to no poo. Using a low-poo is still waaaaaaay better than an SLS shampoo.\n\nIf the BBB you tried doesn't work for your hair type (I'm wondering if it has a lot of plastic bristles mixed in, because often they do, and those damage hair), I highly HIGHLY recommend getting a wooden bristled brush-- whether you are no poo or not. The bristles are spread far apart, still flexible if you get one of the squishy brushes, and the wood does distribute natural hair oils a bit, which is still beneficial even if (or especially if) you use a low-poo or shampoo cleanser. It can give some life back to your ends between washes without looking greasy or damaging your hair. You can get them at whole foods or health foods stores or online. Best of luck to you!",

        "body": "I totally get that nopoo is not for everyone.  But I think it should be said that having healthy hair isnt the same as having sleek shiny hair. I have naturally curly hair but I hate how it looks. (like Brent Spiner in Independence day!!)  Totally frizzy no matter how much I brush or whatever.  So I straighten my hair with that same BBB and a hair drier.  Looks pretty amazing with a good cut.  Healthy hair isnt going to make your hair smooth if its not.  I use a shampoo bar a couple times a week max and I dont have to use a conditioner or any other products.  (I think using styling products makes it more necessary to wash more often but everyone is different) That said if OTC shampoos works for you then right on.  :-)",

        "body": "Yeah, I believe nopoo is not for everyone. I tried it for one year. I used BS and ACV. Workefd nicely for a while then it dried my hair. Then I tried water only and it worked pretty  well for a while, but my hair looked sticky and greasy.  My hair is very thin and curly. After a while I noticed that my hair got even thinner and my scalp was showing (not sure if it's stress or what). I've discovered that we have hard water at home and the build up was crazy on my head. So last month, I said srew it and went back to an slas shampoo (Johnson's baby shampoo). I do an oil treatment for 2 hours before washing it so the shampoo won't dry out my hair. I no longer use conditioners, I just use a tiny bit of olive oil and that's it.",

    "body": "Just making some lists of products that seem interesting to me by brand. :) ***Not in any particular order.***\n\nI have sensitive skin so they're gonna be a little biased towards that way. I'm listing the prices converted from the retail price in Korea so you can see whether you're outrageously overpaying if you do decide to go look for any of these online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SIDMOOL**\n\nMost products from this brand seem to fragrance-free. They're quite popular in Korea, it looks like. Sensitive skin-friendly, mid-range to very affordable price, good performance/rave reviews. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mu73nuoc8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3671e9c6328bb8cab34a24366fac08d06ace645f\n\n1. **Pure Bifida 95 Ampoule - 30ml/24,600 Won ($20.94)**\n\n*Bifida Ferment Lysate, Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nBifida ferment is the \"star\" ingredient that makes up most of the famed Estee Lauder night recovery serum if you didn't know (although it matters which strain was used apparently, same with SK-II & their dupes). It's said to strengthen your skin barrier over time and provide very slight, gentle exfoliation. Reviews for this Sidmool serum I have read on the Hwahae app do confirm that many people felt their skin became \"stronger\"/less sensitive. Many also said their skin tone & texture improved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmd5qi5e8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9d487bb091642b6ee3ea1e20e2b1f4cc276b0e4\n\n2. **Skin Sauce D Panthenol Ampoule - 12ml/11,800 Won ($10.04)**\n\n*Water, Panthenol, Pantolactone, Xanthan Gum, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root (Chinese Skullcap) Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root (Tree Peony) Extract.*\n\nPanthenol is a great barrier repairing ingredient. Research shows using 5-10% is the best for skin penetration. It's said to be very healing. Note the tiny size, however. 12 ml = 0.4 oz.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kc56mwli8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5deb3f6d7af94d6cd14851695dd3a721e599c8\n\n3. **Madagascar Real Moisture Cream - 80g/23,800 Won ($20.26)**\n\n*Centella Asiatica, Glycerin, Hydrogenated lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Paeonia Suffruticosa (Tree Peony) Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis (Chinese Skullcap) Root Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ethyl Undecylenate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Erythritol, Sorbitol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic acid, Asiatic acid, Astaxanthin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Beta-Glucan, Panthenol, Vaccinium Angustifolium Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Ficus Carica Fruit Extract, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Nut Extract, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nThis lightweight gel-cream (Koreans call watery/hydrating creams \"soo boon cream\" meaning \"moisture cream\") is a crowd-pleaser, starring centella and many other soothing ingredients such as Chinese skullcap extract, allantoin, licorice root (the soothing component, not the skin-lightening), and madecassoside. It also has polyglutamic acid, beta-glucan, and hyaluronic acid as humectants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qi4q3uak8ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0af940dc986ca78892585f4a03d2fd7b23a3b96a\n\n4. **Honey Peptide Moisture Pack - 40ml/9,800 Won ($8.43)**\n\n*Honey Extract(40%), Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Hyaluronic Acid, Sorbitol, Propolis Extract,Royal Jelly Extract, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Beta-Glucan, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Caffeoyl Tripeptide-1, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Glycine Max (Soybean) Seed Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Butylene Glycol, Sucrose, Fructose, Glucose, Trehalose, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allantoin, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Glucosylrutin, Arginine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\nA lightweight, gel-textured sleeping pack. This has been #1 for sleeping packs for a while now, too. Reviewers say this is very hydrating. It's absolutely *stuffed full* of humectants: honey, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, sugars, beta-glucan, collagen, and peptides. Some soothing ingredients as well, allantoin, licorice root & extracts. Very dry skinned people said it wasn't enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfr8w5oo8ku31.jpg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfdcfdfe41ba52ad5d588187902b7d00420478a4\n\n5. **Calendula Ampoule Moisture Cream - 80ml/16,800 Won ($14.30)**\n\n*Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Glycerin, Calendula Officinalis Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Cholesterol, Glyceryl Stearate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Curcuma Longa (Tumeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Water, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Xanthan Gum, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Heptyl Undecylenate, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\nA gel-cream with skin-soothing calendula flower as the star. Other soothing, anti-inflammatory extracts make an appearance here, as well as ceramides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7f77tcs8ku31.jpg?width=280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd7d7db952d0ec115a2a39a569a337f661ac0789\n\n6. **Idebenone Firming Ampoule - 32ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Rosa Canina (Dog-Rose) Fruit Extract, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydroxydecyl Ubiquinone, Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Adenosine, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Human Oligopeptide-1, rh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Acetly Hexapeptide-8, Copper Tripeptide-1, Ethyhexylglycerin.*\n\nIdebenone is the synthetic version of the powerful antioxidant, CoQ10/ubiquinone. CoQ10 molecules are really big though, so it has trouble penetrating. Idebenone has smaller molecules so it can do the job better. I heard that the patent on idebenone ended recently, so maybe we can see more of this goodie in future products. There are also peptides in this ampoule, as well as some soothing & firming ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdnxp8cu8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72616b051ce0532bd51287099a4e28de9871ec0f\n\n7. **Green Tea Peeling Gel - 120ml/4,800 Won ($4.09)**\n\n*Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water(10%), Glycerin, Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Betaine,Beta-Glucan, Arginine, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Allantoin, Sodium Polyglutamate, Carbomer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Hydroxide, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil.*\n\nThis is wildly popular, being so affordable. It's a nice, basic peeling gel. Fragranced with lavender essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cvgwgvv8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b79356fcf60cdd09f5435cd76817e90c5f036c1\n\n8. **Jojoba Lip Essence \\[Original Moisture\\] - 13ml/3,800 Won ($3.23)**\n\n*Polyisobutene, Petrolatum, Diisostearyl Malate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Microcrystalline Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Royal Jelly Extract, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Tocopheryl Acetate*\n\nThis lil' lip balm has been #1 on the Hwahae app for a while now. Which surprises me, personally, as the Korean skincare community is going through a major \"EWG is best source/natural is better\" moment right now. But hey, I guess if it works, it works. Fragranced with orange essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz9arxe39ku31.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff34a25e8bccfe68e01a8ccc85e304df7b1b0826\n\n9. **Saccharo Ferment Therapy Essence - 60ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Saccharomyces/Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Allantoin, Human Oligopeptide-1, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Water.*\n\nI think some of Missha fermented products use Saccharomyces. Whenever you see a ferment ingredient/whatever extract, that means that plant has been fermented to make the nutrients in it more bioavailable for us. Supposedly the fermentation process releases lots more goodies than just using the extract alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/myfq67u59ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecfc805f707759f790b86d6dd65460379b6c9674\n\n10. **Saccharo Ferment Sparkle First Ampoule - 100ml/49,000 Won ($41.70)**\n\n*Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Polyglutamic Acid, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract.*\n\nGalactomyces = SK-II, Bifida = Estee Lauder, though which strains are trade secret or something. A very simple ampoule with ferments, a humectant and some plant extracts. They do have a cream version as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0w9k8ta9ku31.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41a8cd57bde651c10bf016cd3d6cea4a2799e937\n\n11. **Saccharo Essential Mist - 60ml/18,000 Won ($15.32)**\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Beta-Glucan, Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin, Paeonia Suffructicosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6471tkd9ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5903dcfdcc876d4365879230722e61b4da4c2130\n\n12. **Honey Peptide Mist - 60ml/8,600 Won ($7.32)**\n\n*Honey Extract, Water, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Stem Extract, Glycerin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sorbitol, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Beta-Glucan, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Caffeoyl Tripeptide-1, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Butylene Glycol, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allantoin, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.*\n\nA watery, soothing mist with honey, propolis, royal jelly, collagen and peptides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfoo0nzf9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b834384913e4a2a6161fb10bfeed8aeeee4e647\n\n13. **The Calming Essence - 50ml/18,600 Won ($15.83)**\n\nArtemisia Capillaris (Mugwort - Capillary Wormwood) Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Arginine, Cabomer, Pantolactone, Xanthan Gum, 1,2-Hexanediol.\n\nA very simple, soothing mugwort, panthenol, allantoin, and licorice root essence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0fj8zdi9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=915ee84ef3cb6c1dec999de951abe84a8b268783\n\n14. **Dr. Troub Bio Repair Powder Cleanser - 60g/15,600 Won ($13.27)**\n\n*Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Disodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Sobitol, Cellulose Gum, Scutellaria Bicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Artemisia Princeps (Mugwort - Korean Mugwort/Korean Wormwood) Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Citrus Junos Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Human Oligopeptide-1, Acetyl hexapeptide-8, Copper Tripeptide-1, Citric Acid, Arbutin, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower/Leaf Extract, Allantoin.*\n\n\\[Second cleanser\\] An SLS-free powder foaming wash. The surfactants in this (Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate & Disodium Lauroyl glutamate) are extremely gentle surfactants often used for cleansers targeted toward babies and sensitive skin. They're more expensive but provide a bunch of non-stripping foam. We see a lot more of these sort of surfactants in recent years because of the bad rep Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate have gotten, which are used widely because of their cheap cost (whether they are gentle or not depends on the formula and what other surfactants they have been mixed with).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8jz1gqk9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1943c1bb896d85a41596a26febcc48e6a47a684\n\n15. **Dr. Troub Skin Returning Cleansing Milk - 200ml/13,600 Won ($11.57)**\n\n*Water, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Decyl Glucoside, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Diheptyl Succinate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Milk Protein Extract, Allantoin, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n\\[First Cleanser\\] This is a popular cleansing milk that you use like you use an oil cleanser (rub into dry face with dry hands). to remove sunscreen and makeup. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1w3vw2xp9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b0abeef20e0d4ee0787e6101c376d2e70fbb4c3\n\n16. **Galatokside Real Peptide Barrier Moisture Soo Boon Cream - 50ml/29,800 won ($25.36)**\n\n*Copper Tripeptide-1, Glactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Paeonia Suffructicosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Betaine, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Sucrose, Fructose, Glucose, Polyglutamic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium PCA, Beta-Glucan, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Tocopherol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Adenosine, Arginine, 1,2-Hexanediol.* \n\nA nice, soothing cream with tons of humectants/peptides, and centella components. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3ur5mms9ku31.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=480295636783722d34de21a551c16f1fd5a2c4d5\n\n17. **Madagascar Centella Skin - 150ml/14,800 Won ($12.59)**\n\n*Centella Asiatica Extract(97%), Butylene Glycol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol.* \n\nRemember that toners are referred to as \"Skin\" in Korea (Japan = lotion). A simple, calming toner all about centella and soothing licorice and other plant extracts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jittu4x9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c068d9ca9b0ad1830d93a384cfafef950eeebe0c\n\n18. **Eggplant Ampoule - 50ml/22,800 Won ($19.40)**\n\n*Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract**,* *Water**,* *Butylene Glycol**,* *1,2-Hexanediol**,* *Fructose**,* *Sorbitol**,* *Maltitol**,* *Hyaluronic Acid**,* *Sodium Pca**,* *Lupeol**,* *Sodium Hyaluronate**,* *Hydroxyethylcellulose**,* *Sodium Chloride* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6p1j3qf0aku31.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ece7d4d75dea064bfd4febe2f0f610148e9569c\n\n19. **Ferment Care Thermal Mineral Water - 125ml/14,800 Won ($12.60)**\n\n*Onsen-sui, Morus Alba (White Mulberry) Bark Extract, Lactobacillus/Honeysuckle Flower Extract, Cimicifunga Dahurica (Black Cohosh) Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum (Chinese Rhubarb) Root/Stalk Extract, Platycodon Grandiflorus (Balloon Flower) Root Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Extract, Sophora Flavescens (Ku Shen) Root Extract, Rubia Cordifolia (Manjistha) Root Extract, Coptis Japonica (Japanese Gold Thread) Extract, Lithospermum Officinale (European Stoneseed) Extract, Taraxacum Platycarpum (Korean Dandelion) Extract, Pueraria Thunbergiana (Kudzu) Root Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum (Korean Pepper) Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana (Korean Pasque Flower) Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract.*\n\nI like thermal water, idk. I thought there would be more ferments in this, given the name, but I guess not. Thermal water does have a light soothing effect/deposit minerals onto your skin. I thought it was just boring water in a can too, but Labmuffin has a post on it; It's interesting. Korean Pasque Flower is called \"Hal-mi-Kkhot\" meaning \"granny flower\", lol. Because the flower part droops down towards the ground, like how grandmas walk stooped down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqs0h5n2aku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b15d061d15804a54905cf44c73c01d3c8e78da3\n\n20. **Mega Peptide Eco Hydro Soothing Cream - 60ml/28,400 Won ($24.18)**\n\n*Bambusa Vulgaris (Bamboo) Water, Copper Tripeptide-1, Glycerin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic.Capric Triglyceride, Pentapeptide-20, Nicotinoyl Tripeptide-1, sh-Octapeptide-4, sh-Decapeptide-7, sh-Oligopeptide-9, sh-Pentapeptide-19, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Panthenol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Diopyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorce) Root Extract, Punica Granatum (Pomegranate) Seed Oil, Propolis Extract, Chamomilla Recutica (Matricaria) Flower/Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Olibanum, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol (Vitamin E).* \n\nSidmool sure loves peptides! This one seems just loaded. Lots of soothing/calming stuff in here as well. Unfortunately, it is fragranced with lavender essential oil, if you are sensitive to that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSidmool has loads of other things but my fingers are tired ok.",

    "body": "Hello, new to this community. I recently messed up my skin barrier and was developing some fungal acne. My skin had lots of redness, itching, rough bumpy texture, and a dry yet oily/waxy feeling. These products helped me out a bit. I searched the ingredients through sezia and found 2 of the products where completely safe. The rest contained 1 “possible” trigger. Posted this here in case someone was looking for other options/safe products. Of course, skincare is individual, and not one size fits all. But, hopefully this helps someone. \n\n1. Briotech Topical skin spray (100% safe)- $14. It’s a hypochlorous acid spray. Hypochlorous acid is electrolyzed water. It smells slightly of chlorine while wet/liquid, once dry it turns to salt water. Non-toxic, or irritating. It’s what’s added to tap water to make sure it’s safe for drinking. It’s a good disinfectant on surfaces. As well as being skin safe and eye safe. It’s prescribed to treat certain eye conditions such as pink eye, helps heal styes, and eliminate eyelash mites. It’s also great for eczema and psoriasis prone skin, because it helps kill irritating skin mites. Helps promote wound healing etc...All in all a great gentle product for helping keep bacteria at bay on the skin, without further compromising your skins moisture barrier. I like to mist it on my face throughout the day, and on my face mask to kill bacteria. Doesn’t sting or burn. \n\n2. Prosacea rosacea gel-$10 (100% safe). Ingredients: 10% sulfur, Acrylates, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Diazolidinyl Urea, Lactose, Methylparaben, Propylene Glycol, Propylparaben, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water. *Nice sulfur option in a gentle base. \n\n3. La roche posay effaclar gel cleanser $14- it’s a zinc pca based face wash that’s a less drying alternative to zinc shampoos and nizoral. Formulated with a 5.5 ph for the face. Sezia flagged 1 ingredient for being a possible trigger, while folliculitisscout said it was safe. I’ve always had luck with this wash helping my skin recover from fungal acne. They flagged the peg-120 which is a surfactant and emulsifier. *Ingredients: AQUA / WATER / EAU, SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE, PEG-8, COCO-BETAINE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PEG-120 METHYL GLUCOSE DIOLEATE, ZINC PCA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, CITRIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PARFUM / FRAGRANCE\n\n4. Zapzyt acne wash $5- 2% salicylic acid cleanser. This feels so gentle and soothing compared to other acne cleansers. *Ingredients: Purified Water, Disodium EDTA, Chamomile Extract, Aloe Vera Gel, Bioterge AS-40, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glucamate DOE-120, Glydate, Sodium Chloride. Folliculitisscout says it’s safe, while sezia flagged 1 ingredient: glutamate doe-120, which is a plant derived thickener, and helps reduce irritation from certain surfactants. \n\n5. Clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel- lightweight moisturizer, more hydrating than sebamed gel. I like to add some squalane when I need a bit more moisture. The glycerin was flagged.*Ingredients: Water, Dimethicone, Isododecane, Butylene Glycol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Glycerin, Laminaria Saccharina Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Saccharomyces Lysate Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract/Extrait D'Orge, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seedcake, Caffeine, Trehalose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria), Polysilicone-11, Silica, Propylene Glycol Dicaprate, Oleth-10, Lactobacillus Ferment, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Carbomer, Caprylyl Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Tromethamine, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Yellow 5 (Ci 19140), Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 6 (Ci 15985) Lotion.",

    "body": "You guys seemed to have an enthusiastic response to my [previous post about my great experiences using Lush Henna Hair dye.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LushCosmetics/comments/dzjtnx/guys_i_used_the_henna_hair_dye_last_night_and/) I thought I’d post a couple reviews of some products I have tried for you guys. I know I LOVE hearing other people’s experiences with different products, and how they review them.  \n\nI thought I’d post about the Shampoo and Conditioner products that I’ve tried so far.  For background information, I have medium length hair that air dries into a bouncy, but frizzy, curl (note, the frizz has come down a bit and the bounce has gotten bouncier since using henna). It leans towards the thin side of the spectrum, but closer to average thickness I think. I spent the last few months on a hardcore mission to re-train my hair to be washed less often.  I’m a serial shampooer, and the devastation this has caused to my hair should be a felony. It’s been 5 months, and my mission has been a huge success.  I went from daily (sometimes multiple) shampooing to shampooing an average of 2 times a week and my hair is MUCH happier about it.\n\n# [Honey I Washed My Hair Shampoo Bar](https://www.lushusa.com/hair/shampoo-bars/honey-i-washed-my-hair/05563.html)\n\nHIWMH is the first naked shampoo I have ever used.  I thought it just smelled so yummy, so I was excited to take it home and try it.  It smells deliciously sweet, so if the sweeter scents aren’t really your preference, this may not be the shampoo for you.  This bar lathers up incredibly, and it’s no surprise as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is the first ingredient.  If you find sulfates to be too harsh on your hair, this shampoo bar is probably not the one for you.  I usually have no problem with SLS, but I do get that ‘too clean’ almost rubbery feeling with this shampoo as I’m rinsing it out, and my hair doesn’t get that soft smooth feel I usually like when I’m rinsing under the tap.  Out of the shower, my hair smells very nice and it does feel clean, but could be a bit softer or shinier. I find I only need about 2-3 passes over my hair, or just a couple rubs between my hands to get enough product for a wash.  I let this product dry on a towel after using, and stored it in a round lush tin when not in use. As the bar has shrunken down, I have found it to become soft and pliable, however this has not affected its efficacy and It still works just like the first time.  Overall, I would say HIWMH is a decent shampoo, but having now tried other naked bars, I don’t think I will be repurchasing this one.\n\n# [American Cream Conditioner Bar](https://www.lushusa.com/hair/conditioners/american-cream/08956.html)\n\nAmerican Cream is the first (and only) naked conditioner I have ever used.  American Cream is a classic Lush scent that I have a confusing relationship with.  I cannot decide if I like it or if I dislike it.  Lush describes it as having a “strawberry milkshake” scent, but I have a very difficult time placing that.  I pick up spicy notes in it, which I assume is the Sage and Lavender Oils. I can maybe KINDA sorta smell that strawberry milkshake smell when my hair dries, but I have to really reach for it. All that said, I keep buying products with this scent, so I guess I do like it. I work this bar between my hands pretty vigorously to get it worked into a slightly creamy consistency.  This bar takes a lot more work than the shampoo bar to feel like I’ve got enough product for my hair.  After working it between my hands, I rub both my hands and then the bar itself all over my hair.  I actually find what works best for me is to kind of wrap my hair around the bar and slide it down a few times.  I hold it pretty firmly to really rub the conditioner onto my tresses. Once I have what feels like a good amount on my hair, I put the bar away and start massaging it into the length of my hair.  I tend to get a few good sized pink chunks in my hair, so i be sure to really rub them in and spread it throughout the strands.  I then use a wide tooth comb to distribute and detangle.  Then I let it sit on my hair while I finish the rest of my shower.  I find I have to rinse this out super thoroughly.  I work it super well with my finger tips, and then finish with a wide tooth comb under the tap.  I finish with a rinse with cold water. Despite this conditioner bar being a little bit more work than a traditional liquid product, I find it makes my hair very soft and bouncy.  It’s easily detangled after using, and despite my conflict with the American Cream scent, I find the light fragrance it leaves behind to be much more pleasant then while using it in the shower. I let the bar dry on a towel after use, and store it in a square Lush tin, and it does not get soft like my experience with the HIWMH shampoo bar.  Overall, I really like this conditioner bar, and have repurchased it.  I’ll most likely continue to use this conditioner until Lush releases another that catches my eye.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Coconut Rice Cake Shampoo Bar](https://www.lushusa.com/hair/shampoo-bars/coconut-rice-cake/09207.html)\n\nCoconut Rice Cake shampoo bar is the second shampoo bar that I tried, and it won me over the first time I used it.  It has a light coconut scent that I find enjoyable.  The flower on the top looks really pretty when you buy it, but if you don't remove it before use (I did not) it looks kinda gross once it gets wet.  It lathers great, as the first ingredient is Sodium Coco Sulfate.  Full disclosure- I had to google what SCS was.  It's made with similar fatty acids and such as SLS is, however there hasn't been much research on whether or not it can be just as stripping to your hair as SLS is.  If sulfates are a concern for your hair, you might want to skip this product. I personally do feel like it is more gentle on my hair than HIWMH was.  I use this product the same way I use the other shampoo and conditioner bars- by rubbing it between my hands a couple times and running the lather through my hair, or just rubbing the bar across my hair 2 or 3 times. My hair felt soft when I was rinsing the shampoo out under the tap, something that I distinctly did not feel with HIWMH. I use this bar in conjunction with the American Cream conditioner bar, and my results have been fantastic.  My hair is soft, clean, and since beginning use, my frizz has reduced.  I love this shampoo bar, and will continue to use it for the forseable future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [No Drought Dry Shampoo](https://www.lushusa.com/hair/shampoo/no-drought/9999903589.html)\n\nI have really struggled to find a dry shampoo that works well for me. Traditional shampoos have a propellant and sometimes just leave a damp feeling if you’re not constantly shaking the can while your spraying.  No Drought is just a simple powder, and because of this, I find it works beautifully for my hair. The smaller 1.9oz bottle is lasting me a surprisingly long time.  I use it 1-2x a week, usually on the 3rd day after shampooing. Depending on my needs that day, I will either gently squeeze the bottle to “puff” some powder directly onto my hair, or pour some into the palm of my hand and use a powder brush to work it into my hair.  I used to be self conscious about using dry shampoo, afraid it would be obvious that I hadn’t shampoo’d that day. But with No Drought, My hair feels fresh, clean, and bouncy and I will leave it down on days I use it (which I never did with other brands of dry shampoo. It has a light citrusy scent, which is no surprise as Lush says it contains Lemon, Grapefruit and Lime oil. I really like this dry shampoo, and I plan on repurchasing, possibly in the larger size, once this bottle is empty.\n\n# [Avocado Co-Wash](https://www.lushusa.com/hair/shampoo/avocado-co-wash/05940.html)\n\nI was super curious about Avocado Co-Wash from my first visit into Lush. In my quest to shampoo my hair less often, I decided to try using cleansing conditioner (The No-Poo Method for the young and trendy among us). I on my next trip to Lush, I asked for a sample of Avocado Co-Wash and they happily obliged.  This product is definitely softer than the other naked hair products, so be sure not to leave it in the wet steamy shower when you’re done using it.  I let it Dry on a towel before I store it.  I store it in an empty clear jelly-mask pot. It has a soft citrus fruit scent thanks to bergamot oil.  The ingredients list Sodium Laureth Sulfate as included in the formula, so if your hair is sensitive to sulfates, you might need to skip this one. I use this product on the 3rd or 4th day after washing my hair, when I want to wash it, but with something a little gentler than the shampoo bars. This bar does not lather, but don’t worry.  I work the bar between my wet hands and it will begin to get creamy.  Then I run my hands through my hair, and then rub the bar over it a few times before massaging it into my scalp and strands.  I follow by working it through my hair with a wide tooth comb.  I leave the co-wash on my hair while I finish the rest of my shower.  When I’m ready to rinse it out, I wash it out under the tap.  I finish with a cold water rinse. I had really positive results with this product.  My hair feels soft and looks clean, with one exception- one time I used it, I used less of a lather to wash, and I did find my hair still felt oilier than I’d hoped when I rinsed and dried it. Going forward, I’m going to spend a little extra time working the lather.  I like this product and how it makes my hair look, feel, and smell.  I’ll definitely be purchasing a full sized bar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo there you go, there are my thoughts on the Shampoo and Conditioner products I have tried.  I hope this was informative and will help some people that wanted some anecdotal information about these products.",

I used their conditioner as well, and for a while, it made my hair nice and soft.  \n\nThen all of a sudden, my hair started to get extremely dry and tangled all the time. I am talking self dread locking, small animal around the nape of my neck tangled.  I first chalked it up to being winter and my jacket/scarf being the culprit, but as we moved into and through summer, same problem.\n\nI started changing conditioners, trying different ones, but nothing seemed to help.  I tried protien treatments and that seemed to help. Then I realized, it was not the protien treatment that was helping but the aphogee shampoo for damaged hair which had SLS in it. \n\n I have been experimenting with this theory and it appears that whenever I shampoo with the aphogee and my regular conditioner its fine.  If I use the SLS free shampoos I have, tangled, dry mess. I am thinking that the more natural shampoos just dont cut it (literally), I think there is junk left on my hair, which means that the moisture from my conditioner isn't penetrating in there and also that junk likes to stick to junk, causing tangling.\n\nIs there any rhyme to my reason or am I totally off base here?

You can play around with the percentage according to how nourishing you want the soap to be. \n\nIf you find the soap is too liquid, you can add some more Lactic Acid but know that the soap will still firm up a bit in the first 24 hours. If too viscous, add water in small increments.\n\nThe 1% perfume concentration is typical for soaps. The perfume concentrate you're adding, should **not contain any ethanol**. DPG is a suitable solvent. \n\nAlso check whether each RM in your perfume formula is stable in liquid soap (most are). [Perfumersworld.com](http://Perfumersworld.com) is a good resource for checking. \n\nIf so inclined, also check the IFRA limits for **category 9**.\n\nThis is the only soap recipe I have made so far, so an expert I am not.

    "body": "So let me keep this brief if at all possible. I have been experiencing itching, swelling discomfort, and this crawling nerve issue in my vulvar region since September. I went to the gyno and she took a sample, lost it, and didn't give a freak about me and trying to make me feel better. At first my symptoms were mimicking a yeast infection, with thick discharge and everything. but once i did the second culture my yeast came back negative. Thinking about how I have had that issue in my past I just concluded that it was cytolytic vaginosis and was careful about my probiotic intake. I did the whole baking soda baths and it seemed to get a little better but it never went away. Then the crawly, creepy, almost vibrating feeling ramped up over the last few months. Pads made it sooo much worse as well. I finally decided to try Evvy - they said I was L. iners dominant and that I needed to increase good bacteria but I was hesitant so I took it slow. I started taking them and increased my good bacteria but i was still having symptoms. I then thought about it sooo hard like why did this just start, I was fine...what happened. I believe for the past few years I have had CV and I didn't know it but it always went away and came back around the week before my period. This isn't going away!! What the heck could it be?!?!\n\nI realized around the time that this started I switched detergents and was using the huge Costco tub of powder detergent. It has \\*\\*\\*sodium lauryl sulfate\\*\\*\\* which a lot of women are allergic to down there!! It is also in ALL of the free and gentle and clear detergents! They're all a crock - it is a less irritating version \"sodium laureth sulfate\". And beware of creams for itching, look at the ingredients!! the main one my Dr prescribed had that in it and made me worse!! \n\nThen I thought okay I will buy a detergent with nothing in it. So I did and my symptoms definitely improved but not the way I thought. Then I got this crazy idea to look into my vitamins. I started taking Vitex (chasteberry) for acne the same month I switched to Costco. Vitex causes ITCHY VULVA!!! It was also in my multivitamin!! Everyday I am covering myself with panties that are making me itch and ingesting something to make me worse. I could not believe it. LADIES! All multivitamins have \"hormone support\" now but that stuff really messes you up if you don't really need hormone support. Be vigilent!!! I stopped all the vitamins, all the detergents, and wear no panties when you can. I feel a lot better, I hope I can help just 1 person. \n\nJust go back to the basics ladies. ",

I got patch tested and determined which things I specifically was being irritated from and was told that everything else was safe for me. Trial and error like what OP has done can also work, but everyone is different!!! \n\nFiguring out what chemicals to eliminate can be tedious and costly - I recommend starting with fragrance and propylene glycol, then refer to the NAD80 list for chemicals known to cause irritation/allergies in a significant portion of the population. Like OP said, simplifying as much as possible is ideal, but we all have to rely on some products - you can patch test products on your inner arm (look for redness 2-5 days after contact). \n\nI don’t have as much experience with ingested compounds but this is a major treatment pathway for IC.",

    "body": "Hi, I would really appreciate some advice and recommendations.\n\n\nAs said in the title, I'm really allergic to coconut and anything coconut derived. This includes the ever present coco-betaine, as well as coconut diethanolamide, cocamide sulfate, cocamide DEA, CDEA, and basically anything else with \"coco\" somewhere in the name. In addition, I'm very sensitive to SLS (sodium laureth sulfate). \n\n\nI didn't have this problem nearly as much years ago as there were a lot of products that relied on palm oils or hemp oils and such, but it seems that coco-betaine has really taken the haircare world by storm and I am really struggling now to find any haircare products that don't contain either coconut derived ingredients or that don't contain SLS and similar acne/itching inducing sulfates. All products I used to use from child to adulthood that my hair loved have now reformulated to use coconut based cleaners. Don't get me wrong- ethically and environmentally I support the move away from palm oil etc, but it puts me in a serious bind! \n\n\nThe extra injury to insult is that I was hit by a semi truck two years ago that left me with a traumatic brain injury and I'm still struggling to recover. One of the things I still really have trouble with is reading, and searching through long complicated ingredient lists for any and all of the many forms of coconut is a task that seems precisely calculated to be what I'm worst at. This means that I keep making mistakes and buying products that I think are safe, or, I've checked ingredients online and they check out but then I start having a reaction and realize that what I bought at the store has the same name but a different ingredient list than what I read about! My fiance has been an absolute saint helping me with so many daily tasks and with the medical and insurance paperwork that I've been overwhelmed with in addition to supporting us both since the accident that I feel terrible asking him to devote even more time to meticulously reading conditioner bottles when he has so much on his plate.\n\n\nSo, I'm hoping that the Reddit community might be willing to help me find a product that I can use and rely on! I really really appreciate your kindness in advance, I know it is an annoying task but I could really use your help.\n\n\n***\n\n\n**Hair type:** Thick, wavy probably 2A\n\n**Current Routine:** Trying to do co-wash only because a) my hair seemed to like it and b) I can't find a shampoo I can use anyway. Wash with conditioner every 3-4 days, squish to condish, rinse thoroughly (I still seem to break out on my back if I do any leave in)\n\n**Current product:** Shea Moisture raw Shea butter restorative conditioner\n\n**Current problems:** Although this conditioner miraculously doesn't contain anything I'm allergic to, I find that my scalp is really itchy and my hair is very dry and prone to tangling and breaking. It weirdly feels like I'm almost not even using conditioner it seems so rough and tangled even just after washing. I've also been having increasingly annoying dandruff and I don't know what I should do about it as I haven't had that problem before I had to switch from my last product when it started containing coco-betaine. I've also in the past used Garnier Whole Blends repairing conditioner \"honey treasures\" which is also ok allergy wise (at least, last I checked) but I found it left my hair fairly heavy and itchy too without using shampoo, and when I put it into the curly girl ingredient checker it says it's not very CG friendly.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any other information, I would very sincerely appreciate some help figuring out what to do!",

I'm new here, and I'm on a mission to have hair that isn't gross and oily by the end of the day.\n\nI have very fine, straight, oily, non-colored hair that goes to just below my shoulders in length. It's a dark blonde, and when it gets oily, it looks gross and wet. Disgusting, really. I have always been a slave to daily washing, and used crappy products. I have lived with the philosophy that conditioner should never go above the ears, and will make your hair oilier if you put in on your scalp. \n\nRecently, a friend recommended Davines NouNou shampoo and conditioner, and swore that it allowed her to go 48-72 hours between washes without getting oily. I have been trying to do this, and using dry shampoo on days that I don't wash. However, it's been a month now, and I am still heavily dependent on the dry shampoo on my no-wash days, and I don't like the way it makes my hair feel. Looking at the ingredients, it contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate, which I'm given to understand is better than Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, but still bad. It also has amodimethicone which I'm guessing is a silicone. \n\nAnyway, I'm rambling now. Apologies for the wall of text. After discovering this subreddit, I am seeking your advice. How can I get to the point where I don't need to wash my hair every day? Are there any products you can recommend that are available at Target? That's easier for me, cause I have a weird housing/mailing situation, but I can also get things from Amazon if necessary. Does conditioner belong on my roots? Thanks in advance!!",

        "body": "I also have fine, straight hair with an oily scalp. Because of daily washing and shampooing with harsh sufactants, my scalp was dry but overly oily. My hairs would get greasy by the end of the day, and you can see the hairs clumping together from the grease. After slowly transitioning to a CO-washing method and clipping my shorter hairs back, I am able to go days without shampooing; I now shampoo about once a week. The decrease in oil production was probably because my scalp was irritated from the constant shampooing, and along with that, I was also shampooing every day. This constant irritation was stripping my scalp of moisture and sebum, which probably led to a higher sebum production to compensate for the lack of moisture and my scalp trying to retain what little moisture it had.\n\nGood thing you took a look at the ingredients in your hair products, because those aren't really suitable for CO-washing. You might still want to keep the shampoo to use a clarifying shampoo. \n\nYou can check the [Product Recommendations](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/product_reviews) page to see if you can pick up any of those products. Otherwise, check out the [CO-washing guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1m0g7c/conditioner_only_method_cowashing/) to see what ingredients to avoid or to look for.",

I had bought it as a trial from Smytten\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Cherry Blossom, Charcoal Powder, Tea Tree, Aloe Vera leaf juice.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua\n Decyl Glucoside \nLauryl Sarcosinate\nCarbomer\nPhenoxyethanol\nSugar\nPropane Glycol\nGlycerine\nSodium Cocoamphoacetate\nDMDM Hydantoin\nPolyquat 10\nEDTA\nAloe Vera Leaf Juice\nActivated Charcoal Powder\nTea Tree essential oil\nPeppermint essential oil\nCherry blossom essential oil\n\n**Claims:** Paraben free, cruelty free, formulated with 100% natural ingredients\n\n**Texture:** Black liquid\n\n**Packaging:** Tube/Bottle\n\n**Usage:** For a few weeks\n\n**My Experience:** This was my first attempt at a charcoal based product. The idea that it removes blackheads & whiteheads from a mere face wash drew me in. But sadly, this didn’t do anything. \n\nI know that pores don’t open or close, but this facewash made me think as if they are opening wide. My skin looked weird. This facewash felt harsh, stinged my eyes that eventually I threw it away. \n\nI’ve gotta ask, Is it worth trying a charcoal based products or are they all farce?\n\n\n**➡️Plum Green Tea Pore Cleansing Wash**\n\n**MRP:** Rs. 495/- for 120 ml\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Glycolic Acid, Green Tea Extracts, Natural Cellulose Beads\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua (Water), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Carbomer, Cellulose, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fda Approved Colours, Fragrance, Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate\n\n**Claims:** Free of parabens, SLS & mineral oil, vegan, cruelty free. Suited for oily, acne prone, combination skin\n\n**Texture:** Transparent liquid with green granules type beads\n\n**Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Usage:** A few times\n\n**My Experience:** It was pretty okay. I didn’t enjoy either the fragrance or the texture. It has tiny green granules, granules not beads that usually absorb into your skin on pressing between your fingers. Due to it, it has felt like a mild scrub than a facewash and I’m not comfortable using a scrub like product on my face daily.\n\nIt also felt mildly harsh on my skin, which is why after a few uses, I was easily turned off. \n\nI still have the product left, that I’m now using to clean makeup brushes. It might work on other skins, but not for me. \n\n**➡️Re’equil Fruit AHA Face Wash**\n\n**MRP:** Rs. 490/- for 200 ml\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Fruit AHAs\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Decyl Glucoside, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Aqua, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/​Leaf Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Betaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate, Buteth-3, Tributyl Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Ci 19140, Ci 45100\n\n**Claims:** Free of parabens, sulphates, silicones & mineral oil.\n \n**Texture:** Yellow coloured fluid. (almost looks like Pee)\n\n**Fragrance:** No fragrance\n\n**Packaging:** Bottle\n\n**Usage:** A few times\n\n**My Experience:** This is the harshest facewash I’ve ever used in my life. The texture is so watery but generates foam easily after coming in contact with water. However, after every wash, my skin felt very tight, which  is why after a few washes, I stopped using it.\n\nSeeing as I still had some product left, I decided to use it instead of shower gel. Damn, My skin felt so smooth after first wash that since then, I’ve been using them as Shower gels for Bath. \n\nI wouldn’t recommend this facewash to anyone seeing how harsh it was compared to other facewash.

You don't have to follow the CG method if you don't want it to be curly, but for products that would be good for your hair I'd check out r/curlyhair.\n\n\nIt'll be an uphill battle to get your hair to a place of relative health if you're going to continue straightening. I personally have curly hair that I bleach and color regularly, so I feel that pain. But taking care of your curls in between straightening treatments will be the best thing you can do.

    "body": "23 year old male. Started noticing hair loss around 2 years ago but never really gave it that much importance. Figured it was bound to happen anyway (saw it happen to my father and my older brother). I should also mention that I've been using regular cheap shampoos my entire life. Some time around October last year, I was shopping for a new shampoo bottle when I stumbled upon a Clear shampoo bottle that said \"Anti Hair Fall - Nutrium 10\". Alrighty then, looks good enough. First time using it my scalp was itching so hard, I thought \"oh lolol must be the anti-hairfall stuff working its magic\". It also seemed to make my hair really dry and frizzy (by stripping it of all its natural oils I guess). Over the next few weeks, my scalp seemed to get used to it and there was no more itching after showers. \n\nToday I saw a 6 months old picture of myself, and then looked at myself in the mirror. I was shocked. I realized that not only the shampoo wasn't working, but it might have been actually making it worse. After 2 hours of furious googling and reading about shampoo ingredients, I found out that this one had a lot of bad stuff in it: Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Dimethiconol, Peg-4, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium sorbate, Propylene glycol... So I ran to our town's supermarket and spent another hour reading the backs of shampoo bottles.. Apparently out of the 10 available brands, only Johnson's baby shampoo wasn't as bad as the stuff I've been using. It's my only option for now until I can maybe talk to a specialist or visit a bigger supermarket. And no, I can't order something from the sidebar online because I live in a third world country where you're not allowed to buy stuff online... Sigh..\n\nWhy did I post this? I honestly don't know.. I've just felt like sharing. I was very mad at first, and now I'm just depressed. I feel like I've neglected my hair for so long and now the damage is probably beyond repair. Take it as a PSA.. Don't just buy a shampoo because it says it does something on the front of the bottle. Check the ingredients, read about them, and read online reviews if you can find any. \n\nA few articles about the ingredients you should avoid:\n\n[Article 1](http://naturalhaireverything.tumblr.com/post/3253973196/10-ingredients-to-avoid-putting-on-your-hair)\n\n[Article 2](http://www.epochinspired.com/inspired/1093460-17-harmful-shampoo-ingredients-to-avoid/)\n\n[Article 3](http://livelovefruit.com/12-toxic-ingredients-to-avoid-in-shampoo/)",

        "body": "If you noticed your hair started thinning two years ago, I hate to break it to you, but it may be worse over 6 months on its own and not due to the shampoo. \n\nIf it was from the shampoo, however, the good news is that it's likely to just be excess shedding due to the irritants aggravating your scalp, something of which the intense itching was likely a symptom, so the healthy follicles you still have will produce new hairs again in time. \n\nHowever, male pattern baldness occurs as the follicles (think of them like the little holes in your scalp that the hairs grow out of) begin to die and no longer grow hair. If the shampoo caused hair shed, unfortunately, the follicles that were dying may not regrow hair as the next phase in the hair cycle begins. \n\nIf you're concerned about your hair continuing to thin, now would be the time to start using a product like Rogaine. It won't grow hair from the follicles that have already died, but it will help out the ones that have been on their way out, and it can also help to slow down the overall thinning process.",

    "body": "Hello Ladies! I thought I would create this post as I haven’t seen a very detailed thread about hair care yet. We often talk about skincare and beneficial or terrible ingredients here and on the wider web, however I always think hair care is never as thoroughly investigated. I’m a total newbie at hair styling, however I will blow my own trumpet and say after years of research and trial and error I’m pretty good at hair care. This will probably be very long even without me going into lots of detail, but feel free to ask in comments for more detail on specific things that interest you and I will expand. Also chime in with any extra info, especially if you’re curly haired! My experience and knowledge is more based in straight and slightly wavy hair. \n\nA disclaimer – proper hair care can be time consuming and require lots of trial and error at first, it did for me and everyone who I know is really into it too, but in my opinion it is worth it. It doesn’t have to be pricy though, there are lots of great cheap products! Once you find what works for you though, you will really reap the benefits for life. \n\n\nSo, let’s start!\n\n\n**Finding out the true state of your hair**\n\nMost likely you use silicones on your hair (a lot of products contain them), and silicones coat your hair, make it soft, sometimes weigh it down. They cover a lot of hair care sins. To find out the true condition of your hair, you will need to strip it of silicones. To do this, you will need to use a shampoo with a fairly strong detergent, sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), or sodium coco-sulfate are often shunned, however they are great for removing silicones from hair. You can then apply a non-silicone conditioner, and then wait for your hair to dry naturally. At this stage, you will see how good (or bad) a condition your hair is really like. It may still be looking great, but you may get quite a shock and decide you need quite the chop. I know I did the first time I cleansed my hair properly. It went from being fairly soft albeit a bit flat with just some split ends, to dry, tangled, and extremely brittle on the bottom 10cm. It looked matted. I took off a third of my length immediately and then a few months later another 5cm or so. I will edit this later once I find some before photos of my hair, and I will also do a current photo with my hair free of silicones.\n\n**Figuring out your hair porosity**\nHair porosity is your hair’s ability to absorb moisture. There is theoretically a simple test [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/40/3d/62/403d621b14f0c8c63e04ec9b61c02508.png) you can do, however over time you may find the result of it wasn’t 100%. I have medium porosity, meaning my hair absorbs moisture okay and keeps it for a decent amount of time. Low porosity hair doesn’t absorb moisture easily, however once it does, the moisture stays for a very long time. This can lead to product build up which will need to be cleansed regularly. Low porosity often requires using heat to absorb moisture (such as putting on a hair mask, a plastic shower cap and blowing hot air at it). High porosity hair absorbs moisture quickly, but it also lets it out quickly. Often requires good conditioning, but may also require cleansing from time to time. It will often feel frizzy, and humidity will have a big impact on high porosity hair. Unfortunately, you can’t really change the porosity of your hair, but you can definitely care for it! \n\n\n**Ingredients and Products**\n\nI have to say, compared to the east, the west has actually rather limited hair care options. Most high street and even salon brands are really not fantastic. I live in the UK, but I source most of my products from Eastern Europe, so for those of you in the US my specific recommendations might not be too much help, but you might be able to find some or find alternatives by looking at the ingredients list. \n\n**Ingredients**\n\nThere isn’t really a super easy way to go about this. After a year or so I learnt the names of ingredients that really work or don’t work for me and I look for or avoid them. [Here]( http://www.tightlycurly.com/ingredients/) is a good ingredients list which tells you what the ingredient is and what it is used for. It does also have a ‘good’ ‘okay’ ‘avoid’ rating system, however I wouldn’t necessarily take it into consideration, as how a lot of ingredients affect you is personal (for example some people’s hair responds well to sulfates or paraffin, others not so much). \n\nThe order of the ingredients list is not accidental. The further from the top, the less of that ingredient there is. Any beneficial ingredient listed after ‘parfum’ is not going to bring you any results, as it is basically a trace, however something that you are sensitive to can still have a negative effect on your scalp even at such trace amounts. \n\n*Things to look for*: \n\n*Oils* – any ingredient name that ends with oil (except mineral oil which is paraffin, more on this later!) is beneficial for hair. The more and the closer to the top of the list, the better, especially in masks and conditioners.\n\n*Extracts* – again any name that ends with extracts. These are extracts of naturally occurring plants, herbs, or even legumes which have different beneficial effects such as smoothing, adding shine, protecting or strengthening. \n\n*Emolients* – lanolin, anything with ‘butter’ (e.g. shea butter), cera alba (beeswax), pafarrinum liquidum (paraffin, more on this later)\n\n*Humectants* – glycerin, urea, mel (honey), aloe vera, fructose (sugars).\n\n*Antioxidants* – ascorbic acid (vit C), tocopherol (vit E), Ubiquinone (Q10), retinol/retinyl acelate/palmiatate (vit A), niacinamide (vit B3). \n\n*Proteins* – hydrolysed silk, hydrolysed keratin, hydrolysed wheat protein, hydrolysed oat protein. Proteins help to strengthen hair. \n\n*Soothing ingredients* – allantoin, arnica montana, calendula officinalis, panthenol. Particularly useful if you have a sensitive scalp.\n\n\n*What to avoid (generally speaking):*\n\n*Sulfates* – Sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, although if anything in the ingredients list of your shampoo ends with sulfate, check on the list for strength. Sulfates don’t always need to be avoided.  They are cleansers and foaming agents used in a large majority of shampoos. They can strip your hair of oils and humectants and dry the skin on your scalp, however they are also useful in the removal of silicones.  They shouldn’t be used every day, but once a week to every 2 weeks is recommended if you use silicones on your hair. If your scalp and roots respond well to sulfates, you can protect the lengths of your hair by applying an oil or conditioner pre-washing, thoroughly washing your scalp and roots with a sulfate shampoo and only using the leftover foam on the length, then conditioning again. There are more and less harsh versions, and the gentler ones can be used more frequently, please refer to ingredient list! Not recommended for curly hair.\n\n*Parabens and preservatives* – Ones I found particularly harmful to me personally: DMDM Hydantoin, 5-Bromo-5-Nitro-1,3-Dioxane, 2-Bromo-2-Nitropropane-1,3-Diol, Diazolidynyl Urea, Imidiazolidynyl Urea, Phenyl Benzoate, Phenyl Dimethicone, Formaldehyde, Methylchloroisothiazolinone. Parabens are used to prevent products from going off. They’re not the only preservatives used in hair care and by no means the worst ones, but they can affect your scalp and hair. Eco-shampoos and conditioners are often filled with alcohol instead of parabens which can really dry out your scalp and hair. I don’t find parabens to be bad for my hair at all, but this is personal and you will have to eliminate and reintroduce (see that thing I said about time consuming at the start?) to really find out. You will not be able to find a preservative free product, therefore it is worth checking which work for you. \n\n*Alcohol* – alcohol denat and isopropyl alcohol, most others are fatty alcohols which are moisturising. The only time harsh alcohols are useful is when using hair ‘rubs’, where they help with product absorption. \n\n*Scents* – most scenting ingredients are listed under parfum, however some particularly harsh ones are required to be listed separately. These are: limonene, linalool, citronellol, geraniol, coumarin, citral, benzyl benzoate and eugenol. They’re usually at the very end of the list and in the trace amounts will not usually do any harm unless you have a sensitivity. \n\n*Silicones* – similarly to sulfates, silicones are not always bad. I personally like silicones. They work with my hair without concealing its true condition much or weighing it down. If your hair is thin you may find it better to only use the more soluble ones or none at all.\nI avoid shampoos with silicones at all cost though. The job of a shampoo is to cleanse your hair and prepare it for absorption of beneficial ingredients. I allow water soluble and gentle shampoo soluble silicones in conditioners and hair masks, and I use SLS requiring silicones in leave in conditioners that I only put on the ends of my hair. \n\nWater soluble silicones are: dimethicone copolyol, lauryl methicone copolyol, hydrolyzed wheat protein hydroxypropyl polysiloxane and silicones with PEG and a number at the start. The higher the number (especially above 10), the more water soluble the silicone. \n\nSilicones soluble in mild shampoo: amodimethicone, dimethicone, dimethiconol, beheonoxy dimethicone, phenyl trimethicone.\n\nNeed sulfates: simethicone, trimethicone, trimethylsilylamodimethicone, trimethylsiloxysilicates.\n\nEvaporate from hair (only washing with a conditioner to become soluble): cyclometicone, cyclopentasiloxane, cyclotetrasiloxane, octamethyl cyclotetrasiloxane, cyclohexasiloxane.\n\nI would advise completely removing silicones from your hair care routine for a week (you might find out your hair curls when it never did before), and then slowly reintroducing them one by one from the mildest to the heaviest ones to see how your hair reacts.  \n\n*Paraffin*  - Mineral Oil, Paraffinum Liquidum, Paraffin Oil, white oil are most common names of Paraffin. Paraffin has made a bad name for itself, it is known to be comedogenic to skin, however this does not happen to everybody, and even then you don’t have to put it on your scalp. Paraffin can be found in conditioners, masks and hair oils, and I’ve never had problems with it as an ingredient. It is also found in a lot of baby products, as near enough no one is allergic to it. You will have to experiment to see how it works for you. If it agrees with your hair, it works much quicker than natural oils – you will see results from first use, rather than after months of regular use. Products containing paraffin can be used after washing and conditioning to protect your hair from split ends. Paraffin requires stronger cleansing agents such as SLS for removal, and therefore not recommended for curly hair. \n\n\n**Products**\n\nNow, let’s look at specific products and how to get the most of them. \n\n*Hair Oils*\nI cannot recommend hair oils enough. This is probably the number one thing that changed my hair. I have been using hair oils for 6+ years and have never looked back. I’ve tried A LOT of oils, and my favourite one is [khadi]( https://www.essentialslondon.com/products/hair-care/khadi-vitalising-hair-oil-100ml?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuOPxmKHw1QIVCrftCh1njgn9EAQYAyABEgIwGPD_BwE#fo_c=762&fo_k=e4b0478aa27161be9771ad687e8f656d&fo_s=gplauk). It promotes hair growth and keeps my hair healthy and shiny, but some people don’t like the scent. Pure argan oil and rosehip oil are also great for me, as is pure coconut oil or the coconut hair oil from [vatika]( https://www.amazon.com/Dabur-Vatika-Enriched-Coconut-150ml/dp/B006BA3BAY/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_121_bs_t_1/136-1463637-2732606?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=B8H7QG82QJF78X98V78D). There are a lot of oils on the market, just make sure what you’re using is pure oil, not stuff like the brand ‘moroccan oil’ because even your cooking olive oil is better than that. You can find a lot of indian hair oils on amazon. Apply by taking a few droplets and warming them up in your palms, then rubbing into the scalp and the lengths of the hair. When I first started my hair care and my hair was quite damaged, I would apply oils overnight every other night (before washing), and sleep with a cotton hair cap on to prevent transfer onto my pillow, then wash it off and condition in the morning. I now wash my hair in the evenings, so I apply it for about an hour before washing and I find that’s enough, but my hair is not particularly damaged.\n\n*Shampoos*\n\nFor day to day cleansing I try to find as simple a shampoo as possible, such as this [Babydream]( https://www.codecheck.info/kosmetik_koerperpflege/babypflege/babyshampoo/ean_4305615272467/id_792172/Babydream_Shampoo_mit_Kamille.pro). I’ve tried other ones over the years, but always come back to this one as it’s super cheap and gentle. I also like [Equilibria aloe vera shampoo]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,51609,equilibra-aloe-shampoo.html). Other products that I’ve used as a shampoo that aren’t a shampoo: [Facelle intimate wash]( http://www.rossmann.pl/Produkt/Facelle-intim-plyn-do-higieny-intymnej-Sensitive-300-ml,101735,7210), [Johnson’s Baby 3in1 Wash]( http://www.johnsonsbaby.com.pl/johnsons-baby-%C5%82agodny-p%C5%82yn-do-mycia-cia%C5%82a-i-w%C5%82os%C3%B3w-3w1). At the start I found my hair a bit tangled after use, but I think that was partly due to the damage. For heavier cleansing I use [Avalon organics rosemary]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/Avalon-Organics-Rosemary-Volumizing-Shampoo/dp/B001ET78QU) or any of the herbal [Barwa Natura]( https://www.barwa.com.pl/seria/barwa-naturalna/) shampoos. I do this every 10-14 days depending on how my hair feels regarding silicones and paraffin that I’ve used. A special mention goes to [Babuszka Agafia Black Soap]( https://bioika.pl/pl/p/Naturalne-Syberyjskie-Czarne-Mydlo-Agafii-na-bazie-37-ziol/659) which is just amazing. \n\n*Conditioners*\n\nI like to go rich here. I look for alllll of the extracts, oils, humectants, anything and everything. My everyday conditioner is the [Garnier avocado and shea butter]( https://www.fragrancedirect.co.uk/garnier-ultimate-blends-the-nourishing-repairer-conditioner-0083190.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=merchant&utm_keyword=foo&istCompanyId=17773c4e-a26f-4631-9b91-73e6422dbe77&istItemId=xiqwpwpqil&istBid=tztx&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9Oud06Lw1QIVxbztCh0PbQzcEAkYASABEgI4UfD_BwE) and it’s been with me for years. I also like the [seboradin ginseng conditioner]( https://seboradin.pl/en/seboradin-revitalizing/29-lotion-seboradin-revitalizing.html), Nivea Long Repair, [Balea Coconut and Milk](http://lepotica.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/balea-mleko-za-telo-lepotica.jpg) and [Timotei Precious Oils]( https://www.amazon.com/Timotei-Precious-Oil-Hair-Conditioner/dp/B00UGHRW6M). Currently I apply in-shower for however long it takes me to shave and wash, then rinse off. When my hair was damaged, I would put a cap on and leave them on for 30 mins, then rinse.\n\n*Masks*\n\nAs with conditioners, as many of the goodies as possible. This is probably the product I’ve switched up the most, as there are not very many BAD hair masks, usually they’re between average and amazing. My favourites over the years have been [Alterra]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,43114,haarkur-granatapfel-aloe-vera.html), [Natur Vital aloe vera]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,40836,naturvital-sensitive-hair-mask-aloe-vera-juniper-zimbro.html) mask, [biovax masks such as this]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/LBiotica-Biovax-Damaged-Hair-250ml/dp/B00N42XUL2), [Babuszka Agafia yeast mask]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,51660,pervoe-reshenie-przepisy-babci-agafii-maska-do-wlosow-drozdzowa-na-pobudzenie-wzrostu.html) and [Kallos Latte]( https://www.notino.co.uk/kallos/serical-mask-for-damaged-chemically-treated-hair/?item=78561&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqp7vxKPw1QIVbb7tCh2u0QGcEAQYASABEgKtzPD_BwE) mask. I used to apply masks twice a week, but now I do it weekly or even every 10 days. Usually I will apply a mask instead of conditioner, throw on a shower cap, and keep it on for anywhere between 1 and 3 hours before rinsing. Sometimes I will blow warm air from the hairdryer to help the ingredients absorb better.\n\n*Rinses*\n\nThere are many rinses you can make at home, not really available as products to buy. I like a chamomile rinse the best as I’m blonde, I also like a dissolved aloe one, but you can experiment with ingredients recommended for your hair type. They can strengthen your hair, add shine, reduce frizz, make it sleeker.\n\n*Rubs*\n\nThese are products that you rub into your scalp and roots (and sometimes hair length) without rinsing off. My favourite is from [Jantar]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,69415,jantar-odzywka-do-wlosow-i-skory-glowy-nowa-wersja.html), I also like [Joanna Rzepa]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,17640,rzepa-kuracja-wzmacniajaca.html). There are also placenta capsules after which I got an insane amount of baby hair. Rubs help with growth and strength of hair!\n\n*Hair protection*\n\nI use something with silicones and proteins in to protect my end, usually the silk from [biovax]( http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/like/112353278842?chn=ps&dispItem=1&adgroupid=44158024220&rlsatarget=pla-324287136906&abcId=1128926&adtype=pla&merchantid=115212699&poi=&googleloc=1007281&device=c&campaignid=856227250&crdt=0), but some hair oils (especially coconut) will also do. I do this once my hair is at least half dry and leave it in. If I’m not washing my hair for longer than 2 days, I will reapply. \n\n*Vitamins, Supplements etc.*\n\nThere are a lot of supplements you can try to help your hair growth or its condition. Vitamin E is obviously a staple. Biotin is fantastic for hair growth. Pregnancy vitamins strengthen hair. Drinking nettle and horsetail tea will do wonders. If you are really, really adventurous and can stomach a lot, drinking yeast (fresh is best, but dry will do) is the best for hair growth. You need to drink it every day for a prolonged period of time though, and it is incredibly unpleasant so requires a lot of commitment.\n\n*Hair styling and others*\n\nAs you might have seen from my previous post, I don’t often style my hair, and have never done. I do hairdry on cold or lukewarm settings, but I only use heat stylers for events and I chuck in a lot of hair protection. I’m gonna experiment a little with styling after my most recent post, but after looking for styling products, I’ve found very few that are not harmful to hair. I don’t brush my hair wet unless using the wet brush, I have a cotton tshirt I use to absorb water from it with instead of a towel, I don’t sleep with it wet, I keep it in a loose twisted bun overnight mostly to avoid rubbing. I have 3 different hair brushes (sable and synthetic) and a tangle teezer. If it’s very windy, I plait my hair, and I wear a hat in the sun. I wear a cap to go swimming. \n\n\nWell done if you got to the end, you are a hero. I hope you find these tips useful and can pick and mix as you please! Give most products 3-4 weeks to do their work before you deem them useless though. Looking forward to any tips you ladies might have on hair care, discussion, and what you found works for you and if you’re as obsessive as I am about it! \n\n\nEdit: link with some [hair photos](https://imgur.com/a/CQU90), 6 year difference",

    "body": "Recently Imade a discovery and found out what was causing 90% of my breakouts. \n\nA while ago I started getting lots of pimples concentrated around the corners of my mouth. I was confused because even if I had acne, it was never there and never this severe. A quick search on this subreddit gave me one comment that said something along the lines of “check your toothpaste, it might have Sodium Lauryl Sulfate”. So I did that, and yes, my toothpaste contained SLS. I stopped using it immediately after that and the skin around my mouth calmed down and the majority of pimples went away.\n\nHowever sometime after that, in chemistry class I found out that SLS is most commonly used in shampoos as a thing that makes them go all foamy (sorry for the lack of smart vocabulary, still working on my english). So I looked at the ingredients of the shampoo I was using at the time and bam! The cursed thing is there too. Now I also have to get rid of that! As I have a very sensitive and problematic scalp I used this shampoo that was specifically designed to make it better so finding a replacement was extremely difficult for me. So I have been looking for quite a while. But as soon as I found a product that didn’t contain it, my skin cleared up immediately. Really, I get as little as 2-3 pimples a week now. And compared to the eternal breakout state I was in before that, it’s phenomenal. My skin is almost clear for over a month now and I am so so glad that I had found the root of the problem that I wanted to share it on this subreddit, in case someone is having a similar issue.\n\nIt is important to note though, that during the entirety of my search for the perfect shampoo I’ve also discovered that not only SLS, but also Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) and Sodium Coco-sulfate made me break out as well. I am now settled on a cheap herb-based shampoo that doesn’t contain either of those and doesn’t irritate my scalp but also turns my curly hair into a pathetic puffy cloud. The price to pay, I guess. If you have any good recommendations I would really appreciate it.\n\nSo, check not only the ingredients on you skincare products but hair products and toothpaste and whatever else comes into contact with your skin as well. It helped me to mostly get rid of what I thought was hormonal acne and it might help you too.",

    "body": "In another thread, /u/powderherface reviewed the [Noreva Cicadiane SPF 50+](https://noreva-laboratoires.com/produit/soin-reparateur-apaisantspf5040ml/62), I bought the [face version](https://noreva-laboratoires.com/produit/soin-anti-taches-spf5040ml/22) marketed as brightening, but really, their INCI are very similar.\n\nNoreva Trio White XP SPF 50+:\nAQUA (WATER), DIBUTYL ADIPATE, DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE, BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE, GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE, POLYMETHYL METHACRYLATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PENTAERYTHRITYL DISTEARATE, TRIACONTANYL PVP, DISODIUM CETEARYL SULFOSUCCINATE, ACETYL GLYCYL BETA-ALANINE, XANTHAN GUM, CHLORPHENESIN, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM DEHYDROACETATE, SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, AMINOMETHYL PROPANOL, SODIUM SULFATE, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, TETRAPEPTIDE-30, ACETYL SH-HEPTAPEPTIDE-1. \n\n\n**-> Uvinul A plus, Tinosorb S Aqua, Uvinul T 150**\n\nThe Trio White is more than twice as expensive as the Cicadiane, which is probably due to gimmicky brightening peptides and acetyl glycyl beta-alanine. \nApplication is good and poses no issue. The sunscreen smell is very present (which I've always disliked) but goes away after a few minutes. \n\nIt does not leave your face as dewy as other sunscreens, it is not drying, a bit moisturizing, and does not pill. Really, I can't say anything against this sunscreen other than high price. Other than that, you can quite feel it on your face, which is to be expected from most sunscreens. It's a tube with a weird applicator, but it's not a deal-breaker. As opposed to the Cicadiane, the UVAPF is not disclosed, but since the INCI are so similar, it should be around 38.\n\n[Yves rocher Soin Anti-Âge SPF 50+:](https://www.yves-rocher.fr/corps-et-douche/soin-solaire/protection-solaire/soin-anti-age-protection-fps-50-/p/yr.R57438) AQUA (Eau) DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE, PHENOXYETHYL CAPRYLATE, C12-15 ALKYL BENZOATE, DIBUTYL ADIPATE, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, METHYLPROPANEDIOL, BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE, PHENYLBENZIMIDAZOLE SULFONIC ACID, DIMETHICONE, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE, TROMETHAMINE VP/EICOSENE COPOLYMER, PEG-100 STEARATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, STEARYL ALCOHOL, ERYNGIUM MARITIMUM EXTRACT (Extrait D'Etoile Des Dunes), ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, GLYCERIN, XANTHAN GUM (Gomme De Xanthane), PARFUM, BENZYL ALCOHOL, ISOEUGENOL, TOCOPHEROL\n\n**-> Uvinul A plus, Tinosorb S, Ensulizole, Uvinul T 150**\n\nThe Trio White would have been my HG (I'm tired of looking for a sunscreen), had I not decided to buy Yves Rocher's one to try since it's -45% on their website. I'm not against fragrance (especially if it's masking sunscreen smell), and the fragrance is very much pleasant and faint; not overbearing at all.\n\nApplication is great, it's an airless pump which are vastly superior to tubes, and greatest of all... it gives my skin a very healthy look in a way. Most sunscreens give me a greasy-ish look. As opposed to the Trio White, I don't feel it at all on my skin. Despite the fragrance, the formulation is top notch. I know fragrance + UV exposure = bad, but I'm kinda willing to take the risk, and will stop if my skin ever comes to react badly.\n\nAnyway, thanks to this, my search for a face sunscreen has ended. \nIf this sunscreen is not in sales, it's around 21€, which depending on where you buy the Trio White, can be more expensive than the Trio White (which I bought for 17€).\n\nFinally, I'm pretty sure than Yves Rocher is more accessible than Noreva around Europe.\n\nThe marketing is funny though: \"made to meet women's highest standards\". I'm a man, please.",

    "body": "Hello and welcome to the 38th installment of The Great Spice Off! What is The Great Spice Off?\n\nI love the scent of Old Spice, so much so that it's the only aftershave I use as I don't really feel a need to splash anything else on. But, as we all know, Old Spice no longer makes shaving soap. They still make a cream, but that's hardly a great soap and it doesn't smell like Old Spice. As such my plan is to test out all the Old Spice options that are out there on as many bases as possible both to try out a variety of bases from different soapmakers and to report back to you on who really nails the scent.\n\nI'll be shaving three times with each soap, using a variety of brushes and razors, and blades. Yes, I know that means it won't be exactly scientific but this is going to take a while and I want to use all my other shit too. Soaps will be rated on a few factors and given points from 1-5 for each.\n\n* **Oldness:** How much does the soap smell like OG Old Spice. This is the more analytical scent analysis and I'm comparing to an OG Old Spice aftershave I have and the Shulton aftershave from India.\n* **Spiciness:** This is the je ne sais quois of Old Spice. Does the soap make me feel the nostalgia, warmth, and whatever it is about the scent that works. Is there something special about it that makes it stand out? Does it invoke a memory or make a new one? The most subjective of this list.\n* **Lather:** You know, can I make a shave soap out of it.\n* **Shave:** How's it work on the ol' face while shaving.\n* **Post:** How's the scent profile after the event. How does my face feel.\n\n# [V and E Maine Made Crafts - Old Maine Spice](https://i.imgur.com/MN3CyKS.jpg)\n\nThe Internet is a very big place and it is hard to search all of it. In fact, I thought I had searched all of it for Old Spice dupes as was displayed by my somewhat questioning proclamation in the last TGSO that it was the last one. Clearly, as you have once again read the intro for the 38th time, that is not the case. No, in what can only be considered a cruel twist of fate, a few days after publishing the \"last\" TGSO u/ThumpingVTwin88 asked a question about a soapmaker called V and E Maine who sold their glycerin-based soap over eBay. I have no idea what prompted me to not only click over to the page but then go ahead and check if they had an Old Spice dupe aside from habit but that's exactly what I did. And now here we are reviewing Old Maine Spice.\n\nThe Great Spice Off is eternal! I will no longer be proclaiming it over as that has just proved false on multiple occasions. It will outlive me and you and your children's children until the heat death of the universe. Poopy poop poop. (My son just came in and told me to write that.)\n\nNow that I've dug a bit into V and E Maine Made Crafts I know why they had never popped up in any search. There is literally nothing about them anywhere even on their eBay page. No social media, no website, no online reviews. They exist only on eBay and possibly somewhere in the state of Maine but I can't independently verify that fact. The eBay page was launched in 2021 so maybe that's when they were founded. They sell shaving soap, aftershave, hand lotion, candles, and the like, but surprisingly not hand soap, which is the usual base product \"craft\" sellers get in on. And that's all I've got. I can't even tell you who V or E are so you'll just have to hypothesize yourselves (My going theory is they're a burly Russian couple named Victor and Edgar and they'd invite you into their charming Maine cottage and give you hot cocoa if your car broke down while regaling you with stories of the old country).\n\nAs for their soap, they offer two different glycerin-based soap bases. One that features shea butter and one that does not. Old Maine Spice only comes in the one without shea butter so no double review for you all today. The glycerin base includes Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Stearate, Sorbitol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Coconut Oil, Sodium Myristate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Laurate, Sodium Cocoate, Purified Water, Fragrance Oil at 3.3%, soap color dye. Nothing really jumping out there but they claim all the ingredients are all natural, except the fragrance of course. Hard to make all natural Old Spice scent I'd guess. Well, I don't have to. [I had someone try.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/16twdui/the_great_spice_off_cloud_shave_unscented/)\n\nV and E don't actually mention Old Spice anywhere on the page for Old Maine Spice but given the name and the fact that all the scent notes listed are exactly the scent notes of Old Spice, I think it's pretty clear. Victor and Edgar wouldn't like to me. Would they?\n\nThe soap comes in a plastic baggie, though from the page it appears some of their other soaps come in tins. They recommend you melt it down and pour it into a tin for use but no ones got time for that shit. Just give me my soap in a tin, Victor and Edgar! Maybe melting it down would have made this not the strangest feeling shave soap I've ever held. To be clear, like most glycerin-based soap, it's very hard but its consistency is such that the moment its in your hand you can feel it melting. Then when you scrape it off to scoop it into your bowl (not the recommended way) it turns into this gelly weirdness instead of flaking or chipping off like other glycerin soaps I've used. It's a really weird consistency, like jam but you wouldn't want to eat it or spread it on anything. I love me some Old Spice but I don't want it on my toast (now, Old Bay on some toast...).\n\n**Oldness: 1**\n\nThis is one of those soaps where I'm pretty sure they have no idea what vintage Old Spice smells like because this ain't it. Overwhelmingly, this just smells like soap. Maybe they didn't put enough scent in to overwhelm the soapy smell or maybe it's just the wrong scent but whatever the reason this is a shaving soap that smells like soap. It is, however, kind of vintagy in its overall scent profile even if its mostly vintage soap, but somewhere in there is some citrus and some of those underlying spice scents but they're pretty buried on the whole. What I'm saying is that it doesn't smell like Old Spice.\n\n**Spiciness: 2**\n\nVintage soap (Does everyone else kind of know what I'm talking about when I say this?) isn't a bad smell at all but it's hardly something that's really standing out to me. Sometimes I can get overly excited about things that don't smell like Old Spice but this ain't doing it in any way. It's also just annoying when you expect some at least somewhat like Old Spice and don't get it at all. I'd hate to be someone who doesn't have 37 other Old Spice dupes to fall back on when I received this thinking I was getting something that smelled like Old Spice. Honestly, how do the rest of you survive?\n\n**Lather: 2**\n\nI'm knocking this down a bit just because of the weird jellyness. Not fair because they suggest brush loading? Tough! Once you get ready for that jelly the soap actually lathers pretty darn big, if not as dense as I would like. You need to take a big scoop of soap, but I was surprised by how lathery it actually got as other glycerin soaps usually come up thinner and airier but Old Maine Spice has some heft to it. It never reaches true lather nirvana, though, always staying just a bit thin no matter how well you work it.\n\n**Shave: 3**\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by just how slick the shave was with Old Maine Spice. Mild to aggressive things slid easy over my face like a man sliding across the great ice lakes of Maine, which are definitely things that are in Maine because it's so north. However, the cushion on this one is not like the downy snow that falls year round upon the grounds of the article sate of Maine (note: I've never been to Maine) but more like a light flurry, just enough to get your hopes up of a snow day but you're still going to school. Have I lost this metaphor?\n\n**Post: 3**\n\nOld Maine Spice's vintage-esque scent does it a lot of favors in post-shave where it plays just stellar with both the vintage Old Spice and the Indian. Not many soaps play this well with both scents, even ones that actually smell like Old Spice, so that's a big plus in my book. In terms of face feel, it's not doing anything especially fantastic, but my skin never felt dry. Sometimes thing just fall right in the middle. I don't know if that's good but I can't call it bad. That's why we have numbers like three that sit halfway between 1 and 5.\n\n**Final Verdict: 12**\n\nPossibly unfairly hampered by the \"jelly scooping\" -- which, by the way, is also the hot new dance craze sweeping the country this winter -- it's hard to recommend and Old Spice dupe that doesn't smell like Old Spice and only delivers a half-decent shave. There's some surprising quality in here for what is obviously a melt and pour but it's not enough to make up for the fact that it's not an Old Spice dupe and it's actually that great a shave either.\n\n**Previous Great Spice Offs:**\n\n1.

It has sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), which is gentler than SLS, and some other gentle surfactants.  It's low PH and it cleans really wall. I don't love it but it cleans and is low PH and never strips my skin. \n\nI never liked foaming cleansers as they are drying but decided I'd give  AB foaming cleansers a try.  One was [Hada Labo of Tokyo Hydrating Cleanser](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_9f6e227015.html), as I heard it's a lot less drying than regular Hada Labo foaming. It was not drying and pleasant to use.   I tried the Tosowoong for novelty (alcohol & SLS) for the novelty.  Considering what is in the Tosowoong, it's fairly gentle. If you don't lather it up enough in your hands it is like washing your face with powdered Tide.  I preferred HLoT.o I used that for about 7 weeks. Over time, I started getting really clogged.   I just thought my skin is molting for spring.  My SF went crazy producing gunk and causing red bumps.  I didn't figure it out, as that wasn't expecting to get clogged. I expected to get dry. . I tried upping my BHA a bit.  I tried using a bit more AHA. Nothing worked.\n\nThen I read a post by The Acid Queen saying, who had recommended HLoT, saying that she had decided foaming cleansers were not helping her dry skin. That was my lightbulb moment.  Not wnating to buy more cleansers,  I went back to PC and stopped using sheet masks.. Things improved and I am not clogged any more. A week later I added Pixi Glow toner and things improved more. So it's probably not one thing, but I think it was the main cause of all the clogs was using foaming cleansers.  All my life they had been a problem.\n\nThis might help other dry people. Also if you are clogged and not sure why, maybe it's your cleanser.",

I'm a hiker, and I was looking for environmentally friendly soaps to use when I'm on the trail, and I came across Dr Bronners soaps, vegetable oil based soaps with minimal ingredients and environmentally conscious production. Sounded great, ordered a peppermint and a tea tree and waited for them to arrive.  \n\n\nI had horrible acne and eczema and had tried what felt like everything. I've been on several different medications/antibiotics for cystic acne and chronic folliculitis, been on the pill, tried so many types of face wash, tried different diets etc. \n\n\nAt that time packing my whole skin care routine for hiking would have taken up half my bag, so I figured I'd make do with the soap for my face in the meantime and deal with the fall out after I got back. Tried the soap out before I went to make sure I wouldn't have a really bad reaction to it on my face, but after a couple of days I actually noticed my skin getting better. Within a few weeks my skin had cleared up.\n\n\n3 years later and I use Dr Bronners to wash my whole body (and I can use it for everything when I go hiking- shampoo, laundry, dishes, even toothpaste!) I've tried other brands and \"flavours\" but the tea tree Dr Bronners bar soap is the best I've found. I get the odd hormonal pimple, but no huge breakouts, no backne or buttne and all the dryness from my body skin is gone. I've tried switching back to regular products and other types of soap but every time I do I return to the horrible greasy skin and breaking out everywhere, and redevelop my old eczema. \n\n\nI don't really know why regular cleansers don't work for me. It could be a sensitivity to sodium laureth sulfate, or something to do with the way regular body/face wash works (the \"clean\" feeling you get with body wash is really weird to me now). All I know is that the conventional thought of \"don't use soap\" was actually harmful to me and I wish I'd known sooner that soap isn't actually the worst thing ever.\n\n\nMy routine now is easy - wash face twice a day, then moisturise! The only other products I use now is a light witch hazel moisturiser for my face and a generic body moisturiser (both from Boots - a U.K. based pharmacy/cosmetics store). I've found other vegetable based soaps ok, but I think the tea tree in the Dr Bronners is the key though. I try to limit makeup, but if I do wear it I use a makeup remover lotion then wash my face with the soap and moisturise after.\n\n\nEveryone says to avoid soap based cleansers for your face but in my case I accidentally found it was my cure. Just wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone. \n\n\nT.L.D.R - switched to using Dr Bronners soap when I went hiking. It fixed my skin. Soap isn't as bad as people say it is if you use the right one. Also the Dr Bronners soap labels are hilarious. \n\n",

My wife has suffered from acne since she was 12, and discovered she was allergic to Sulfa 10 years ago. \n\nLast month she visited a new Allergist who asked about her acne and some red bumps along her scalp, and suggested that it plus the Sulfa allergy might actually indicate she is allergic to sodium laureth sulfate, or SLS. SLS is in most soaps, shampoos, body washes, laundry detergent, mouthwashes and toothpastes. She switched products, and in less than a week her acne cleared up, and her skin wasn't oily anymore; apparently the 'acne' was really an allergic reaction. \n\nIt has been pretty easy to switch away from sodium laureth sulfate, in most products it is the second ingredient (although you do have to check online for some things like detergent). She's been to probably 6 doctors and more than one allergist over the last decade, and this was the first time we had heard of an SLS allergy.\n\nAs always, consult a medical professional on all things related to your health; this is not medical advice, just sharing one woman's experience.

    "body": "So, i have been suffering from Seb Derm and terrible scaly skin all over my face and body for a few years now. Each year it seemed to get worse. In the past 6 months it has gotten terrible.\n\nI went to Spain on vacation for 2 weeks and decided to cut out Coke Zero and also shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate which dry out the skin and cause all sorts of imbalances. I was having 2-3 bottles or cans of coke zero a day.\n\nMid-vacation i decided to cut both of these things out. It has now been 5 days since i have cut it out and my skin has stopped scalling and pealing off as much as it used to. I believe the skin is in a healing phase now after years of being in a cycle of trauma. I only now use Dove Soap Bar to wash and also only will now shampoo once a week.\n\nI also noticed that washing my face or showering twice a day is very important in reducing the skin peeling. I started washing my face a few times a day with cold water and then applying moisturiser which has helped a lot. I think another week and should be pretty much clear.\n\nCleaning and exfoliating your face is very important as the building up fungi, bacteria and dead skin + moisturiser can cause havoc on your skin. Just think about it for a second....\n\nHope this helps anyone looking to try out a different method.\n\n***UPDATE: 09/06/2024***\n\nOk, so i just got back last week from a 2 week all inclusive vacation to Montego Bay, Jamaica. My skin was actually great before going to Jamaica and i was looking forward to a great holiday without shedding skin and having a nightmare sleeping. I stopped coke zero for 4 weeks prior and also only used Dove Bar soap to wash skin and hair. Everything was great, until 3 days in to the holiday, i decided to lose discipline and have coke zero. And low and behold, the seb derm was back! I done a ton of research into this and it turns out it could be a histamine issue with the foods and drinks i am having. I also hae coffee a few times during breakfast - again just being reckless and splurging on whatever took my fancy. I noticed this completely messed me up. Itchy scalp and face around beard etc. Turns out the high histamine foods are the things that are causing my flareups, not forgetting the sulfate shampoos which make the skin worse by creating a massive imbalance on the skin microbiome.\n\nWhat i also notice is every time i get a breakout, i get a runny nose and puffy eyes with stringy mucus coming out constantly throughout the day. I am 100% i am getting closer to the answer. It seems to be a reaction to a food or ingredient i am eating or drinking.\n\nI read this article and it seems interesting: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35143102/#:\\~:text=Scalp%20seborrheic%20dermatitis%20(SD)%20is,is%20not%20well%20understood%20yet.",

My dermatologist said I was the worst case of seb derm she's seen but we've found a way to manage it to the point that is barely affects me, and the shampoo rotation was part of the treatment and the only one I still consistently use.\n\nEdit: I realize this post adds nothing except my rationalization for why I will continue coke zero, but I shall monitor further developments and periodically reassess... you know, since no one asked",

Looking for support + safe product recs.*\n\n*(Matrixyl + Argireline serum, toner, and sunscreen).*\n\n  \n\\*                        \n\n\n\nThat might sound dramatic, but I don’t think I’m exaggerating.\n\n  \n\n\nSkincare has always been mine. It’s something I’ve loved since I was a kid. Not because of trends or influencers—but because it made me feel beautiful. It gave me structure, hope, and a way to take care of myself when nothing else in my life felt like it could be taken care of. Skincare became part of how I saw myself. It brought me joy—genuine joy.\n\n  \n\n\nBut now… everything is changing.\n\n  \n\n\nMy skin is so sensitive now that I’ve had to give up almost everything. Even the “gentle” products. Even the ones I loved. I can’t use tretinoin (my skin never tolerated it), adapalene didn’t do anything, and while retinol did work, the one retinol that helped me ended up containing ingredients I’m allergic to. \n\n\n\nSame with Matrixyl + Argireline serums—I found one that actually worked for dynamic wrinkles, but my skin clearly doesn’t like something in it. Even The Ordinary version, which I liked at first, became too strong and also had allergens. Every door I try to open… slams shut.\n\n  \n\n\nI’ve actually been oil cleansing for a while now—mostly with pumpkin seed oil—because it’s the only thing that doesn’t trigger my skin. But there was a point where that didn’t feel like enough, and I started thinking maybe I needed to find a proper cleanser again. So I tried. Again. And after my last experience—VaniCream Gentle Cleanser absolutely wrecked my skin—I’m done. Forget it. That was my last ditch effort, and it reminded me why I stopped searching in the first place. I can’t use cleansers. Not even the ones labeled “gentle.” That's just the tip of the iceberg, but you get the point. \n\n\n\nHere are my confirmed allergens and non-negotiables:\n\n  \n\n\nAllergens I absolutely cannot use anymore:\n\n\n\n* Phenoxyethanol\n* Ethylhexylglycerin\n* Disodium EDTA\n* Cocamidopropyl Betaine / Coco-Betaine\n* Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES)\n* Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)\n* Soy derivatives\n* Corn derivatives (including corn-based citric acid)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nOther things I avoid because my skin can’t handle them:\n\n\n\n* Foaming agents (even if I’m not allergic, they strip me completely)\n* Essential oils (my skin is too reactive)\n* Drying alcohols\n\n\n\n  \nThe issue is these ingredients are in just about everything, but, it’s not just about the fact that I can't use the same stuff anymore. I feel like I lost a part of me, skincare wasn't just about results - I think it became a part of my identity. I still remember, the one Christmas (as a kid) I got a clean and clear kit and I was so excited. \n\nSkincare for me, it's part of what made me who I am,  It was something that made me feel like I had power. I could change my routine, research ingredients, experiment—and see my skin change. It was mine - and now, it's being taken from me. If I care about the health of my skin/body I can't use products I know are not good for me. I just don't feel like I'm ready to let go yet.\n\n\n\nI know it sounds silly, but I don’t have much else right now. I don’t have the body I want, the job I want, the income I want, the social life I want, the health I want. I’m trying. I really am. But skincare was the one thing I did and I did it well. It was mine. It was freedom, my peace, my sanctuary - even when everyone told me it was shallow, or dumb, it brought me peace and joy - I loved it. \n\n  \nAnother thing, Skincare was supposed to be my way to age gracefully, I don’t want Botox. I don’t want fillers. I'm not against them per se, it's just not me. Also, with my finances, body dysmorphia, and allergies, It would not be smart. But now the products that helped with dynamic wrinkles are off the table too. \n\n\n\nI’m 29, and I - I feel like a caterpillar that never wanted to be a butterfly, yet, is forced to lose everything about itself for something that it didn't want, didn't ask for, and can't control. \n\n  \n\n\nWhat I also noticed is that, with each product I stop using, I shop at Sephora less - I’ve been a Sephora Rouge member for years. It's not about status, I'm not even sure if it's about Sephora per se. (Although, Im a Sephora girly for life!) But what watching the possibility that I may not be a Sephora rouge member by the end of the year means. Loss. \n\n  \nI know, this is a first world problem. But, I just feel lost - life has not been the kindest, but this, was constant, and now that's changing too. \n\n  \n\n\nI'm not ready for things to change because, If I let go of this - what do I have left? \n\n\n\nI guess, I want to know I'm not crazy or If anyone can relate to how I feel? If you’ve gone through something similar? I'd love to hear your story. It'd be nice to know I'm not alone. \n\n  \nHowever - regarding actual skincare - I'm still searching for a couple things In particular, so if you have any recs that would be great:\n\n\n\n* A Matrixyl + Argireline serum without any of my allergens\n* A sunscreen that won’t trigger me (mineral or not, just allergen-free)\n* A gentle, hydrating toner I can safely use (ideally in a travel size)\n\nI know this was long, but thank you for listening \n\n  \nxoxo <3\n\n\n\n",

I’m now close to 40 and had similar allergy problems recently. \n\nWith “clean” beauty becoming the norm, most people don’t realize that the majority of their favorite sephora and ulta brands are quietly reformulating their staples to fit the “clean conscious beauty” labels at both retailers. Unfortunately parabens, which are safe and extremely well tolerated by most skin have been replaced by preservatives like phenoxyethanol, which is supposed to be well tolerated by most skin as well. I’m one of the unlucky people who can’t handle it. \n\nSo what happened over the past year is that I didn’t change my skin or makeup routine that much, but when suddenly almost ALL of my products have phenoxyethanol in them, I started getting super irritated, rashy, dry textured skin. I did some research and suspected the culprit and got a patch test with my derm and confirmed it’s the phenoxyethanol that I’m allergic too. I believe that my skin could tolerate it at the bottom of an ingredient list in just one serum, but when it was in almost my whole routine it got bad. \n\nAll that to say, once I cut it out completely, going back to avene cicafailte, argan oil and hypochloric acid my skin calmed down and I could start to introduce gentle serums and toners again.  This took a while! Probably 5 months to fully repair my skin barrier. Maybe once yours repairs and you know what you’re allergic too you can add some products with those ingredients back in! \n\nI saw a few people recommend cocokind, and I have had luck with their products, specifically the retinol and the barrier repair. And I love the avene eczema line. I can also use Korean products like purito toner and laniege cream skin. It takes a lot of time and research, but if you’re like me you like learning more about skin and doing your research. \n\nAs far as spf I love the Black Girl sunscreen kids version (ulta online), and most Korean sunscreens, as well at supergroup play. \n\nDon’t give up! Like I said I’ve been a skincare obsessive from a young age and now my routine is simpler than ever and my early spf use and consistency is paying off in skin texture and clarity.",

What can we use to achieve the same effect but keep our stupid not understanding ingredient list customers happy? Add a different awful detergent.\n\nAt this point I treat sulfate free labeled shampoos as chemical reading practice. Some sulfate free shampoos ARE better then others. I struggle with a lot of Paula's writings; Paula likes to generalize and bash things to push her own agenda.\n\nIt is better to read individual products and educate yourself on which sulfate alternatives are less harsh/more harsh. Naturally curly has some decent resources on sulfate harshness levels. \n\nExample: Briogeo Curl Charisma, claims to be sulfate free, but that shampoo is harsher on my hair by a large margin because of the sulfate alternative content. It's my friggen clarifier. \n\nJessicurl is also a sulfate free shampoo. Completely non harsh. I have to work harder with my hands, but it does the same job a sulfate shampoo does without drying my scalp out. \n\nBoth claim to be sulfate free. One actually cares enough to formulate with a gentler cleansing agent.",

Though, I thought about it more, and in between the two periods I ruined my hair, I was using this shampoo by Herbal & Essences which also does seem pretty drying, but didn’t damage my hair at all (from what I saw physically):\n\nAqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Cocamide MEA, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Hexyl Cinnamal, Magnesium Nitrate, Zea Mays Silk Extract, Rose Extract, Pearl Extract, CI 19140, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Sorbate, CI 42090\n\nIt in fact has more sulphates, but also more humectants at the same time. Could it be the alcohol? Or is the problem in fact, not the drying of my hair? I’m really lost and scared to buy another shampoo in case I ruin my hair again.",

Here’s what I’ve learned thus far:\n\n## Lesson 1: Sunscreen is definitely [worth the (comparably low) risk!](https://blog.skincancer.org/2018/06/06/sunscreen-safety/)\n\nDaily sunscreen use reduces cancer rates by 40-50% - a demonstrable benefit that exponentially outweighs the scarce in vivo or even in vitro experiments showing a link between various ingredients and potential health risks (usually at high concentrations).\n\n## Lesson 2: Different regions have different regulations and [ratings](https://theklog.co/spf-meaning/)\n\n* The Boots ★ rating is proprietary, and relative to the SPF. So ★★★★★ on SPF 15 may not be as good as ★★★ on SPF 50.\n* PPD is akin to SPF but for UVA rays.  A PPD of 10 indicates that it takes 10 times longer to darken than unprotected skin.\n* The U.S. has a “broad spectrum” test, but the ratio of UVA to UVB isn’t explicit\n* Some newer ingredients that show promise (Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Mexoryl SX Mexoryl XL, & Uvinul A Plus) are still pending safety studies for U.S. approval\n* Outside the U.S., not all companies are obliged to show the % of their active ingredients in the sunscreen formulas.\n\n## Lesson 3: Some ingredients may be better than others.\n\n* Oxybenzone & Octinoxate may be [endocrine disruptors](https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/report/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/)\n* Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide are better, but alone [aren’t effective enough](https://www.consumerreports.org/sunscreens/shining-a-light-on-natural-sunscreen/).\n* Some studies linked inactive ingredients with other risks:\n   * \\[Vitamin A (Retinyl Palmitate)\\]([https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/705545/RETINYL\\_PALMITATE\\_(VITAMIN\\_A\\_PALMITATE)/](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/705545/RETINYL_PALMITATE_(VITAMIN_A_PALMITATE)/))\n   * [BHT (Butylated hydroxytoluene)](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700741/BHT/)\n   * [Unregulated Fragrances/Perfumes](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/702512/FRAGRANCE/)\n   * [Aluminum compounds](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700326/ALUMINUM_STARCH_OCTENYLSUCCINATE/)\n   * [DMDM Hydantoin](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/702196/DMDM_HYDANTOIN_(FORMALDEHYDE_RELEASER)/)\n   * [PABA (Para-Aminobenzoic Acid)](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/704390/PABA/)  \\- Soon to be banned by the FDA\n   * [Parabens](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/search.php?query=paraben), [Propyl-paraben](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/705335/PROPYLPARABEN/) & [Butyl-paraben](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700868/BUTYLPARABEN/)\n   * [PEG/PEO](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/704983/POLYETHYLENE_GLYCOL/)/PPG/PPO (Macrogol, Polyethylene glycol, Polyethylene Oxide, Polyoxyethylene, Polypropylene glycol or polypropylene oxide)\n   * [Silicones](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/701277/CETYL_PEG%3B%3B_PPG-10%3B%3B_1_DIMETHICONE/)\n   * [SLES (Sodium Laureth Sulfate)](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/706089/SODIUM_LAURETH_SULFATE/)\n   * [Trolamine Salicylate ](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/706476/TEA_SALICYLATE/) \\- Soon to be banned by the FDA\n   * [Phthalates](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/719992/ISOPROPYLPHTHALIMIDE/)\n   * certain [preservatives](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/703935/METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE/)\n* Other safe ingredients can feel unpleasant on skin (especially for us oily types):\n   * Allergens (gluten, nut oil, certain emulsifiers)\n   * Simple (aka short-chain) alcohols can dry out skin\n      * Alcohol Denat (Denatured Alcohol)\n      * Aminomethyl Propanol\n      * Benzyl alcohol\n      * Ethanol alcohol\n      * Ethyl alcohol\n      * Isopropyl alcohol\n      * Phenethyl\n      * Phenoxyethanol\n      * Propanol alcohol\n      * T-Butyl Alcohol\n   * certain Oils\n   * certain Emulsifiers\n   * Silicone & Acrylate polymers make sunscreen “waterproof” but can leave [tacky / greasy film](https://www.sharecare.com/health/sunburn-prevention/why-sun-protection-products-greasy) on your skin. Good for swimming, not for daily use.\n* Finally, a combination of Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Ferulic Acid may further protect skin from damage.\n\n## Lesson 4: SPF ratings aren’t as high in real life as they are in labs\n\nSunscreen’s ability to block UVA/UVB rays depends on the thickness applied to the skin.  In tests for SPF rating, they assume a thickness of 2mg/cm², which few people apply in real life (where it’s generally closer to .5 - 1mg/cm²).  That’s one of the reasons it’s better to use SPF 30+, because you’re likely only getting a fraction of the protection anyway.\n\n## Lesson 5: Protect your skin - with SCIENCE!\n\nThe coolest thing I found was that BASF (a major chemical manufacturer in the U.S.) has [a free tool](https://www.sunscreensimulator.basf.com/) that lets you plug in a sunscreen formulation and estimate its effectiveness, along with what it’s theoretical SPF, Boots ★ Rating, PA+ rating, and U.S. Broad Spectrum test results - you can even test at a lower amount like what people would realistically apply on their skin.\n\nSo what I did was search the internet for sunscreens that didn’t use Oxybenzone / Octinoxate, (which largely left Avobenzone - aka Methoxydibenzoylmethane - as the main UVA blocker), and compared their results.\n\nDisclaimer²: My understanding is that while we aren’t 100% confident in which chemicals are completely safe, we have previously found more risks from some chemicals than others.  This is part of why the FDA seeks more research on all sun blocking chemicals.\n\n## The Best\n\n**Legend:** Real - effective rating for 1mg/cm²; CR - Consumer Reports Ranking;\tNC - Non-comedogenic (doesn't block pores);\tPb - contains Parabens;\tA - contains short-chain alcohols; \tF - contains unspecified Fragrances; Scroll right for $/oz., $/UVA, $/UVB.\n\n|**TYPE**|**BRAND**|**NAME**|**SPF**|**REAL**|**UVA**|**★**|**PA**|**PPD**|**NC**|**Pb**|**A**|**F**|**GREASY?**|**$/Oz.**|**$/SPF**|**$/UVA**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Stick|Ombrelle|[Face Stick SPF 60 with Mexoryl XL](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/ombrelle-face-stick-spf-60/6000016946893)|60|15|7.3|3|PA+++|7.2|Y|N|N|N|Water Resistant, Company claims it's \"non-greasy\"|$53.33|$3.56|$7.31|\n|Spray|Rocky Mountain|[Quart Spray SPF 50 KIDS Mist](https://www.rmsunscreen.com/sprayquart50kids-single.aspx)|50|10|6|3|PA++|5.7|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Company claims it's \"non-greasy formula\"|$1.33|$0.13|$0.22|\n|Spray|Rocky Mountain|[6-oz Spray SPF 50](https://www.rmsunscreen.com/6ozsprayspf50sunscreen.aspx)|50|10|6|3|PA++|5.7|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Company claims it's \"greaseless\"|$1.67|$0.17|$0.28|\n|Spray|Altruist Dermatologist|[Sunspray SPF 50](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0794VX8R1)|50|10|5.9||||?|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"non greasy\"|$1.92|$0.19|$0.33|\n|Lotion|La Roche-Posay|[Anthelios Xl Ultra-Light Fluid](https://www.shopgator.com/product/la-roche-posay-anthelios-xl-spf-50-ultra-light-fluid/)|50+|10|**14**|5|PA+++|9.3|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Company claims it's \"non-greasy\"|$12.13|$1.21|$0.87|\n|Lotion|Sun Bum|[Original 30 SPF\\*](https://www.amazon.com/Sun-Bum-Sunscreen-SPF-30/dp/B00GO9QER4/)|30|10|6.2|3|PA++|5.6|Y|N|N|**Y**|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"non-greasy\"|$1.88|$0.19|$0.30|\n|Lotion|Sun Bum|[Orignal 50 SPF](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Moisturizing-Sunscreen-Protection-Hypoallergenic/dp/B004XGPM32/)|50|10|6.1|3|PA++|5.7|Y|N|N|**Y**|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"non-greasy\"|$1.88|$0.19|$0.31|\n|Lotion|Sun Bum|[Original 50 Face Lotion](https://www.amazon.com/Sun-Bum-Lotion-Spectrum-Protection/dp/B07B685MFG/)|50|10|6.1|3|PA++|5.7|Y|N|N|**Y**|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"non-greasy\"|$4.33|$0.43|$0.71|\n|Lotion|Avene|[Ultra-Light Hydrating Sunscreen Lotion](https://www.pharmaca.com/avene-ultra-light-hydrating-sunscreen-lotion-spf-50-1-3oz-1)|50+|10|6|3|PA++|5.7|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"not greasy\"|$14.12|$1.41|$2.35|\n|Lotion|La Roche Posay|[Anthelios Clear Skin Oil Free](https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Anthelios-Clear-Skin-Sunscreen/dp/B01A0NT3D6)|60|10|5.9|3|PA++|5.2|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy\"|$11.83|$1.18|$2.01|\n|Lotion|Altruist Dermatologist|[Sunscreen SPF50†](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Altruist-Dermatologist-Sunscreen-SPF-50/dp/B06X6LZWRC)|50|\\~10?|\\~5.9?||||?|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"non greasy\"|$1.45|$0.14|$0.25|\n|Lotion|Bioderma|[Photoderm MAX Lait SPF 50+†](https://www.rakuten.com/shop/perfume-worldwide/product/U-SC-3311/?sku=U-SC-3311)|50+|10|5.9||||Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"leaves skin a bit shiny\"|$7.88|$0.79|$1.34|\n|Lotion|Eucerin|[Sun Fluid Sensitive Protect SPF 50+†](https://store.sweetcare.pt/eucerin-facial-sunscreens-p-002734eu?)|50+|\\~10?|\\~5.9?||||?|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Company claims it's \"non-greasy texture\"|$11.83|$1.18|$2.01|\n|Lotion|Aloe Up|[White Collection 30 SPF](https://www.aloeup.com/shop/white-collection-spf-30-sunscreen-lotion)|30|6|5.6|3|PA++|5.5|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Company claims it's \"non-greasy\"|$3.00|$0.50|$0.54|\n|Lotion|BGS|[Black Girl Sunscreen SPF 30](https://blackgirlsunscreen.com/product/black-girl-sunscreen-spf-30/)|30|6|5.4|3|PA++|4.2|?|N|**Y**|N|Silicone/Acrylic Polymer,|$6.33|$1.06|$1.17|\n|Moisture|La Roche-Posay|[Toleriane Double Repair Facial Moisturizer](https://www.thebeautyplace.com/la-roche-posay-toleriane-double-repair-moisturizer-2-5-oz.html)|30|6|6|3|PA++|5.2|Y|N|**Y**|N||$7.87|$1.31|$1.31|\n|Moisture|CeraVe|[Ultra Light Moisturizer + SPF 30](https://www.walmart.com/ip/CeraVe-Ultra-Light-Moisturizing-Face-Lotion-with-SPF-30-1-7-oz/647153722)|30|6|5.4|3|PA++|4.2|Y|N|N|N|Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"wasn't greasy\"|$8.82|$1.47|$1.63​|\n\n\\* Not sure why, but the SPF 30 tested a higher UVA protection than SPF 50  \n† Doesn’t list % of active ingredients.

        "body": "Hi, nice post.\n\nThere are a few details I would like to explain:\n\n* **PA-rating** is NOT related to SPF. PA++ is a PDD between 4 and 8, no matter the stated SPF. **Boots star rating** IS a relative information though (in percentage of SPF; 3 stars is the minimum)\n* **Trolamine** **Salicylate** might get banned, but I've honestly never seen it in any sunscreen. I think it'd be much harder to find one that has it than to list it as a \"bad thing not to have\"\n* **comedogenic ratings** are close to useless. Some individuals might find their skin reacts according to the CosDNA scale or some other, but it's not a general/scientific thing. Products stating to be non-comedogenic can still be comedogenic. There is no regulation or common standard or anything. Btw, **Tocopherol** often gets a higher comedogenic rating, and some people really have to avoid it.\n* Similar with the \"feel\" of a product, though there might be a bit more of consensus. **Acrylates/Silicone Copolymer** usually improve the spreadability of a sunscreen, increasing its protection (which is one of the two major reasons the Sunscreen Simulator tends to underestimate protection). They (the copolymers or acrilates, not the silicone) are also necessary to make a product resistant to sweat and water. I personally prefer such products because they actually tend to feel *less* greasy.  **Methyl Methacrylate** is a common ingredient to encapsulate UV filters, which improves their stability (something Avobenzone and also Octinoxate need). Tinosorb S Aqua (Tinosorb S on steroids) also uses this technology.\n* **Parebens** are not all equal. You may want to avoid them all, your choice, but Methyl- and Ethylparaben are technically not capable of binding to your hormone receptors, so they basically cannot disrupt your hormones. Butyl- and especially Propylparaben are different (longer chains, higher affinity - but still very low; wait for next week when the CIR is releasing their final safety assessment of Parabens, the tentative report is incomplete but the discussions are worth a read if you're interested). They are also the least likely preservative to cause any irritation or reaction in sensitive skin, though there are of course some people who do not tolerate them.\n* As long as the sunscreen doesn't come in an aerosol bottle (which is harmful to the environment, does not provide decent protection, and is dangerous for a large number of ingredients), mentioning ingredients that are **potentially toxic when inhaled** as a con doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Talc, etc etc are all toxic when inhaled at larger quantities, not because the substances themselves are harmful but because the particles have a structure that is specifically dangerous to our lungs. The EU is currently deciding on the danger of TiO2 for that reason alone, we might get some sort of warning on products in the future (in the EU).\n* most people are able to use **Sunflower oil** without any issues. Most non-synthetic and some synthetic substances are potential allergens for some. Not worth to be mentioned imho. **Methylisothiazolinone** for example is banned in the EU for leave-on products due to its high allergenic potential, as with continued use more and more people developed sensitivities to it. But: it is still fine for 95% of the population.\n* whether a sunscreen leaves a **whitecast** or not is actually quite easy to determine. There are only a few ingredients that are visibly white: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Tinosorb A2B and Tinosorb M. They can be totally invisible on pale/light skin, but easy to sport on deeper tones. If a sunscreen does not contain any of these, it is invisible.\n* The UVA-PF of **Altruist** is 31 for the SPF50, and 23 for the SPF30.\n* Right, as you can see in the Sunscreen Simulator, **UVA-PF** (Europe) and PPD (Asia) are NOT the same. So comparing PA++++ (PPD of 16 or higher) to SPF50 with UVA-circle (UVA+PF of 16.66667 or higher) is a bit sketchy (though we all do it, because we have no other information).\n* I'm a bit surprised about your love for **Avobenzone**. Yes, it provides great UVA protection but it is highly unstable, stings people's eyes and stains your clothes (yellow). Uvinul A Plus is the way to go in my opinion (same pros, no cons). In order to trust Avobenzone you'll want to make sure it is at least stabilized. Ideally by Octocrylene (3.8% of that and Avobenzone barely degrades at all over 8 hours, really the best stabilizer; Oxybenzone is also good, Octisalate and the Tinosorbs are not that powerful). Octinoxate and minerals (TiO2, ZnO) decrease the stability of Avobenzone, unless coated (Avobenzone can also be encapsulated, same goes for Ocinoxate - encapsulated Octinoxate is quite stable, does not penetrate the skin and provides better protection).\n\nOut of curiousity, what is the problem with short chain alcohols? There is a risk of irritation for some people, but that is very individual, not only with respect to the person but also the product.\n\nAnd where did you find the information that PABA will get banned? Does it apply to derivatives? That would surprise me. Ethylhexy Triazone does not pose any substantial risk to human health as far as we know, it's too big to be absorbed into the skin and has thus far has not shown to cause allergic reactions or anything.\n\nThere is a bill suggested in California that proposes the ban of ingredients that are known to be dangerous.  [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill\\_id=201920200AB495](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB495)\n\nAnother suggestion is to look into European (or Asian, though Ocinoxate is extremly popular there) sunscreens.\n\nAnd definitely have a look to Peter's Posts and Excel sheet:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/5w4o0g/sun\\_care\\_mega\\_list\\_of\\_fragrance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/5w4o0g/sun_care_mega_list_of_fragrance/)  and  [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/a1m15a/review\\_comparison\\_of\\_sunscreens\\_with\\_tinosorb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/a1m15a/review_comparison_of_sunscreens_with_tinosorb/)",

        "body": "The sunscreen calculator is considered unreliable. It doesn’t take into account how other filters boost uva protection of others, or the boost from antioxidants and so on.\n\nEwg is as equally unreliable. \n\nYou should look at kind of Stephens website/blog. Probably the best source of info and understandable explainations. Lab muffin is pretty reasonable also. They both also link the research on the supposedly risky avo and at best it shows we would need 277 years of daily all over use to cause any effect on us.\n\nI agree that physical filters on their own are massively over rated. When most of the population can’t wear thick enough layers of them without getting impossible whitecast then they can’t provide the protection advertised on the bottle. I’m also somewhat sick of hearing that physical filters are ideal for sensitive skins- ymmv always applies and I’m sure I’m not the only dry and sensitive skinned person who reacts badly to zinc oxide. Yet I get on great with chemical filters, as long as the base is fragrance free and moisturising. \n\nI think the other issue with sunscreens often not noted is whether they are water resistant or not. Sweating filters off won’t offer protection as advertised.",

Avobenzone needs other filters to stabilize it. Avobenzone by itself degrades so so so much faster without the accompanying stabilizer like tinosorb, mexoryl, uvinul, octocrylene, etc. \n\nAnd avobenzone can't be mixed with uncoated mineral filters as they also can degrade avobenzone.",

I am not sure about my skin type yet(combo, dry patches, probably dehydrated, easily irritated) and also am new to reddit so please bear with me :)\n\n\nAbout the brand: L300 is a Swedish skin care line/brand that is based on ingredients found naturally in the skin. At least Intensive moisture(for dry skin) and Ultra Sensitive(for sensitive skin) are free of parabens, mineral oils and added perfumes. This information was found on the brands  website, language options there are only in finnish and in swedish.\n\nPH: ~5.3 according to one of the retailers. \n\nPrice: 6.90€ was the best price I found not in sale from the store in Finland. I also noticed that unless you live in Finland or Sweden these products might be hard to find or too expensive with shipping to order.\n\nPackage: The look of the bottle is very simple and cap keeps the dispenser clean. I have now been using it for almost 2 months and there's still almost half a bottle left. \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/AYYow\n\n\n\nThe dispenser gives enough foam to cleanse whole face with one push. Foam is very easy to apply, has a nice texture and doesn't dissolve too much. After washing my face feels very soft(this was mentioned in many other reviews I read about this product) and to my surprise and delight it didin't irritate my face or break me out. This product alone with regular moisturizing has made most of my dry patches dissappear, I have had less breakouts and my facial skin feels much happier and glowier now. \n\n\nOverall I am very satisfied with this cleanser, definitely gonna buy it or the Ultra Sensitive one when this one empties. \n\nI recommend this product to someone who hasn't yet found a gentle enough foam cleanser and is looking for something cheap and handy\n\n\nPrice-quantity-quality: 4,5/5\n\n\n\nIngredients: Water, glycerine, sodium laureth sulfate, PEG-800, PEG-12, sodium lauroyl glutamate, phenoxyethanol(!), betaine, panthenol, caprylyl glycol, sodium lactate, sodium PCA, glycine, fructose, urea, niaciamide, inositol, lactic acid, propylene glycol, sodium benzoate, sodium chloride, citric acid, BHA(only explained as \"antioxidant\" on the website) and pantolactone",

Joy!\n\nThen I when my gf stayed over and noticed the toothpaste had changed I told her I made the 2 changes, but I wasn't sure which one fixed it. I chose to brush with the sonicare cause I like the vibration and the way it makes my teeth feel... That evening I felt one growing on my right cheek, then over the next  2 days one slowly grew in the back of my left cheek!\n\nIt turns out I found the cause and it's funny how obvious it is in retrospect. I bought the toothbrush when I started getting lots and I've used the toothpaste with SLS for years. (I'm still switching toothpaste just to be safe, I got some with the old stuff)\n\n\nLuckily I did discover 2 cures that do work for me during my raid of canker sores, but they have a huge caveat.\n\nNumber 1 cure: big ass salt rinses -  I forget who posted this, but it was on this subreddit. Rinse with very salty water for 5 minutes at least 3 times a day, sometimes I do it 6 or more.\n\nNumber 2 cure: clorohexadine mouthwash - I use this 1-2 times a day when I don't feel like doing a salt rinse. Its much less harsh and tastes better. It also has a numbing effect for sometimes up to an hour or more.\n\n~~ Huge Caveat ~~~\nI have found these only work if the canker sores are newer and more importantly DEEP. I have observed the healing process in canker sores so many times and without treatment they have phases:\n\n1:looks like a cut or scrape - very easy to miss this phase and might not happen to all sores\n\n2: Small and deep with the typical grey/beige coloring\n\n3: growing in diameter to maximum, still notably indented\n\n4: stays the same size but gradually becomes flatter then eventually rounded at the top\n\n5: once the top is rounded, pain is usually less and slowly dissipates as it disappears\n\n\nMaybe mine are different than others, but this is 100% consistent with my untreated ones. \n\nIf I do salt rinses with or without clorohexadine at phase 1 or 2, it folds in on itself and never gets to phase 3+\n\nIf I do to rinses near the end of phase 3 or during phase 4/5, NOTHING happens, no difference.\n\nSo ya, long post, hope it helps some people.\n\nTLDR: \nMy electric toothbrush was causing my sores and maybe a little bit of my SLS toothpaste too. Swapping then cured my sores, yay!\n\n5 minute salt rinses 3-6 times a day really help (with or without clorohexadine mouthwash rinses as well) but only if the sores are new and deep. \n\nWorks for me, hope it works for others!",

    "body": "When we enter in this curly world will come across various abbreviations and new words like cg ( Curly girl method ) , cgm, fsg, sotc, **Hair types**, hair porosity, etc. etc. Well in the beginning it will be really confusing and overwhelming coz we have never used this or heard this type of terms. (That was my case too, all i new was, “I have CURLY HAIR”)But it is not necessary to understand everything right in the beginning. Take baby steps  So let me make it simple for you guys.CG METHOD – **Curly girl** method.Yes CG means curly girl. Textured hair (**Wavy**, **Curly**, **Coily**) are naturally dry as the sebum (natural oils) cannot travel through our **Hair length**, hence it lacks moisture and shine.So now the question is what to do? How to take care of it? Well it’s very simple. All we have to do is to make certain changes in our **Washing style** (I mean hair washing style). Let us divide the curly girl method into 4 steps to make it more clear and easy.\n\n* STEP 1: **CLEANSING**.\n\nAs the word suggest we have to clean our hair. BUT here’s the catch in Curly girl method we don’t use normal shampoos. Because it contains harsh chemicals (surfactant) like “sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate, with co – surfactant, most often cocamidopropyl betaine (WHAT?)Too much to remember right? Too make it simple for you go let us do a test grab the current shampoo bottle you have at your home read the first ingredient on it or may be second and if u find anything which ends with sulfate than that’s it . STOP using it. (Why?)Because it is a detergent and that dries out textured hair. It will strip away our natural oils and it will make it more frizzy and dry. So instead of using sulfate shampoos use **Sulfate free shampoos or cowash** (wash with conditioner) on your scalp to remove the dirt and oil.The original cg method suggest to co wash as its less harmful for our scalp too but there can be certain places that you might not able to find a proper co wash hence u can use a sulfate free shampoo instead.So the MORAL of the story is: **Use Sulfate free shampoos Or COWASH to clean your hair and scalp.**\n\n* STEP 2: **CONDITIONING.**\n\nWell we all use conditioner Dahh! What’s new about it? (This is what I was thinking when I started my journey). Well conditioner is a boon to curly girl; it’s the key to have gorgeous hair. (IS IT?) But I am also using conditioner and I have tried dozens of conditioners nothing makes my hair soft, frizz free, gorgeous like we see on commercials L not even spa treatments at saloons. This is what u must have been thinking. JUST KIDDING 😉Well conditioner in curly girl method is must. Seriously this is one thing that not a single curly can live without. So again here’s the catch we don’t use normal conditioner \\[nothing about a curly girl is normal we all are extraordinary ;)\\]. Jokes apart normal conditioner mostly contain SILICONE (remember SILICONE). Commonly found by the names as: Dimethicone, Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone, cyclopentasiloxane, and demithiconal etc. … (Ahh! Again science)To make it simple go grab your current hair conditioner and read **READ** your ingredients list. If you find anything that ends with CONE, XANE or CONOL.STOP using it. (Why?)Because silicones are Plastic. Yes you read it right it’s a type of plastic which will coat your hair to look manageable and shiny for few hours and it gives us a smooth feel and great slip but it will block the natural moisture to enter into your hair. We curlies don’t need silicone. Because it’s bad very bad for hair in general.  (I mean even to straight hair girls/boys). This makes our hair dead, lifeless, dry and the only thing that can remove this plastic form our hair is SULFATE. So again more dryness, trust me our hair deserve much more than this.So what to do now? Simple, use **silicone free conditioners**. In cg method we use conditioner for two purposes, one is to detangle and other is to condish (u can also use it as a co wash).So the MORAL of the story is: **Use Silicone free conditioner**\n\n* STEP 3: **DETANGLE.**\n\nAs we talked above detangling comes while conditioning. \\*\\*Why do we do this?\\*\\*Because in curly girl method we do not use combs once our hair is dry.**NO DRY COMBING OR DETANGLING.** Yes unlike our straight hair friends we don’t have to use comb after our hair gets dry. If will do this then our curls will break and will end up having a frizz ball. (Remember combing will **not** make your hair straight… **never**) so stay away from combs. It’s kind of a myth in India.So now the question is **HOW to detangle and when to detangle?**  Detangle your hair in shower when is fully saturated with water and conditioner, you can use your fingers or wide tooth combs which is less harmful for textured hair. **Curly hair** is very fragile they can break easily. So if you’ll dry comb your hair then not only it will be frizzy but you’ll lose lot of hair due to breakage which will lead to more frizz.So the MORAL of the story is: **Detangle with the conditioner or a leave in conditioner or wit oil.**\n\n* STEP 4: **STYLING.**\n\nThe third most important Step after well after all of the above steps is styling.There are different techniques used in curly world. If you’ll goggle, **How to style naturally curly hair?**  Then you will come across these names: \\*\\*Rake and shake, praying hands, shingling, finger coiling, twist out, scrunching… etc. etc.\\*\\*What are these techniques used for? Well we use it to put products after we wash our hair. (Will talk about it in another article) Basically we need two products after washing:**Leave in conditioner and gel.** But there are other products too: Curl creams, Smoothies, Mousse, Custard, Soufflé etc… Etc.  Now what does these products do? Well they are used to get definition, shine, hold, moisture for longer duration.**LEAVE in CONDITIONER:**  First of all don’t get it mixed with **serum.** Serum contains silicone and we don’t want that in our hair so no livons! Leave on conditioners are little different from the rinse out conditioner its less thick but moisturizing hence we need this in our routine. This will be on our hair for days, till the next wash so it will help to keep our locks look moisturized and live.  They will not harm our hair but use **silicone free and alcohol free** styling products. You can also use your rinse out conditioner as leave in conditioner.**GEL:** Yes u read it right. Gels in India are mostly used by man so we never thought of using it on our hair. But yet again gels contain harmful and drying alcohols so why do we have to use this? Well we don’t have to use the gels which contain harmful alcohol and silicones but here in curly girl method we use organic gels.Gels which are alcohol free and safe to use on your hair. Now the question is what do gels do? Ya why do we need them? Gels are mostly used to give hold to our curls. It will lock the moisture of our conditioners and make our curls frizz free. How interesting right 😉 so using right gel will help your curls survive for days.So the MORAL of the story is: \\*\\*Use Silicone and alcohol free leave in conditioner and gel to style our hair.\\*\\*This concludes the basic steps of a curly girl method. There is more as I said there is a whole curly world. But it’s not rocket science. You can crack that. Just start with basic steps and you will see a huge difference in your hair.Also if you want to start your journey today, then start with a pure sulfate shampoo(without silicone)  as your final wash to remove all the silicone build ups and then use a co wash or a sulfate free shampoo, silicone free conditioner and an alcohol free gel , get these products and you are ready to begin your natural hair journey.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sxp1y3jjqs421.jpg?width=1359&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75218d503d6cb282a26fc9112b1a0dc891d4f7a2",

However, I've realized a few things recently that point to a different cause.\n\nWhile I was abroad, I was using one washcloth to wash my face and my body, and it was difficult to do laundry so I couldn't use a fresh one often. And about two weeks into the trip I got the worst breakout of my life. I was using this travel body wash that contained SLS and SLES and I was applying it to my face everyday, basically. No big deal, SLS is in everything, right? \n\nThe problem is that while this breakout has for the most part been healed, I keep getting acne. Last week I got some really huge pimples, the likes of which I haven't had in a while. And while in the shower today I realized that I had been using that same body wash I used over the summer because I ran out of my regular body wash. Could this be causing my issues? It should also be noted that I've recently been washing my hands with foaming soap (which of course contains SLS and SLES, I just checked) right before applying moisturizer, and my shampoo contains SLS.\n\nAlso: And all of the products that did contribute to the clearing of my face after the summer did not contain any sulfates at all.\n\nTL;DR Could these sulfates be causing my problems or am I just reaching too hard for an explanation? There is a lot of information out there about skin irritation and SLS but not much about whole-face acne breakouts.",

According to the isitcg.com site, it has sulphates, in the form of Sodium Laureth Sulfate and an unknown, Steareth-4 in it. Are these ok for my final (or reset) shampoo/to shampoo out hair dye?\n\n\n2) Similar to 1. I have lush Jason and the argon oil shampoo bar. It also has sodium laureth sulphate as well as several unknowns, mainly perfumes/natural oils as well as agar agar and colour 17200. Can I use this for my final (or reset) shampoo/to shampoo out hair dye?\n\n\n3) My current conditioner, lush retread, apparently isn't CG ok as it has sodium laureth sulphate. Any suggestions for what I can use instead? Also, do I need a conditionor for co-washing and one for conditioning or can I use the same one for both? When I've tried conditioner bars in the past, I've not got on with them btw.\n\n\nThanks :)",

You just have to make sure you rinse them out well to remove any excess as they are fairly oil rich formulas. The shampoos are not CG method friendly though. \n\nI use johnsons baby shampoo currently, cleans my hair, while not stripping it at all, its lovely. If your looking for a higher quality alternative to that, the NYK1 shampoo and conditioner on amazon is really good and lasts a while, just was too pricey for me, when I get the same results with the baby shampoo! You could also go down the co wash route if you want, I've never tried it though! \n\nI will say even other surfactants, not only SLS and ALS, are super stripping and drying in some curly approved shampoos, so try and find a list saying which ones are okay. I found one a while back listing all the completely gentle cleansers, the ones that are drying for some, and then the harsh ones(like SLS), and it's helped a lot, since I found even the only drying for some, were worst than the harsh ones on my hair. I can only use the fully gentle, non sulfates.\n\nAlso if you are co washing, it depends on the conditioner and your hair. Typically a less heavy and rich conditioner/co wash gives the best washing results I've read, and depending on what you prefer for your ends richness wise you can basically choose whether to use the same conditioner or not. I wouldnt say specific co washes would be used on your ends tho.",

Turns out normal gel hand soap has SLS (sodium laureth sulfate) to make it foamy, bar soap doesn't. \n\nI then switched to SLS-free shampoo as well to check whether that's causing the irritation, a few weeks later, my sebderm cleared completely.\n\nHope this helps someone!

Getting a good foundation will help the most then you can add other ingredients to help whatever you base routine didn't fix.

I would leave that on for an hour or two and then wash it off. Then apply Aloe Vera as moisturizer I did this for a few days and my skin bounced back. I would do this for right now then I would get into a skincare routine! If you still find moisturizers too harsh try rosehip oil! I only use oil to moisturize my skin!!\n\nThis is what I would do:\nMorning:\nCleanser: None\nToner: Hydrating Toner\nMoisturizer: I don't use one since I'm Oily\nSunscreen: I use a Mineral Sunscreen\n\nNight: \n1st Cleanser: Oil cleanser or Micellar Water\n2nd Cleanse: Gentle Cleanser\nToner: Hydrating Toner\nMoisturizer:  Oil \n\nHere's some products I recommend you trying: \n\nCleanser: \nStartia Velvet Milk Cleanser \nCeraVE Hydrating Cleanser\nIndie Lee Rosehip Cleanser\n\nToner: \nPyungKang Yul Essence Toner or\nIsntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner \n(Korea and Japan make the best toners in my humble opinion.)\n\nMoisturizer: \nCeraVE PM (Not my favorite but well loved)\nStratia Liquid Gold\nOil!

If you like the way it makes your hair look and feel (and it's not outrageously expensive, because it shouldn't be) that's really what counts.\n\nIt's not necessarily bad (obligatory some people don't like sulfates cleansers, some people avoid heavy silicones) but there's also nothing special or unique about it.  \n\n**Edit**: I just noticed that it has zinc pyrithione in it, which can be a dandruff treatment.  I will check how much z.p. needs to be in a formula to be considered an active (edit: it's 0.3% for the control of dandruff (FDA final monograph [here](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Over-the-CounterOTCDrugs/StatusofOTCRulemakings/ucm111019.pdf), page 6 of the document).  That's plausible.  Not all the clear products seem to follow the labeling laws for OTCs though, and not all of the them even make dandruff-related claims, which might mean they're not all functional dandruff shampoos?  \n\n**OP, could you please give more information as to which shampoo in the Clear Line this is?  Is it being marketed as a Dandruff shampoo? Can you link to it?  I cant quickly find the one that matches the name in your title and the ingredient list in your post.**\n\n**Edit**: Just because it's interesting, Clear is owned by Unilever.  I thought it might be interesting to look at some of Unilever's other brand's products.\n\nHere's Suave Deep Moisture shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Glycerin, Dimethiconol, Fragrance, Carbomer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, TEA Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, PPG 9, Tetrasodium EDTA, TEA Sulfate, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, PEG 45M, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)\n\nYou can see it's pretty similar.  This one doesn't have the dimethicone, but the basic system is very close.\n\nHere's Dove Nutritive Solutions Daily Moisture:\n\n> Water (Aqua), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Glycol Distearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycerin, Dimethicone, Dimethiconol, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Tetrasodium EDTA, Amodimethicone, DMDM Hydantoin, PEG-45M, Tea-Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, Cocamide Mea, Lysine HCI, Arginine, Peg-9M, Cetrimonium Chloride, PPG-9, Propylene Glycol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Red 33 (CI 17200).\n\nAgain, not identical of course, but pretty similar.  The basic sulfate cleanser + silicone is pretty common in \"moisturizing\" shampoos.\n\nIf your product is a real dandruff shampoo, here's a rival: Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Shampoo:\n\n> active ingredient: zinc pyrithione 1% inactive ingredients: Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Dimethicone, Cocamide MEA, Zinc Carbonate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Magnesium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Magnesium Carbonate Hydroxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Yellow 5, Red 33, Blue 1\n\nNot identical again (could plausibly expect it to be a stronger cleanser), but same sort of idea.

That could *potentially* cause some problems on the scalp, but there are two caveats to what I'm saying: 1) GHC is pretty low on the ingredients list here, so it might not be enough to interact with the dimethicone to any significant degree 2) I've only read research on this in the context of binding to hair, not skin. I can't say whether or not the action would happen there too.\n\nSo if this is making you happy, then you're probably good to go. Just keep an objective eye on it for a month or two perhaps to see if there's any serious uptick in hair loss or dandruff. Like Hamfan said as well, it likely won't be very gentle to the scalp because of the sodium laureth sulfate, so if your skin is on the sensitive side, that might cause you some dryness and hair fall. \n\nKey word in all this being *might.*",

    "body": "Hey guys, we are happy to start this thread as we stand by the notion that everyone has the right to look and feel their very best, and we want to bring attention to this important issue as most of us are duped into the idea that our genes are our fate and that if hair loss runs in your family there is nothing you can do about it. \n\nVery little is known about how you can truly reverse hair loss because many people wrongly view it as a cosmetic disorder. Unfortunately, the vast majority of dermatologists still share the outdated belief that diet and compromised body systems are unrelated to the etiology of hair loss. Big Pharma drug products being sold (like Rogaine and propecia) take full advantage of the public's lack of knowledge on the subject.\n\nThe results of the human genome project have now shown us that genetics are not your destiny and that the epigenome is constantly responding and reacting to your environmental and dietary factors. In other words, gene expression is determined by a number of factors and just because hair loss runs in your family does not mean you can’t reverse and stave off hair loss. In other words, weight gain, excessive physical or mental stress, environmental pollution, poor diet and eating disorders, lack of vitamins and minerals, and a buildup of toxins in the body all play a large part. Do genetics play a role? Yes, but your genes just determine a supsceptivity towards thinning and hair loss. There are many ways for halting the process naturally for all types of hair loss. The key is getting to the root cause of the problem as opposed to treating the symptoms.\n\nHere are some recommendations that will be a good starting point for those needing help. You can get them through food sources but for most utilizing them in supplement form will probably be easiest.  They address the most critical elements in hair loss and are proven through scientific research. Best of all, anyone wanting to thicken their existing hair, maintain its natural luster, or just add body and extra shine to it can follow these methods too. Always remember that reversing any type of hair loss is a process, requiring a search into your whole body. What factors effecting one person’s body may not effect another which is why some people recover quicker. Discovering these factors can make all the difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The first natural compound that you should be taking on a daily basis is scutellaria baicalensis, which has been used extensively throughout the world as a medicinal remedy for eczema, psriosis, hay fever, hepatitis, bronchitis, and a whole host of other conditions that call for antibacterial treatments. As if all of these curative benefits weren’t enough, scutellaria baicalensis also enhances hair growth and prevents further hair loss by inhibiting DHT binding with the androgen receptor and regulating the hair growth factor. In essence, this forces your follicles to transition from the telogen to anagen growth phase, which puts a stop to widespread hair loss. A brand actually carried out testing on an active ingredient that consisted primarily of baicalin on hair loss patients, and the results were fantastic, especially for a 3-month treatment. We recommend taking one scutellaria baicalensis supplement every morning.\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496985](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496985)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. The second tip we’d like to share with you is utilizing Ecklonia Cava which is one of the most multifaceted supplements you can add to your routine. It can stimulate hair growth, prevent hair follicle death, and reduce DHT activity in a natural way. Research has also found that the enzyme responsible for hair and skin follicle degradation, Matrix Metallopretianse-9, is greatly inhibited by Ecklonia Cava. And last but certainly not least it even helps improve blood pressure and circulation which can aid in the condition of your hair. We recommend taking two a day, one in the morning and another at night.\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24252083](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24252083)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Our third hair regrowth supplement we recommend is a combination of Curcumin and Resveratrol. Curcumin, is a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to your scalp health. Not only does it downregulate the androgen receptor and impede GSK-3beta, which is responsible for overflow of sebum on the scalp, but it also has the power to block Cannabinnoid receptor-1 when it’s combined with resveratrol. This is important because Cannabinnoid receptor-1 is to blame for detrimental hair growth cues due to stress and anxiety. Stress related hair loss is one of the most prevalent types of hair loss in the world today, and has very little to do with DHT or Genetics. These two supplements will help you take that hair regrowth obstacle out of your way. We recommend supplementing with both Curcumin and resveratrol daily.\n\n\\[3\\] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19328683](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19328683)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. The fourth supplement we recommend using on a regular basis is Milk Thistle for liver function. Alcohol, stress, fatty and sugary foods, can all contribute to hair loss because they all put stress on the liver. The liver removes hormones and toxins from our bodies including free testosterone and DHT. If it starts to underperform, levels of these hormones rise. Supplementing with milk thistle on a regular basis can help improve the functioning of your liver and thus improve your overall health and hair. We suggest taking one a day.\n\n\\[4\\] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9590429](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9590429)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. The fifth recommendation is taking an Omega-3 fatty acid supplement every day. Specific hormones, called prostaglandins, can slow hair follicle growth and when left unchecked greatly contribute to hair loss by allowing another hormone called interleukin 6 to shorten the anagen hair growth stage and extend the catagen hair sleeping stage. Using an Omega-3 supplement on a daily basis helps to suppress this inflammatory prostaglandin which is a direct response to DHT. Additionally, Omega-3 provides important health benefits to the cardiovascular system, the immune system, supports healthy growth and development, and reduces inflammation. We recommend taking Krill Oil twice a day which is an excellent choice for getting the right amount of Omega-3 in the diet.\n\n\\[5\\] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21881585](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21881585)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. The sixth tip isn’t a supplement, but a hair growth salve. It’s crucial to use a topical aid when treating hair loss. The supplements help your body from the inside out, and an effective topical directly addresses the scalp and hair from another front. A topical aid also gives you the chance to alleviate scalp inflammation and hair loss until your body’s hormone levels are balanced out. If at all possible, try to avoid chemicals and opt for a natural topical that does not create dependent hairs but rather stimulates and aids hair growth naturally. You may have heard that certain essential oils topically are effective against hair loss. Well this is true, as a study that compared the effectiveness of Rosemary Oil vs. the effectiveness of Minoxidil showed that rosemary oil was just as effective without the side effects. Start off using it every day and after you start seeing an improvement in your hair you can ease off and use it every other day.\n\n\\[6\\] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25842469](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25842469)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. The final tip is actually something that you should avoid. If at all possible, steer clear of chemical laced shampoos and opt for only natural hair care products. The wrong products strip your hair of its protective oils, which causes breakage and exacerbates your hair loss. Our rule of thumb when choosing a new shampoo is to avoid the following ingredients. Sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, propylene glycol, PEG, DEA, TEA, parabens, and fragrances. All of these harmful ingredients can cause micro inflammation in your scalp and follicles.\n\nThis is a fantastic beginners guide for stopping hair loss and taking control of your hair regrowth. If you have any questions or need any help don't hesitate to reach out with your questions. Best of luck. \n\n[Naturecrazy.com/ProHairHealthRevolution](https://naturecrazy.com/pages/about)",

Now I am on the hunt for a detergent that doesn't contain any sodium ingredients (sodium tallowate, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), sodium laurate, sodium cocoate). I would love to just make our own detergent using soap flakes+ washing soda, but all the soap flakes I can find all have sodium-based ingredients.

All sulfates are salts and surfactants, but there are other non-sulfate salts (including washing soda) and sulfate free surfactants. So if the washing soda is okay, then you can adjust your criteria accordingly and look for a sulfate free (and probably fragrance free, because a lot of fragrances can be irritating for skin conditions) detergent. If the issue is sulfates, which is common with eczema so it likely is, then sodium tallowate and sodium cocoate are fine, as those are both sulfate free surfactants. Unscented Fels-Naptha + washing soda may be a good option for you. It’s a very simple formula with few ingredients so even if he does react to it, it should be easy to identify the ingredient that’s causing that. If he doesn’t react to it (and I suspect he won’t), then you’ll have a short list of ingredients you know are safe for him and if you want to change detergents in the future, you can work off the knowledge that those sulfate free surfactants are okay.",

Both dry out and irritate the skin.\n\nPolypropylene: This has been identified as a possible carcinogen.\n\nTriclosan: Triclosan is an antibacterial and antimicrobial ingredient added to soaps which causes irritation.\n\nSynthetic dyes: They make soaps colorful and are made from petrochemicals that can cause allergies, skin irritations, hives and respiratory problems.\n\nLye: A concentrated and watery solution of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. It is often combined with caustic soda because it is very corrosive and may also cause itching, irritation and burns.\n\nTips for Dry Skin Care:\n \nIt is necessary to avoid cleansers that contain harsh and drying ingredients such as antibacterials, fragrances, parabens, alcohol, dyes and additives.\n\nAvoid soaking the skin in water for a long period of time.\n\nGentle exfoliators that contain AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids) and BHAs (beta hydroxy acids) are best.\n\nWear sunscreen with at least SPF 30 daily.\n\nUse skin boosters that contain non-fragrant skin nourishing plant oils or hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is a natural substance in the skin. It is lost as we age. Adding this ingredient will make a tremendous difference in our skin’s hydration.\n\nUse a humidifier at home during extremely dry and cold weather or periods with low humidity.\n\nUse moisturizers and serums that contain skin replenishing ingredients.\n\nWhat are Skin Replenishing Ingredients?\n      Skin replenishing ingredients enrich the skin’s surface. They supply revitalizing hydration and lock it in on the skin’s surface. Doing this helps dry, tight and uncomfortable skin look and feel soft, supple and smooth.\nDaily application of skin replenishing ingredients protects the skin from environmental factors that lead to loss of moisture and dehydration thereby helping the skin look younger, more vibrant and replenished.\n\nExamples of skin replenishing ingredients include:\n    Those naturally present:\n-ceramides\n-hyaluronic acid\n-sodium PCA\n-glycerin\n-glycerol\n-cholesterol\n-phospholipids\n\n    Those proven by research:\n-silicones\n-petrolatum\n-triglycerides\n-omega fatty acids\n-alpha hydroxy acids (such as glycolic acid)\n-beta hydroxy acids (such as salicylic acid)\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading through this post. Please send in your questions and I’ll respond as soon as possible.\n\nWith love,\nFatima♥♥",

For instance, Paula of PC says to avoid the latter but the former might be a necessary evil... others don't even mention the latter but say the former is as bad--or at least almost as bad--as others.\n\nI know it is totally impossible to avoid sulfates entirely without going to co-washing or tolerating poos that don't clean well... I personally have very fine, thin hair and an oily scalp and am used to shampooing daily (would prefer to, but know I'll have to alternate at least every other day with a dry). But is there any consensus on whether either of these two items is ok? It is so frustrating to look at, for instance, all of Matrix's \"sulfate free\" \"color-safe\" poos and see sodium laureth sulfate, and then look at my totally sulfate free personal favorite like Anthony Volumizing Collagen Bamboo (SOOO effective) sneak in the sodium c14-16 olefin sulfonate as the second ingredient. This latter practice seems a particularly prevalent violation of good faith since it doesn't sound quite as \"sulfatey\" and we're all in total confusion as to which are ok and which aren't.\n\nNote that I'm not concerned about safety issues or the whatlike... just want a shampoo that, when in conjunction with other good practices like violet shampoos/toners, using lukewarm water/limiting water contact as much as possible, heat/UV protection, using only every second or even third day if I can do it, etc. will let me 1) maintain blonde as long as possible without going blo-range and 2) clean my oily scalp so I can deal with the necessity of using a dry shampoo on off-days.\n\nAnd if anyone is interested, I can provide a list of the shampoos I'm considering (this post is getting pretty long as it is); I'm making a spreadsheet based on Ulta's 1 liter sale going on now/MUA reviews/ingredient concerns. And unfortunately the recs list in the wiki here is out of date (the one listing is just for a conditioner--not really the major issue for color-safe hair issues anyway--Tresemme Naturals--has apparently been reformulated and now has a variety of choices, all ostensibly with different ingredient lists). \n\nThanks much for any clarification of this anyone can provide.",

The hair was clean, I think it was too clean, there was more resistance when brushing vs after shampoo washing, there was significantly more hair left on my hands (and on the brush when brushing too I think) when applying the product. I think the hair was somewhat sticky and waxy, but not too much.\n\nThe second time I did it the easy way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage (and in the process get a bit on the hair and ends too), wait, wash. The hair was clean enough (not shampoo-clean, but I think that's better for my hair and for my scalp's accomodation). There was more resistance when brushign vs after shampoo washing (and I think also vs the first co-wash). There too was significantly more hair left on my hands when applying the product, but because it was applied only once it was this much less hair loss. My hair is sticky, waxy. It looks good, but feels really bad, because of the stickiness.\n\nI used warm water.\n\nTo put this into perspective, if I brush my hair downwards while leaning down, the hair will literally stay in the air afterwards as if I gelled it or something. This effect is present to some extent after I shampoo-wash too, but not this extremely. It's also quite difficult to brush in the first place.\n\nThe conditioner somewhat sticks to the hair even while washing with it, the consistency of conditioner is gluey, sticky, it doesn't make my fingers run through my hair with conditioner applied run buttery smoothly, but rather the complete opposite, I'm scared of pulling my hair out this way... No hair loss when rinsing it off. \n\nMy scalp is also itchy as fuck now. My guess is the preservatives Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone are to blame, but the thing is the shampoo has them too, so maybe not and the waxiness or whatever (co-washing in general) causes this?\n\nI'm pretty certain that the conditioner causes this. I didn't use any other product. When I wash with just shampoo from the same brand (it's SLES based, but it's the opposite of potent, I take few times more of it to achieve the same potency that normal SLS shampoos have, could be the conditioner is similarly \"potent\") and either don't use any other product or only few drops of oil it won't be like this and it's pretty much what I want.\n\nThe ingredients of the conditioner:\n> Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract, Inula Helenium Extract, Humulus Lupulus Flower Extract, Helianthus Annuus Hybrid Oil, Cera Alba, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Chamomilla Recutita Oil, Geranium Sibiricum Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, PEG-12 Dimethicon, Pinus Sibirica Needle Extract, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil Polyglyceryl-6 Esters, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Ceteareth-20, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nNote that Cera Alba (Bees wax), Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride (guar gum derivative) and PEG-12 Dimethicon (water-soluble sillicon) are in it. Could it be that the Bees wax is the problem? The two other ingredients are water soluble so shouldn't be... Cera Alba (Bees wax) is also in the shampoo, but probably in smaller quantity.\n\nIngredients of the shampoo:\n> Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract*, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Glycine Soja Oil, Urtica Dioica Extract*, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Water*, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract*, Salvia Officnalis Oil, Carum Carvi Fruit Oil, Mel*, Saponaria Officinalis Root Extract*, Cera Alba, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Benzyl Salicylate, Hexyl Cinnamal, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nShould I buy another conditioner, keep on using this one or switch to non-harsh shampoo? If I should switch conditioner, what ingredients should I be looking for except no wax and sillicon? No oils? Other surfactants (glucosides instead of kationic chlorides)? Something more oily? Something very minimalistic (just kationic surfactans like cetrimonium chloride and humectants like cetearyl alcohol)? Something with more humectants?  I wouldn't be super happy buying another conditioner just to find out it's trash and I have nothing to do with it.\n\nEdit: My hair is ~5inch/13cm long.",

        "body": "I'm no expert and this is just personal experience over the past several years but I would try an SLS-free shampoo & silicon-/wax-free conditioner to see if that helps. It sounds more like an issue with the conditioner ingredients or other products sticking to your hair and scalp then not getting washed out with the co-wash so it builds up on your hair more and more. I tried many conditioners to co-wash and also water-only but neither worked for me. My hair ended up stringy, heavy and waxy though not as quickly as you have experienced. I have very hard water where I live which can also add to the problem.  You can also look into an apple cider vinegar rinse as an alternative (lots of info on the side-bar).\n\nI have had good success with SLS-free shampoo plus silicon-free conditioner every second wash or so. I only have to wash it once a week with water-only rinses as needed in between washes and my scalp is much less itchy and dry than when I was using regular shampoo or co-washing. When particularly dry and itchy, I use jojoba oil on my scalp as a mask/cleanse before I shower, massage it in well, leave it on for 5-10 minutes then wash out . This also helps with any build-up of product on my scalp.\n\nIt will probably take some trial and error to find out what works for you and a bit of time for your scalp to transition. You may also need to use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of all the build-up on your hair before starting over to give you a clean start but not everyone needs that step.",

They ebb and flow but typically appear for 10-14 days each time, and I occasionally have them in quick succession. These are really quite painful and make eating difficult and drinking difficult, to the point that it's almost a nutrition issue. I've tried to isolate some environmental causes such as toothpaste that contains sodium laureth sulfate but they still persist so I'm certain this is an autoimmune/IBD mediated issue.   \n\n\nMy gastroenterologist has prescribed a mild steroid paste that \"caps\" over the sore called Kenalog in Orabase, and greatly reduces the pain, but I have them so commonly that I don't want to overuse the steroid. My understanding is that oral ulcers seem to be more common in Chron's rather than Ulcerative Colitis - do you think having them this often makes it more likely that my IBD might also have a Chron's element? What are your experiences?",

I want to try a kinder product - thinking a Paula's Choice variety, but running them through COSDNA makes me skeptical! (Also, no Cetyl/Cetearyl/Stearyl Alcohol.) I am also confused - I don't want to risk break out, but it seems possible the harshness of my cleanser was over stripping, so should I stick with an anti-acne line of cleanser, or just supplement BHA and apply BP afterwards, and that would be enough to combat the acne?      \n\nFor the record, I have an oily t-zone. A little rosacea. My cheeks aren't flaky dry, but they are less of an oil slick. I sometimes still break out on them, though. I am also open to any other options than the ones listed below!\n\n1) Option : CLEAR Pore Normalizing Cleanser:  \n\noffender : sodium laureth sulfate (3) and butylene glycol (1)  \n\nDoes anyone use this? Is that sls evil incarnate?  \n\n\n\n2) Option : Hydralight One Step Cleanser :\nSLES (3) , Triethanoamine (2) , and...it says BP3? which it categorizes as a sunscreen? I....I don't think I really need that, if cleansing only before bed. Is COSDNA wrong?  \n\n*BONUS*: Could [this](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/CLEAR-Acne-Treatments/_/CLEAR-Regular-Strength-Anti-Redness-Exfoliating-Solution-With-Two-Percent-Salicylic-Acid/) replace having to choose between the liquid/gel/lotion 2% BHA products the company offers?

        "body": "I would go for the hydralight. I've used them both and the clear is definitely harsher/stronger? I sometimes use it at night when my skin feels particularly oily/gross. I don't have rosacea, but if it makes your skin more sensitive I wouldn't recommend it. The clear cleanser also contains [triclosan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triclosan), which is an anti-bacterial agent. I think it's suppose to help with the acne, but it didn't make a particularly big difference for me. Far more important was the BHA and the BP. There's lots of options for cleansers though, honestly I think PC cleansers are on the expensive side and you could do without. But their BHA are to die for and the 2.5% BP is excellent. \n\nAs for the regular strength clear toner, I love that stuff! It's like the BHA 2% liquid (the extra strength is exactly the same as the BHA 2% liquid fyi) except it doesn't leave a residue on the skin and is more gentle. I'd start with that if you're new to BHA.\n\nIf you're concerned about the prices and not too much about potential irritation from the cleanser, I'd just buy the regular clear kit (or the trial size). If you're not, I'd suggest buying the hydralight cleanser (it comes in 16oz, cheaper by the oz and lasts FOREVER), the regular clear toner and the 2.5% BP.\n\nGood luck! :) PC also has a really good return policy and excellent customer service in my experience.",

There's a huge no-man's-land between high-brow research jargon and trendy \"natural\" health blogs and their miracle cures.\n\nReading the ingredients in most beauty cosmetics feels like a betrayal. The majority carry petroleum based products that make the skin *feel* soft, but have a lasting negative impact, such as the [contamination of dioxanes in sodium laureth sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_laureth_sulfate), or petroleum jelly, which is really only a skin protectant / sealant, not the skin healer it is advertised to be.\n\nOn the flip side, natural health bloggers suggest using highly alkaline products like baking soda (pH of 9) on the skin, which disturbs the acid mantle as surely as irritating petroleum products and fragrances do. It seems like everywhere I look, skin care routines are either drenched in chemical irritants, or invented by misguided trends.\n\nAs educated consumers, how can we define what is healthy when we buy / make our skincare products?",

        "body": "Great post topic. \n\nI was recently researching **Arbutin**. Since using Deciem's Alpha-Arbutin which is claimed to be better than beta-arbutin, the natural arbutin extracted from bearberry leaves.\n\nIn Dr Hannah's Sivak's new book, The Scientific Revolution in Skin Care, i read her comments on this as she had been asked which is better. I learnt  that Alpha-Arbutin is synthetic and is not proven in its effectiveness.\n\nI could not find 1 journal paper on Alpha-Arbutin effectiveness. I found several journal articles that (beta)arbutin is effective in de-pigmenting and it helps tyrosinase inhibit but none for alpha-arbutin which is an invention from the lab. Of course, the trade journals from the manufacturer of the lab says alpha-arbutin is better. I approach their findings with a pinch of salt. Biased, I am not sure I could trust.\n\n**Question:** How do we assess trade journals, both in quality/quantity? Other than biases, other than Vivo / Vitro testing. How about journals that corroborate the same findings, how many is good? What are some reputable skincare journals you recommend?\n\n\n***\n\nIn scenarios like Vitamin C, synthetic L ascorbic acid is better than the natural source eg Kakadu plum (highest natural source but only <5% LAA in reality). L-Ascorbic Acid you get 100% Vitamin C.\n\n***\n\n**Natural is not always better!**\n\nAll-natural ingredients can cause allergic reactions. One study in the British Journal of Dermatology shows that popular natural ingredients such as tea tree oil, feverfew, lavender, and jasmine brought on allergic or sensitivity responses in some people.\n\nAccording to [ScientificAmerican.com](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=slideshow-natural-skin-remedies) some natural concoctions really do work while others are not only unsuccessful but actually potentially harmful. \n\n[See this article by Choice.com.au on Natural and Organic Cosmetics. ](https://www.choice.com.au/health-and-body/beauty-and-personal-care/skin-care-and-cosmetics/articles/natural-and-organic-cosmetics) Many brands are offenders and jumping on the \"natural\" is better bandwagon. Claiming they are using natural ingredients tend to help the bottom line. \n\nI quote this Aloe Vera [post](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-22/no-evidence-of-aloe-vera-found-in-the-aloe-vera-at-wal-mart-cvs). I always thought my aloe vera gel contained 100% natural aloe vera. Wrong.  \n\ningredients: Aloe Vera Gel, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, DMDM Hydantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\nThe choice.com.au article said  \"Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera is 100% Gel – but not 100% Aloe Vera gel. It also contains ingredients prohibited in natural standards – and even in some countries!\"\n\n***\n\nOne more question. Is Organic really better?",

There are many of them, such as Antipodes, Mad Hippie, Acure, Garden of Wisdom, etc. Read the brand's philosophy and from that we might know if that brand is suitable for us or not.",
