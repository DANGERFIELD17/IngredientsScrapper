    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

        "body": "I appreciate you taking the time to write this up and the thought and effort behind it. I will say though that there is one part you should seriously consider editing:\n\n\"Do not use hydroxy acids with retinoids/retinol/Retin-A/Accutane or Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) products. Speaking from personal experience, this is way too much irritation to most people's skin. It can create more breakouts, redness, and inflammation, which is what you're typically trying to fix with these topicals.\"\n\nThis is very incorrect. While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

    "body": "Our Country lacks strict laws, regulations and a testing & approval agency for cosmetics and supplements. All the products in these categories are unregulated.   \nMetformin is a very commonly used drug for diabetes and insulin resistance. Recently regulatory authorities of many developed countries issued a recall of many metformin tablets produced by several manufacturers. And most of these recalled products are manufactured by Indian companies in India. The reason : presence of carcinogens ( cancer causing compounds) in the medicines. This carcinogen (carcinogens found in metformin : NDMA) is a byproduct of the poor manufacturing practices. And these medicines are manufactured by giants like cadila, Lupin , sun pharmaceutical etc.  \nWhen initially this recall became a news, our news agencies tried to contact the companies and they declined to answer. And then all news channels in India stoped reporting about this health issue.  \n Moreover, these metformin medicines are still being used widely in India.. So, you can clearly see the poor standards of our medicines despite being regulated , then just think about the situation of our unregulated supplement and cosmetic sector and products. Now, the metformin we buy in India have NDMA while the same brand available abroad is free of this carcinogen.  \nMany products sold as natural, ayurvedic, chemical free in India are actually more damaging and chemical laden. Anybody with  a minimum of 1 lakh rupees can start their own cosmetic brands and sell them .   \nI saw several posts on this sub advertising or promoting various brands(most being new brands claiming to be chemical free).  \nMy sincere request to all of you, stay away and don't use them.   \n\nOur country has the capacity to produce the highest quality  products, this is evident from our exported items(oils, medicines, supplements, spice powders, fruits etc). But when the same products are sold in domestic market, we are given second quality items. Because they know we consumers are ill informed and easy to deceive.  \nmethylchloroisothiazolinone(MCI and methylisothiazolinone(MI) are the most commonly used non paraben preservative, and many people are allergic to them. Moreover, due to the nature of these chemicals ,most people will develop sensitivity towards them over time. many of your chronic dermatitis or your increased hair fall might be caused due to your body getting sensitised towards these chemicals. You may not be sensitive initially, but over time (may be 6 months or 1year) you will become allergic to them.   \nAnother chemical that should be avoided is DMDM Hydantoin, which is used in many products used in India. i will (and all of my colleagues) happily use products with parabens and stay the hell out of the non paraben preservatives. one of my friend and colleague who is an expert toxicologist and a certified hypochondriac uses paraben shampoos and wont even touch any thing with MI , MCI & DMDM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni will make a post soon with a detailed list of brands/products that you should avoid or limit and why you should avoid them. As a glimpse to my upcoming post, some commonly promoted brands on this sub that you should avoid and are cheating & harming consumers include : ( some or all products by ): minimalist, man matters, dermaco,mama earth, reequil and the list also include few pharmacy products like anaboom shampoo, mildy shampoo etc.\n\nwe already have cheaper and safer alternatives available, hence we are not losing anything by avoiding these products, instead we are actually making a better future for us consumers by making the brands realise that consumers are not stupid and we also need quality items. if people in south east asia, europe or other developed countries can get quality products ,then why can't we also get the same treatment ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthe last time i made a genuine post about essential oils, i was spammed by some companies. I believe, as consumers we must be aware of what we are using.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nps: if you want me to check any specific brands or products, please mention them below.",

I wrote this months ago; just have a courage to post it now lol.\n\nEverything I wrote is based from my experience, knowledge from fellow redditors on r/AsianBeauty, r/SkincareAddiction, and A LOT of research. Always remember - **YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)** - what worked for others might not work for you and vice-versa. There's no universal treatment in acne or other skin concerns. Skincare is a process of trial and error. Take this post with a grain of salt. \n\nAlso, this is a lengthy post so if you don't have any patience to read this wall of text, shoo! (Ay ang hard haha). Seriously, this post is mostly composed of studies, anecdotes, and other references to support my claims. AYAW NATIN NG FAKE NEWS 'DI BA? \n\nFor clarification, I'm far from that Korean, dewy skin. I have suffered from acne vulgaris for years, but I'm confident that my face improved a lot. But this post wouldn't focus with my acne journey. I want this to be a general skincare guide. There may be some personal thoughts here and there but that would be it. \n\nLastly, I apologize if along the way I may have bent the rules of grammar. I'm just accustomed to explaining things in English. I might repeatedly edit this post if I could bring myself to thoroughly proofread this.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile I know and appreciate that dermatologists know what products or practices are best for us especially our skin, I'm one of those enthusiasts who believe that it is much better if you know your OWN skin. For example, over my skincare journey I found out that my skin can't handle SLS but I can tolerate SLES, products with malunggay/ben oil break me out, etc. And these are findings a dermatologist can't just provide to me.\n\nYou'll probably get fed up with my skincare one liner - YMMV (Your Mileage May vary) - but this is crucial concept to be familiarized with. Everyone's skin is different. In a simple context - we have different sensitivity to cosmetic ingredients. YMMV but the components of our skin are all the same, just varies on how much you have vs how much they have.\n\nLet me provide you with some science. I'll try to explain this simply (as the saying goes, know and befriend your enemy), tho of course jargon can't be avoided. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A LITTLE SCIENCE ON HOW OUR SKIN WORKS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur skin is composed of three layers - dermis, hypodermis, and epidermis. The most important of the three is the **epidermis** - the outer layer of the skin. Epidermis consists of 15-20 layers of cells which is mostly 95% of **keratinocytes**. They create proteins, with *Keratin* being the most major protein. They are made in the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis - *Stratum basale/stratum germinativum*. Keratinoctyes present here undergo division and differentiation, half of it will remain in this basal layer, while the other half will further go upward into the upper layers until they reached the outermost layer of the epidermis - the **stratum corneum (SC)**. Keratinocytes in the SC are now keratinized or cornified, this is why they are also called Corneocytes. These keratinocytes in the SC or **corneocytes** are now dead skin cells, which regularly slough away (also called desquamation) and again replaced by Keratinocytes from the deeper layers. They are tightly bound together, forming the SC barrier (sometimes called epidermal barrier, moisture barrier), which plays an important role for a healthy skin.^[1,2]\n\nThis entire process of keratinization takes up to 4 weeks or approximately 28 days. \n\nOther cells present in the epidermis are:^[1,3]\n\n- Melanocytes - they protect our skin from harmful uv rays through their pigment called *melanin*. This pigment is black in nature, that's why when our skin is excessively exposed to sun, such cells produce more melanin. More melanin = darker spot. Heh! Don't blame melanocytes; blame yourself for not applying sunscreen. :P\n- Langerhans’ Cells - they uptake the antigens in our skin and carry them to the nearest lymph node. Specialized in fighting germs.\n- Merkel Cells - enables us to sense pressure because of their sensory function. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNotice how I focused with the Epidermis 'cause this is where skin diseases usually arise. I hope I haven't lost you yet. Skin actually involves complicated processes; the one I mentioned above is just a simplified version.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGoing back to stratum corneum (SC). SC is the most superficial layer of epidermis. It is also called 'horny layer' because *stratum corneum* is a latin term which literally translates to horny layer. \n\nAnd now the SC barrier. SC barrier is usually described through the *Bricks and Mortar* model. Construction of SC barrier resembles a wall in which layered *corneocytes* stand for *bricks*. Desmosomes keep them intact. Intercellular lipids are the cement which stand for *mortar*.^[2,4]\n\n[Visualization](http://www.ajicjournal.org/cms/attachment/2006299184/2028507809/gr3.jpg)\n \nThese bricks main job is the SC's hydration. This is because of the presence of **natural moisturizing factors** (NMFs). NMFs provide moisture retention because of its humectant property. Humectant bonds with water molecules to increase water content in the skin. Some \ncompounds also have the ability to attract moisture from the environment. NMFs are comprised of amino acids, carboxylic pyrrolidone acid, lactic acid, urea, glucose, and mineral ions.^[5-7]\n\nThe mortar, intercellular lipids, are mostly **ceramides** or sphingolipids (50%), remaining would be 25% of **cholesterol**, and 15% of **free fatty acids**. Together, they strengthen the permeability barrier, warding off external irritants; help in water retention and flux.^[8]\n\n\nAlso notice how important hydration (i.e. water content) in our epidermis, specifically in stratum corneum. \n\nHold on, I'm not trying to sound r/imverysmart here. I assure you such information are significant in skincare. As we delve in further, you'll understand why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo how do you measure skin barrier function? It is through **transepidermal water loss (TEWL)** and water content of the stratum corneum, and **skin surface pH**. TEWL and water content are evidently inversely proportional - increased TEWL lowers water content; decreased TEWL more water content. TEWL is the total amount of water vapor loss through skin when there is no sweat gland activity. TEWL is measured by ServoMed Evaporimeter (VERY EXPENSIVE!).^[9-12]\n\nImpaired barrier function has been known to lead in skin conditions and diseases such as xerosis (dryness), rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and acne vulgaris.^[10,13-15] It has been observed that patients with acne vulgaris have low amount of ceramides due to the diminished water barrier content, measured by TEWL. AV patients have higher sebum production and greater TEWL.^[16]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Oh, okay. Eh 'di ikaw na maraming alam, OP. Bakit hindi mo na lang kami diretsuhin sa acne treatments?!*\n\nAba aba, easyhan mo lang. This is one of my pet peeves. We want to have a healthy skin but we don't really educate ourselves with how our skin works, how  a specific product works - how it really impacts our skin. We just slather a random product on our skin and just hope for the best. Well, that 'best' doesn't come easily. We tend to follow unsolicited advice from people who are blessed with good genes and have a healthy skin to begin with. \n\nAnd if ever there's someone here, reading, who has a clear skin to die for, please stop giving UNSOLICITED advice. You're just bringing more attention to the person that they have problematic skin. Of course they know it, but rubbing it to them that they need to treat it isn't actually helpful at all.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n'Kay, going back. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me state my side why when someone asks advice from me, I don't advise them to see dermatologist ASAP. Emphasis on ASAP. I don't want to sound like I'm discouraging people to visit dermatologist. \n\n*Insert situation where a patient went to dermatologist because of acne vulgaris*\n\nA dermatologist would surely prescribe acne treatments. These can be topical or oral antibiotics;  oral Vitamin A derivative like Accutane; topical Vitamin A derivatives (also known as retinoids) like Tretinoin, Epiduo, Differin (Adapelene); benzoyl peroxide; salycilic acid; azelaic acid; and many more. ~~(YOU SEE, THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS AVAILABLE AND YET WE STILL SUFFER FROM AV)~~. They would also insist you to use their products or prescribe OTC products, having a basic routine to support a treatment they chose for you.\n\nBy then, the patient already have a simple routine of cleanser, (toner), moisturizer, (and sunscreen) + maybe a topical treatment like Epiduo. The dermatologist advised the patient to use all of these consistently. \n\nProblems? MANY. First, there's no guarantee that the basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, etc will work for your skin. Why? You can be sensitive to certain ingredient/s present on them, thus leading to *acne cosmetica* (breakouts from cosmetic products). Second, how the hell will you know if it's the cleanser, the toner, or the moisturizer that's causing the problem if you introduced them all at once? Third, treatments like Epiduo encourage faster skin cells turnover rate which can lead to *purging* (surfacing clogged pores A.K.A. it's gonna get worse before it gets better), how will you know if those added acne are due to purging and not acne cosmetica?\n\n\nFourth, these treatments can compromise our skin barrier. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) can cause irritant dermatitis and can result to TEWL.^[17] Topical retinoids can also cause dermatitis. In fact, there's a term called retinoid dermatitis - erythema (redness), scaling (dryness), and desquamation. ^[18] In short, no matter how powerful these treatments are, they can also worsen your skin concerns.\n\n\nQuoting:\n\n> In addition, certain medications used to treat AV can cause alterations in SC integrity and function, either via the active ingredient, the vehicle, or both, which can result in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation. . Providing specific skin care recommendations, including product selection and proper use, is an important part of the management of AV and may adjunctively augment the efficacy of topical medications in reducing acne lesions.^[19]\n\nYes, the patient's derma is right in providing a skin care products to help a treatment. But he's wrong for suggesting to use them all at once.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that a problematic skin has an impaired barrier function present to different conditions as what stated above.^[10,13-15] So damaging the skin barrier further would just worsen everything. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SO what do you need to do, then? BABY your skin! Moisturize it. Strengthen your SC barrier.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut how? By having a dedicated skincare routine! This is what I like with r/AsianBeauty. ABers focus on strengthening their skin barrier rather than treating any skin conditions right away. Try posting once on their daily help thread. \"Hi! I'm new to skincare and I need suggestions to treat my acne.\" They wouldn't say \"Hello! Acids like chemical exfoliants are effective on treating acne, try...\" Their answers would probably be, \"What's your current routine? I suggest having a basic routine first before proceeding with powerful treatments.\"\n\nBecause it makes sense! Having a dedicated skincare routine without treatment is as powerful as focusing on treatment itself.^[20,21]\n\nFun fact: Even a proper skincare routine has been known to be effective in aiding the skin barrier function of infants.^[22,23] ~~I can now foresee what would be the first product I would buy for my son/daughter - a moisturizer! Haha, kidding.~~ \n\nBelieve me, when I started having a routine of cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen every day, the number of my acne reduced significantly. But of course I reached the plateau where I needed to incorporate treatments on my routine, because having a solid routine + a powerful treatment would lead you far!^[24-26]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA simple skincare routine shall compose of a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, a broad-spectrum sunscreen.\n\nBefore we go further to skincare routine let me just provide additional notes to consider.\n\n**YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)**, duh. I know I mentioned this numerous times and will still do. It is important to instill this concept. You shouldn't be surprised that a certain, popular product didn't work for you. Or a product in which some told you to stay away from, worked for you. That's one of the mysteries of this world, Babe. ~~When they said we are created in God's image and likeness, they meant different gods~~. \n\nWe have different sensitivities to ingredients present in a specific product. \n\n>\"People can even be allergic to commonly used products. It’s not that ingredients in these are unsafe – it’s the way the body reacts to them can differ from person to person.\"\nDr Chris Flower, Director-General of CTPA and a Chartered Biologist & Toxicologist^[27]\n\nWhen a product says *hypoallergenic* doesn't guarantee one won't have reaction to it. After all, *hypo* means *less than* so just lesser chance of allergic reaction. \n\nSame goes with *non-comedogenic* (won't clog your pores). This is just one of those marketing strategies to make you buy that product. Okay, I might have gone overboard. That is still a useful guideline 'cause they could mean that the manufacturers tested their products and consider them good fit for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Don't get so worked up with this when you buy products tho. *\"Okay, this one doesn't say non-comedogenic so I might get acne here*\". No, not that mindset. Remember what I said? YMMV. You won't know until you test it out yourself.\n\n[FDA has a list of common claims and labels used in cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/default.htm). \n\nThese are:\n\n- \"Alcohol Free\"\n- “Cosmeceutical”\n- \"Cruelty Free\"/\"Not Tested on Animals\"\n- Hypoallergenic\n- Organic\n\nAs you can see, non-comedogenic is not recognized by FDA.\n\nOne reason is the comedogenicity of some ingredients were tested on rabbit ears. NOT ON HUMANS. \n\n[Related reading](https://www.prettycat.uk/single-post/2017/09/12/Comedogenicity-testing--The-Rabbit-Ear-Test)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom time to time, I'm gonna use cosdna.com as a reference to products' ingredients. It's a helpful site for identifying if a specific ingredient is highly comedogenic or an irritant. It does sound contradicting to my previous statement but even [CosDNA said that](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/help/ingredients_qna.php)\n\n> Our data source include[sic] international experts, institutions and publications. If any the three column is blank, this meas[sic] there is no data (not indicate[sic] [whether] the ingredient is safe or unsafe). We want to remind our user, the effect of cosmetics depends on concentration, quality, process and mutual influence of ingredients. The skin condition of each person are[sic] different (even constantly changing).\n\nNevertheless, it still a good site to track ingredients of a particular product. If for example two products broke you out or gave you adverse reactions, you can look and compare the ingredients present on these products, and pinpoint what could be the culprit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat being said, **Don't hesitate to stop using a product that is not working for you.** If it's making things worse, that just means it's not meant for you. \n\n*Ahh maybe this product is just drawing these pimples out.* No, that is *skin purging* and purging, only happens when you're using exfoliants (BHA, AHA,etc), acids, and/or vitamin A topical derivatives which increase skin's cells turnover rate like retinoids. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**SKINCARE IS GENDER-NEUTRAL**\n\nThis is intended specifically to men. Taking care of your skin doesn't make you less masculine. Using at least three facial products won't hurt your manliness. Please stop that ongoing machismo. \n\nThose products labeled *for men* are just marketing bullshits. \n\nI'm not saying that there's no skin difference between men and women. In fact, males have been reported to have larger pore size and higher sebum production.^[28] Even the skin's pH (which will be tackled later) of females are lower compared to males.^[29] Males also have greater skin thickness than females.^[30]. Males also experience more intense pigmentation after sun exposure and retain it for a longer time than females.^[31]. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's have an example.\n\n*Nivea for men deep cleansing face wash*\n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e1ce27538.html)\n\n> Aqua, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, **Sodium myreth sulfate**, **Decyl Glucoside**, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Alcohol Denat**, PEG-90 GLYCERYL ISOSTEARATE, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-2, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Parfum\n\nIngredients in bold are surfactants and an alcohol. What I have observed from cleansers that are marketed for men is its supposedly \"deep cleansing\" characteristic. This can be seen from these surfactants. I included alcohol because aside from these sulfates, this is also the culprit why it feel like such products *really cleanses* your face. When in reality, it just leaves your face squeaky clean and DRY. \n\nWhat I also observed is the presence of Benzophenone-4, why the hell would you put a sunscreen ingredient in a facial wash?? \n\nNow, knowing that men's skin has larger pores and tends to be more oily, do these ingredients really help with a male skin? Does science view surfactants as ingredients for men? \n\nDon't get me started with the other one - *Sikreto ng mga Gwapo*. ~~Sikreto pero binunyag, h'wag ako~~. Okay, I'm not saying avoid this product and the like. If it works for you, then okay. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother example:\n\n*Pond's Men Energy Charge All-in-One Moisturizer*\n\nWow what's with these \"men\" products that use \"Energy\" \"Fresh\" \"Sport\", \"Cool\"? To make them more *masculine*? lol\n\n[Ingredients](https://www.ponds.com/ph/men/products/collection/energy-charge/moisturizer.html)\n\n> Water, Dimethicone, Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capri Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Perfume, DMDM Hydantoin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, BHT, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Triethanolamine, Niacinamide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract\n\nAnother thing I observed is that these manufacturers of supposedly \"for men\" products might be inclined to the idea that men prefer putting products that absorb easily, almost feel like nothing has been applied to the skin, have a cooling effect. \n\nThese are evident with *Alcohol Denat* high up in the ingredients list. Alcohol, an astringent, makes the product absorb easily and can be irritating to some. The presence of Menthol, which is another astringent, is just for added fragrance and cooling sensation. And how can these be beneficial to male's skin? \n\nIt's not that this particular moisturizer is not beneficial. Key ingredients such as *Niacinamide* - for skin brightening and sebum regulation, *Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract* - for anti aging and photoaged skin, are also present. The thing is these ingredients are way below the list. Perfume even listed ahead of them, in which sensitive skin peeps should be wary of. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay let me stop criticizing these products. The takeaway is - skincare is not sexist! The *for men* label is just a marketing ploy, tricking you into thinking that their products are specially formulated for men. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### A skincare routine that doesn't compromise our SC barrier\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ON CLEANSERS / FACIAL WASHES**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're going to visit r/AsianBeauty you might stumbled with the pH level of the cleanser they are using. Apparently, pH level is significant in choosing a cleanser to have a healthy skin barrier. \n\n**The pH (Potential of Hydrogen / Power of Hydrogen)** is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.\n\n[For reference](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fChGF6M8a4/Vxcq2iOIf_I/AAAAAAAAEv8/tqT54xF5wMcwSVVaqHBe8YROCx7wP6EVgCLcB/s1600/640px-216_pH_Scale-01.jpg]). The pH scale ranges from 0-14. The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 is an acid and any solution with a pH above 7 is an alkali (or base).\n\nThe skin itself does not really have a pH. When they talk about the pH of the skin, they are referring to the pH of a very thin, naturally secreted, moist layer caused by normal secretions from sweat glands (sudoriferous glands), sebaceous glands (which secrete an oily substance called sebum), and the breakdown of fatty acids on the skin by good bacteria that live on our skin. Together these secretions create the **Acid Mantle**.\n\nYes, remember that I mentioned that skin's pH surface is one of the measures of skin barrier function?^[12] Well, it's gonna be relevant here!\n\nSkin's surface pH is said to be ranging from 4 to 6. Some papers say anywhere from 4 to 7 pH level. Having an average of 4.7, 5.5.^[32,33] The consensus is that our skin's pH is acidic to slightly/mildly acidic. This pH level helps maintain the strength and cohesiveness of the skin.^[34]\n\nWhy is it important to maintain this level of acidity tho? The formation of barrier lipids is observed to be delayed when the pH level is 7.4 or alkaline in nature.^[35] Hope you still remember the SC barrier's mortar.^[8] Lipid formation and metabolism require an acidic pH; alterations contribute to the SC barrier's integrity which may lead to different skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Eczema), irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris, and Candida albicans infection.^[36]\n\nAlso, maintaining the skin's acidity doesn't disrupt the bacterial flora's (good bacteria) colonization, present on our skin. Whereas, reaching an alkaline pH promotes the dispersal of these bacteria.^[37] One example is the growth of  Propionibacterium acnes (P Acnes), a commensal bacterium found naturally on our skin, which is also one of the causes of acne vulgaris. P Acnes grow much better in an acidic environment, reaching alkaline pH can increase the number of P Acnes.^[38] Aside from these, alkaline pH skin can show severe irritation to ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a harsh detergent that we will talk about later).^[39]\n\nIt has also been observed that patients with acne vulgaris tend to have a higher skin pH in comparison to those who a normal skin. Majority of acne occurences are related to high skin pH. Further increase of this pH mirrors a state of SC instability.^[40]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat increases our skin's pH? There are certain factors for that. Endogenous factors include: Skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition, race, age, atopic skin disease. Exogenous factors include: Soaps, detergents, cosmetic products, occlusive dressings, skin irritants, and topical antibiotics.^[41] We'll focus on the latter, with cleansers being the most significant. \n\nThe use of high pH cleansers can disrupt the acid mantle by increasing its acidic pH.^[37,40] A study showed that using an acidic cleanser reduced the number of acne and caused little irritation to acne-prone patients, as oppose to the group who used a soap bar (with a relatively high pH) - number of acne increased.^[42] \n\nIdeally, cleansers should have a pH of around 5.5.^[43] Avoid using soap bars, not only because almost all of them are alkaline (high pH)^[44] , they are also harsh and bring greatest changes to the barrier. Opt for liquid facial cleansers instead.^[45] \n\nEver wondered why some of feminine washes are formulated with acidic pH? (i.e. pH Care). ;)\n\nHow about the recently hyped Aztec Healing Clay Mask? Why is it combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)? Aztec's main ingredient is calcium bentonite clay which has a whooping pH level of 8 to 9.7! ACV has a pH level 3 to 5 - a perfect pH-neutralizer to bring down the bentonite clay's pH to an optimum skin pH level. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**You might want to avoid cleansers with SLS**\n\nProbably the most common surfuctant is *sodium lauryl sulfate* (SLS) also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It is one of the cheap foaming agents commonly found on soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc. It is responsible for the foam or the rich lather you notice when you use such products.^[46]\n\nSurfuctants can penetrate into skin and compromise SC barrier function.^[47] SLS, among other surfuctants, can increase the SC's TEWL and can cause inflammation.^[48,49] Ceramides, one of the skin's lipids^[8], has been observed to decrease when skin is in contact with SLS.^[50] \n\nIt is also listed by [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ebc959348.html), having a comedogenic rating of 5. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo TL;DR just choose a cleanser that is low pH and doesn't contain SLS then? NOT REALLY but IDEALLY yes. What I meant is there's a reason why some have nice skin despite using cleansers with high pH.  It's just that if you can avoid the drawbacks, then why not? But then again YMMV.\n\nBUT if semantics aside, what you really need to consider is to make sure you're using a **GENTLE** cleanser. Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing. Not drying. Not that \"squeaky clean\" feeling as what others coin.  Just because you're oily, you're gonna tolerate that. No. Remember that I mentioned that sebum is one of the components of acid mantle? That squeaky clean feeling is removing this fatty layer which is important part of skin's natural protection, and stripping natural oils instead of excess oils.\n\nAvoid overwashing, too. Cleanse for a maximum of two times only. Some even like to just splash plain water in the morning. I know it's tempting to wash your face, especially for oily skin, but that's just a temporary fix. After a few minutes, you'll notice that oils will start to build up again. You might even get *acne detergicans* from overwashing. If it bothers you that much, I recommend having an oil face blotter instead which only removes excess oils. [Like this one from Clean & Clear](https://www.cleanandclear.com/blotting-papers/clean-clear-oil-absorbing-sheets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm gonna list some IDEAL facial washes you can choose from. If I missed other ones, especially LOCAL cleansers or easily available, please do comment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Human Heart Nature] Facial Washes**\n\n[Months ago, I asked Human Heart Nature through their page the pH levels of their various cleansers](https://imgur.com/a/DPcKZ). They were pretty responsive. Listing them down.\n\n- [Nourishing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/nourishing-facial-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.50 to 5.2\n- [Hydrating Creamy Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/hydrating-creamy-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Balancing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/balancing-facial-wash.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Acne Defense Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/acne-defense-facial-wash-100ml.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 5.0\n\nPersonally,I prefer the Nourishing Facial Wash. It does what a cleanser should do - gentle cleansing. You might ask why not the Acne Defense Facial Wash since I have oily acne-prone skin type? My understanding is cleanser should only cleanse not treat your acne with acne-fighting ingredients. It's because cleanser is not meant to stay on our skin for a few minutes, thus such ingredients would not really contribute to acne. But if it works for some, go! If you want to try these facial washes, each of these has a small variant for a cheap price. Perfect for testing before committing to full sized bottles. \n\nKeep in mind that the surfuctants on these cleansers are not strong and little to no emulsifier present, thus you *might* not notice a rich foam or lather but that doesn't mean it's not doing it's job. Don't use a huge blob just to force a lather. These are also not fragrance-free. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Celeteque Dermoscience] Hydration Facial Wash](https://www.unilab.com.ph/products/celeteque-dermoscience-hydration-facial-wash/)**\n\nQuoting the product's description:\n> It has mild cleansing agents and a special combination of moisturizers that gently yet effectively clean without drying your skin.\n\nAnd according to one redditor who used digital pH meter to test the pH level of different cleansers, this one has a pH of 5.5! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/63jk7a/psa_ph_levels_of_various_cleansers/)\n\nHas SLES - a milder version of SLS. I do like this one tho even my mom and my lil sis. Fragrance-free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Sebamed] Facial Cleansers**\n\nHas two variants: \n\n- [for oily and combination skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=124&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=33d05c27ea2ee6871e84e36fdd0a39e4)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to remove excess sebum and aid the skin achieving lipid balance of oily and combination skin\n\n- [for normal to dry skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=125&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=62e9f9649f6166184bb8da0635908ac3)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to support and maintain the moisture and lipid balance of normal to dry skin\n\nThe cleansers look promising. I haven't tried them out tho.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Belo Essentials] Facial Washes](http://beloessentials.ph/product)**\n\n- *Pore Minimizing Facial Wash*\n\n> For smooth and radiant complexion, start with Belo Essentials Pore Minimizing Face Wash that tightens pores and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, gentle cleanser contains Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revitalizing your skin with a radiant glow. Expertly formulated for oily skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.3.\n\n- *Skin Hydrating Facial Wash*\n\n> Your first step to whiter skin, Belo Essentials Skin Hydrating Face Wash deeply cleanses without over-drying and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, nourishing cleanser is infused with Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revealing clearer and whiter skin. Expertly formulated for normal to dry skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.4.\n\nPersonal thoughts: The \"whitens your skin in just 7 days\" seems bogus. You can't just \"whiten\" your skin for that span. And expecting that from a cleanser? Nah. Anyway, if you're looking for a cleanser that's no-frills, these are not for you. They have tons of ingredients present.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**[[Safeguard] Derma Sense Facial Cleanser Sensitive Variant](http://www.sampleroom.ph/safeguard-derma-sense-gently-cleanses-facial-cleanser-acne-prone-skin)**\n\n> gently cleanses easily irritable skin with its mild, unscented formula. It removes dirt, impurities and excess oil, while maintaining your skin's natural layer. Dermatologically tested, DERMA SENSE brings professional care right to you\n\nAlso pH-balanced. I freaking want to try this one because it's well loved by fellow redditors here, but it's always out of stock! Yes, if a product is labeled for sensitive skin, I always prefer it because of their clean ingredients list (no fragrance, additives,etc), so less chance of breaking me out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Himalaya] Purifying Neem Face Wash](http://www.himalayaherbals.com/products/skincare/Purifying-Neem-Face-Wash.htm)**\n\n> Specially formulated to give you clear, problem free skin, a soap-free, daily use face wash gel that cleanses your skin by removing excess oil and impurities without over-drying. Neem, well-known for its purifying and antibacterial properties, kills problem-causing bacteria. Combined with Turmeric, it helps control acne and pimples leaving your skin soft, clear, refreshed and problem-free.\n\nAccording to some redditors it has a pH level of 5.5.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Cetaphil] Gentle Skin Cleanser](https://www.cetaphil.com/gentle-skin-cleanser)**\n\n> a mild, non-irritating formulation that soothes skin as it cleans. In fact, it's gentle enough for a baby's delicate skin. Designed specifically to work for all skin types, it is a simple, yet highly effective way to care for your skin.\n\nThis one has SLS. But my best friend uses this one and she really likes it! She said it's like putting a lotion on her face. Unfortunately, this broke me out. I can't handle SLS. It is also popular on r/AB and r/SCA. \n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7019242376.html)\n\nIf you can tolerate SLS, this is a perfect cleanser for you. Very short ingredients list. But I've read somewhere this has a pH of around 6.7. Not alkaline so it's kinda good nevertheless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**ON MOISTURIZERS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is probably the most vital part of skincare. Moisturizers can help with our SC barrier function if proper ingredients are used. From TEWL reduction, skin lipids' restoration, and other skin rejuvenation benefits.^[51]\n\nAll skin types need moisturizer. Yes, that is contrary to the popular belief that oily skin doesn't need moisturizer. You just need to find a moisturizer that will suit your needs. I presume you already know what your skin type is. If still not, I suggest reading this **[informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4kufkk/skin_basics_181_skin_types_setting_standards/)** \n\n**Skin types** vary in different measures but the most common would be: Normal (please step out, jk), Oily, Dry, Combination, and Sensitive. ([Paula's Choice recognizes that everyone has sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/what-is-my-skin-type.html)).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are different types/components/classes/properties of moisturizers. These are humectants, emolients, occlusives, and constituents of natural moisturizing factor/essential proteins.^[52,53] \n\n**Humectants**, as mentioned earlier,^[6] attract water from two sources - from the dermis into the epidermis and in humid conditions from the environment. In short, they are responsible for hydration! However, humectants are a double-edged sword. They increase TEWL too by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis where it is easily lost to the environment.^[53] In simplest words, because humectans increased the water content, the skin now have enough water so the rest just evaporates! For this reason, humectants are best combined with occlusives.\n\n**[Some ingredients that act as a humectant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/table/T3/)**:^[54,55]\n\n- *Glycerol/Glycerin*\n\nThis is the most common humectant. In fact, it is the second most frequently used cosmetic ingredient, next to water, documented through the FDA’s Voluntary Cosmetic Reporting Program.^[56] Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration.^[57] \n\n- *Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or hyaluronan/Sodium Hyaluronate*\n\nThey are not actually the same. Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from Hyaluronic Acid but they still function the same.^[58] It is also present on our body and most abundant in our skin, which accounts for 50% of our body’s total HA level.^[59,60] It can hold 1000 times its water weight!^[61] This makes it a superstar ingredient in skin's hydration and even in skin aging.^[62-64]\n\n- *Propylene Glycol(PG) and Butylene Glycol (BG)*\n\nI've been seeing these ingredients mostly from sheet masks, which is pretty logical. PG and BG, not only a humectant, but can also act as an enhancer. They help active ingredients penetrate the skin.^[65,66] So from a few minutes a sheet mask stayed from your face, the ingredients present penetrated better on your skin; thus faster result (i.e. brightening). There are also studies concerning that PG is skin-sentisizing (can cause adverse reactions from repeated exposure).^[67-69] But the consensus seemed to be PG is safe to use in cosmetics.^[65] If anything, PG should be used in low concentrations^[69] just like other humectants.^[55]\n\n- *Panthenol (Vitamin B5)*\n\nPanthenol, in long-term use, significantly improved the moisture level and decreased TEWL of the skin.^[70,71] It is incredibly useful in wound healing, too.^[72]\n\n- *Urea*\n\n*Insert biased praises in this ingredient.* I just recently discovered this ingredient and I'm already in love. Urea? EWW. Don't worry it's a different urea when used in cosmetics. We are talking about hydroxyethyl urea. As you've read earlier, Urea is one of the natural moisturizing factors present in our skin.^[7]\n\nApparently, Urea is a well-known ingredient in treating xerosis (dry skin).^[73-75] As it turns out, it can also be beneficial to other skin types! Who said only dry skin needs that hydration?\nUrea, like other humectants, can increase the hydration and water-binding capacity of the horny layer.^[76,77] It reduces TEWL and the irritant reactions when skin is exposed to SLS.^[78,79] \n\nThis sexy ingredient has also been observed to have a keratolytic property!^[80,81] **Keratolytic** means the agent that assists keratolysis - \"the softening and shedding of the horny outer layer of the skin\".^[82] In other words, it helps with the desquamation of keratinocytes in the SC or corneocytes; or in more simpler term: *exfoliation*. Fear not, it gently exfoliates compare to active chemical exfoliants. The fun doesn't stop as Urea can also enhance the penetration of other topical ingredients.^[81,83,84]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Occlusives** sit on the skin, creating a physical barrier, blocking the TEWL in the SC. This is the reason why humectants are paired with occlusives. The former draws water onto the skin, while the latter traps this water. The most popular occlusive ingredient is **petrolatum** or petroleum jelly. At a minimum concentration of 5%, it can reduce TEWL by more than 98%!^^[54] \n\nBut you all know how greasy a petroleum jelly is, right? Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline), was previously labeled as highly comedogenic after testing on rabbit's ear. But this has been busted by a study that tested it on acne-prone patients. They concluded that greasiness doesn't equate with comedogenicity! \"The admonition for acne patients to seek \"oil-free\" skin care products has no scientific merit with regard to comedogenicity.\"^^[85] If a product is making you oily because of its nature, doesn't make it highly comedogenic.  But of course -.  There was also an issue that occlusives futher impair barrier function but it has been proven that occlusives, like petrolatum, even accelerated barrier recovery.^[86] I can attest to that. Petroleum jelly really helped when I overexfoliated my skin.\n\nBecause of aesthetic reasons, lighter occlusives came into picture like **lanolin, mineral oil**, and **silicones** which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.^[54]\n\nJust look at how our fellow redditors are fond of occlusives A.K.A. **S L U G  L I F E**\n\n[I didn't choose the Slug life, the Slug life chose me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/73t814/humor_i_didnt_choose_the_slug_life_the_slug_life/.)\n\n[To all the slugs out there, you win](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7xe07s/personal_to_all_the_slugs_out_there_you_win/)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Emolients** fill the gap between the layered corneocytes, smoothing the skin. This is the sticky feeling you notice on your moisturizer. \n\n\n---\n\n**[References used:](https://docdro.id/0zJ9xzb.)**\n\nEdit: I have to divide this into parts cause of characters restriction.",

    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove.

Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

    "body": "TLDR: Formaldehyde donor preservatives like DMDM hydantoin are perfectly safe as they are used and cosmetics and do not cause hairloss or cancer\n\nI'm sure most of us have heard about this [Tressemé lawsuit](https://www.kgglaw.com/class-action-lawsuits/tresemme-keratin-shampoo-class-action-lawsuit/) by now. They are alleging that Tressemé's keratin shampoo caused hairloss and scalp irritation via a common preservative called DMDM hydantoin.\n\nFormaldehyde donor preservatives [work](https://cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/formaldehyde-infographic) by slowly releasing small amounts formaldehyde overtime in order to prevent microbes like fungi and bacteria from growing. Formaldehyde is a [naturally occuring](https://www.acsh.org/news/2018/09/05/formaldehyde-so-dangerous-youd-be-dead-without-it-13366) chemical and exists in animals (including humans) and plants regularly. Pears for example contain about [60 ppm](https://agricultureandfoodsecurity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40066-018-0166-4) of formaldehyde.\n\nThe [CIR](https://cir-safety.org/cir-findings) has established that DMDM hydantoin is safe as it used in cosmetics for preservation. As an allergen only about 1.6% of the North American population has a sensitivity to it. As whole formaldehyde allergy rates have actually [decreased significantly ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25581671/). Keep in mind that being allergic to a product is not the same as it being unsafe for general use. Companies also hold no liability for consumers using something they are allergic to if it is clearly listed in the ingredients.\n\nThe health dangers of formaldehyde are rooted in inhalation. This is where the danger is greatest and where the [link to cancer](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/formaldehyde.html) is found. Topical use doesn't carry the same risks and the link to cancer isn't even fully vetted for inhalation. This is why keratin treatments pose much more of a risk and have been condemned by safety organizations while formaldehyde preservatives in cosmetics have not. \n\nWe have to keep in mind that correlation does not equal causation. There are many reasons for hairloss and experiencing hairloss while using tressemé in no way proves that it was cauing the hair loss. Even if the hairloss stopped after using it. Humans love [finding patterns](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/patternicity-finding-meaningful-patterns/) that don't exist and this is why anecdotal evidence is so unreliable. Civil lawsuits are based on arguments that appeal to human nature, not scientific evidence. I hate big corporations as much as the next person, but there is a long history of lawsuits against big companies being won despite the scientific evidence not because of it. No matter if Tressemé loses or wins it won't change the scientific consensus.\n\nYour cosmetics are safe. Stop listening to the fear mongerers that just want to sell you products. Psuedoscience is rampant in modern culture and this is just another example of it. Never trust anyone who says that chemicals are either toxic or nontoxic. The dose makes the posion. \n\nAll sources are hyperlinked. Please check them out if you want to learn more about this subject",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "Here is the routine that my skin has come to make peace with since the last 8 months after years of perfunctory experiments it endured. I have also incorporated the  **Be Minimalist's AA & TXA serums since 20/02/2021**  into my routine,so they are being reviewed here while the CTM+sunscreen products have gained my trust enough to be holy grail(s)! \n[You can fill yourself in regarding my skin type and concerns by reading this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/lmjcxq/look_what_arrived_in_the_mail_today_upcoming_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and consider the routine to be nothing greater than anecdotal evidence :)\n\nPS: The length of the post might make it look like I accidently published a scientific paper on the Internet but I have compensated for that by using the '🐳' emoji as pointers because nothing emotes joy like a whale mindlessly sprouting water into the ocean :P\n\n🔹 **MORNING ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n🐳 Cleanser:  **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel**\n\n   \n   🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum: **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%**\n   \n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night             Repair**\n\n\n   🐳Moisturizer:  **Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**\n   \n\n    🐳Sunscreen :  **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++**\n\n\n\n🔹 **NIGHT ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n    \n   🐳Cleanser :  **Cera Ve Salicylic Acid Cleanser**\n\n   \n  🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair**\n\n    \n    🐳Moisturizer:  **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion**\n\n    \n    🐳Replaying that moment when I called my class teacher 'mummy' in the 7th grade before wrapping up the day is a cult ritual.\n\n\n\n\n🔵 **CLEANSER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water (Aqua), Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Cocoglucoside, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Ceteareth-60 Myristyl Glycol, Glycol Palmitate, Glycerin, Peg-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Propylele Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract.\n\n🐳 **Application** : Just like how *normal* people apply a face wash. Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

It was a recommendation from a Thai friend, apparently it’s super popular in SE Asia. It’s manufactured by the same parent company and has a similar ingredient list with Bifida Lystate as the 2nd ingredient. \nThe only con for me is that it has alcohol in it.

But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

I hope it makes a significant difference and isn't just a reason for the company to charge more.",

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

Hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed wheat protein (5th and 6th ingredient)\n\n##I’ve included this product list more for myself because it is very hard to find products with varying protein types and sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

I picked it up and wondered if it was as good for a primer, as it's neighbor, Nivea Post Shave Balm, has been known to be.  I compared the two products' ingredient lists, and noticed some big differences.\n\n> **Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm**: Water, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tapioca Starch, Triceteareth-4 Phosphate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol , Piroctone Olamine, Fragrance.\n\n> **Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating+**: Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 MA Crosspolymer, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, DMDM Hydantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Stearic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Panthenol, Sodium Lactate, Triethanolamine, Sodium PCA, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 1\n\nThe first thing that jumped out at me was the inclusion of silicone compounds in the Dove shave balm.  It contains cyclopentasiloxane and dimethicone.  Silicones are absent from the Nivea balm.  This is a pro or a con, depending on your skin type and the base of your foundation.  \n\nThe second thing I noticed that I liked was the inclusion of ceramides in the Dove balm.  However, they're mostly on the tail end of the list, so it's hard to say how much is actually in the products, and if it is present enough to do any good.  Certainly can't hurt.\n\nThe Nivea balm has the benefit of having tapioca starch in it's formulation, which can be good for oil, and it has Witch Hazel extract.  Both balms have pretty good ingredients.  Neither contains drying alcohol.\n\nSo I purchased it.  When I got home, I washed my face, moisturized as normal, then put the Dove balm on the left side of my face and the Nivea balm on the right side.  I eschewed all other primers.  I dabbed a little Maybelline FitMe concealer under my eyes, and used a RT sponge to apply some L'Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte.  The foundation went on very smoothly and did not cake up or pill.  I set it with NYC loose powder.  I added some blush and bronzer for some depth, then I went about my day.\n\nSix hours later, I surveyed the first round of results.  Aside from my foundation being rubbed off of the tip and bottom of my nose (got the flu), both sides looked okay.  I did noticed, however, that the foundation on the right side of my face was more textured.  I could see my pores way clearer than the other side of my face.  Both sides were moderately oily.  The left side of my face was holding up somewhat better than the right side.  I noticed fewer flakes around the dry spots of my face on the left side.  At eight hours, all of these observations were more pronounced.  I noticed more oil on the right side, enough that my pores were \"shining\" with oil.  It was odd.  Neither side looked bad, however.  But for me, the left side (Dove) was winning out in the overall appearance category.  \n\nSo, for my initial testing, Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating did better than Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm, as a foundation primer.  Both have pretty good ingredients, both are alcohol free, and each can serve certain skin types better than the other.  Cheers! ",

I've been putting it on my face and I don't know if its doing anything but it helps cooling it.  I came across this video and the naturopathic doctor (who is an MD) says not to use products with DMDM Hydantoin because its a formaldehyde releaser.  Towards the end of the segment, she recommends using aloe instead of coal tar.  Well guess what, her example of aloe to use is the CVS one I have which, you guessed it, contains DMDM Hydantoin.  Oy.\n\n",

I checked the hair care aisle at my local Target, and I still stand by my statement that it’s not difficult to avoid. I don’t intend on misleading people, but I understand how my post was exaggerated (ps I don’t work in hair care, and even if I did there’s no need to call me disgusting). Like sulfates, some shampoos have it, and you can also find shampoos that don’t have it. Please check the ingredients list before you put something in your cart and I’m sure you’ll be able to find a variety of alternatives.\n\nIMO it’s an uncommon ingredient in hair care products, perhaps due to the green/clean beauty trend. I’m allergic to DMDM hydantoin (as well as some other formaldehyde releasers) and I rarely see it in ingredient lists. Out of all the shampoos in the drugstore, you would maybe find 2 that have DMDM hydantoin.",

You can also add products by taking a few pictures and they will research them and get them added. You can search and follow links to Amazon or the product's website to shop.

    "body": "hello, 3a long-haired curly here. thought i'd put my routine here bc the curls have been popping recently. this is low-key a part two to this previous post i'd made a few months back: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/o88d8d/my\\_experience\\_with\\_indian\\_curly\\_hair\\_products/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/o88d8d/my_experience_with_indian_curly_hair_products/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n\\[since someone on the sub asked: out of all this, for a beginner the tldr is p much four-five steps - regular shampoo followed by a good conditioner like re'equil. detangle w a wet brush in shower, avoid dry brushing. arata cream, simple brush styling, re-wetting, scrunching. followed by arata gel and scrunching. wait till dry to sotc. that's all. to make it last for the rest of the week: put hair in a pineapple at night w a loose scrunchie preferably satin/silk. simple diy mask on weekends/whenev u have the time.\\]\n\nin detail as follows:\n\ni wash my hair once a week, on weekends bc i literally don't have the time all week and bc it's been lasting really well w this routine. i double cleanse my scalp and use a scalp massager since i deal w dandruff - a mild shampoo (currently the curl up one but i can't wait to change, dmdm hydantoin isn't for me) followed by a ketoconazole one. i do avoid sulphates and all of that bc i think that leads to hair fall for me. i think for most curlies a regular shampoo, ideally without sulphates and not too drying, would be sufficient. i would not recommend using conditioner to wash your hair the way cgm recommends. i live in a hot humid place so it's simply out of question.\n\nafter shampooing, a good conditioner has been the absolute game changer for both my frizziness and hairfall - i've used a handful of different options and the one that i found off this sub has been as close to an hg for me as it really can get: re'equil's murumuru conditioner. given that i wash my hair once a week, it absolutely melts any tangles. i detangle w my fingers and follow it up w it a wet brush bc i don't dry brush my hair, it ruins my curls and gives me mad frizz. i ensure there are absolutely no knots/tangles and my hair gets super juicy fat clumps. i squish to condish if i remember. wash off w cold water, and ik my hair's well-conditioned if it feels like seaweed. that's all for inside the shower.\n\nonce i'm out i use a little bit of arata's cream on dripping wet hair avoiding my roots. i use the same wet brush from earlier to quickly brush style; it defines my curls and creates pretty thicc ringlets. if i have time, i finger roll a couple of the face-framing ones. i re-wet the hair well and scrunch it all in, turning my head from side to side so the roots aren't flat.\n\nfinally i scrunch and glaze some of arata's gel onto my head, plop it with an old cotton t-shirt and do my makeup/skincare/get ready. remove it after i'm done and diffuse on cool air if i have to go out or just leave it to air-dry if i can't be bothered. i scrunch out the crunch once it's fully dry. i shake the curls out for volume too and pull a couple apart carefully for extra definition/volume.\n\nthe process might seem a little long but given that i literally have to this once a week for it to look good all week is fine w me hehe. i don't even have to really refresh my hair all week either - like maybe on the 5th day, i'll take a lil water and finger roll a couple of face-framing curls at max and that's it. the arata products are my absolute hgs esp the gel bc it keeps shit put.\n\nonce a week/if i have the time, i'll put a diy hair mask - like an egg, curd, honey or just a curd one. occasionally, i'll wash my hair and use no styling products to just let my hair breathe and see where it's at naturally without too much assistance. this helps me gauge what problem areas i have and whether my hair needs protein/moisture too or if it needs a trim. also great for just literally not bothering about the hair for a lil bit lol, curly hair can be a pain. nothing wrong with frizz either, india's literally tropical and the city i live in has like 90% humidity aha.\n\ni avoid super manipulative hairstyles and i do use satin scrunchies so that my hair lasts all week (and sometimes more). i do use bandanas and regular rubber bands and clips if i feel like it tho, i just don't tie it up all wack or in a manipulative bun. i also keep my hair in a pineapple at night without fail and use a satin pillowcase. i referred to a handful of instagram accounts and youtube channels which helped me figure what works best for my hair! i've been wearing my curly hair and taking care since jan this year and i've cut it myself a couple of times as well which has helped too!\n\nedit: imgur link for some pictures and a video as requested! this is my hair normally (including some not-wash-day pictures)  [https://imgur.com/a/dVvKaJy](https://imgur.com/a/dVvKaJy) \\- the video is the most recent.\n\nedit \\[2\\]: this is my hair after testing not washing it for two weeks to see how long the routine can actually make the curls last: [https://imgur.com/a/1RC2uVo](https://imgur.com/a/1RC2uVo) (not recommended, hair was oily and yucky lol).",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

The \"[Safe Cosmetics and Personal Care Products Act of 2018](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6903/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+6903%22%5D%7D&r=1)\" (HR 6903) would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. It comprises ingredient safety, registration fees, resources for small businesses, labeling regulation and more.\n\nIf passed, the act would initially prohibit use of the following:\n\n* Oxybenzone, Octinoxate, and Octocrylene (sunscreen filters)\n* Butylated Hydroxyanisole (BHA) and Butylated Hydroxyoluen (BHT) (antioxidant and preservative boosters)\n* Coal tar dyes (p-Phenylenediamine) (color additive and medicine, found in shampoos for scalp treatments and hair dyes for dark colors)\n* Cocamide Diethanolamine (surfactant/emulsifying agent)\n* Dibutyl Phthalate (Phthalates DBP), Bis(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate (DEHP) (fragrances)\n* Toluene (fragrance)\n* Styrene, Styrene Acrylates (polymers, film formers)\n* Formaldehydes (methylene glycol/methandeiol/formaldehyde) and Formaldehyde-releasing preservatives (DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea, imidazolidinyl urea, methenamine, quaternium-15, and sodium hydroxymethylglycinate) (AKA our favorite preservative, Germall Plus)\n* Tricolsan (antibacterial/antifungal agent, found in antibacterial soaps and hand sanitizes)\n* Lead acetate and other lead compounds (color additive in hair dye products)\n* Parabens (iso­pro­p­yl­paraben, iso­bu­t­yl­pa­ra­ben, phenylpa­raben, ben­zyl­­pa­ra­ben, pentylpa­raben, propylparaben and butylpar­aben) (AKA the most effective preservatives)\n\nListed ingredients have the potential to be removed if they are later deemed \"safe\", under the act's definitions. Manufacturers would have one year to reformulate their products to eliminate aforementioned banned ingredients.\n\nAn additional list would be created of at least 300 ingredients to be assessed, to which 100 further ingredients would be added annually until all ingredients that are used in the formulation or manufacture of cosmetics have been added for review.\n\n>“Most Americans would be shocked to realize that cosmetics are one of the least regulated consumer products on the market. Yet the average American uses about ten of them every day. That translates to being exposed to about 126 unique chemicals from your personal care products. This includes countless products families use on their babies and children.  \n>  \n>That’s why today I’m introducing the Safe Cosmetics and Personal Care Products Act of 2018. This bill not only calls for full disclosure of the many chemicals in our products but would ban toxic ingredients, including carcinogens, in them. This bill takes a step that should have already been taken – consumers, families, and workers have been at risk for far too long. We need to ban toxic beauty and personal care products and give the Food and Drug Administration the resources it needs to keep Americans safe, including recall ability.” said Schakowsky in a [statement](https://schakowsky.house.gov/press-releases/schakowsky-introduces-bill-banning-toxic-ingredients-from-personal-care-products/).\n\n&#x200B;",

I'd be wrecked within minutes haha \n\nFor anyone reading worried about the ubiquity of chemicals, it's important to remember you might have more specific intolerances along with systemic mcas. For instance, I can have Fd&c blue all day but if I even have the capsule of my Adderall with a sulphur-containing blue, I'm screwed.\n\nFragrances are bad across the board for me too, though.\n\nSalicylate sensitivity changes are annoying. I went up to 2mg keto and can't tolerate more than 500 mg quercetin now, or any salicylates really that aren't it. Hoping I regain so I can take a gram of it and camu camu again. Worsened pots, lpr, etc., fragrance sensitivity is even worse, yet my condition is better now overall.\n\nWe need better genetic and enzymatic testing for patients... my doctor is cool to leave my autism at an adhd med Rx and won't discuss the complexity of any of it. I figured out my sulphation was fucked through my own research and am getting better rapidly.",

    "body": "So a few months ago-- in the middle of the OMG ST IVES IS CANCELLING THEIR EXFOLIATING PADS Panic of 2015-- I [posted a quick message](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/2vzpmf/aftermath_of_the_st_ives_exfoliating_pads/) to learn a little bit more about these magical pads that I unfortunately never got the chance to try, and also feel out the community to see if there was any interest in being so kind as to collaborate with us to bring a similar or potentially better exfoliating pad to market.\n\n\nAs mentioned in that previous post, I'm Founder of a company called [Raw Athletics](http://www.rawathletics.com).  Basically, we develop and sell cleaning supplies specifically for people who lead healthy and active lifestyles, but I'll save you the sales pitch.  We currently don't have any personal care products, although its always been the plan to expand into that market eventually, way in the future.  But when I personally saw the outcry from this sub when those St Ives pads were discontinued, we saw an opportunity to bring to market another product that people truly ~~want~~ need so they can lead happier, healthier lives.\n\n\nAfter that initial post, a lot of you reached out to me directly to learn more and express your interest in receiving samples and providing feedback.  So we got all our resources lined up for the next steps, but before engaging the community, we respectfully asked permission from the old moderators of this sub to move forward to get their blessing to gather feedback from the sub, ask questions, collaborate, and work together with YOU guys to make sure we are bringing back this product the same or better than it was, specifically for what you want.  They came back to us essentially saying that they do not give us permission to do that, however we could PAY them directly as \"consultants\".  In hindsight, I knew what they were doing was wrong, but because this was supposed to be a fun side project, we decided to just drop it there.  I still kick myself for not blowing the whistle on them that very second, and for that I truly apologize.\n\n\nANYWAYS, next thing you know, the mods all got booted in one fell swoop, and a new era was born.  \n\n\nSo we decided to try and move forward once again.  \n\n\nSpecifically, our next steps are to continue to gather feedback on what people DID and DIDNT like about St Ives Exfoliating Pads, as well as find a handful of people to test some samples our lab will develop as we move through the product.  We'd like a wide array of testers-- people who both HAVE and HAVE NOT tried the St Ives Pads, as well as people with dry skin, oily skin, acne-prone skin, male, female, etc etc.\n\n\nTo keep the conversation going, here's the info we've gathered so far. Feel free to chime in with more thoughts--\n\n* 6-10% Lactic Acid (and disclosed on label)\n* pH between 3-4, closer to 4 (and disclosed on label)\n* Fragrance free\n* Smooth pad, not too much physical exfoliation, and not too flimsy\n* No animal testing at all (we'd never do that anyway, but duly noted)\n* Non-comedogenic\n* Price point ~$5 (this might be tough)\n* Readily available (we already have relationships with tons of online and grocery retailers)\n* Potentially aloe-free and alcohol-free\n* Include hyaluronic acid? green tea? witch hazel? caffeine?\n* Avoiding irritating preservatives like DMDM HYDANTOIN\n\n\nSo if there's still interest from the community in bringing this beloved product back to market in a new-and-improved format, here's where we go from here--\n\n* We'd love to hear more about what you do and don't want in this product.  We will keep adding comments to that list.\n* We'd love to start building a list of people whom are willing to try out samples as we develop them.  If you are interested, please message me or say so below.\n\nThanks everyone!\n\n**EDIT: Whoa, this blew up.  Working through all the notes, comments and suggestions now.  Need to figure out a better way to organize volunteer samplers to gather more information on the group as a whole so we know all ages, sexes and skin types are properly accounted for. Will keep you updated**\n\n**EDIT 2:  Thank you to everyone who's volunteered to provide consumer feedback and to potentially test samples.  Because the response was so great, we need to organize all interest through this form-- [http://www.rawathletics.com/exfoliating-pads-interest-form/](http://www.rawathletics.com/exfoliating-pads-interest-form/), so please go fill it out if you're still interested!**",

    "body": "a bit of a long post! i wanted to share my experience with indian curly hair products (aka those made by desi brands + those just generally available in india). i've used these over the past year and a bit on my journey of transitioning my hair (barely touched the straightener but brushed and ripped the crap out of it on a daily basis and didn't use any kind of products bc i always thought i just had frizzy straight hair that needed to be brushed into place ahah).\n\n***my hair:***\n\n3a curls with some 2c and 3b bits as well. link to images at the bottom of the post. medium density, medium thickness, high porosity. it's currently mid to long length. i gave myself a chop and some layers using the unicorn method a couple weeks back - it was pretty long prior to this, used to touch my waist when wet/blow-dried straight. i'd say shrinkage of a few inches for sure. started haphazardly attempting to take care of it from august 2020 but started having a proper informed routine from jan 2021. i wash my hair every 4 or more days. i currently live in a very humid area.\n\n***current routine + experience:***\n\n\\- *shampoo*: i use **ketodila (ketoconazole shampoo)** on most wash days bc dandruff. amazing shampoo. occasionally use **curl up's curl moisturizing shampoo** \\- it's really mild but does a pretty good job - and **ogx's coconut water shampoo** for clarifying - also does a pretty good job imo. none of these leave my hair feeling too dry or stripped although it definitely feels clean after use. i haven't had much issue with any of them personally.\n\n*- conditioner:* currently using **curl up's curl hydrating conditioner**. it's got really good slip and is moisturizing but i've been getting a ridiculous amount of hair fall from it. i want to move to a different conditioner since i just discovered it has dmdm hydantoin as well but i'm yet to find one with decent slip - my hair is long so it needs to be very well detangled. i'm very open to suggestions. i've been using the wet brush to detangle in the shower for a few weeks now.\n\n*- styling:* i like to alternate between curl up's styling products and arata's and i've been plopping my hair recently as well. on the days i use arata's products, i first go in with **arata's hair cream** \\- it's thick and you only need a small amount for it to do its thing so it's lasting and light on the pocket in the long run. it's moisturizing but lacks slip so i would recommend putting it on very wet hair if you want to style with a brush like i do - i style with the wet brush bc i'm unable to get my hands on the denman. i then scrunch in **arata's hair gel** \\- it's got nice slip and light to medium hold. some days idk but it gives some flash drying. usually gives a pretty good cast and i sotc once it's dry. this combination gives great definition on most days and lasts for a bit although i do wish the gel had a little more hold. my hair doesn't get ridiculously tangled by day four either, and generally looks and feels healthy. i have heard a lot of people advising against arata's products tho? idk why but i'd love to know; it's been working pretty well for me as of now and i can't seem to find better alternatives.other days i go in with just **curl up's curl defining cream**. i find that it did an absolutely incredible job when i first started using it (jan - do refer to the pictures) but nowadays (june) i find it makes my curls frizzy and undefined, i experience flash drying while applying the cream, and it just isn't doing it for me anymore for some reason. the clumps seem stringy and loose especially when compared to the more voluminous ringlets i get with arata's products and if i use a larger amount my hair just seems oily. it's got pretty decent hold but doesn't give a cast. previously, i could go for days after using it  although not anymore; my hair gets very tangled and full of fairy knots by day four. i would like to mention it contains dmdm hydantoin as well. it does not layer well with my arata products so i don't apply arata's gel after using it.\n\n\\- *deep-conditioning/pre-poo:* once a week or every two weeks i do a diy egg & curd or yogurt mask as well. leaves my hair shiny, soft and with well-defined curls, especially if i use arata products after this process.\n\n***products i used prior to this + experience:***\n\n\\- so i sort of realized i had curly hair (as in spirals and ringlets and not straight frizzy hair) after using **ogx's quenching + coconut curls shampoo and conditioner** that my brother ordered for himself. it gave me somewhat defined curls for the first time in my life and made me realize that there were products specific for curly haired ppl. both the shampoo and conditioner worked incredibly well for me but for some reason, i literally haven't been able to find it on amazon or any h&g store in india apart from that one time. moreover, after educating myself a little more on ingredients and such, i do think their ingredient list is a little questionable so ig it was for the best.\n\n\\- i've used **best life's argan nourish conditioner** since i saw desicurly (deepika joshi) recommend it and it's on her amazon store. i would seriously advise against using it. like please do not. it had terrible slip and my hair would literally fall off in clumps when i used this conditioner. it was impossible to detangle hair using it and i thought my hair just wasn't cooperating initially but would get used to it bc it's \"curly-hair/cg friendly\". i finished the entire bottle and had a terrible experience every damn time i used it. spare yourself from it.\n\n\\- i've also used **wow's coconut milk shampoo** and found it pretty trash as well. i usually think that there's not much a shampoo can do to mess up compared to like conditioners and styling products, but this would leave my hair completely stripped, dry, matted and frizzy. would also make it super-prone to massive tangles and gave me hair fall. i've seen a handful of indian curly hair bloggers recommend wow's products but i absolutely hated them.\n\n\\- unfortunately, **wow's coconut & avocado oil conditioner** was terrible as well. it gave me hair fall, had zero slip and i'm honestly convinced that this and **best life's argan nourish conditioner** gave me dandruff. again, seriously advise against it.\n\n***end notes:***\n\ni would like to mention that i never had a concerning amount of hair fall until i used some of these shampoos and conditioners and would love to know others have had such experiences as well. i will definitely say i - and i'm positive others w textured hair bc i see my curly haired boyfriend and wavy-haired best friend - have an unbelievably difficult time finding the right products for curly hair in india and have found a lot of the indian curly products average at best - especially bc of the ingredient lists, the pricing not being worth the quality one bit, and also the hair fall sigh. i'm not heavily recommending any of these (only recommending against using the ones that gave me hell) bc so much about all of them is just questionable. to be fair, given india's teeny market for textured hair, it's difficult to source other curly hair-friendly products here though but if anyone's had some luck with good products, please feel free to share! terrible experiences also welcome xD\n\n**edit:**\n\nsince the image gallery disappeared from some reason, i've added pictures here for reference - [https://imgur.com/a/TYiOKGE](https://imgur.com/a/TYiOKGE) (and they're all from good hair days ngl - there are plenty of days when it looks like a fuzzball, i just never took pictures of those). the order is as follows: the first two pictures are from back in jan, when i just started using curl up products and properly transitioning. the third picture's from june where my hair became stringy and curl up products just weren't doing it for me anymore plus i needed a chop. the fourth's from april where my hair's been blow-dried straight bc i wanted a trim and indian salons hate curly hair so they straightened it but it gives a good idea of the shrinkage. the fifth and sixth are also from june where i chopped off a bit, tried to give myself the layers to combat the stringy curls, and moved to arata's products.\n\n**edit \\[2\\]:**\n\na little update/part two to the routine here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/qg1081/updated\\_curly\\_hair\\_routine\\_thats\\_legit\\_working/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/qg1081/updated_curly_hair_routine_thats_legit_working/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",

What really frustrated me was that I could never seem to get consistent results, sometimes curls would form amazingly and others just not, and when it did turn out good the curls only held for like three days max before they would become stringy. \n\nNow I just do a DIY hair mask before washing my hair, use a good shampoo and conditioner that works for me, a leave in cream and a mask for deep conditioning. And for styling I follow one of those methods for heatless curls. Its made life so much easier. \n\nSerious props to those of you who have the willpower and dedication to stick to the CGM.",

Even after I graduated 10th std and was able to wear what I wanted and ditched the oil at once, it took me a couple of years to truly realize that I had some wave and what works for people with straight hair won't necessarily work for me. When I started out, I used Arata products too! In fact, those were my first stylers! \n\nIf you're looking for products, I'll always throw my weight behind Fix My Curls products. They're one of the very few Indian brands that have large sizes of their products, and all the products I've checked have been free of any stressors. Though their leave in Cream and defining gel can be a bit too protein heavy, so I recommend pairing either one with the protein free stylers. Their Mellow conditioner doesn't have good slip though. \n\nI've been using the Re'equil Babassu Conditioner for a few weeks now, and I love it! It has amazing slip and just melts the tangles in my hair! I'm also noticing a reduction in frizz after using this! My only gripe with it is that it's such a small tube (150ml??? Come on!!! We're gonna get through that tube in a matter of couple of months!!!) \n\nOne thing I'm really glad about is that curly hair is slowly starting to trend in India. Suddenly we're seeing companies come out with products catered towards curly hair and we're seeing more and more posts on forums like these. So while I do lament that we have such a small selection of affordable items, I'm glad they're slowly getting larger and that textured hair is slowly getting visibility here.",

There is a study that says that PVP does not provide adequate protection against heat, unlike VP / VA.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Monohydric alcohols provide faster drying, better hold, less frizz and more manageable hair, but this is NOT helpful. Fast drying is stressful for the cuticles. Here you have to choose: straighten wet hair or dry. Some damage during styling with hot tools is the result of water boiling out of the inside of the fiber, causing blisters to form in the cuticle, which, when combed, lead to more damage.\r  \n\r  \nThe less water in your hair, the easier it is to style. There is also less chance of earning bubble hair.\r  \nBut even here it is not without drawbacks: the tools during styling remove more water than the hair can absorb from the air (the scientific term for this loss of moisture is syneresis). To recover from syneresis, it is necessary to submerge the hair in water to restore its original moisture level. At low humidity levels, hair becomes more brittle, breaks and splits more easily. For this, moisturizers are desirable in the composition of the products, which will make the hair more elastic and slow down the evaporation of moisture from the hair.\r  \n\r  \nThis is one of the reasons why I do not recommend thermal protection with monohydric alcohols, especially on a regular basis, and especially on bleached or severely damaged hair. You should not evaluate such thermal protection in terms of care - this is a purely \"convenient\" styling tool.\r  \n\r  \n\\- moisturizers are added to give hair elasticity, protect against dryness, and also to protect the product from drying out\"",

So basically I've been CG for about 2 months now and I've been finding it really hard to find a good shampoo. This being because every one I look at, there seems to be something that may or may not work in it.\n\nFor example, the Cantu Cleansing Cream, it has Disodium EDTA which is apparently a chelating ingredient and I feel like if I'm using that every wash it'll be drying.\n\nThen there's the discussion on sodium c14-c16 sulfonate. Is it sulfate free? Do I use it or not? Or would it be bad in the long run and drying for my hair? there's so many opinions/information on it I just don't know.\n\nThen there's the whole thing around dmdm Hydantoin. I literally bought 3 conditioners that happened to have this ingredient in them, used one for a week, then this controversy surrounding it happened. Now I feel scared to use the conditioners I bought.\n\nSo far, I've tried out Dr organics Aloe Vera Shampoo, which have given me small white flakes so I switched to the Arula Beauty shampoo which helped but I still get small flakes in my hair. I feel like maybe my scalp isn't getting cleansed properly, but I don't know what shampoo to use. \n\nSo I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm constantly feeling anxious about my hair and all the opinions on ingredients and what's right and wrong it's really taking a toll on me. I just want a simple budget friendly routine that works but it feels like I can't find anything.\n\nSorry again, I just feel like I need to let this out my system. I feel so frustrated.♥️",

A lot/most of the theory isnt even backed up by any studies, so to try to follow it so religiously is silly. Take a breath.\n\nAs for shampooing, if you want a gentle sulfate-free shampoo, the Johnson Baby Shampoo is very affordable and a standard to many people's routines. You can find it at Boots.\n\nIt is still good however to use cleansing shampoo with sulfates every few weeks however, a lot of products that are supposedly cgm like coconut oil, shea butter etc are hard to wash out and can pile up.\n\nAlso you can look into conditioners/products with amodimethicone. The fear-mongering around silicones is not founded, as they have excellent sealing and smoothing properties. Amodimethicone especially is particularly good because it is charged, so it cannot pile up on hair since the layers repel each other. This means you can have it in your routine and still use sulfate-free shampoos very rarely. Lab muffin, a chemist youtuber has a great video on that https://youtu.be/yzM4pCKXZ5Y.",

There are a lot of upset reviews on their website and Amazon specifically regarding the formula change. Also, make sure you read the ENTIRE ingredients list when you buy a product because roughly the first half of these two formulas are the same. When I noticed the different bottle, I expected a formula change, but I only compared about half the ingredients and thought I was buying the same product.  I should have known better but won't be making that mistake again!  \n\n**Older, blue-top formula:** Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Palmitate, Mineral Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Octyldodecanol, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Colloidal Oatmeal, Dimethicone, PEG-40 Stearate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, DMDM Hydantoin, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben  \n\n**Newer, red-top formula:** Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Palmitate, Mineral Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Octyldodecanol, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Colloidal Oatmeal, Dimethicone, Methylpropanediol, PEG-40 Stearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Piroctone Olamine, Carbomer, Benzyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Decylene Glycol  \n\nI bought the new version about a week ago and only just realized why my skin has gotten so upset lately. I have rosacea and relied on this as a HG moisturizer for body AND face for the last couple years. The new formula burns my skin and makes my face flaky and red all day. It essentially makes my rosacea worse. My biggest concern, though, is that it makes some parts of my body red...areas that have never caused me ANY sensitivity issues before. Weird. Some other reviews mentioned that it isn't moisturizing at all because it doesn't sink in and that it has a weird smell, both of which I can attest to as well.  \n\nI just wanted to throw this out there in case anyone else uses this product or was considering it. I still HIGHLY recommend the blue-top version if you happen to find it somewhere, but this new red version was awful for me and apparently many others. Also, read the entire ingredients lists when you're comparing formulas!",

I've been taking all the easy precautions like wetting my hair with clean water before getting in the pool and wearing a swim cap, but now I'm looking to specific products that help with removing buildup from chlorine and other pool chemicals. In my research, the only ingredients I've found that are good for this purpose and commonly found in clarifying shampoos and some conditioners are:\n\n* Sodium Thiosulfate ([neutralizes chlorine](http://curiouschemeng.blogspot.com/2014/01/chlorinated-hair.html))\n* Disodium/Tetrasodium EDTA ([chelating agent](http://curiouschemeng.blogspot.com/2014/01/chlorinated-hair.html))\n\nWhich brings me to my question, which is a little silly and neurotic, but I hope someone can help me. I've really fallen in love with this [L'Oreal Kids 2-in-1 Swim Shampoo](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/products/hair-care/products/shampoo/loreal-kids-extra-gentle-2-in-1-swim-sport-shampoo.aspx?shade=extra-gentle-2-in-1-swim-sport-shampoo). I just love how it smells, I love the bottle, I love how cheap it is, and I love how it reminds me of when I was a kid! Upon looking into the ingredients though, I found neither Sodium Thiosulfate nor EDTAs among them. Here they are listed out:\n\n>AQUA/WATER/EAU • SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE • DISODIUM COCOAMPHODIACETATE • PEG-200 HYDROGENATED GLYCERYL PALMATE • POLYSORBATE 20 • SODIUM CHLORIDE • PEG-7 GLYCERYL COCOATE • HEXYLENE GLYCOL • DISODIUM RICINOLEAMIDO MEA-SULFOSUCCINATE • PARFUM/FRAGRANCE • SODIUM LAURETH-8 SULFATE • POLYQUATERNIUM-10 • SODIUM METHYLPARABEN • MAGNESIUM LAURETH-8 SULFATE • MAGNESIUM LAURETH SULFATE • SODIUM OLETH SULFATE • DMDM HYDANTOIN • MAGNESIUM OLETH SULFATE • CI 47005 / YELLOW 10 • CI 14700 / RED 4\n\nBasically I want to know, am I missing something? How can L'Oreal confidently claim that this shampoo \"removes chlorine\" if there are no ingredients that are specifically capable of that? I like this product a lot and want to continue using it but I also want to make sure I'm getting all the pool chemicals out of my hair after I swim.\n\n^(In before \"just use it if you like it,\" I know my question is kinda silly, I just want to understand how these ingredients work!)",

This change made a huge difference in my health and overall well-being, but also caused me a lot of stress. I have 2c/3a hair that is medium to coarse, naturally frizzy, and dry. I also have seborrheic dermatitis, which gets triggered by many oils, and I have nut and avocado allergy, so I avoid anything with those oils (it might be ok due to oils not having protein, but I'm not going to risk it). \n\nIn the last 4-5 years, I have been able to occasionally use fragranced products again as long as I don't use them every day. I use K18 Mask once every couple of weeks, and I sometimes feel a little itchy with it, but it's tolerable. I handled Olaplex well too.\n\nGood fragrance-free curly hair products are far, and few, and it's better now than it used to be but still not as ideal as I would like. Here's what I am using now:\n\n**The Ordinary Shampoo:** I'm not super picky regarding shampoo. I want something that will clean my hair but not strip it. This does just that. However, it doesn't lather much, but I'm ok with that because lather comes more from lathering agents like betaine rather than sulfates and sulfate alternatives that break up oil and clean the hair. Plus, lathering agents can be irritants. I tried it as a body wash too, and it was fine, cleansing but not stripping.\n\n**The Ordinary Conditioner:** This is a great conditioner. There was so much slip, leaving my hair light and soft. I didn't have to use much either. The directions say to rinse it all out, but I leave a little in. For more conditioning, I  can mix a few drops of oil into it in my palm before applying. I would buy bigger bottles of this.\n\n**Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Fragrance and Protein Free Curl Cream:** I saw a review saying this is a dupe for SEEN Curl Cream, and I don't agree, but I still like it. SEEN is more of a leave-in with a little hold and NYM is more like a gel with some moisture. It gives a good definition and decent hold. It doesn't have cationic conditioning agents, so it doesn't have that clumping reaction with regular gels. I'm currently pairing it with Lulu Lube and Silver Stone Apothecary Gel.\n\n**Lulu Lubricant:** This product has a weird story. A hair YouTuber made a video of her using it to refresh her hair, which came out well. Then a bunch of people started reviewing it, saying it worked for their hair too. Lulu then stated that it's a good CG product as part of its marketing. I tried it because it's simple and cheap, and it's not the first time I've attempted to lube in my hair. It's similar to Curl Keeper or Curl Junkie Curls in a Bottle but doesn't have plastic film formers. It has sodium PCA, is super moisturizing, has a lot of slip, and is a very light hold, and it doesn't react to creams or leave-ins with cationic conditioning agents. I've also noticed more shine in my hair when I use it. It's also the best thing I have found for refreshing curls. \n\n**Silver Stone Apothecary Mystic Styling Gel:** When used alone, it gives good clumps and definition, but it has such a strong hold that it makes my hair feel dry, especially if the weather is dry. It doesn't pair well with cationic conditioners unless my hair is very wet or diluted. I'm currently using a little bit mixed with Lulu lube to get more hold.\n\nThis is what else I have used that's still available:\n\n**SEEN Shampoo and Deeper Conditioner:** I really liked SEEN for a long time, but I have a bad ragweed allergy, and I'm nervous that constant exposure to bisabolol (a chamomile-derived compound) will eventually cause a reaction. If it weren't for that, I think these are great products. The shampoo cleans well while not being harsh, and the Deeper Conditioner moisturizes well, but it could have a better slip. If I add a little squalane to the conditioner, I can make a nice moisturizing deep treatment.\n\n**SEEN Curly Creme:** The closest thing to an HG styling product I have found in the last ten years that I can still use. It's fairly moisturizing and helps my hair form clumps when I brush style. However, it does not have enough hold on its own and I get more frizz than I'm comfortable with when it's used alone, so I have to use it with a gel and it doesn't play well with a lot of traditional hair gels.\n\n**Not Your Mother's Fragrance & Protein Free Gel:** It doesn't play well with cationic conditioning agents and alone makes my hair feel dry. It is probably compatible with the NYM Curl Talk Curl Cream, but I feel like that combo would be too much hold for me in my climate.\n\n**Curlsmith Shine Jelly:** I know this isn't truly fragrance-free, but I don't react. It helps my hair form amazing clumps, has a good hold that lasts, and doesn't react to the SEEN Curly cream. However, my hair started to feel a little dry with it. Still, it was better than a lot of things I've tried. I may go back to it again someday.\n\n**SEEN Leave-in Conditioner:** This is just the Curly cream without hold and more oil. It plays a little better with the Silver Stone gel than the curly cream, but the combo still wasn't moisturizing, so I returned it. \n\n**Curl Keeper Fragrance-Free:** Combined with the SEEN curly cream, it helped with frizz, shine and definition, and my hair looked great. Unfortunately, it contains DMDM Hydantoin, which made my scalp itch. \n\n**Devacurl Fragrance-Free Gel:** I hated how this felt in my hair. It reduced the slip while I was styling (I rake and brush my styling product into fully coat my hair), and then my hair felt dry after styling. It also had a bit of that balling-up reaction with the SEEN cream. I returned it.\n\n**Vanicream Shampoo and Conditioner:** The shampoo is harsh, and the conditioner doesn't condition my hair at all. \n\n**Vanicream Hair Gel:** Good hold, good clumping, and good frizz control, but it makes my hair feel dry\n\n**A Simple Planet Defined Hair Gel:** This was my HG styler for a couple of years, and then the last time I used it, I got this burning reaction from it. To this day, I still have no idea what caused it because I'm not allergic to anything in it from what I can tell (all the ingredients are in other things I use). My only guess was that it went bad and got very acidic when the preservative kicked in. I can't trust it to try again.\n\n**Curelle Hydra Shampoo and Riche Conditioner:** These were my HG products long before I discovered SEEN. The conditioner is very gentle and has a lot of slip. However, they both have oat protein, and I had to clarify a lot to prevent protein overload, but I would use these again. Even with the shipping from Canada, they were cost-effective. Also, the conditioner worked as a leave-in.\n\n**Curelle Hair Gel:** It made my hair look stringy and awful. Its high pH made me nervous about its health.\n\n**Curl Junkie Spiral Lotion:** Very moisturizing and helped with definition, but it broke me out around my ears and jawline. Also couldn't be used without a gel.\n\n** Jessicurl Spirialicious Gel: ** This one was weird. If I used it on soaking wet hair, my hair would get really limp, and my curls would fall out. It was way too much hold if I used it on damp hair. I decided it was too finicky and gave it away.\n\n**KY Liquid:** Lulu wasn't the first time I tried lube in my hair. I was attempting to dupe an old fragranced favorite, Curl Junkie Curls in a Bottle. The KY was ok. It helped with moisture but had no hold so it couldn't be used independently. I may try it again with the SEEN Curly Cream someday.\n\n**Bulk Apocathary Hair Gel:** This hair gel base is meant for crafters and resellers to add their ingredients and fragrance and then repackage. It's very inexpensive. I found it was not moisturizing enough so I added 1 part glycerin to 4 parts gel and got a product similar to Curl Keeper and Curls in a Bottle. However, it didn't play well with my leave-in then, and it would leave my hair feeling dry after a day.\n\n**Flax Seed Gel: I wanted to add this because it's recommended a lot. My hair loved it, but my scalp hated it. It triggered my seborrheic dermatitis. Also, it's a huge hassle to make.",

Plus I garden and allergic to wasps.\n\nI have super curly frizzy dry hair too but it’s fine, thinning, and graying. (Gray’s very fine not stereotypically wiry.) Generally protein has been my friend.\n\nI use Neutrogena T-Sal shampoo but it’s too drying to use every day in summer when I need to get the pollen out of my hair. Looking for an uber gentle shampoo or co-wash that would remove pollen but not weigh my fine hair down. Any leads?\n\nI’ve been using the ff Ouidad Unbreakable Bonds condition and sometimes the shampoo. It isn’t really moisturizing enough but doesn’t weigh my hair down.\nI’ve tried the ff Curl Keeper but doesn’t seem to work as well as it used to - not sure why??\nHave been using the Treluxe ff serum. It was ok over winter/spring but isn’t cutting in humid summer weather.\nHave used Mixed Chicks Kids Leave-In off and on — which doesn’t weigh my hair down and has a bit of hold - tho not eanoygh. Not enough conditioning.\n\nI have yet to find anything ff to gets rid of my frizz but doesn’t weigh down my hair. Oils never work - just give me shiny frizz. Nor anything that effective clumps and holds my hair. I recently tried Color Wow’s Dream Coat for Curly Hair - but it doesn’t last past day 1…\n\nI also can’t find anything to replace my holy grail root product — Nioxin Diamax Advanced. \n\nAny suggestions?\n\n(I used to use Curls Rock activator - almost a 1 and done product for me. Or Curl Keeper/AG Recoil/Batia & Aleeza Hair Gel/Glaze - alternatively Phyto Defrisant Balm instead of Curl Keeper. Or Nick Chavez Plump n Thick Leave-In or HydroHair Styling Mask. But never found anything to put over these for hold.)",

I am a bit scared to use this,not gona lie, because of all the heavy ingredients, but winters tend to get very dry where my hostel is, hence I am going to go out on a limb and try this out. \n\n2. UV doux sunscreen-pretty self explanatory. This is one of the most raved about sunscreens right now. I am trying to hate pan my Lotus gloop (the damn thing refuses to finish wtf dude)\n\n3. Dermafique toner- i have checked out the ingredient list and it seems interesting (Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260). \n\nI am not big on toners, but seeing panthenol so high up on the ingredient list made me so happy. \n\n4. Aveeno dermexa emollient cream- although I have one body butter and a body lotion to finish up, I still want to go for this lotion solely for my hands and feet. My knuckles tend to get very dry(and sometimes bleed) during extreme dry winters and this looks like could help. \n\n5. Baidyanath/dabur almond oil- i always buy a bottle of almond oil before the winter begins. It is an amazing all purpose product. \n\n6. Sebamed foaming face wash- i am currently using cetaphil. I want to try out something else. No specific reason for choosing sebamed out of everything else. I am not fussy about facial cleansers. \n\n7. Fabindia charcoal face mask- I have used this one before and this cleared up my skin like no other. Fabindia's products are incredibly underrated. This is one Indian homegrown brand that I can fully get behind. I have used quite a few of their stuff and none disappointed me. \n\n8. Neutrogena lip balm with SPF15- no specific reason for choosing this one out of all. Just wanted to try out a lip balm with spf. \n\n9. Any one of nykaa's moi perfumes- I simply love perfumes. i have the one in black(can't remember the name). I want to try out more of their perfume line. I will stick to the minis for now. \n\nThat is all that I have in my wishlist for now! Share us yours!",

I used their conditioner as well, and for a while, it made my hair nice and soft.  \n\nThen all of a sudden, my hair started to get extremely dry and tangled all the time. I am talking self dread locking, small animal around the nape of my neck tangled.  I first chalked it up to being winter and my jacket/scarf being the culprit, but as we moved into and through summer, same problem.\n\nI started changing conditioners, trying different ones, but nothing seemed to help.  I tried protien treatments and that seemed to help. Then I realized, it was not the protien treatment that was helping but the aphogee shampoo for damaged hair which had SLS in it. \n\n I have been experimenting with this theory and it appears that whenever I shampoo with the aphogee and my regular conditioner its fine.  If I use the SLS free shampoos I have, tangled, dry mess. I am thinking that the more natural shampoos just dont cut it (literally), I think there is junk left on my hair, which means that the moisture from my conditioner isn't penetrating in there and also that junk likes to stick to junk, causing tangling.\n\nIs there any rhyme to my reason or am I totally off base here?

    "body": "Skin Type: Combination Skin\n\n**➡️Sage Apothecary Activated Charcoal & Tea Tree Face Wash**\n\n**MRP:** Rs. 549/- for 100 ml, but is always on discount on Amazon. Currently for Rs. 269/-. I had bought it as a trial from Smytten\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Cherry Blossom, Charcoal Powder, Tea Tree, Aloe Vera leaf juice.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua\n Decyl Glucoside \nLauryl Sarcosinate\nCarbomer\nPhenoxyethanol\nSugar\nPropane Glycol\nGlycerine\nSodium Cocoamphoacetate\nDMDM Hydantoin\nPolyquat 10\nEDTA\nAloe Vera Leaf Juice\nActivated Charcoal Powder\nTea Tree essential oil\nPeppermint essential oil\nCherry blossom essential oil\n\n**Claims:** Paraben free, cruelty free, formulated with 100% natural ingredients\n\n**Texture:** Black liquid\n\n**Packaging:** Tube/Bottle\n\n**Usage:** For a few weeks\n\n**My Experience:** This was my first attempt at a charcoal based product. The idea that it removes blackheads & whiteheads from a mere face wash drew me in. But sadly, this didn’t do anything. \n\nI know that pores don’t open or close, but this facewash made me think as if they are opening wide. My skin looked weird. This facewash felt harsh, stinged my eyes that eventually I threw it away. \n\nI’ve gotta ask, Is it worth trying a charcoal based products or are they all farce?\n\n\n**➡️Plum Green Tea Pore Cleansing Wash**\n\n**MRP:** Rs. 495/- for 120 ml\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Glycolic Acid, Green Tea Extracts, Natural Cellulose Beads\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua (Water), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Carbomer, Cellulose, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fda Approved Colours, Fragrance, Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate\n\n**Claims:** Free of parabens, SLS & mineral oil, vegan, cruelty free. Suited for oily, acne prone, combination skin\n\n**Texture:** Transparent liquid with green granules type beads\n\n**Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Usage:** A few times\n\n**My Experience:** It was pretty okay. I didn’t enjoy either the fragrance or the texture. It has tiny green granules, granules not beads that usually absorb into your skin on pressing between your fingers. Due to it, it has felt like a mild scrub than a facewash and I’m not comfortable using a scrub like product on my face daily.\n\nIt also felt mildly harsh on my skin, which is why after a few uses, I was easily turned off. \n\nI still have the product left, that I’m now using to clean makeup brushes. It might work on other skins, but not for me. \n\n**➡️Re’equil Fruit AHA Face Wash**\n\n**MRP:** Rs. 490/- for 200 ml\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Fruit AHAs\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Decyl Glucoside, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Aqua, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/​Leaf Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Betaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate, Buteth-3, Tributyl Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Ci 19140, Ci 45100\n\n**Claims:** Free of parabens, sulphates, silicones & mineral oil.\n \n**Texture:** Yellow coloured fluid. (almost looks like Pee)\n\n**Fragrance:** No fragrance\n\n**Packaging:** Bottle\n\n**Usage:** A few times\n\n**My Experience:** This is the harshest facewash I’ve ever used in my life. The texture is so watery but generates foam easily after coming in contact with water. However, after every wash, my skin felt very tight, which  is why after a few washes, I stopped using it.\n\nSeeing as I still had some product left, I decided to use it instead of shower gel. Damn, My skin felt so smooth after first wash that since then, I’ve been using them as Shower gels for Bath. \n\nI wouldn’t recommend this facewash to anyone seeing how harsh it was compared to other facewash. So think before you buy.\n\n_________________\n\nThanks for reading 💕",

    "body": "**Stridex Maximum Pads**\n\nYes, you read that correctly…I am here before you today to review Stridex Pads LOL! Hear me out…\n\nI was browsing Amazon a few months ago looking at their top selling/most popular skincare products and Stridex popped up pretty high on the list.\n\nInitially, I passed over them with a nice long eye roll…but decided to click through and actually read the ingredients list.\n\nMy use of Stridex Pads stopped sometime in high school in favor of Proactiv and I hadn’t really thought about then since then.\n\nSurprisingly, the ingredients list didn’t look as scary as I had imagined.\n\n2% Salicylic Acid plus some preservatives, fragrance, and texturizes. All in all..not that bad.\n\nSo, I took the plunge and decided to give this retro product (at least for me) another go. My results have been kind of shocking to be honest.\n\nThe pads are soaked in a lightweight fluid that applies to skin nicely and soaks in rather quickly.\n\nAlthough I am not a fan of the slight “foaming” that happens upon application or the menthol based/“medicinal” scent…both dissipate rather quickly and aren’t a huge issue (for me).\n\nOnce applied, I tend to let the fluid sit for a couple of minutes before moving on to my toner, essence, so on and so on.\n\nOver the past month my skin has really seemed to appreciate these pads. Blemishes seem to be minimized both in size and frequency and clogged pores are less apparent as well.\n\nThe Stridex Maximum Pads have been a great accompaniment to my Curology prescription since that contains Azaleic Acid (aka AHA). Having a separate BHA-only product rounds out my chemical exfoliation step and I’ve had no issue using the duo on a daily basis.\n\nDon’t get me wrong…I would love to use an AHA/BHA toner to skip the extra step. But, I worry that adding another AHA like Glycolic Acid may be too much for my skin at this time (or at least one with a high concentration of AHA).\n\nI’m not a fan of the one time use cotton pads due to the additional waste...so I’ll most likely be passing on a repurchase of this product in favor of a BHA only toner I can use with reusable cotton pads (given I can find one LOL).\n\nBut for those looking for a super affordable, easy to obtain, and relatively straightforward BHA fluid…I don’t see any reason why I wouldn’t point to the Stridex Maximum Pads as a potential option.\n\nNever thought I’d be saying that LOL!\n\nFull Ingrediens List:   \n \n\nActive Ingredients: Salicylic Acid (2%) ((w/w))\n\nInactive Ingredients: Amino Methyl Propanol, Ammonium Xylene Sulfonate, Citric Acid, DMDM Hydantoin, Fragrance, Menthol, PPG 5 Ceteth 20, Water (Purified), Simethicone, Sodium Borate, Tetrasodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Amazon - $7.00 USD): [https://www.amazon.com/Stridex-Strength-Medicated-Maximum-Count/dp/B000O1KP1O/ref=sr\\_1\\_2?crid=LX1DRG258I7V&dchild=1&keywords=stridex+acne+pads&qid=1594676853&sprefix=strides+%2Caps%2C178&sr=8-2](https://www.amazon.com/Stridex-Strength-Medicated-Maximum-Count/dp/B000O1KP1O/ref=sr_1_2?crid=LX1DRG258I7V&dchild=1&keywords=stridex+acne+pads&qid=1594676853&sprefix=strides+%2Caps%2C178&sr=8-2) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7gr65u4jcua51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3259a05ca51f71ff4c1794812515b6f12ace02f",

    "body": "**What is DMDM Hydantoin?**\n\nDMDM hydantoin is an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative with the trade name Glydant. DMDM hydantoin is an organic compound belonging to a class of compounds known as hydantoins. It is used in the cosmetics industry and found in products like shampoos, hair conditioners, hair gels, Rite Aid Liquid Lubricant, and skin care products.\n\nDMDM hydantoin slowly releases formaldehyde and works as a preservative by making the environment less favorable to the microorganisms.\n\nIDENTIFICATION: \n\n1,3-Dimethyol-5,5-dimethyl hydantoin (DMDM hydantoin) is an odorless powder or solid. It is slightly volatile and very soluble in water. It is a member of a group of chemicals called hydroxymethyl dimethyl hydantoins, which are formaldehyde releasers. The hydroxymethyl dimethyl hydantoin group also includes hydroxymethyl-5,5-dimethyl hydantoin (MDM hydantoin). \n\nOther names for DMDM Hydantoin: \n\nGlydant® \n\nGlydant Plus® (95:5 mixture of DMDM and iodo propynyl) \n\nDimethyloldimethyl hydantoin \n\n1,3 dimethylol-5,5-dimethyl hydantoin \n\nDantoin DMDMH \n\nDMDMH \n\nMackstat DM \n\nNipaguard DMDMH \n\n1,3-Bis(hydroxymethyl)-5,5-dimethyl-4-imidazolidine-2,4-dione(+) \n\n2,4-imidazolidinedione, 1,3-bis(hydroxymethyl)-5,5-dimethyl- \n1,3-Bis(hydroxymethyl)-5,5-dimethyl-2,4-imidazolidinedione \n\n1,3-Di(hydroxymethyl)-5,5-dimethylhydantoin \nGlycoserve-DMDMH \n\nHydantoin,1,3-bis(hydroxymethyl)-5,5-dimethyl\n\n**In short, it's a commonly used preservative. **\n\n\n\n**When do we get exposed to DMDM Hydantoin?**\n\nUSE: \nDMDM hydantoin and MDM hydantoin are used as antimicrobial agents and preservatives in cosmetics, adhesives, air freshners, caulks, cleansers, fabric softeners, hydraulic fluids, inks, liquid detergents, metalworking cutting fluids, paints, powdered detergents, sealants, carpet shampoos, soap, stains and coatings, paper/paperboard coatings, starch solutions, textiles, and wax. \n\nEXPOSURE:\n People may be exposed through dermal contact and breathing in mists or dusts in the manufacture of materials containing DMDM hydantoin and when using consumer products containing DMDM hydantoin. If released to the environment, DMDM hydantoin will break down in air. DMDM hydantoin released to air may also absorb on particles that eventually fall to the ground. It will move readily in soil. It will be broken down by microorganisms. DMDM hydantoin in water breaks down to form 5,5-dimethyl hydantoin and formaldehyde. DMDM hydantoin will not build up in aquatic organisms. \n\n**What are some examples of day to day products we use that contain DMDM Hydantoin?**\n\nShampoos - Dove, Tresemme,  Axe, clinic plus, pantene, Sunsilk,(A lot of Unilever shampoos) \n\nFacial gels - It's used as a preservative in some aloe Vera gels as well so do check the ingredients list before purchasing. \n\n**What are the risks of DMDM Hydantoin?**\n\nRISK: \nDirect contact with DMDM hydantoin or solutions with DMDM hydantoin may result in eye damage and skin irritation. Allergic skin reactions may develop in some people exposed to DMDM hydantoin. No abortions or birth defects in offspring were found after pregnant laboratory animals were given doses of DMDM hydantoin by mouth. Tests of the potential carcinogenicity of DMDM hydantoin in laboratory animals have not been conducted. The potential for DMDM hydantoin to cause cancer in humans has not been assessed by the U.S. EPA IRIS program, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, or the U.S. National Toxicology Program 13th Report on Carcinogens. (SRC)\n\n\n**Why are people so bothered about this particular preservative?**\n\nThere was a lawsuit against Tresemme because of this particular preservative. Since tresemme is a widely used brand, a lot of people complained that they face hairfall issues after using their shampoos. People claimed that it was this particular preservative(DMDM Hydantoin) that was the cause for their hair fall. \n\nThe lawsuit is based around the inclusion of DMDM hydantoin in the brand's Keratin Smooth Color Shampoo, and the hair loss that, according to the suit, over 100 people saw after using it. \n\nThis isn't the first time the impact of formaldehyde-releasing ingredients in personal care products has been called into question. The suit's filing includes the nugget that in 2012, Suave, also owned by beauty conglomerate Unilever, recalled its Keratin Infusion products in light of complaints that it caused hair loss and scalp irritation. The line included DMDM hydantoin, which is found in many hair and skincare products. \n\nLast year, there was a similar class action lawsuit brought against the curly hair product brand DevaCurl. Facebook groups discussing people's inordinate hair thinning gained over 60,000 members and, as of April, the New York Times writes that there were at least 10 class-action lawsuits pending in which customers say DevaCurl damaged their scalps and made their hair fall out in clumps. Although those suits didn't name a specific ingredient of concern, it's worth noting that some DevaCurl formulas also include a formaldehyde-releasing preservative, diazolidinyl urea. \n\n\n**What do experts say?**\n\nDermatologist Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology and an associate professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital, tells Health that, while direct contact to formaldehyde-releasers can lead to allergic contact dermatitis, it's rare. Dermatitis can look like red, itchy, flaky skin, he says, and can temporarily interfere with functioning hair follicles, leading to shedding. \n\nBut so many people having an issue with a certain kind of ingredient does stir up doubt—and Dr. Sharima Rasanayagam, science director of Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, confirms that when it comes to a known carcinogen, irritant, and allergen like formaldehyde, any exposure is worse than none. Small doses of it can trigger reactions in sensitive individuals, Rasanayagam says, either from encountering it in different products or from continued use of just one. \n\nThe good news? Zeichner says it's unlikely there'll be any long-term damage and, while unpleasant, allergic contact dermatitis isn't harmful to your overall health. There's no way of predicting who will react to formaldehyde-releasers, he says, and genetics play a determining role—so if you have an history of eczema or other skin allergies, you could be more likely to develop a reaction.   \n\nThere are also websites like Paula's choice, Incidecoder and ChemicalSafetyFacts.org that provide info on DMDM Hydantoin.\n\nIn summary, Paula's choice claims it to be an Okay preservative, incidecoder says it's a controversial preservative and ChemicalSafetyFacts says it's safe as long as its used in small quantities. \n\nI'll link the articles here - [Paula's choice](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/preservatives/dmdm-hydantoin.html) [ChemicalSafetyFacts](https://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/dmdm-hydantoin-2/) [Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dmdm-hydantoin)\n\nThere's a video by Dr Dray about this topic on YouTube. Do check it out [Dr dray video on DMDM ](https://youtu.be/WYuZsOAearo)\n\nIf you want to be on the safe side, the even better news is that there are tons of shampoos that don't contain formaldehyde-releasing preservatives like DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea, or quaternium-15, so you don't have to wonder if your hair routine is causing hair loss.  \n\n\n**Which shampoos DO NOT contain DMDM Hydantoin?**\n\n1)Garnier Fructis long and strong shampoo (If my eyesight is right coz zooming into those blur pictures with tiny prints on flipkart was a headache🙃)\n\n2) Garnier ultra blends range \n\n3)Herbal essences shampoos\n\n4)Aveeno Scalp Soothing Fresh Greens Blend Shampoo for Volume\n\n5)Matrix Biolage shampoos \n\n6)Head and shoulders shampoos\n\n7)St Botanica shampoos\n\n8)Himalaya shampoos\n\n9)Johnsons baby shampoo (The product has Quaternium-15 which has the ability to break down to formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. Here's a link to the website that told me this.)\n\n(In theabove list of shampoos, I checked the ingredients list of few of the variants of each company shampoos and they don't seem to have DMDM but please check the ingredients list everytime you buy a shampoo coz formulations can change)\n\nAlso, Here's a post by u/santa96 on DMDM [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/m6zap9/anyone_who_feels_dmdm_hydantoin_is_the_cause_of/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",

No matter the heat / humidity outside, my edges stayed laid and it didn’t make my hair revert when it was straight. However, after experiencing thinning edges I started to go down my list of products. I’ve always had lighter looking edges (I have naturally ashy brown hair with blond hairs in my edges), but there was enough difference that I knew something was up. \n\nLo and behold I found that a main ingredient in this edge control is DMDM hydantoin, which is a preservative and antibacterial ingredient. But, this chemical is known to release levels of formaldehyde throughout its shelf life. Formaldehyde is the same ingredient they tell us to beware of in relaxers, and also known to cause cancer. After I stopped using, my edges grew back as normal. I have to admit it took me testing this theory twice and confirmed this was the culprit of my edge issues. I will never use this product again. \n\nNeedless to say, I’d just beware if you’re using this. Especially if you’re concerned with formaldehyde and have other hair health issues. Hope this helps! ",

Sinks into the skin fast while being moisturizing. Does not make me sweat even on the hottest humid-est days.  \nFor reference, [POND'S Super Light Gel Face Moisturiser](https://incidecoder.com/products/ponds-super-light-gel-moisturiser), [Plum Green Tea Oil-Free Moisturizer](https://incidecoder.com/products/plum-green-tea-oil-free-moisturizer) and [Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture for Combination Skin](https://incidecoder.com/products/neutrogena-oil-free-moisture-combination-skin-india) caused me CCs and would sit on top of my skin for 10-20 minutes or longer which would cause me sweat it out.\n* One tube lasted 9 months with twice everyday usage.\n* Bought from CultBeauty\n* Irrelevant but I appreciate the packaging since its commensurate to the content of the product.

Made me realize that maybe all sunscreens don't suck. Also, till now haven't seen this one be mentioned on the list of dubious sunscreens.\n* I have been switching between this and Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence so I have yet to finish it.\n* Bought from BeautyBarn\n\n# 💋Lip Balm:\n\n**Burt's Bees Lip Balms**\n\n* **Rant + WNRP**\n* Usage timeline: since Dec 2019\n* Ingredients: [Nourishing Lip Balm Mango](https://incidecoder.com/products/burts-bees-nourishing-lip-balm-mango), [Pink Grapefruit Lip Balm](https://incidecoder.com/products/burts-bees-pink-grapefruit-lip-balm), [Coconut & Pear](https://incidecoder.com/products/burts-bees-coconut-pear)\n* Mango was a decent lip balm and comparable to any regular lip balm available in the Indian market\n* Pink Grapefruit irritated my lips\n* Coconut & Pear does not moisturize.

I type on my keyboard throughout the day and it does not leave residue on the keys or any surfaces.\n* Combats drying after excessive hand washing. Needs to reapplied after washing.\n* Its perfect as a day time hand cream.

It's the jack of all trades and middle option I'd go for if I wasn't trying to max out on any specific feature. It's moisturizing *enough*, absorbs fast, not greasy, not extra heavy duty. The main downside is the EE scent catalogue is mostly gourmand, so I have a hard time finding scents I like.\n* CocoaPink Voluptuous Body Butter - similar in consistency to EE lotion, slightly thicker, and a lot more scents to choose from.\n* CocoaPink Coco Mango Body Butter - lighter and greasier than the voluptuous version. I prefer the voluptuous. \n* Wylde Ivy body butter/skin cream - thicc formula that absorbed very fast (almost too fast lol - I find myself having to almost apply in patches/can easily run through a lot of product since it would absorb before I was done spreading it evenly around)",

I adore other products in the Booda Organics line and I really wanted to love their body butter. Their ingredients list is minimal and amazing. But it is very thick and slightly tacky on the skin. It has to be warmed up in your hands first for a longer period of time than other body butters which I didn’t like personally. I’ll still buy it as a rich hand cream, especially for winter. I just probably won’t use it as an all over body moisturizer again. \n\nI’ve also tried Chagrin Valley’s whipped butter. This one was the opposite experience: light and easy to apply, but not hydrating enough for my liking (at least in winter). But again the all natural ingredients list was very appealing. I might give it another shot in the summer when my skin needs less moisture. \n\nUpdate: I ended up going with the Laguna Naturals body butter. I think I might have found the one. The ingredients list is very clean, and it is perfect amount of thickness in my opinion. My skin feels very hydrated and not sticky when I apply it. 10/10 would recommend.",

We often talk about skincare and beneficial or terrible ingredients here and on the wider web, however I always think hair care is never as thoroughly investigated. I’m a total newbie at hair styling, however I will blow my own trumpet and say after years of research and trial and error I’m pretty good at hair care. This will probably be very long even without me going into lots of detail, but feel free to ask in comments for more detail on specific things that interest you and I will expand. Also chime in with any extra info, especially if you’re curly haired! My experience and knowledge is more based in straight and slightly wavy hair. \n\nA disclaimer – proper hair care can be time consuming and require lots of trial and error at first, it did for me and everyone who I know is really into it too, but in my opinion it is worth it. It doesn’t have to be pricy though, there are lots of great cheap products! Once you find what works for you though, you will really reap the benefits for life. \n\n\nSo, let’s start!\n\n\n**Finding out the true state of your hair**\n\nMost likely you use silicones on your hair (a lot of products contain them), and silicones coat your hair, make it soft, sometimes weigh it down. They cover a lot of hair care sins. To find out the true condition of your hair, you will need to strip it of silicones. To do this, you will need to use a shampoo with a fairly strong detergent, sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), or sodium coco-sulfate are often shunned, however they are great for removing silicones from hair. You can then apply a non-silicone conditioner, and then wait for your hair to dry naturally. At this stage, you will see how good (or bad) a condition your hair is really like. It may still be looking great, but you may get quite a shock and decide you need quite the chop. I know I did the first time I cleansed my hair properly. It went from being fairly soft albeit a bit flat with just some split ends, to dry, tangled, and extremely brittle on the bottom 10cm. It looked matted. I took off a third of my length immediately and then a few months later another 5cm or so. I will edit this later once I find some before photos of my hair, and I will also do a current photo with my hair free of silicones.\n\n**Figuring out your hair porosity**\nHair porosity is your hair’s ability to absorb moisture. There is theoretically a simple test [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/40/3d/62/403d621b14f0c8c63e04ec9b61c02508.png) you can do, however over time you may find the result of it wasn’t 100%. I have medium porosity, meaning my hair absorbs moisture okay and keeps it for a decent amount of time. Low porosity hair doesn’t absorb moisture easily, however once it does, the moisture stays for a very long time. This can lead to product build up which will need to be cleansed regularly. Low porosity often requires using heat to absorb moisture (such as putting on a hair mask, a plastic shower cap and blowing hot air at it). High porosity hair absorbs moisture quickly, but it also lets it out quickly. Often requires good conditioning, but may also require cleansing from time to time. It will often feel frizzy, and humidity will have a big impact on high porosity hair. Unfortunately, you can’t really change the porosity of your hair, but you can definitely care for it! \n\n\n**Ingredients and Products**\n\nI have to say, compared to the east, the west has actually rather limited hair care options. Most high street and even salon brands are really not fantastic. I live in the UK, but I source most of my products from Eastern Europe, so for those of you in the US my specific recommendations might not be too much help, but you might be able to find some or find alternatives by looking at the ingredients list. \n\n**Ingredients**\n\nThere isn’t really a super easy way to go about this. After a year or so I learnt the names of ingredients that really work or don’t work for me and I look for or avoid them. [Here]( http://www.tightlycurly.com/ingredients/) is a good ingredients list which tells you what the ingredient is and what it is used for. It does also have a ‘good’ ‘okay’ ‘avoid’ rating system, however I wouldn’t necessarily take it into consideration, as how a lot of ingredients affect you is personal (for example some people’s hair responds well to sulfates or paraffin, others not so much). \n\nThe order of the ingredients list is not accidental. The further from the top, the less of that ingredient there is. Any beneficial ingredient listed after ‘parfum’ is not going to bring you any results, as it is basically a trace, however something that you are sensitive to can still have a negative effect on your scalp even at such trace amounts. \n\n*Things to look for*: \n\n*Oils* – any ingredient name that ends with oil (except mineral oil which is paraffin, more on this later!) is beneficial for hair. The more and the closer to the top of the list, the better, especially in masks and conditioners.\n\n*Extracts* – again any name that ends with extracts. These are extracts of naturally occurring plants, herbs, or even legumes which have different beneficial effects such as smoothing, adding shine, protecting or strengthening. \n\n*Emolients* – lanolin, anything with ‘butter’ (e.g. shea butter), cera alba (beeswax), pafarrinum liquidum (paraffin, more on this later)\n\n*Humectants* – glycerin, urea, mel (honey), aloe vera, fructose (sugars).\n\n*Antioxidants* – ascorbic acid (vit C), tocopherol (vit E), Ubiquinone (Q10), retinol/retinyl acelate/palmiatate (vit A), niacinamide (vit B3). \n\n*Proteins* – hydrolysed silk, hydrolysed keratin, hydrolysed wheat protein, hydrolysed oat protein. Proteins help to strengthen hair. \n\n*Soothing ingredients* – allantoin, arnica montana, calendula officinalis, panthenol. Particularly useful if you have a sensitive scalp.\n\n\n*What to avoid (generally speaking):*\n\n*Sulfates* – Sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, although if anything in the ingredients list of your shampoo ends with sulfate, check on the list for strength. Sulfates don’t always need to be avoided.  They are cleansers and foaming agents used in a large majority of shampoos. They can strip your hair of oils and humectants and dry the skin on your scalp, however they are also useful in the removal of silicones.  They shouldn’t be used every day, but once a week to every 2 weeks is recommended if you use silicones on your hair. If your scalp and roots respond well to sulfates, you can protect the lengths of your hair by applying an oil or conditioner pre-washing, thoroughly washing your scalp and roots with a sulfate shampoo and only using the leftover foam on the length, then conditioning again. There are more and less harsh versions, and the gentler ones can be used more frequently, please refer to ingredient list! Not recommended for curly hair.\n\n*Parabens and preservatives* – Ones I found particularly harmful to me personally: DMDM Hydantoin, 5-Bromo-5-Nitro-1,3-Dioxane, 2-Bromo-2-Nitropropane-1,3-Diol, Diazolidynyl Urea, Imidiazolidynyl Urea, Phenyl Benzoate, Phenyl Dimethicone, Formaldehyde, Methylchloroisothiazolinone. Parabens are used to prevent products from going off. They’re not the only preservatives used in hair care and by no means the worst ones, but they can affect your scalp and hair. Eco-shampoos and conditioners are often filled with alcohol instead of parabens which can really dry out your scalp and hair. I don’t find parabens to be bad for my hair at all, but this is personal and you will have to eliminate and reintroduce (see that thing I said about time consuming at the start?) to really find out. You will not be able to find a preservative free product, therefore it is worth checking which work for you. \n\n*Alcohol* – alcohol denat and isopropyl alcohol, most others are fatty alcohols which are moisturising. The only time harsh alcohols are useful is when using hair ‘rubs’, where they help with product absorption. \n\n*Scents* – most scenting ingredients are listed under parfum, however some particularly harsh ones are required to be listed separately. These are: limonene, linalool, citronellol, geraniol, coumarin, citral, benzyl benzoate and eugenol. They’re usually at the very end of the list and in the trace amounts will not usually do any harm unless you have a sensitivity. \n\n*Silicones* – similarly to sulfates, silicones are not always bad. I personally like silicones. They work with my hair without concealing its true condition much or weighing it down. If your hair is thin you may find it better to only use the more soluble ones or none at all.\nI avoid shampoos with silicones at all cost though. The job of a shampoo is to cleanse your hair and prepare it for absorption of beneficial ingredients. I allow water soluble and gentle shampoo soluble silicones in conditioners and hair masks, and I use SLS requiring silicones in leave in conditioners that I only put on the ends of my hair. \n\nWater soluble silicones are: dimethicone copolyol, lauryl methicone copolyol, hydrolyzed wheat protein hydroxypropyl polysiloxane and silicones with PEG and a number at the start. The higher the number (especially above 10), the more water soluble the silicone. \n\nSilicones soluble in mild shampoo: amodimethicone, dimethicone, dimethiconol, beheonoxy dimethicone, phenyl trimethicone.\n\nNeed sulfates: simethicone, trimethicone, trimethylsilylamodimethicone, trimethylsiloxysilicates.\n\nEvaporate from hair (only washing with a conditioner to become soluble): cyclometicone, cyclopentasiloxane, cyclotetrasiloxane, octamethyl cyclotetrasiloxane, cyclohexasiloxane.\n\nI would advise completely removing silicones from your hair care routine for a week (you might find out your hair curls when it never did before), and then slowly reintroducing them one by one from the mildest to the heaviest ones to see how your hair reacts.  \n\n*Paraffin*  - Mineral Oil, Paraffinum Liquidum, Paraffin Oil, white oil are most common names of Paraffin. Paraffin has made a bad name for itself, it is known to be comedogenic to skin, however this does not happen to everybody, and even then you don’t have to put it on your scalp. Paraffin can be found in conditioners, masks and hair oils, and I’ve never had problems with it as an ingredient. It is also found in a lot of baby products, as near enough no one is allergic to it. You will have to experiment to see how it works for you. If it agrees with your hair, it works much quicker than natural oils – you will see results from first use, rather than after months of regular use. Products containing paraffin can be used after washing and conditioning to protect your hair from split ends. Paraffin requires stronger cleansing agents such as SLS for removal, and therefore not recommended for curly hair. \n\n\n**Products**\n\nNow, let’s look at specific products and how to get the most of them. \n\n*Hair Oils*\nI cannot recommend hair oils enough. This is probably the number one thing that changed my hair. I have been using hair oils for 6+ years and have never looked back. I’ve tried A LOT of oils, and my favourite one is [khadi]( https://www.essentialslondon.com/products/hair-care/khadi-vitalising-hair-oil-100ml?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuOPxmKHw1QIVCrftCh1njgn9EAQYAyABEgIwGPD_BwE#fo_c=762&fo_k=e4b0478aa27161be9771ad687e8f656d&fo_s=gplauk). It promotes hair growth and keeps my hair healthy and shiny, but some people don’t like the scent. Pure argan oil and rosehip oil are also great for me, as is pure coconut oil or the coconut hair oil from [vatika]( https://www.amazon.com/Dabur-Vatika-Enriched-Coconut-150ml/dp/B006BA3BAY/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_121_bs_t_1/136-1463637-2732606?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=B8H7QG82QJF78X98V78D). There are a lot of oils on the market, just make sure what you’re using is pure oil, not stuff like the brand ‘moroccan oil’ because even your cooking olive oil is better than that. You can find a lot of indian hair oils on amazon. Apply by taking a few droplets and warming them up in your palms, then rubbing into the scalp and the lengths of the hair. When I first started my hair care and my hair was quite damaged, I would apply oils overnight every other night (before washing), and sleep with a cotton hair cap on to prevent transfer onto my pillow, then wash it off and condition in the morning. I now wash my hair in the evenings, so I apply it for about an hour before washing and I find that’s enough, but my hair is not particularly damaged.\n\n*Shampoos*\n\nFor day to day cleansing I try to find as simple a shampoo as possible, such as this [Babydream]( https://www.codecheck.info/kosmetik_koerperpflege/babypflege/babyshampoo/ean_4305615272467/id_792172/Babydream_Shampoo_mit_Kamille.pro). I’ve tried other ones over the years, but always come back to this one as it’s super cheap and gentle. I also like [Equilibria aloe vera shampoo]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,51609,equilibra-aloe-shampoo.html). Other products that I’ve used as a shampoo that aren’t a shampoo: [Facelle intimate wash]( http://www.rossmann.pl/Produkt/Facelle-intim-plyn-do-higieny-intymnej-Sensitive-300-ml,101735,7210), [Johnson’s Baby 3in1 Wash]( http://www.johnsonsbaby.com.pl/johnsons-baby-%C5%82agodny-p%C5%82yn-do-mycia-cia%C5%82a-i-w%C5%82os%C3%B3w-3w1). At the start I found my hair a bit tangled after use, but I think that was partly due to the damage. For heavier cleansing I use [Avalon organics rosemary]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/Avalon-Organics-Rosemary-Volumizing-Shampoo/dp/B001ET78QU) or any of the herbal [Barwa Natura]( https://www.barwa.com.pl/seria/barwa-naturalna/) shampoos. I do this every 10-14 days depending on how my hair feels regarding silicones and paraffin that I’ve used. A special mention goes to [Babuszka Agafia Black Soap]( https://bioika.pl/pl/p/Naturalne-Syberyjskie-Czarne-Mydlo-Agafii-na-bazie-37-ziol/659) which is just amazing. \n\n*Conditioners*\n\nI like to go rich here. I look for alllll of the extracts, oils, humectants, anything and everything. My everyday conditioner is the [Garnier avocado and shea butter]( https://www.fragrancedirect.co.uk/garnier-ultimate-blends-the-nourishing-repairer-conditioner-0083190.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=merchant&utm_keyword=foo&istCompanyId=17773c4e-a26f-4631-9b91-73e6422dbe77&istItemId=xiqwpwpqil&istBid=tztx&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9Oud06Lw1QIVxbztCh0PbQzcEAkYASABEgI4UfD_BwE) and it’s been with me for years. I also like the [seboradin ginseng conditioner]( https://seboradin.pl/en/seboradin-revitalizing/29-lotion-seboradin-revitalizing.html), Nivea Long Repair, [Balea Coconut and Milk](http://lepotica.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/balea-mleko-za-telo-lepotica.jpg) and [Timotei Precious Oils]( https://www.amazon.com/Timotei-Precious-Oil-Hair-Conditioner/dp/B00UGHRW6M). Currently I apply in-shower for however long it takes me to shave and wash, then rinse off. When my hair was damaged, I would put a cap on and leave them on for 30 mins, then rinse.\n\n*Masks*\n\nAs with conditioners, as many of the goodies as possible. This is probably the product I’ve switched up the most, as there are not very many BAD hair masks, usually they’re between average and amazing. My favourites over the years have been [Alterra]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,43114,haarkur-granatapfel-aloe-vera.html), [Natur Vital aloe vera]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,40836,naturvital-sensitive-hair-mask-aloe-vera-juniper-zimbro.html) mask, [biovax masks such as this]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/LBiotica-Biovax-Damaged-Hair-250ml/dp/B00N42XUL2), [Babuszka Agafia yeast mask]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,51660,pervoe-reshenie-przepisy-babci-agafii-maska-do-wlosow-drozdzowa-na-pobudzenie-wzrostu.html) and [Kallos Latte]( https://www.notino.co.uk/kallos/serical-mask-for-damaged-chemically-treated-hair/?item=78561&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqp7vxKPw1QIVbb7tCh2u0QGcEAQYASABEgKtzPD_BwE) mask. I used to apply masks twice a week, but now I do it weekly or even every 10 days. Usually I will apply a mask instead of conditioner, throw on a shower cap, and keep it on for anywhere between 1 and 3 hours before rinsing. Sometimes I will blow warm air from the hairdryer to help the ingredients absorb better.\n\n*Rinses*\n\nThere are many rinses you can make at home, not really available as products to buy. I like a chamomile rinse the best as I’m blonde, I also like a dissolved aloe one, but you can experiment with ingredients recommended for your hair type. They can strengthen your hair, add shine, reduce frizz, make it sleeker.\n\n*Rubs*\n\nThese are products that you rub into your scalp and roots (and sometimes hair length) without rinsing off. My favourite is from [Jantar]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,69415,jantar-odzywka-do-wlosow-i-skory-glowy-nowa-wersja.html), I also like [Joanna Rzepa]( http://wizaz.pl/kosmetyki/produkt,17640,rzepa-kuracja-wzmacniajaca.html). There are also placenta capsules after which I got an insane amount of baby hair. Rubs help with growth and strength of hair!\n\n*Hair protection*\n\nI use something with silicones and proteins in to protect my end, usually the silk from [biovax]( http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/like/112353278842?chn=ps&dispItem=1&adgroupid=44158024220&rlsatarget=pla-324287136906&abcId=1128926&adtype=pla&merchantid=115212699&poi=&googleloc=1007281&device=c&campaignid=856227250&crdt=0), but some hair oils (especially coconut) will also do. I do this once my hair is at least half dry and leave it in. If I’m not washing my hair for longer than 2 days, I will reapply. \n\n*Vitamins, Supplements etc.*\n\nThere are a lot of supplements you can try to help your hair growth or its condition. Vitamin E is obviously a staple. Biotin is fantastic for hair growth. Pregnancy vitamins strengthen hair. Drinking nettle and horsetail tea will do wonders. If you are really, really adventurous and can stomach a lot, drinking yeast (fresh is best, but dry will do) is the best for hair growth. You need to drink it every day for a prolonged period of time though, and it is incredibly unpleasant so requires a lot of commitment.\n\n*Hair styling and others*\n\nAs you might have seen from my previous post, I don’t often style my hair, and have never done. I do hairdry on cold or lukewarm settings, but I only use heat stylers for events and I chuck in a lot of hair protection. I’m gonna experiment a little with styling after my most recent post, but after looking for styling products, I’ve found very few that are not harmful to hair. I don’t brush my hair wet unless using the wet brush, I have a cotton tshirt I use to absorb water from it with instead of a towel, I don’t sleep with it wet, I keep it in a loose twisted bun overnight mostly to avoid rubbing. I have 3 different hair brushes (sable and synthetic) and a tangle teezer. If it’s very windy, I plait my hair, and I wear a hat in the sun. I wear a cap to go swimming. \n\n\nWell done if you got to the end, you are a hero. I hope you find these tips useful and can pick and mix as you please! Give most products 3-4 weeks to do their work before you deem them useless though. Looking forward to any tips you ladies might have on hair care, discussion, and what you found works for you and if you’re as obsessive as I am about it! \n\n\nEdit: link with some [hair photos](https://imgur.com/a/CQU90), 6 year difference",

Olay is my HG facial cleanser which I've been using for 10+ years. I used Olay foaming cleanser as my main, and use Olay cream cleanser only on specific days (e.g when I want to exfoliate, although whether the exfoliating part works or not I have no idea, I've just been using it for a long time and never really felt like changing, it's not even my \"HG\" per se, I just never tried anything else) \n     * However, I recently found out that their products contain DMDM Hydantoin, a formalhyde releaser suggested to be bad for someone with respiratory problem (I have symptoms of flu daily which is usually diagnosed as sinusitis). Which is why I bought Senka Perfect Whip Foam and the Hada Labo cleanser, to check if they can replace my Olay. \n     * I had been using Senka Perfect Whip Foam for a while, and I actually liked it! However, reviews of it being too high pH and potentially bad for long term use caution me. Anyway Senka Perfect Whip Foam is the highest in this list at a pH value of 9, which matches with what was reported in this subreddit pH list.\n     * So when the tube finished, I went back to Olay for 1/2 days then bought Hada Labo Hydrating Foaming Wash. \n         * _I then used HL foaming wash twice (Wednesday night and Thursday morning) and felt that my skin felt tight/dry, looked a bit reddish around the cheek area, and flaky. **I was dumbfounded and trying to figure out, what's causing this? Is it the high pH of my previous cleansers (Olay foaming wash or Senka Perfect Whip foam? Is it the Senka Hoshitsu Lotion R Toner - Shittori version? Is it because my moisture barrier is damaged? Is my skin hydrated but not moisturised? is it because of my period?** (unlikely as I never notice this happening during my previous periods) I'm now afraid of aggravating my skin further that I went back to only using my Olay foaming wash and not using anything else, not even toner or moisturiser. While the redness and extremely tight feeling feels better overnight after washing with HL foaming wash, until today, I can still see the flakes on my cheek area and touching my cheek feels like the texture is no longer mochi-mochi (or soft), more like a bit of sandpaper-y texture, although I feel that it seems to be getting better now._ I’m now using HL foaming wash for my neck, it doesn’t seem to have any problem.\n         * I found Hada Labo Gokujyun Foaming Face Wash to have pH7 instead of 5.5 or its rounded up value of 6 like others have tested before. I wondered about this myself that I tested the product twice. It gave me 7 both times. \n         * Hada Labo Tamagohada AHA+BHA was reported by others as having pH6 while I also found it to be pH7. I had used this only once before HL foaming wash and I didn't notice glaring problem.\n         * I don't know what's causing the differences of pH results with others, re-formulation perhaps? Although, HL claims to be pH balanced... reading at it that way, 7 is the balance between acid and alkaline..\n* **HAIR DILEMMA**\n     * I was actually planning to ditch Hask because despite the branding of being free of sulfates, parabens and drying alcohol, it contains Methylisothiazolinone, a persevative rated as POOR by Paula's Choice and scored overall hazard as 7 by EWG. Hask is non-AB, a US brand, reeled me in because they claim to be number 1 used products in Hollywood and used in Agent Carter, one of my favourite TV shows, and also being free of sulfates, parabens and drying alcohol. Another shocking fact is that my Watson baby wet wipes contains this very same ingredient, welp, makes me rethink Paula's Choice's article about be wary of products that claim to be natural (and in the wet wipes case also claim as being for baby).\n     * But, Milbon, a Japanese brand which can only be bought in affiliated professional salon, has higher pH level. \n     * Now I'm thinking to ditch both, **_should I try Moist Diane or Kracie Ichikami next? Any recommendations?_** _Hair type: East Asian, dry, coloured (not bleached), wavy, fine - if I don't dry my hair using hair dryer, people think I didn't comb my hair._\n* **BODY WASH DECISION**\n     * I might be holding a Shokubutsu is over party in my bathroom soon. I still have 2 refill packs left. **_Any ideas on what should I repurpose it as?_** Or should I just continue to use it until its finished? I actually like the product, it makes my skin feels smooth after shower and it contains mostly gentle ingredients according to CosDNA. I'm just cautious of the long term effects of using high pH cleansers as brought up in many articles.\n     * Johnsons’ pH5.5 body wash has the result of pH6. Since my pH paper doesn't have comma indicator, suffice to say Johnsons do good by their words here. I'll be sticking with it.\n",

I did recently have a reaction to the Biore UV Watery Essence sunscreen (I'm thinking maybe it was the citrus extracts?), and it took me about 3-4 days to get back to normal-ish and about a week to 10 days to fully recover. I went super boring on my recovery routine: \n\n- La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser (non-foaming, pH 5.5)\n\n- Hada Labo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion (both applied directly to skin and the cotton square masking technique, pH 5.5)\n\n- Sebamed Clear Face Care Gel (pH 5.5)\n\n- Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream (pH 5.5)\n\n- Vaseline as an occlusive at night\n\n- No actives and no sunscreen (partially because I was traumatized by sunscreen and unsure of what ingredient(s) gave me the reaction, and partially because I didn't think my skin could handle double cleansing to remove the sunscreen if I wore it)\n\nIt can and will get better! \n\nI recently went through and re-pH-tested a bunch of my products, after reading [Snow's blog post on the disappointment and betrayal of product reformulation](http://www.snowwhiteandtheasianpear.com/2016/06/a-rant-on-reformulations.html), and I got the same result that you did on the Hada Labo Gokujyun Foaming Face Wash! [pH = 7](https://imgur.com/tgNDma7), with or without water mixed in (my tap water has a pH of 7)! I'll have to go home and check the expiration date/location of manufacture, but I ordered my Hada Labo Foaming Face Wash on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CE5P580/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on October 18, 2017 and received it on October 24, 2017. \n\nWhen/where did you buy yours? I posted about this in the Daily Help Thread on November 15, 2017, hoping to see if anyone else had the same experience as me. I wonder if there are more of us...",

        "body": "I swapped to Dr. Bronner's Peppermint shampoo. I mix it with some oils like castor, rosemary, pumpkin seed, and argan oil. I shake it up to emulsify it and it makes a soap/butter. I put that in a container then grab some to work into a lather for my shampoo. You probably can get away with not using any of the oils but I figured it would help moisturize since I dumped conditioner as well. I do still use the keto shampoo once a week, but the moment I stopped using those shampoos my hairfall went from 40-60 per shower to 4-15. Been doing it for 1.5 months now I think. Dunno if it's helping over all but the hair catcher does not lie.I also did a lot of research and tried a few different shampoo/conditioners that were supposed to be real good for hairloss. I got tired of the search because it would either have something in it that was not good for the scalp or would I would still see a shed in the shower. The difference was immediate so I'm fine with the current regime.\n\nEdit: I know I have MPB. I am losing it in the standard pattern. I also take fin so I'm not hoping this change in shampoo will cure me. I am just hoping this help tip the scales rather than continuing to aggravate my scalp and make things worse.",

Heat protection sprays are designed to protect from heat settings that get up to 450 degrees (depending on the product).\n You can test heat protection sprays and how well they buffer the heat.  1. Simply spray the product on one hand and leave the other hand free from product. I like a liquid spray. 2. Take a blow dryer and apply heat to the hand that has the spray. Count how many seconds you can withstand the heat from the dryer. 3. Next apply heat to the hand that doesn’t have product and count how long you can stand the heat.\n There should be a noticeable difference between the  heat. This will give you an idea of how effective your product is working. \n Also with liquid sprays you can spray the product your hand and apply to avoid contact with your face. Hope this helps.",

    "body": "I recently became curious about sunscreens after reading a [piece by Lifehacker](https://vitals.lifehacker.com/lifehackers-essential-science-based-guide-to-skin-care-1824029261) stating - even if you’re not spending much time outside - “not one anti aging product, anti wrinkle product, firming, toning, any other product on the market … can compare or compete with the benefits of sunscreen”.\n\nBut when I looked for a recommendation, I couldn’t find a consensus.  EWG is difficult to navigate (IE-only - what year is this?), and tends to look overly-favorably towards physical/mineral-only sunscreens. The Wirecutter and Consumer Reports are more focused on price and SPF than ingredient health risks (not unreasonable given prior results from studies) and feel on your skin (less reasonable - what good is sunscreen that you never want to use?).\n\nFor the record, I was \\~90% of the way through my own research before I found this subreddit =)\n\nDisclaimer¹: I am neither a doctor nor a scientist, nor do I have any affiliation with any of the companies or brands mentioned.  I’m just in search of a straightforward recommendation on which sunscreen to buy.\n\nOnce I’d fallen deep down the rabbit hole, I wanted to share what I found with others in case others might find it helpful.  Here’s what I’ve learned thus far:\n\n## Lesson 1: Sunscreen is definitely [worth the (comparably low) risk!](https://blog.skincancer.org/2018/06/06/sunscreen-safety/)\n\nDaily sunscreen use reduces cancer rates by 40-50% - a demonstrable benefit that exponentially outweighs the scarce in vivo or even in vitro experiments showing a link between various ingredients and potential health risks (usually at high concentrations).\n\n## Lesson 2: Different regions have different regulations and [ratings](https://theklog.co/spf-meaning/)\n\n* The Boots ★ rating is proprietary, and relative to the SPF. So ★★★★★ on SPF 15 may not be as good as ★★★ on SPF 50.\n* PPD is akin to SPF but for UVA rays.  A PPD of 10 indicates that it takes 10 times longer to darken than unprotected skin.\n* The U.S. has a “broad spectrum” test, but the ratio of UVA to UVB isn’t explicit\n* Some newer ingredients that show promise (Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Mexoryl SX Mexoryl XL, & Uvinul A Plus) are still pending safety studies for U.S. approval\n* Outside the U.S., not all companies are obliged to show the % of their active ingredients in the sunscreen formulas.\n\n## Lesson 3: Some ingredients may be better than others.\n\n* Oxybenzone & Octinoxate may be [endocrine disruptors](https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/report/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/)\n* Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide are better, but alone [aren’t effective enough](https://www.consumerreports.org/sunscreens/shining-a-light-on-natural-sunscreen/).\n* Some studies linked inactive ingredients with other risks:\n   * \\[Vitamin A (Retinyl Palmitate)\\]([https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/705545/RETINYL\\_PALMITATE\\_(VITAMIN\\_A\\_PALMITATE)/](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/705545/RETINYL_PALMITATE_(VITAMIN_A_PALMITATE)/))\n   * [BHT (Butylated hydroxytoluene)](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700741/BHT/)\n   * [Unregulated Fragrances/Perfumes](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/702512/FRAGRANCE/)\n   * [Aluminum compounds](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700326/ALUMINUM_STARCH_OCTENYLSUCCINATE/)\n   * [DMDM Hydantoin](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/702196/DMDM_HYDANTOIN_(FORMALDEHYDE_RELEASER)/)\n   * [PABA (Para-Aminobenzoic Acid)](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/704390/PABA/)  \\- Soon to be banned by the FDA\n   * [Parabens](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/search.php?query=paraben), [Propyl-paraben](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/705335/PROPYLPARABEN/) & [Butyl-paraben](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700868/BUTYLPARABEN/)\n   * [PEG/PEO](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/704983/POLYETHYLENE_GLYCOL/)/PPG/PPO (Macrogol, Polyethylene glycol, Polyethylene Oxide, Polyoxyethylene, Polypropylene glycol or polypropylene oxide)\n   * [Silicones](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/701277/CETYL_PEG%3B%3B_PPG-10%3B%3B_1_DIMETHICONE/)\n   * [SLES (Sodium Laureth Sulfate)](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/706089/SODIUM_LAURETH_SULFATE/)\n   * [Trolamine Salicylate ](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/706476/TEA_SALICYLATE/) \\- Soon to be banned by the FDA\n   * [Phthalates](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/719992/ISOPROPYLPHTHALIMIDE/)\n   * certain [preservatives](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/703935/METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE/)\n* Other safe ingredients can feel unpleasant on skin (especially for us oily types):\n   * Allergens (gluten, nut oil, certain emulsifiers)\n   * Simple (aka short-chain) alcohols can dry out skin\n      * Alcohol Denat (Denatured Alcohol)\n      * Aminomethyl Propanol\n      * Benzyl alcohol\n      * Ethanol alcohol\n      * Ethyl alcohol\n      * Isopropyl alcohol\n      * Phenethyl\n      * Phenoxyethanol\n      * Propanol alcohol\n      * T-Butyl Alcohol\n   * certain Oils\n   * certain Emulsifiers\n   * Silicone & Acrylate polymers make sunscreen “waterproof” but can leave [tacky / greasy film](https://www.sharecare.com/health/sunburn-prevention/why-sun-protection-products-greasy) on your skin. Good for swimming, not for daily use.\n* Finally, a combination of Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Ferulic Acid may further protect skin from damage.\n\n## Lesson 4: SPF ratings aren’t as high in real life as they are in labs\n\nSunscreen’s ability to block UVA/UVB rays depends on the thickness applied to the skin.  In tests for SPF rating, they assume a thickness of 2mg/cm², which few people apply in real life (where it’s generally closer to .5 - 1mg/cm²).  That’s one of the reasons it’s better to use SPF 30+, because you’re likely only getting a fraction of the protection anyway.\n\n## Lesson 5: Protect your skin - with SCIENCE!\n\nThe coolest thing I found was that BASF (a major chemical manufacturer in the U.S.) has [a free tool](https://www.sunscreensimulator.basf.com/) that lets you plug in a sunscreen formulation and estimate its effectiveness, along with what it’s theoretical SPF, Boots ★ Rating, PA+ rating, and U.S. Broad Spectrum test results - you can even test at a lower amount like what people would realistically apply on their skin.\n\nSo what I did was search the internet for sunscreens that didn’t use Oxybenzone / Octinoxate, (which largely left Avobenzone - aka Methoxydibenzoylmethane - as the main UVA blocker), and compared their results.\n\nDisclaimer²: My understanding is that while we aren’t 100% confident in which chemicals are completely safe, we have previously found more risks from some chemicals than others.  This is part of why the FDA seeks more research on all sun blocking chemicals.\n\n## The Best\n\n**Legend:** Real - effective rating for 1mg/cm²; CR - Consumer Reports Ranking;\tNC - Non-comedogenic (doesn't block pores);\tPb - contains Parabens;\tA - contains short-chain alcohols; \tF - contains unspecified Fragrances; Scroll right for $/oz., $/UVA, $/UVB.\n\n|**TYPE**|**BRAND**|**NAME**|**SPF**|**REAL**|**UVA**|**★**|**PA**|**PPD**|**NC**|**Pb**|**A**|**F**|**GREASY?**|**$/Oz.**|**$/SPF**|**$/UVA**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Stick|Ombrelle|[Face Stick SPF 60 with Mexoryl XL](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/ombrelle-face-stick-spf-60/6000016946893)|60|15|7.3|3|PA+++|7.2|Y|N|N|N|Water Resistant, Company claims it's \"non-greasy\"|$53.33|$3.56|$7.31|\n|Spray|Rocky Mountain|[Quart Spray SPF 50 KIDS Mist](https://www.rmsunscreen.com/sprayquart50kids-single.aspx)|50|10|6|3|PA++|5.7|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Company claims it's \"non-greasy formula\"|$1.33|$0.13|$0.22|\n|Spray|Rocky Mountain|[6-oz Spray SPF 50](https://www.rmsunscreen.com/6ozsprayspf50sunscreen.aspx)|50|10|6|3|PA++|5.7|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Company claims it's \"greaseless\"|$1.67|$0.17|$0.28|\n|Spray|Altruist Dermatologist|[Sunspray SPF 50](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0794VX8R1)|50|10|5.9||||?|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"non greasy\"|$1.92|$0.19|$0.33|\n|Lotion|La Roche-Posay|[Anthelios Xl Ultra-Light Fluid](https://www.shopgator.com/product/la-roche-posay-anthelios-xl-spf-50-ultra-light-fluid/)|50+|10|**14**|5|PA+++|9.3|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Company claims it's \"non-greasy\"|$12.13|$1.21|$0.87|\n|Lotion|Sun Bum|[Original 30 SPF\\*](https://www.amazon.com/Sun-Bum-Sunscreen-SPF-30/dp/B00GO9QER4/)|30|10|6.2|3|PA++|5.6|Y|N|N|**Y**|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"non-greasy\"|$1.88|$0.19|$0.30|\n|Lotion|Sun Bum|[Orignal 50 SPF](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Moisturizing-Sunscreen-Protection-Hypoallergenic/dp/B004XGPM32/)|50|10|6.1|3|PA++|5.7|Y|N|N|**Y**|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"non-greasy\"|$1.88|$0.19|$0.31|\n|Lotion|Sun Bum|[Original 50 Face Lotion](https://www.amazon.com/Sun-Bum-Lotion-Spectrum-Protection/dp/B07B685MFG/)|50|10|6.1|3|PA++|5.7|Y|N|N|**Y**|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"non-greasy\"|$4.33|$0.43|$0.71|\n|Lotion|Avene|[Ultra-Light Hydrating Sunscreen Lotion](https://www.pharmaca.com/avene-ultra-light-hydrating-sunscreen-lotion-spf-50-1-3oz-1)|50+|10|6|3|PA++|5.7|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"not greasy\"|$14.12|$1.41|$2.35|\n|Lotion|La Roche Posay|[Anthelios Clear Skin Oil Free](https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Anthelios-Clear-Skin-Sunscreen/dp/B01A0NT3D6)|60|10|5.9|3|PA++|5.2|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy\"|$11.83|$1.18|$2.01|\n|Lotion|Altruist Dermatologist|[Sunscreen SPF50†](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Altruist-Dermatologist-Sunscreen-SPF-50/dp/B06X6LZWRC)|50|\\~10?|\\~5.9?||||?|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"non greasy\"|$1.45|$0.14|$0.25|\n|Lotion|Bioderma|[Photoderm MAX Lait SPF 50+†](https://www.rakuten.com/shop/perfume-worldwide/product/U-SC-3311/?sku=U-SC-3311)|50+|10|5.9||||Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"leaves skin a bit shiny\"|$7.88|$0.79|$1.34|\n|Lotion|Eucerin|[Sun Fluid Sensitive Protect SPF 50+†](https://store.sweetcare.pt/eucerin-facial-sunscreens-p-002734eu?)|50+|\\~10?|\\~5.9?||||?|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Company claims it's \"non-greasy texture\"|$11.83|$1.18|$2.01|\n|Lotion|Aloe Up|[White Collection 30 SPF](https://www.aloeup.com/shop/white-collection-spf-30-sunscreen-lotion)|30|6|5.6|3|PA++|5.5|Y|N|**Y**|N|Water Resistant, Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Company claims it's \"non-greasy\"|$3.00|$0.50|$0.54|\n|Lotion|BGS|[Black Girl Sunscreen SPF 30](https://blackgirlsunscreen.com/product/black-girl-sunscreen-spf-30/)|30|6|5.4|3|PA++|4.2|?|N|**Y**|N|Silicone/Acrylic Polymer,|$6.33|$1.06|$1.17|\n|Moisture|La Roche-Posay|[Toleriane Double Repair Facial Moisturizer](https://www.thebeautyplace.com/la-roche-posay-toleriane-double-repair-moisturizer-2-5-oz.html)|30|6|6|3|PA++|5.2|Y|N|**Y**|N||$7.87|$1.31|$1.31|\n|Moisture|CeraVe|[Ultra Light Moisturizer + SPF 30](https://www.walmart.com/ip/CeraVe-Ultra-Light-Moisturizing-Face-Lotion-with-SPF-30-1-7-oz/647153722)|30|6|5.4|3|PA++|4.2|Y|N|N|N|Silicone/Acrylic Polymer, Reviews claim it's \"wasn't greasy\"|$8.82|$1.47|$1.63​|\n\n\\* Not sure why, but the SPF 30 tested a higher UVA protection than SPF 50  \n† Doesn’t list % of active ingredients.

        "author": "mxlila",
        "body": "Hi, nice post.\n\nThere are a few details I would like to explain:\n\n* **PA-rating** is NOT related to SPF. PA++ is a PDD between 4 and 8, no matter the stated SPF. **Boots star rating** IS a relative information though (in percentage of SPF; 3 stars is the minimum)\n* **Trolamine** **Salicylate** might get banned, but I've honestly never seen it in any sunscreen. I think it'd be much harder to find one that has it than to list it as a \"bad thing not to have\"\n* **comedogenic ratings** are close to useless. Some individuals might find their skin reacts according to the CosDNA scale or some other, but it's not a general/scientific thing. Products stating to be non-comedogenic can still be comedogenic. There is no regulation or common standard or anything. Btw, **Tocopherol** often gets a higher comedogenic rating, and some people really have to avoid it.\n* Similar with the \"feel\" of a product, though there might be a bit more of consensus. **Acrylates/Silicone Copolymer** usually improve the spreadability of a sunscreen, increasing its protection (which is one of the two major reasons the Sunscreen Simulator tends to underestimate protection). They (the copolymers or acrilates, not the silicone) are also necessary to make a product resistant to sweat and water. I personally prefer such products because they actually tend to feel *less* greasy.  **Methyl Methacrylate** is a common ingredient to encapsulate UV filters, which improves their stability (something Avobenzone and also Octinoxate need). Tinosorb S Aqua (Tinosorb S on steroids) also uses this technology.\n* **Parebens** are not all equal. You may want to avoid them all, your choice, but Methyl- and Ethylparaben are technically not capable of binding to your hormone receptors, so they basically cannot disrupt your hormones. Butyl- and especially Propylparaben are different (longer chains, higher affinity - but still very low; wait for next week when the CIR is releasing their final safety assessment of Parabens, the tentative report is incomplete but the discussions are worth a read if you're interested). They are also the least likely preservative to cause any irritation or reaction in sensitive skin, though there are of course some people who do not tolerate them.\n* As long as the sunscreen doesn't come in an aerosol bottle (which is harmful to the environment, does not provide decent protection, and is dangerous for a large number of ingredients), mentioning ingredients that are **potentially toxic when inhaled** as a con doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Talc, etc etc are all toxic when inhaled at larger quantities, not because the substances themselves are harmful but because the particles have a structure that is specifically dangerous to our lungs. The EU is currently deciding on the danger of TiO2 for that reason alone, we might get some sort of warning on products in the future (in the EU).\n* most people are able to use **Sunflower oil** without any issues. Most non-synthetic and some synthetic substances are potential allergens for some. Not worth to be mentioned imho. **Methylisothiazolinone** for example is banned in the EU for leave-on products due to its high allergenic potential, as with continued use more and more people developed sensitivities to it. But: it is still fine for 95% of the population.\n* whether a sunscreen leaves a **whitecast** or not is actually quite easy to determine. There are only a few ingredients that are visibly white: Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Tinosorb A2B and Tinosorb M. They can be totally invisible on pale/light skin, but easy to sport on deeper tones. If a sunscreen does not contain any of these, it is invisible.\n* The UVA-PF of **Altruist** is 31 for the SPF50, and 23 for the SPF30.\n* Right, as you can see in the Sunscreen Simulator, **UVA-PF** (Europe) and PPD (Asia) are NOT the same. So comparing PA++++ (PPD of 16 or higher) to SPF50 with UVA-circle (UVA+PF of 16.66667 or higher) is a bit sketchy (though we all do it, because we have no other information).\n* I'm a bit surprised about your love for **Avobenzone**. Yes, it provides great UVA protection but it is highly unstable, stings people's eyes and stains your clothes (yellow). Uvinul A Plus is the way to go in my opinion (same pros, no cons). In order to trust Avobenzone you'll want to make sure it is at least stabilized. Ideally by Octocrylene (3.8% of that and Avobenzone barely degrades at all over 8 hours, really the best stabilizer; Oxybenzone is also good, Octisalate and the Tinosorbs are not that powerful). Octinoxate and minerals (TiO2, ZnO) decrease the stability of Avobenzone, unless coated (Avobenzone can also be encapsulated, same goes for Ocinoxate - encapsulated Octinoxate is quite stable, does not penetrate the skin and provides better protection).\n\nOut of curiousity, what is the problem with short chain alcohols? There is a risk of irritation for some people, but that is very individual, not only with respect to the person but also the product.\n\nAnd where did you find the information that PABA will get banned? Does it apply to derivatives? That would surprise me. Ethylhexy Triazone does not pose any substantial risk to human health as far as we know, it's too big to be absorbed into the skin and has thus far has not shown to cause allergic reactions or anything.\n\nThere is a bill suggested in California that proposes the ban of ingredients that are known to be dangerous.  [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill\\_id=201920200AB495](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB495)\n\nAnother suggestion is to look into European (or Asian, though Ocinoxate is extremly popular there) sunscreens.\n\nAnd definitely have a look to Peter's Posts and Excel sheet:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/5w4o0g/sun\\_care\\_mega\\_list\\_of\\_fragrance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/5w4o0g/sun_care_mega_list_of_fragrance/)  and  [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/a1m15a/review\\_comparison\\_of\\_sunscreens\\_with\\_tinosorb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/a1m15a/review_comparison_of_sunscreens_with_tinosorb/)",

        "body": "The sunscreen calculator is considered unreliable. It doesn’t take into account how other filters boost uva protection of others, or the boost from antioxidants and so on.\n\nEwg is as equally unreliable. \n\nYou should look at kind of Stephens website/blog. Probably the best source of info and understandable explainations. Lab muffin is pretty reasonable also. They both also link the research on the supposedly risky avo and at best it shows we would need 277 years of daily all over use to cause any effect on us.\n\nI agree that physical filters on their own are massively over rated. When most of the population can’t wear thick enough layers of them without getting impossible whitecast then they can’t provide the protection advertised on the bottle. I’m also somewhat sick of hearing that physical filters are ideal for sensitive skins- ymmv always applies and I’m sure I’m not the only dry and sensitive skinned person who reacts badly to zinc oxide. Yet I get on great with chemical filters, as long as the base is fragrance free and moisturising. \n\nI think the other issue with sunscreens often not noted is whether they are water resistant or not. Sweating filters off won’t offer protection as advertised.",

Avobenzone needs other filters to stabilize it. Avobenzone by itself degrades so so so much faster without the accompanying stabilizer like tinosorb, mexoryl, uvinul, octocrylene, etc. \n\nAnd avobenzone can't be mixed with uncoated mineral filters as they also can degrade avobenzone.",

I've been looking high and low for a good anti-aging moisturizer that is not ridiculously expensive. The closest thing I can find is Olay's Quench, which has niacinamide - but nothing else really. And I find it greasy feeling. Makeup Artist's Choice has a nice-looking lotion, but it's $25 for 8 oz!!! Yeah that will last me about 2 weeks :(\n\nI don't know why it seems no drugstore companies have thought to put nice things like ceramides, niacinamide and peptides into body lotions. I don't want to have young face/old body!\n\nMy favorite lotion is Lubriderm's Shea and Cocoa Butter Daily Moisture. Here are the ingredients: Water, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Dimethicone, Petrolatum, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Ceteareth-20, DMDM Hydantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium EDTA, Sodium Citrate, Titanium Dioxide, Fragrance, Panthenol, Citric Acid\n\nIs this a crazy idea? Should I just stick with creating my own body lotion with all these goodies from scratch?",

I use Skinactives and they have a lot of info about DIY on their website as well.\n\nYou can also look at Ponds Clarant B3 lotion.

The one I'm using is a Korean one called MODAMODA Zero grey black shampoo. Just started using it a week ago so can't say yet if it works or not!",

idk why but i'd love to know; it's been working pretty well for me as of now and i can't seem to find better alternatives.  \nother days i go in with just **curl up's curl defining cream**. i find that it did an absolutely incredible job when i first started using it (jan - do refer to the pictures) but nowadays (june) i find it makes my curls frizzy and undefined, i experience flash drying while applying the cream, and it just isn't doing it for me anymore for some reason. the clumps seem stringy and loose especially when compared to the more voluminous ringlets i get with arata's products and if i use a larger amount my hair just seems oily. it's got pretty decent hold but doesn't give a cast. previously, i could go for days after using it although not anymore; my hair gets very tangled and full of fairy knots by day four. i would like to mention it contains dmdm hydantoin as well. it does not layer well with my arata products so i don't apply arata's gel after using it.\n\n\\- *deep-conditioning/pre-poo:* once a week or every two weeks i do a diy egg & curd or yogurt mask as well. leaves my hair shiny, soft and with well-defined curls, especially if i use arata products after this process.\n\n***products i used prior to this + experience:***  \n\\- so i sort of realized i had curly hair (as in spirals and ringlets and not straight frizzy hair) after using **ogx's quenching + coconut curls shampoo and conditioner** that my brother ordered for himself. it gave me somewhat defined curls for the first time in my life and made me realize that there were products specific for curly haired ppl. both the shampoo and conditioner worked incredibly well for me but for some reason, i literally haven't been able to find it on amazon or any h&g store in india apart from that one time. moreover, after educating myself a little more on ingredients and such, i do think their ingredient list is a little questionable so ig it was for the best.\n\n  \n\\- i've used **best life's argan nourish conditioner** since i saw desicurly (deepika joshi) recommend it and it's on her amazon store. i would seriously advise against using it. like please do not. it had terrible slip and my hair would literally fall off in clumps when i used this conditioner. it was impossible to detangle hair using it and i thought my hair just wasn't cooperating initially but would get used to it bc it's \"curly-hair/cg friendly\". i finished the entire bottle and had a terrible experience every damn time i used it. spare yourself from it.\n\n\\- i've also used **wow's coconut milk shampoo** and found it pretty trash as well. i usually think that there's not much a shampoo can do to mess up compared to like conditioners and styling products, but this would leave my hair completely stripped, dry, matted and frizzy. would also make it super-prone to massive tangles and gave me hair fall. i've seen a handful of indian curly hair bloggers recommend wow's products but i absolutely hated them.\n\n\\- unfortunately, **wow's coconut & avocado oil conditioner** was terrible as well. it gave me hair fall, had zero slip and i'm honestly convinced that this and **best life's argan nourish conditioner** gave me dandruff. again, seriously advise against it.\n\n***end notes:***  \ni would like to mention that i never had a concerning amount of hair fall until i used some of these shampoos and conditioners and would love to know others have had such experiences as well. i will definitely say i - and i'm positive others w textured hair bc i see my curly haired boyfriend and wavy-haired best friend - have an unbelievably difficult time finding the right products for curly hair in india and have found a lot of the indian curly products average at best - especially bc of the ingredient lists, the pricing not being worth the quality one bit, and also the hair fall sigh. i'm not heavily recommending any of these (only recommending against using the ones that gave me hell) bc so much about all of them is just questionable. to be fair, given india's teeny market for textured hair, it's difficult to source other curly hair-friendly products here though but if anyone's had some luck with good products, please feel free to share! terrible experiences also welcome xD",

We have some information we want to share with you.\n\nDMDM hydantoin is a formaldehyde-releasing preservative that's in some hair and skin products. Most people don't have issues with this, but it is possible to be allergic to formaldehyde, which means you'll [likely](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0536.1988.tb02802.x) also react to DMDM hydantoin. Your doctor or an allergist would be able to confirm this. We obviously don't know if that's what's happening here, but hair loss is a known side effect of allergic reactions that cause contact dermatitis.\n\nFormaldehyde is a known carcinogen, but in tiny amounts in a rinse off product, it's not likely to have a health impact in the grand scheme of things unless you are allergic.\n\nUnlike the DevaCurl allegations, the DMDM hydantoin controversy (and any related lawsuits) is tied to this specific ingredient. If you do happen to have issues with hair loss and DMDM hydantoin, you should consider checking for a formaldehyde allergy just in case, as there are [several other ingredient](https://www.contactdermatitisinstitute.com/formaldehyde.php) you might be sensitive to as well.\n\nIf I'm wrong, I probably just picked up on a keyword in your title (Please ignore me!).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I've been really frustrated with Ultra Defining since going white/silver and finding that with my most recent bottle I've had to use double what I used to and then end up with knotted ends after a day because of all the product or less definition and decided to try something new. My grocery store started carrying Johnny B (my stylist uses this brand for her male clients and on pixie cuts and I've had good experiences with their pomades) so I decided to give it a shot and see if my hair would respond better to it than Deva or at least make it less tangled and stiff on the ends. I did not expect to see my curls looking nearly as tight as they were before I'd bleached it. It's still not 100% and i doubt it will be until it grows out more but it's way better than I was getting before this. \n\nIt's so good, my hair stays super duper soft and doesn't tangle up as badly on day 3-4 like with Deva, and it gives me just as good (maybe better?) definition but definitely far better bounce. My curls just look livelier with this somehow, like not quite as hardly clumped and a bit more \"full\". I also really appreciate it not smelling like candy and having a more neutral and pleasant scent than Deva (I love their stuff but omw the scents can be cloying). It also plays well with my other styling products whereas my Deva gel could get finicky with my KCCC and OGX Bonding-Plex leave in sometimes and leave my hair feeling downright weird one week and then normal the next. But no issues at all with the Johnny B.\n\nIt does however, have the strangest texture I've ever felt in a gel. Probably because of the lanolin in it, but it feels waxy and thick in your hands. I used way too much the first time not expecting it to be so thick, but you seriously only need maybe a quarter sized amount for my chin length bob and it's *plenty*. That's like 1/4th of what I need with DevaCurl. I was afraid when I first tried it that it'd just sit on my hair or never come off my hands but it grabs quite well onto the hair and for me it actually does seem to sink in well and I've never noticed a film or odd texture on my hair once it's dried.\n\nAs far as I can tell it's CG friendly, but the ingredients for those curious are: Water, PVP, Sorbitol, Methylparaben, Carbomer, DMDM Hydantoin, PEG-75 Lanolin, Panthenol, and Fragrance. I imagine some of these would cause buildup for some people but I've not experienced that at all while using this. On me, it comes out just fine with water and my cowash. \n\nAnyone still looking for a good gel or just up to trying something new, I highly recommend it! It's cheap (I paid $10 for my bottle in store, but online is $6 plus whatever shipping is and it lasts quite a while), no super strong scent, and it works well. ",

If you like the way it makes your hair look and feel (and it's not outrageously expensive, because it shouldn't be) that's really what counts.\n\nIt's not necessarily bad (obligatory some people don't like sulfates cleansers, some people avoid heavy silicones) but there's also nothing special or unique about it.  \n\n**Edit**: I just noticed that it has zinc pyrithione in it, which can be a dandruff treatment.  I will check how much z.p. needs to be in a formula to be considered an active (edit: it's 0.3% for the control of dandruff (FDA final monograph [here](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Over-the-CounterOTCDrugs/StatusofOTCRulemakings/ucm111019.pdf), page 6 of the document).  That's plausible.  Not all the clear products seem to follow the labeling laws for OTCs though, and not all of the them even make dandruff-related claims, which might mean they're not all functional dandruff shampoos?  \n\n**OP, could you please give more information as to which shampoo in the Clear Line this is?  Is it being marketed as a Dandruff shampoo? Can you link to it?  I cant quickly find the one that matches the name in your title and the ingredient list in your post.**\n\n**Edit**: Just because it's interesting, Clear is owned by Unilever.  I thought it might be interesting to look at some of Unilever's other brand's products.\n\nHere's Suave Deep Moisture shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Glycerin, Dimethiconol, Fragrance, Carbomer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, TEA Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, PPG 9, Tetrasodium EDTA, TEA Sulfate, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, PEG 45M, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)\n\nYou can see it's pretty similar.  This one doesn't have the dimethicone, but the basic system is very close.\n\nHere's Dove Nutritive Solutions Daily Moisture:\n\n> Water (Aqua), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Glycol Distearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycerin, Dimethicone, Dimethiconol, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Tetrasodium EDTA, Amodimethicone, DMDM Hydantoin, PEG-45M, Tea-Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, Cocamide Mea, Lysine HCI, Arginine, Peg-9M, Cetrimonium Chloride, PPG-9, Propylene Glycol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Red 33 (CI 17200).\n\nAgain, not identical of course, but pretty similar.  The basic sulfate cleanser + silicone is pretty common in \"moisturizing\" shampoos.\n\nIf your product is a real dandruff shampoo, here's a rival: Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Dandruff Shampoo:\n\n> active ingredient: zinc pyrithione 1% inactive ingredients: Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Dimethicone, Cocamide MEA, Zinc Carbonate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Magnesium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Magnesium Carbonate Hydroxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Yellow 5, Red 33, Blue 1\n\nNot identical again (could plausibly expect it to be a stronger cleanser), but same sort of idea.

That could *potentially* cause some problems on the scalp, but there are two caveats to what I'm saying: 1) GHC is pretty low on the ingredients list here, so it might not be enough to interact with the dimethicone to any significant degree 2) I've only read research on this in the context of binding to hair, not skin. I can't say whether or not the action would happen there too.\n\nSo if this is making you happy, then you're probably good to go. Just keep an objective eye on it for a month or two perhaps to see if there's any serious uptick in hair loss or dandruff. Like Hamfan said as well, it likely won't be very gentle to the scalp because of the sodium laureth sulfate, so if your skin is on the sensitive side, that might cause you some dryness and hair fall. \n\nKey word in all this being *might.*",

    "body": "I'm been lurking on this subreddit for several months now, and have been trying to fix my regimen to take better care of my skin.  I'm 24 and I have acne-prone combination skin, with a dehydration problem in the winter (I've been trying to rehydrate my skin for a few months... now that it's summer, I seem pretty oily throughout the day so I don't know if that's been fixed or just masked by the humidity).  I feel like I'm getting more cystic acne - normally just one at a time, and basically everywhere on my face has had one (cheeks, forehead, chin, nose bridge etc.) - along with my regular breakouts.  \n\nAs of right now, in the mornings I'm using CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, then moisturising with the CeraVe cream (in the tub), and using Ombrelle SPF 60 sunscreen (only one I could find that didn't have oxybenzone).  At night, I use Philosophy's microdelivery exfoliating wash, a non-alcohol toner if I wore make up that day, and the Cerave cream again.\n\nI went to the dermatologist yesterday for an unrelated issue I have with pilar cysts.  He asked me if I had any other questions which I wasn't expecting (the whole 1 topic per visit thing) so I mentioned that I have issues with acne.  He asked what I'm using - I told him about CeraVe, then he prescribed Clindoxyl Gel for application at night and Vivier Hexam Cleanser instead, then he sent me out the door.  No explanations of why what he was prescribing is better than what I'm using, or really even how to use the gel.\n\nI'm concerned that he told me to get that specific cleanser since his office sells it, particularly since the ingredients list has fragrance/parfum in it, as well as citric acid.  Does anyone have experience with this cleanser?  I haven't yet purchased it.  This is the whole list:\n\nWater/Eau\n\nDecyl Glucoside\n\nSodium Cocoamphodiacetate\n\nCocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate\n\nPEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate\n\nEthoxydiglycol\n\nDMDM Hydantoin\n\nFragrance/Parfum\n\nHexamidine Diisethionate\n\nCitric Acid\n\nThe other question I had is how would I use the gel he prescribed in combination with my nightly routine.  He didn't specifically say, but I assumed I should be using it all over my face, but I've found online that it says to apply to affected areas - does that mean only where I actually have active acne?  It also seems that I'm supposed to use it after cleansing my face, but how does that work with moisturising?  I take it that applying a moisturiser after this gel would be pointless.  \n\nI do plan on speaking with a pharmacist once I fill the prescription.  Knowing myself, I need to think out the whole issue before I know what questions to ask - otherwise I just walk out and then go.. wait, what?  I hope this doesn't qualify as seeking medical advice.  If it does, I'll remove the post.  I'm just trying to figure all of this out!  Thanks for helping me out!",

        "body": "Quite frankly, listen to your doc. \n\n The gel is a topical antibiotic + BP, which means he believes you have a strong bacterial component to the acne.  Apply after cleansing and before moisturizing, but wait a few minutes in between. \n\n It could be drying, so make sure you're packing on the moisturizer.\n\n The directions for how to use this will be on the tube once you pick it up--it would say something like \"Apply to the affected area X times daily\" if he wants you to ONLY apply it on the problem areas.   If you still have questions, call the office. \n\n\nThe cleanser could be helpful.  Hexamidine diisethionate is a preservative and antiseptic [source[(http://www.minasolve.com/molecules_view.asp?n=17&mi=18).\n\n   Does the office give samples?    If you normally have issues with fragrance, then the cleanser may not work for you. Ask the doctor if he has any other non-drying and fragrance-free antiseptic cleanser recs or even ask your pharmacist. \n\n\n>  I use Philosophy's microdelivery exfoliating wash\n\nStop stop stop stop stop with this, and definitely with the nightly physical exfoliation. \n\n  Active acne + physical exfoliants = bad news. You should see an improvement once you cut this out, actually. Probably a lot less inflammation.",

        "body": "I use Clindoxyl nightly and only apply it to areas that need it, after cleansing. It is drying and it will also stain your clothes and towels so be careful what you get it on. You might want to use an old towel to dry your hands on. Even after washing my hands, there are bleached out spots on my towels.\n\nMy doctor told me I could use it 1 or 2 times per day but I find that 2 would be way too often. Also, if using it every night, I do start to get flaky patches so, if my skin isn't too bad, I switch to once every second night.\n\nHope that helps!",

Please can you point out any products which have questionable/ bad ingredients so I can look for better options? As a newbie it has been hard to figure out the names for all of them so I may have missed some! Be as critical as you can :) For example even if you think a product has excessive alcohol which may make it too drying compared to a similar product.\nThere are a few products here so even help on just one product would be much appreciated!

They may include items that are part of the fragrance, but they are in no way considered to be all that is in it.\n\n/u/gr8divide's is right in saying that 'parfum' is as specific as you're really going to get. Their description of each material there is pretty good, too! Linalool is most closely associated with lavender and other agrestic notes.\n\n- Butylphenyl Methylpropional - Floral. Commonly called Lilial.\n\n- Eugenol - Spicy. Think cloves/cinnamon/nutmeg without any hint of sweetness.\n\nThe rest are diluents, thickeners, volumizers, or whatever else goes into your hair for styling.\n\nYour best bet for reproducing it is getting a friend with a GCMS to do a chemical analysis. Short of that, it's get a trained nose (or get good at it yourself!) to smell it and compare with items close to it.",

Just enjoy the smell of the product.  \n\nAxe we also have companion products that smell the same. They have a lot more listed on their website than they do in stores.

    "body": "I'm a med student, and this is actually bringing back some old memories of undergrad chemistry.  I had a clogged toilet and no plunger.  It was late at night, so I looked for YouTube tutorials on how to unclog a toilet without a plunger.\n\nMost of them said to use warm water and dish soap.  I tried it, and it didn't work.  The water just sat with dish soap in it until I could finally get a plunger this morning.\n\nBut then I realized that my girlfriend had put this toilet bowl cleaner thing in when we first set up the apartment.  It's called Bowl Fresh and is something you just drop into the toilet bowl.\n\nThe dish soap I used was Ajax Triple Action.  The listed ingredients are: Water, Ammonium C12-15 Pareth Sulfate, Lauramidopropylamine Oxide, Sodium Chloride, Poloxamer 124, Fragrance, DMDM Hydantoin, Pentasodium Pentetate, Sodium Bisulfite, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, FD&C Yellow No 6, FD&C Red No. 40.\n\nThe Bowl Fresh thing seems to be a borax based compound.  There are two versions of it.  One with just borax and one with a borax/bleach mixture.  Luckily it seems we just have the borax one.    The listed ingredients are: Sodium sulfate, Sodium tetraborate anhydrous, Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, Sodium chloride, Sodium Carboxymethyl Cellulose, Hydroxyethyl cellulose, Acid Blue 9, Water, Cocamide MEA, Aluminum sulfate anhydrous, Tetrasodium EDTA, Glycols (polyethylene), Citric acid\n\nFrom my old understanding, ammonium sulfate is acidic and can create dangerous chlorine gas when mixed with bleach.  It seems that nothing in the Bowl Fresh is a strong base, so it looks like I may be in the clear.  Can anyone with more chemistry expertise give me some insight?  Do I have toxic chemicals in my air at home now?\n\nThanks so much!",

I use it in my night routine after I was my face with water or with Eucerin ph5 wash bar/ syndet. I do have sensitive skin that hates fragrance in most of the products. I recommend you to try this product by pouring it directly on your face or problematic areas or applying it in your palm and tapping it in with your fingers. When I use cotton pads in general my face gets red. So with this product, I decided to not use them too even if they recommend it so. The product isn't too harsh nor too light. After the application my face isn't stinging nor red. \n\nThis exfoliating toner has a really high efficiency when it comes to vanishing pimples that just started to form (when you feel a tiny bump forming under your skin or a bit of light stinging and redness before the pimple appears). Apply it in this time and it will help a lot, the pimple will dissappear without forming a head or anything similar. At least this is how it  works for me. \n\nAfter the toner, I use Bionike defence aqua spray. Followed by Cosrx Snail mucin essence / Vichy mineral 89 probiotic fractions serum and last Uriage Bariederm Cica cream. Don't make that mistake and use nothing moisturizing after you apply an exfoliating product on your face. Make sure that the essence, serum or moisturizer that you apply after contains no acids but only ingredients that help your skin barrier.\n\nEdit: spelling and additional information",

decided to focus on this topic. i know i've procrastinated far too long but my birthday is next week and its my goal to start a skincare routine by then and to have the best skin i can have by then. here's my issues:\n\ni'm a 16 (soon to be 17) year old girl without a job and living in a low income family. i've been on SCA long enough to know that good skincare isnt cheap,  i don't have the money to but a $15 cleanser. idk why but i've been hesitant about starting a SCR probably because i'm fearful i'll do it wrong or the purging & potential for a product not agreeing with me will be too much to handle. i have a lot of new mini kits that i got for christmas and i thought i'd ask for your guy's reviews on these products (because i haven't seen anyone post on most of these yet) and your recommendations for me on creating a routine with what i currently have instead of going out and buying some the the HG products of this community. \n\nfirst, here's some history of my skin:\ni've known about skincare since i was about 11 from watching yt, before that i had did nothing but let water hit my face in the shower. at first i went to walmart and target trying any product that interested me and was cheap. i never stuck to a routine and to this day i've never consecutively washed my face for more than 5 days. the good news is in the last couple of years i've been educating myself more and watching out for certain ingredients and staying away from harmful products. i know i probably sound crazy to you all but i've never even used sunscreen. thankfully, it seems as if i'm crazy blessed because i've never had bad skin issues or a lot of acne, in the last 2 years though my skin has been the worst i've seen it, i don't really know how to rate it because sometimes i look at my skin and think \"ah its not that bad it's practically clear\" and other times, especially when i'm wearing makeup or in good lighting i'm thinking \"goodness, my skin is awful\". my main issue are blackheads on my nose, texture all over my face especially on my forehead (but pretty much unnoticeable unless you're up close or in good/dim lighting), whiteheads on my chin, and a few persistent zits on my cheeks and a few others that pop up here and there. \n\nnow to the products. i'm going to list all of the products i've accumulated and not used recently, most of them are sample sizes from gift sets. my request is for you to give me a mini review on any of the products you've tried and from the skin issues i've relayed for you to tell me what you'd suggest my routine to be with the products i have. if you need anymore information please let me know, and i apologize if i've one anything wrong or worded things weird i'm new to this site and new to skincare at this level.

Skincare actually doesn’t have to be expensive to be effective. In fact, there are many companies for example, The Ordinary that are making great products that are inexpensive. \n\nYour lucky you don’t really have acne prone skin so here’s the routine I’d recommend to you for blackhead:\n\nAM:\nGentle cleanser - I’d recommend CeraVe ($10.98)  \n\n\nSerum/Acids: For blackheads Id recommend - The Ordinary Niacinimide 10% + zinc 1% as its gentle and is known to un-clog pores. Here, you could alternate and  use The Ordinarys Salicylic Acid 2% Solution.\n\nMoisturizer \n\nSunscreen daily \n\nPm: \n\nCleanse with same gentle cleanser\n\nExfoliate 2-3 times per week - I’d recommend The Ordinary  Glycolic Acid 7% Toner \n\nSerums/Acids: Here you can use either the salicylic acid or Niacinamide again. Or you can use one of these in the morning and one at night but don’t mix them together. \n\nMoisturize",

But I looked up some of the Pacifica and Philosophy products on cosdna.com and the ingredients on those seem fine too. \n\nPersonally, I like to alternate my products a lot but that's because I know they all work for me/ don't break me out. I think the best thing for you would be to pick a cleanser and moisturizer now and then swap them out for your others if it's not working for you. \n\n**Cleanser** (Morning and night, pick one to start with, then swap it out for another one. If none of them cause breakouts, you can just alternate which one you use)   \n\n- e.l.f. daily face cleanser w/ purified water\n- philosophy purity made simple (this one is moisturizing)\n- fresh soy face cleanser (this one is mild and a good one to start with)\n\n**Deep Cleanser** (I would probably only use this 1-2 a week in place of your regular cleanser because they seem more harsh on your skin. I would wait to start these after you get used to a daily cleanser)  \n\n- pacifica kale detox deep cleaning face wash\n- purity the microdelivery exfoliating facial wash\n\n**Serum**\n\n- caudalie vinoperfect radiance serum \n\n**Moisturizers** (Pick one and use it morning and night) \n\n- pacifica dreamy youth day and night face cream\n- philosophy renewed hope in a jar (this one has great reviews, maybe start here)\n- caudalie vinosource moisturizing sorbet \n\n**Occlusive** (use this at night for dehydrated skin, damaged moisture barrier)  \n\n- Vaseline (You might already had this at home so you don't have to buy more things)\n- Facial oil (if you have olive oil, sunflower seed, argan oil, jojoba oil, etc, it might be a good place to start.) \n\n**DIY Masks** (You can make nice masks with stuff you might already have at home)  \n\n- Ground up oatmeal + honey + yogurt/milk. This makes my skin really moisturized and glowy. \n- plain yogurt or milk makes my skin look brighter and less dull\n- honey + green tea leaves\n- Turmeric powder. Add this to any of the above masks for a nice glow to your skin. (Skip if you're very pale because it might be too yellow) \n\n**Products to Try in the future**\n\n- Stridex pads in red box. It's ~$7 and the salicylic acid will help with your minor acne problems. \n- Sunscreen   \nI would highly recommend getting sunscreen or start wearing ball caps if you're out in the sun. You're young, but sun damage can really exacerbate all skincare issues down the road.",

This [website](https://www.dandruffdeconstructed.com/formaldehyde-free-dandruff-shampoos/) talks about it in more detail and it lists DMDM Hydantoin as a formaldehyde releaser, which I know is currently the subject of a class action lawsuit. I checked my Nizoral and keto shampoo bottles and while they don't have DMDM in them, they must have another form of the releaser. The derm recommended that I use something completely free of possible allergens, so they said I should try a shampoo called Free & Clear with zinc. \n\nHas anyone else heard this from their dermatologist? It's frustrating because I've been using these shampoos for about a year because they were prescribed from another hair loss derm.

I still had a bottle with the old packaging, so I compared the ingredients list to see if formula had been changed as well, and yes, it has.\n\nHere is the ingredients list for the *old* formula:\n\nWater/Eau, Laureth-23, Polyquaternium-4, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Benzyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Aminomethyl Propanol, DMDM Hydantoin, Fragrance/Parfum, Acrylates Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ecklonia Radiata Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n\nHere is the ingredients list for the *new* formula:\n\nWater, Laureth-23, Polyquaternium-4, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Ecklonia, Radiata Extract, Fragrance, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Benzyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate, Copolymer, Aminomethyl Propanol, DMDM Hydantoin, Acrylates Copolymer, Disodium EDTA\n\nBoth formulas have identical ingredients, so the new formula is still CG friendly, but the order of the ingredients has changed. In the old formula, the aloe leaf and Australian sea kelp extracts and jojoba oil were the last three ingredients. In the new formula, the extracts and jojoba oil have moved to the top of the ingredients list after the first three ingredients, which are the same in both formulas (water, laureth-23, and polyquaternium-4).\n\nFor reference, I took a photo of both bottles side-by-side, [front](https://imgur.com/72OIjeF) and [back](https://imgur.com/NFD47G7). Old packaging is on the left, new packing on the right. If you can't view the images, the old packing was in a mostly transparent tube, and the new packaging is solid purple. Both bottles claim 20 hour \"maximum\" hold. The size of the bottle has remained the same (7 oz).\n\nI haven't had the chance to test out new formula yet, so I can't attest to how the performance has changed. I did squirt out about a dime-sized amount for a quick comparison, though. The texture, consistency, and fragrance seems to be the same. This has been my HG gel for years now, I've even recommended it several times on this sub, and I'm really hoping that the reformulation doesn't drastically affect how it performs on my hair. If is drastically different and doesn't give me as much hold as the old formula, I'm going to be very disappointed and will probably have to start looking for a new gel. I'll try to post a full review of the new formula once I have an opportunity to really test it out.\n\nHas anyone used the new formula yet? What do you think about it?",

This is the first time in months my skin got so bad and I really want to understand why. Apologies for the wall of text.\n\nI am very new with Asian Beauty in general but there was one time I bought a whole regimen from The Face Shop's acne line and used every single product that night. That was many moons ago when I was young and ignorant about skincare.\n\nAnyway, the link above is my current situation and below is my current regimen.\n\nSkin profile: combo/oily/dehydrated | Country: Philippines; humid | Top skin concern: For now, just getting rid of the ccs because I've never had a cluster of ccs concentrated on my lower face region before.\n\n**Routine**\n**Morning:**\n*Celeteque Hydrating Facial Wash (I feel tightness around my cheeks and nose area after use and I've been using this thing for half a month. Also, the reason I tried this even tho it has SLS was because it's included in the Cleanser pH list with a pH level of 5.5)\n>Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Sodium Lactate, Panthenol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Lactic Acid, Disodium EDTA, Chamomilla recutita (Chamomile) Extract, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Masking Agent, Bisabolol, Butylated Hydroxytoluene, CI 19140, CI 16035 \n*Benzac 10% BP (I use it only when I'm not using CosRx)\n*Biore UV Perfect Milk\n\n**Night**\n*Oil Cleanse with J&J Baby Oil (please do not judge me I am an asian ignorant to the ways of Asian Beauty. I actually used Human<3Nature's 100% Pure Sunflower Oil before, which I love, but I wanted to try a cheaper alternative. Never doing that again.)\n*2nd Cleanse with Celeteque Hydrating Facial Wash\n*and I just added CosRx Returning A-Sol (used every other day) two weeks ago.\n\n**Some notes:** I'm thinking that maybe stress contributed to the formation of CCs? Because the week I got the CCs and acne was a very stressful time at work plus shark week came early. I know I always get acne when I'm stressed and on my period but this is the first time I got this much CCs at the same time. \n\nAny product recommendations and routine advice is much appreciated.",

Over doing acne products can really cause flakiness, I think your best bet is to scale back and start over with \"gentle and moisturizing\" in mind. Snails are a good start, I can't recommend Cosrx snail cream high enough mainly because it's very hydrating without being greasy and fragrance free and amazing price. You could be purging from your oil cleanse snafu and might just have to ride that out. Avoid the temptation to pick at them!\n\nI am a big believer in frequent masking, I wasn't always and thought it was too indulgent but it really has helped to nearly eradicate redness, dry patches, scabby texture with a routine that layers on mild moisturizing gels and lotions. \n\nAs with any large scale skin issues, best to get a dermatologist's opinion.

        "body": "Pinay here as well so I feel you pain on the humidity.\n\nFirst, I think the Celeteque Hydrating Facial is very drying and I also felt a certain level of tightness after using it before. I'd rather use a well formulated facial wash that has a higher Ph than use one that gives me that tight feeling. That being said though the Safeguard Derma Sense for Sensitive Skin has a 5.5 Ph, together with the Skinklens of Watsons (Cetaphil Dupe), and Hydrating Creamy Wash of Human Nature.\n\nOil cleansing, sometimes is a matter of finding the right oil for you. I also went the baby oil route in the beginning and it was just terrible. The HM Sunflower Oil didn't work for me either, what did was the Skinfood Black Sugar Cleansing Oil and the Kose Deep Cleansing Oil, Skinfood is available locally if you ever want to try that. It's just easier using a cleansing oil that emulsifies rather than one like baby oil that you have to wipe off of something that doesn't fully washes off like the HM Sunflower Oil.\n\nAnother thing is you need to moisturize, I know it's really humid and sometimes moving a floor up the heat really punches you in the face. But you need to find one that absorbs well and doesn't make you feel gross. The Celeteque Hydrating Moisturizer is something I like and it absorbs pretty fast. Other days I like using the CosRx Snail Essence or Cream, they both absorb really well and I have oily skin.\n\nOn the CC problem, the only thing that really helped me with that was BHA, AHA and Tretinoin. The Asol is great, but only for spot treatment of acne. I'm not saying you need to pile on the actives, but it's really helpful to have atleast one. No cleanser is going to do that for you. I use the CosRx BHA and AHA, and Derm-A Tretinoin from  Watsons. If I could only choose one active, I'd say AHA for your CCs.",

        "body": "The other users have already given very helpful comments and I agree with them. I just thought of chiming in :) \n\nI like the Safeguard Derma Sense for Sensitive Skin that /u/littlemissdayap mentioned. It leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized. If you want to replace your current facial wash, I suggest trying that Safeguard one out.\n\nFor cleansing oil, you may want to try Biore's Cleansing Oil (which is available at Watsons for only 299pesos) or the ones from Nature Republic. \n\nThe percentage of Benzoyl Peroxide you're using (10%) is high and it can be really drying. You may want to use the 5% instead. I was going to say 2.5% BP but we don't have that formulation here in the PH. Also, BP is good for spot treating inflamed or huge pimples. Although it has some comedolytic activity, it's much better as an antibiotic. \n\nTo get rid of and to prevent closed comedones, exfoliation is key. BHAs are superior to AHAs in getting rid of comedones because BHAs are oil-soluble so they can penetrate deep into the pore and unclog it. AHAs are good for exfoliating the top layer of the skin. AHAs will help prevent your pores from getting clogged and it will also help lighten hyperpigmentation. AHAs also have humectant properties so now that your skin is still dry and flaky, I believe it would be good for you. A combination of BHA and AHA would be most beneficial, I think. Of course a retinoid like Tretinoin would be best but I'm just not comfortable suggesting it to you even if surprise surprise it's a non-prescription drug here in the PH. :)\n\nI also think that it would be best if you saw a dermatologist. I mean, you can opt for more affordable products and have a professional closely assess your skin and maybe perform comedone extraction or acid peels. :)",

In humid weather you'll be better off with a hydrating toner and some light moisturizer. Ceracolla lotion is a bit heavier than Hada Labo lotion, but ceramides are awesome for dehydrated skin, because they help rebuild skin barrier. There are many light, gel moisturizers out there, you just need to choose your star ingredient: snails, green tea, aloe, propolis?

I've read a lot about Aloe, and am thinking about trying it. But it seems that everyone recommends making their own, or mention using 100% without alcohol.\n\nUnder my counter, I have the ocean potion 100% pure aloe gel with:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Juice, Citrus Aurantium Amara (Orange) Oil, Acrylates/C10 30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 20, DMDM Hydantoin, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, FD&C Yellow 5 Aluminum Lake, FD&C Blue 1 (CI 42090), Fragrance\n\nNow, I understand that it is not really natural and fresh aloe juice/gel would be best, but would the ingredients here harm my hair? \n\nAlso, would using aloe gel be similar to using conditioner? I'm worried since the conditioner only method dried my hair out. \n\nThanks!",

However, there are potential health risks, though widely overblown when it comes to its inclusion in haircare products. \n\nDMDM hydantoin does release a small amount of formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is a carcinogen in large quantities. However, there's usually only a very small amount of DMDM hydantoin in haircare products in the first place, as its primary use is as a preservative. \n\nSome individuals may have skin sensitivity (and associated side effects) to DMDM hydantoin. But, that statement is true of basically every molecule out there. Reactions are very individual and you should not avoid it on this basis unless you know empirically that you have a sensitivity to it or a very similar molecule.",

Most people don't have issues with this, but it is possible to be allergic to formaldehyde, which means you'll [likely](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0536.1988.tb02802.x) also react to DMDM hydantoin. Your doctor or an allergist would be able to confirm this. We obviously don't know if that's what's happening here, but hair loss is a known side effect of allergic reactions that cause contact dermatitis.\n\nFormaldehyde is a known carcinogen, but in tiny amounts in a rinse off product, it's not likely to have a health impact in the grand scheme of things unless you are allergic.\n\nUnlike the DevaCurl allegations, the DMDM hydantoin controversy (and any related lawsuits) is tied to this specific ingredient. If you do happen to have issues with hair loss and DMDM hydantoin, you should consider checking for a formaldehyde allergy just in case, as there are [several other ingredient](https://www.contactdermatitisinstitute.com/formaldehyde.php) you might be sensitive to as well.\n\nIf I'm wrong, I probably just picked up on a keyword in your title (Please ignore me!).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think after about three weeks my skin looks better in the mornings when I wake up. The problem is I take a shower, using luke warm water as to not overly dry myself, but I come out with the most horrible dry face. I have to apply the moisturizing lotion three times before I my face is not dry. Because of this in less than an hour I look like an oil slick all over my face. I have also noticed some days I am a bit of a tomato face. \n\nMy questions are this; 1) Is this because of the Moisturizing Lotion not being right for facial use? 2) Would switching to the CeraVe Moisturizing Cream cause the same oil slick results, or should I go back to using the Lubriderm. \n\nFor Science, here are the ingredient lists.\nLubriderm Men’s 3-in-1 Fragrance-Free Lotion\nWater, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Potassium Lactate, Copper Gluconate, Zinc Gluconate, Magnesium Aspartate, Sodium Citrate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Petrolatum, Ethylhexlglycerin, Carbomer, Ceteareth-20, DMDM Hydantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide.\n\nCeraVe Moisturizing Cream\nPurified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.

        "body": "Stridex can be very drying and could be the cause of the excessive dryness. It also contains fragrance and menthol, which are problematic for many. You might want to try cutting back to 3x/week or less, but it's possible the Stridex just isn't the right chemical exfoliant for you. AHAs are typically recommended over BHAs for dry skin (Stridex contains salicylic acid, a BHA). Topping your moisturizer with an occlusive (e.g. Vaseline) overnight is great for particularly dry patches. If cutting out the Stridex doesn't resolve the dryness, you may need a heavier duty moisturizer (such as the Cerave Moisturizing Cream).",

I no longer left a trail of white snow behind me. Selenium sulfide was the way to go.\n\nAnd then, I found out awful news. I am allergic to formaldehyde. Turns out, all Selsun products contain a formaldehyde derivative ( DMDM Hydantoin ) so I had to stop using it to prevent further allergic reactions. \n\nHowever, the only alternative shampoo I could find that uses selenium sulfide as the active is the Vichy Dercos shampoo which works, but if I can find a cheaper alternative I wouldn't mind at all (18$CAD for ~250ml). Does anyone know of any other selenium sulfide options available (in Canada) I could use?",

    "body": "For your reference, my skin type is sensitive and acne-prone. All the products I use and review here are completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no “natural” fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus, etc ). So here we go: \n\n**BEST**: \n\n1. **Acne.org cleanser**: this is my HG face cleanser that I have repurchased so many times. No matter how many products I try over the years, I always come back to this because it’s cost effective, works well without drying out my skin, and does not leave a residue behind. It has a gel texture and come in a pump bottle which make it super convenient to use. \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, PEG-150 Distearate, Sodium Laureth 13 Carboxylate, Disodium Cocamphodiacetate, Butylene Glycol, Sage Extract, Cucumber Extract, White Oak Bark Extract, Panthenol, Allantoin, Acrylates Copolymer, Methylgluceth-20, Polysorbate-20, Quaternium-15, DMDM Hydantoin, Disodium EDTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Face Cleanser:** This cleanser is one of my recent discovery and I like it a lot. It’s a little more pricey than the [Acne.org](http://acne.org/) cleanser, but it works well and is gentle on the skin. It comes in a tube which makes it convenient for travel. \n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Hydrogenated Coconut Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Stearyl Alcohol, Allantoin,  Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopherol, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Sodium PCA, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Maltodextrin,  Tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. **Soon Jung pH 5.5 Foam Cleanser:** This is a Korean product. It comes in a tube and does cleanse well, doesn’t over dry, and leaves no residue behind. Overall, this is a good cleanser. If you are looking for a good Korean water based cleanser, I would recommend this one. This would be best for people with normal to oily skin, IMO.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water / Aqua / Eau, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Coco -betaine, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Madecassoside\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WORST**: \n\n1. **Hada Labo Goku-jyun Foaming Face Wash:** This is probably the worse cleanser out of everything I tried in a long time. I decided to purchase this product to try because I like the oil cleanser from Hada Labo, but this one is a total let down! This cleanser come in a pump bottle, which makes it easy to dispense the product, but that’s the only pro. Now the cons: This foam cleanser does not cleanse well. For me, It’s too gentle on the skin, leave a greasy residue on my skin and made me break out. I believe the greasy feeling is due to the Vaseline in the formula. I think this cleanser will only work for people with dry to very dry skin, but even if you have dry skin, there are so many other better cleansers out there. Those of you with oily, acne-prone or combo skin, this product will be a disaster! So stay away!\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, BG, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, PEG-8, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide DEA, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium Taurine Cocoyl Methyltaurate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate(Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), **Vaseline**, Citric Acid, Polyquaternium-7, EDTA-2Na, BHT, Methylparaben\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SO-SO:**\n\n1. **Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser:** This is another Korean product. It comes in a pump bottle and is very convenient to use. However, this is a very average cleanser. It’s not the worst, but not the best either. It works and is gentle on the skin, but there’s nothing wow worthy about it. Also, there’s nothing it does that the other cleansers I mention above cannot do. I won’t be repurchasing this one. \n\n**Ingredients:**  Water, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola) Extract, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Glycine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Aspartic Acid, Protease, Leucine, Alanine, Lysine, Arginine, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Proline, Valine, Isoleucine, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Histidine, Cysteine, Methionine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Potassium Benzoate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Trioleate",

None of these leave my skin dry or tight. \n\n* **Simple Hydrating Cleansing Oil** - this is very nice for such a cheap product. My HG until I tried out fancier stuff. For drier and dehydrated skin that isn't acne prone, you could use this as a single cleanse. I have all winter. \n\n* **Clinique Take The Day Off Balm** - I got this as a sample pot and it's really cosmetically elegant. Lathers up beautifully. Very satisfying to use. Single cleanse works for me. \n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Radiance cleansing balm** - this is so fancy! Unlike the Clinique, it turns straight to an oil texture when you rub it in. I prefer that the Clinique is a slightly thicker texture when you rub it in personally but I'm trying a fermented skincare routine which is why I bought it. The packaging is amazing - it comes with a spatula in a little compartment in the lid! I'm not sure it emulsifies as well as the Clinique so I double cleanse my T-zone to be safe. \n\n* **Simple Refreshing Gel face wash** - very nice, good second cleanser. Cheap but effective. Also Fungal Acne safe according Folliculitis Scout but please check yourself. I use this as my second cleanser on my T-zone and my sole cleanser on my neck/upper chest.",

I was preparing for a garage sale and included in the odds and ends she gave me to sell was an unopened bottle of Wen Finishing Treatment Crème. Was not expecting much but HOLY CRAP I've never used anything like it (and I'm a hair product junkie). Be warned, this product does contain a silicone, although it's one less prone to building up-You can wash it out without using a sulfate shampoo. If you avoid them 100% this isn't for you. \n\n**Basic Info**\n\nIt's not a styling product and the label says it's \"designed to be used on dry, styled hair.\" It also claims to \"add body to all hair types and will give you definition, separation, and texture or a smooth, polished finish.\" \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol (Plant \nDerived), Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Aminopropyl Phenyl \nTrimethicone, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, VP/DMAPA Acrylates Copolymer, \nBehenyl Alcohol, Pomegranate Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract, Wild \nCherry Fruit Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Pomegranate Oil, \nChamomile Leaf Extract, Marsh Mallow/Althea Extract, Goji Berry Fruit Extract, Abyssinian Oil, Acai Fruit Extract, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), White Tea Leaf Extract, Sweet Almond Oil, Marigold Flower Extract, Sunflower Seed Extract, Palm Oil, Soluble Collagen (Marine Kelp), Arginine (L-Arginine), Aspartic Acid (L-Aspartic Acid), Glycine (Naturally Derived), Alanine (L-Alanine), Serine (L-Serine), Valine (L-Valine), Proline (L-Proline), Threonine (L-Threonine), Isoleucine (L-Isoleucine), Phenylalanine (L-Phenylaline), Histidine (L-Histidine), Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Polyquaternium-37, Polysorbate-60 (Plant Derived), Propylene Glycol, Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Cetyl Hydroxyethylcellulose, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, DMDM Hydantoin, Glycerin (Plant Derived), Disodium EDTA, Sodium PCA, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Sodium Lactate, PCA, Fragrance, Citric Acid (Naturally Derived), Methylisothiazolinone\n\n**Price** \n\nI didn't buy it, but it appears to retail for $22 for the 2oz size and $36 for 4oz. Can probably be found cheaper on eBay. \n\n**Where to Buy**\n\nMy mom buys all her Wen from QVC. My Google search shows you can also buy it from the Wen/Chaz Dean website, a Guthy-Ranker (infomercial) website, Amazon, and eBay. \n\n**How To Use**\n\nBottle says to use a dime sized amount and apply it to dry hair. I squished it into my dry hair. The package says to use after drying and styling. \n\n**Pros** \n\n*It honestly gave instant volume to my hair! Of all the claims on the package, volumizing was the last one I expected to be real. I'm still trying to figure out how applying a cream to my dry hair gave it volume. It doesn't even make fucking sense. \n\n\n*Decreased frizz. I mean really. Did anyone else know there was a product you could apply to your hair after it frizzed up to make it smoother? I didn't know this was possible. \n\n\n*It totally refreshed my hair. I went out in pouring rain, which flattened and frizzed my hair something terrible. Then I applied the cream, and BOOM, it looked like I had just washed, plopped, and diffused it. \n\n\n*Smells fantastic, not overpowering at all. \n\n\n*Added texture and tightened curls.\n\n\n*Very little product is needed so one tube goes a long way.\n\n\n*Super easy to use. \n\n\n**Cons**\n\n*It didn't 100% eliminate the frizz (but I mean really I applied it to rain soaked hair on a humid day and it got rid of some frizz which is a miracle in my book). \n\n\n*It didn't moisturize like it claimed. It make my hair look fantastic, but it definitely didn't add any moisture. \n\n\n*The price is a bit high (but the tube should last a long time), and you can only buy it online. \n\n**Overall**\n\nI have never used anything like this. I've tried adding conditioner to my dry hair to refresh my curls, or spraying with a mix of water/oil. This is so much better. The most amazing part was that it added volume! I don't know how, but seriously, I applied a dime sized amount to my long 2c-3a dense, medium thickness, hair, and it gave me volume like I've never seen. I'd rate this a 9/10 and will absolutely be buying a tube when the one I have runs out. ",

Worth taking a trip when you have a couple of hours to yourself and the curlsbot open on your phone.\n\nThere's a Canadian version of the wiki here [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/3/d/e/2PACX-1vTbVtl5RKQyRwtOlctXVt4f8HovDNVjRUkXBMt3l\\_DpnkSS0Q-wQ3d77\\_nf20EJ2yPEFpsuvb6Aa52c/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/3/d/e/2PACX-1vTbVtl5RKQyRwtOlctXVt4f8HovDNVjRUkXBMt3l_DpnkSS0Q-wQ3d77_nf20EJ2yPEFpsuvb6Aa52c/pubhtml#) if you click Canada at the top; it's definitely not everything we can get here but the products on it will be at least CG approved if you're having a hard time finding stuff on your own.\n\nAll the Devacurl stuff is available at beauty supply outlets around here, so if you do decide to go that route (do not really recommend because of pricing here) check out some of those places. They're all around $40-$50 per item from what I've found. (paid $36 plus tax for the Wavemaker a couple of months ago).",

        "body": "Beep boop! It looks like you're asking about or discussing DMDM hydantoin. We have some information we want to share with you.\n\nDMDM hydantoin is a formaldehyde-releasing preservative that's in some hair and skin products. Most people don't have issues with this, but it is possible to be allergic to formaldehyde, which means you'll [likely](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0536.1988.tb02802.x) also react to DMDM hydantoin. Your doctor or an allergist would be able to confirm this. We obviously don't know if that's what's happening here, but hair loss is a known side effect of allergic reactions that cause contact dermatitis.\n\nFormaldehyde is a known carcinogen, but in tiny amounts in a rinse off product, it's not likely to have a health impact in the grand scheme of things unless you are allergic.\n\nUnlike the DevaCurl allegations, the DMDM hydantoin controversy (and any related lawsuits) is tied to this specific ingredient. If you do happen to have issues with hair loss and DMDM hydantoin, you should consider checking for a formaldehyde allergy just in case, as there are [several other ingredient](https://www.contactdermatitisinstitute.com/formaldehyde.php) you might be sensitive to as well.\n\nIf I'm wrong, I probably just picked up on a keyword in your title (Please ignore me!).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "body": "So, to start things off: I have curly, low-porosity hair that's on the coarse side, and although I love my curls at times I've been really wanting to experiment with doing a silk press. Of course, I want to make sure I won't be damaging my hair in the process or ruining my curls, so I've been doing my research and looking around for my holy grail heat-protectant - one that can tolerate high-heat (around 425 F), has water-soluble silicones, no proteins, and no drying alcohols. I've already found a heat-protectant that I plan on trying soon (Discover Found Avocado Oil Heat Protectant Spray), however I'm still looking for a hydrating, heat-protectant leave-in conditioner to use prior to blow-drying. It's been a long search, and although I haven't found the perfect product I think I've come close enough with some of these. I'm open to some exceptions, such as using Amodimethicone because from my understanding it creates a thin film over the hair, doesn't build on top of itself, and mainly builds in damaged areas in the cuticle. Proteins are something I'd highly prefer to avoid as my hair seems to like getting as much moisture as it can get, but in really small quantities I may be fine. Also trying my best to avoid drying alcohols. So with all that in mind, I'd love to get some second-opinions on these products and which would be the best fit for what I'm looking for. I've left some notes on these, so I hope that won't confuse anyone lol. Any other product suggestions would be highly appreciated.

None of my hair has ever been bleached, dyed, or chemically straightened, and I have used heat on it exactly once in the few years it's been since I shaved it all off. My scalp tends to be oily, and I get mild flakes which I've used T-Gel to combat for most of my life. \n\nMy current routine is a weekly shampoo with SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Shampoo, and daily/every-other day co-wash with either SE Strawberry or HE Freesia. Plop for 15-30 minutes (I get distracted), sometimes use some Raw Shea & Cupuaçu Frizz Defense Styling Gel-Cream when it's damp.\n\nI'm wondering what ingredients are different to make me enjoy using SE, and dislike using HE. I can't actually *see* any difference on the days I use one or the other (so I should probably use HE for a week or two and see if there's a visible difference) but the texture, slip, and feel of HE is much nicer in my hair. \n\nComparing the ingredients with the copy&paste website, SE has Propylene Glycol as \"approved with caution\" and Cetyl Alcohol  as \"approved\". HE has Hydrolyzed Keratin, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, and Panthenol as \"approved with caution\" and Cetyl Alcohol and Stearyl Alcohol as \"approved\"\n\n\n\n. | Approved | Approved with caution\n---|---|----\nSuave Essentials | Cetyl Alcohol | Propylene Glycol\nHerbal Escapes | Cetyl Alcohol  | Propylene Glycol\n. | Stearyl Alcohol | Glycerin\n. | . | Hydrolyzed Keratin\n. | . | Panthenol\n\nSo, in an ideal world, this would mean that Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Keratin, or Panthenol are what is making the V05 feel icky. \n\nI have a feeling it isn't that simple.\n\nIf I could put this under a cut, I would, but this is V05 Herbal Escapes *Water (Aqua, EAU), Cetyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Glyceryl Stearate, DMDM Hydantoin, Linalool, Disodium EDTA, Citronellol, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Ext.

    "body": "After using the OGX nourishing coconut milk shampoo consistently for a month, I began to notice an increase in hair quantity accumulating by the drain. At first I assumed I was starting to go bald but after doing some research on the OGX products I learned about the class-action lawsuit and the affect that DMDM hydantoin has on hair loss. Although I did not find that particular preservative on the ingredients list of the bottle I have been using, I have determined that this kind of shampoo has been leaving me with a dry/itchy scalp and has caused significant hair loss. My questions is, after reading about this on several threads and for the people who have had a similar experience using OGX products, did your hair regrow and return to what it was once you stopped using OGX? I am concerned my hair will never return to the state it was in prior to using this shampoo. Have I done permanent irreparable damage?",

    "body": "I'm 22 and I had seriously bad pizza face until early this year. I started reading EVERYTHING on here and bought a lot of stuff and IT WORKED!!! It was mainly tretinoin that worked like magic :)\n\nSo, now, I rarely get zits - maybe two or three once a month. My main concern is this weird texture...not sure how to describe it and it doesn't even show up well in pictures. I've got pores on my cheeks and orange peel-y weirdly textured (it's not smooth and flat like I want it to be) skin in that area. It's NOT severe at all but it really bothers me 'cause when I apply foundation/mousse or any makeup it looks weird and I look old :( Again, I show up normal in pictures.\n\nHow do I fix this? Here's the full list of products I have:\n\n1. Tretinoin microsphere gel 0.04%\n2. Azelaic acid 20%  micronised gel\n3.

I only JUST purchased it though and I've only used it about five times. I'm looking into getting a glycolic acid peel OR microdermabrasion - but I've heard that microderm's effects are only temporary??? SO confused. Please help!\n",

I'm not sure how to tell if it also has zero sulfates. I got the coconut version and the ingredient list is:\n\nWater,\nCetyl Alcohol,\nCetrimonium Chloride,\nParaffinum Liquidum,\nQuaternium-18,\nCetearyl Alcohol,\nPolysorbate 60,\nStearyl Alcohol,\nGlycerin,\nFragrance,\nCoconut Oil,\nCoconut Fruit Extract,\nSweet Almond Fruit Extract,\nOlive Leaf Extract,\nCitric Acid,\nDMDM Hydantoin,\nMethylchloroisothiazolinone,\nMethylisothiazolinone\n\nI don't know enough about these ingredients to know if this is really curly hair friendly (liquid paraffin?) so can someone help me out? I've used it twice so far and like the curl definition, softness and lack of frizz I'm getting but don't want to keep using it if it will dry my hair out over time.\n\nWeirdly, the packaging on what I thought was the [main product site](http://www.dunaturals.com/nude/) is completely different from the version I have, plus the product items (a coconut conditioner). Is there another Down Under Natural's company? Or, do I have an old version of a product that is no longer being produced? So many questions... Help me out Reddit!\n\nEdit - punctuation",

Before I started to really look into skincare, I’ve used Fruit of the Earth 100% aloe vera gel to moisturize my face. I have combination skin but it’s more oily than dry. I don’t know if this is relevant but I’m a 19 year old female living in Florida. Anyways, are the ingredients in this product bad for my skin? I’ve tried to look it up but I can’t seem to find an answer. I enjoy using it because it’s very lightweight and my skin absorbs it pretty fast without any residue being left behind. I’ve tried using the cetaphil moisturizing lotion before because I’ve heard great things about it but it left a residue and left my face feeling pretty greasy. The fruit of the earth 100% aloe vera gel seems nice but I don’t know enough about skincare to know if it’s actually bad for my skin or not (like in terms of ingredients) and I don’t hear about anyone else using it as a moisturizer. So I’m just wondering if any of you guys, who are much more knowledgeable than me about skin care and the ingredients, can help.\n\nthe ingredients listed are:\nAloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Triethanolamine, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea.",

So I bought Smooth Hydration Argan Oil & Shea Butter shampoo, conditioner, and the curl enhancing yogurt. \n\nI love the smell, I love the texture, and I love my curls! My only problem is that the yogurt does not enhance my second day curls, and I'm noticing more frizz than when I previously co-washed with Tresseme products. \n\nUnfortunately, I can't get the \"Search ingredients - what do they do? Are they bad for my hair?\" link on the sidebar to work, and \"Search for product reviews, ingredients, etc\" does not have this particular formula. Has anyone else tried these products?

Two of those Organix products you listed have Dimethicone, which is a silicone.  Can't tell if the shampoo is ok but I have checked a few Organix shampoos at my local drugstore and I found a few with sulfates.  \n\nYes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo is also listed there but has sulfates.  I found out after I've been using it for almost 2 months :(.  The YTC conditioner is ok though. There is also a Garnier Fructis that I made the mistake of buying but thankfully I verified the ingredients before using it.  \n\nThat \"search ingredients\" link is sadly another site that hasn't been maintained for a while :(\n\nIf you need product recommendations, try the pinned post at the top of this subreddit and scroll towards the bottom for the product recommendations.  There is also a product recommendation link at the sidebar in /r/haircarescience.  But before you buy, google the ingredients just in case the manufacturer changed ingredients",

However, on your ingredients list I would put the 1% mark at Triethanolamine. TEA is primarily used in cosmetics as a pH adjustor, so it would be unusual for it to be present at greater than a 1% concentration. Just ahead of TEA on the ingredients list is the emulsifier Polysorbate 20, and it's a safe bet that's present at greater than 1%. So I would guess TEA and everything below it on the ingredients list is used at less than 1%. Note that anything present <1% may be listed in random order; that's permitted under US and EU labeling regulations.\n\nSome of these ingredients will probably not be available from suppliers that serve the DIY/maker market, so you may need to figure out substitutions. Again, I don't know much about hair products, but I know POI has lots of hair product formulas and advice, so you won't go wrong using it as a resource.",

Furthermore, what is the reasoning behind Bona only?\n\nYou have to work 4x as hard to get floor clean with it and it isn't like it has been around forever so people had to be using something before that, right?\n\nThanks so much for any advice, information, or product suggestions.",

However, unilever had a previous lawsuit for a suave keratin product back in 2012 also related to DMDM hydantoin. The lawsuit was upheld and they recalled the product. Idk seems fishy to me lol",

    "body": "So hey! First post here after a few months of lurking around gathering some information. I've decided that its about time that I build up a real skincare routine. \nUntil now, the only product i have been using is a local \"industrial\" looking moisturizer that I'm suspecting is the cause to my many cc's. It's a pretty heavy cream, its ingredients are:\n\n\n\"water, petrolatum, cetearyl alcohol, ceteareth-30, paraffinum liquidum, matricaria, recutita flower extract, methylparaben, propylparaben, tocopheryl acetate, DMDM hydantoin, sodium hydroxide.\"\n\n\nDo you suggest that i'll stop using this moisturizer? I'd like to hear your opinion about it,                             sorry for bad english and thanks alot guys!\n\n",
