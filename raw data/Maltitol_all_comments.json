        "body": "Quarantine. (Haribo Sugar-Free Gummy Bears)\n\nI'm writing this from the quarantine room of my regional level 1 trauma center. by the time you read this I will surely be dead. It started off like any other shift. My partner and I, two regular paramedics from new york, checked our ambulance, restocked and then went into service. like most days we get posted in the same area. we tend to park at the local CVS drug store because of the dark parking lot and excellent wifi signal. I had just convinved my partner to watch the walking dead with me. He's an older medic, and on most calls he shuffles about on the over night shift like a newly dead corpse anyway. Nevertheless he agreed and so we went into the store to buy snacks for our zombie marathon. Being from new york and a member of the \"tribe\" its hard for him to pass up on a deal. i'm sure you know what i mean. So to him it must have looked like a message from god. the giant bag sat there atop all others. 5 whole pounds of gummy bears. and health consious due to their sugar free nature. all for ten dollars. My partner who we will refer to as Steve for this, my dying words, instantly snatched the bag off the shelf and proclaimed \"i have chosen our snacks!.\" those words continue to haunt me. the poor bastard will never know what he did in that single moment. we eagerly skipped to the ambulance excited about our deal. we made an agreement that neither of us would stop until the bag was finished. this would be our undoing. see the bag was on the top shelf and covered in dust. clearly it was there for quite some time. we got in the ambulance shoveling fist fulls of bears into our mouths. like the poor doomed souls we were, we threw bears at eachother and carried on. we had gotten through the first episode and much like rick, we didn't understand the world ahead of us. the horrible little multi colored bears had developed a time delay. this allowed us to just bout polish off the entire bag before it happened. A sound came from steve that could only be described as the thunder one hears as a hurricane draws near. and then i felt it. it felt like recently meth addicted amish girl churning butter in my stomach. I looked over at steve who by now had large quantities of sweat pouring from his forehead. We both scrambled to get the doors open. we grabbed hands and ran tword the cvs bathroom promising never to leave the other behind. but we didn't make it before the first shot across the bow. steve let out a shart so hard that it tore through the triple diamond stiched tacticle 5.11 pants and splattered into the welcome mat at the front door. he let out a sigh of relief, which we both took for false hope. as it lead us to believe that if we made it to the bathroom and let the now angry demons ripping their way out of our anuses we would be fine. we didn't know we had actually opened a portal to hell in our sphincters. luckily i had made it to the bathroom first. with only one stall i realized it was just steve's bad luck that he had to wait. this wouldn't be our fate however. steve had already abandonded all hope. accross from the toilet was a urinal. steve without a moments hesitation took a three point football stance infront of me like a left tackle and dropped his pants trying to aim at the urinal. I was already letting the playdough confetti mixture out from within the depths of my intestines by the time steve had positioned himself. we locked eyes. shame was gone for us. the smell alone should have rendered us both unconsious but by some miracle we were both able to see in eachother the fear. and then it happened. steve relaxed his sphincter and the force splashing off the urinal pushed him clear over on the floor. i had already filled the toliet and i could see the slow moving river of fecal matter rolling towards him like lava. i tried to call out but my body was only able to make a muffled cry that sounded like a dying zebra. the river overtook steve who had his own problems to worry about. crying and curled on the floor he had some how managed to spray the ceiling with one of his primary erruptions. tiny yellow brown droplets fell from the sky as if it were raining our own sorrow and embarrassment back onto us. and this is where i have to fill the story in with witness accounts. you see i'm currently being quarantined with an entire rescue squad. at some point both steve and I must've blacked out. i only remember flashes.. i am told that steve with his dying breath managed to key up dispatch on the radio and send out one last cry for help. the first on scene were the local police. I only remember one of them opening the doors and instantly throwing up into the bathroom. he fell face first on the now liquid covered tile floor. his partner wanted to drag him out but it was too late. by opening the door the smell had been released and now everyone inside the store iteself was contaminated. the next time i opened my eyes i saw a police officer and a small girl rocking in the corner crying. and then i woke up here... i'm told steve is dead. men dressed in yellow hazmat suits report last seeing him push me through the bathroom door to a safer area before he forced the door closed, clearly destined on riding out the storm in solitude. surely an autopsy will reveal that he died after one final push he blew out his colon and his heart fell straight out of his chest through his pelvis and into the abyss. local authorities are classifying this as some time of weaponized pathogen. i tried telling them it was the bears. clean up crews refused to enter the premises and so the cvs and our ambulance were both set on fire and surrounding area evacuated. This is for you steve... may god have mercy on your soul. your wife will never again yell at you for losing her spoons.",

    "body": "/u/Axelrod777 [made the argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/ed4e2h/debunking_the_gpu_bang_for_buck_myth_diminishing/) that you get the most for your money, the more you spend on your GPU.\n\nI agree with them, that the 3600 is currently the best choice for most gaming builds, as it pairs nicely with any GPU from mid range to high end. Spending more on the CPU only helps if you use the computer for something besides gaming.\n\nBut the power of GPUs does't scale linearly with their price. Spending more has diminishing returns the higher you go.\n\n**Cost per FPS**\n\nTo show this, I used the [Shadow of the Tomb Raider - 1920x1080 - Highest Quality benchmark by anandtech](https://www.anandtech.com/bench/GPU19/2638) and compared them to the [prices of the different GPUs](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/#sort=price). \n\nThe result is this [scatter plot that shows how much you pay per FPS](https://i.imgur.com/HonUGN4.png) with different GPUs. 10% error bars to account for price volatility.\n\nA RX 570 has the best FPS to price ratio. You pay $2.07 per FPS. A RTX 2080 Ti is worst with a cost of $6.79 per FPS. But the RX 570 is below 60 FPS, so it should only be used in budget builds.\n\nThe trend line is set to linear, so you can see how much better or worse the FPS/price is. The RX 5700 ($3.13/FPS) and XT ($3.51) get you clearly more \"bang for buck\" than the RTX 2070 Super ($4.6/FPS).\n\n**Cost per userbenchmark score point**\n\nBut are the results the same if we use the userbenchmark scores? Mostly, yes. [Similar scatter plot, but with userbenchmark scores instead of FPS](https://i.imgur.com/pWsqGUO.png). Scores are closer together, but RX 570 is still the best value at $2.34 per userbenchmark score point. And RTX 2080 Ti worst at $5.71. \n\n**Data**\n\nHere is the [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qy5N0NLtGPnNLq0-Yv-LGnhfXM-7_nS5DableGQBFXk/edit?usp=sharing), if someone wants to add further data points or create their own charts. \n\n**Most FPS per dollar GPUs**\n\n- >$150 RX 570\n- $150-$170 RX 580 and 1650 Super\n- $170-$210 RX 590\n- $210-$260 GTX 1660 Super\n- $260-$300 Vega 56\n- $300-$350 RX 5700\n- >350$ RX 5700 XT\n\nRule of thumb: GPUs with good value cost less than $3.5 per FPS.\n\nI only looked at FPS and initial price. Depending on power prices, it may be cheaper to get a more expensive card that uses less power.\n\n**Edits**\nEdit 1: I updated the Price-FPS chart to make it easier to read. Old version: https://i.imgur.com/071uZQ2.png\n\nEdit 2: A comment (which I sadly can't find anymore) explained the other post. Paying $724 (RX 5500 XT + $550 for other components) results in a cost of $13.33 per FPS while spending $950 (RTX 2060 Super + $550) results in $10.24 per FPS. The pricier build has a better value with such a calculation. Though you would be able to find cheaper components for the low end build. For the sake of the argument, I keep the same base price for all GPUs. The [resulting chart](https://i.imgur.com/4hBu5iW.png) shows that there is a sweet spot (RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT).\n\nEdit 3: Keep in mind that I only used the performance of one game. Others will perform slightly different. And prices fluctuate all the time. Do your own research.\n\nEdit 4: [Price on the x axis](https://i.imgur.com/GBcY0ii.png).\n\nEdit 5: /u/exotic_sangria did a [quick calculation for electricity costs](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/ed8g8k/gpu_prices_do_not_scale_linearly_with_gpu_power/fbh8pk0). RX 570 costs about $30 per year. 750ti $6. In countries with higher energy prices, this gives more expensive card with a lower power consumption a better value. At least in the crowded $150-250 range. /\n\nEdit 6: /u/homewrecker07 made a similar [cost per FPS analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/ed8g8k/gpu_prices_do_not_scale_linearly_with_gpu_power/fbhkibt/) when they shopped for a GPU: \n\nEdit 7: /u/Maltitol linked a [chart by PassMark with similar results](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/ed8g8k/gpu_prices_do_not_scale_linearly_with_gpu_power/fbihnkg/).\n\nEdit 8: Formatting.",

There's always been bad blood between me and my mother's girlfriend (we will call her Megan) because I look like my father. My mother lied and said that my younger brother (we will call him Michael) isn't my dad's child. \n\nRecently, I told my mother that when she passes away, I only want my childhood pictures, documents pertaining to me, and the pictures of my children that I sent to her. My mother got rather anxious and doesn't want me to have any of it. I told her that I am ready and more than willing to take Megan to court if I have to. Megan had a heart attack a few years ago, and my mother said that it would kill Megan if I take her to court and it would be my fault.  Megan made my mother disown me, and I don't trust Megan not to try to steal my identity after my mother passes away. I keep getting the feeling that my mother doesn't have much longer to live. \n\nShould I let it go, or pursue this when the time comes? Even if it does cause another heart attack for Megan? True, she is a horribly vile person, but she is a human being. AITA?\n\nUpdate: I talked with my mother. Apparently, Megan ripped up all the pictures years ago, so I have no way of getting them at all. But all is not lost. I found some sugar free gummy bears with maltitol in them. I sent it to Megan. She ate the whole 5 pound bag! It cost me a pretty penny, and it was really hard to get my hands on them (friend of mine had a cousin who had them. They've been discontinued, for very good reason.) I just happened to know that Megan loves gummy bears! My mother was in on it. Megan thinks my mother bought them at the grocery store! Apparently, Megan has been having to practically live in the bathroom and has been pretty miserable, but she kept eating the gummy bears! I feel like I have paid her back for that now.",

    "body": "Why is it so hard to find \"real\" ice cream in India?  \nMilk solids, emulsifiers, palm oil, etc....The dairy industry in India needs to be pushed to provide higher quality products. Stop making \"ice cream\" with OIL. Actual ice cream should have: milk, cream, sugar, vanilla extract, eggs.  There is only one brand so far - Nic Naturals where I have found REAL milk used in the ingredients and it is not available in my area!\n\nSo I decided ok I will just make my own ice cream.  Even then such a well-known company Amul lists MILK SOLIDS on their FRESH CREAM.  Milk solids does not mean fresh.  This is false advertising and misleading.  \n\nThis is an ingredient list for one of the ice cream brands\n\nWater, Milk Solids, Sweetener {Maltitol \\[965(i)\\], Stevia- Stevioside \\[960\\]}, Fructose Oligosaccharide, Stabilizers (410, 412), Emulsifiers (471, 477), CONTAINS PERMITTED NATURAL FOOD COLOUR {160\\[a(ii)\\]} AND ADDED NATURAL FLAVORING SUBSTANCES (VANILLA).

    "body": "Sweeteners are a complex issue. With all of the brand new resolution folks posting, I have seen sweeteners come up so much by so many of you. I have seen posts about Swerve, Atkins, and more. As such, I wanted to make a post directly about artificial sweeteners and how they can affect keto. They can be your best friend or your worst enemy, and it largely depends on your body's chemistry as well as the type of sweetener.\n\n\n\n\n***In general***\n\n________________________________________________\n\nIn general, cutting out sweets can only help you stick to any diet easier. Sweet stuff tastes good and when things taste really good, we often find ourselves having just one more bite.\n\n\nThat said, I personally wouldn’t be on this lifestyle without sweeteners. Most of us simply want to be able to have a treat now and then. Being too restrictive can kill any type of health improvement by making it too daunting to achieve. As such, sweeteners are fine for most people to use. There are cautionary tales by some that they can increase cravings, but most people likely won’t experience this and it’s up to you to experiment to see if they are what is causing your cravings or not.\n\n\nHowever, not all sweeteners are created equal. \n\n\n\n***Sweeteners to watch out for***\n\n________________________________________________\n\n>**Maltitol:** This is almost identical to sugar in terms of carbs, its impact on your blood sugar is very bad.  It simply has the same impact on you as downing sugar would for the most part. It also causes very distressing bowel movements when eaten too much. Sadly it tastes very good and almost like sugar, meaning it’s the #1 one people experiment with--and pay for later. **Almost all sugar free candies will use this one making them not a low carb option nor an option you want if you want to spend your life outside the bathroom.**\n\n\n> **Xylitol:** While better than the other -tol, this one is very dangerous to dogs/cats. It’s toxic to them. It also can cause similar bowel issues if consumed in moderate to large doses.\n\n\n>**Splenda:** The granulated version of Splenda has a lot of carbs. This is because it uses high GI sweeteners with Sucralose as binding agents, making it surprisingly bad for low carb diets, even if it is often suggested as a SF option. Liquid splenda or sucralose itself is fine, but if a product says \"Splenda (TM)\" it is likely using the granulated version. **The sugar free candies that are not using Maltitol will likely use this, making them a poor keto choice.**\n\n>**Just Like Sugar (and anything with Malodextrin):** Malodextrin isn't good. It will often be used in products as a binding agent. Always read ingredients and, if it has that, be wary. Sometimes people will make Stevia mixes with it, completely off-setting the benefits Stevia has.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Sweeteners to freely enjoy***\n________________________________________________\n\n\n> \n>**Stevia:** This is a great, natural sweetener. Its taste can be off-putting, but when you bake with it, you can use extracts to cover it up. I recently made a cranberry pie where I simply added extra vanilla extract to mask its taste.\n\n\n> **Erythritol:** Another good one, this sweetener is gaining in popularity. Chocolate bars like Lily’s and ChocoPerfection both use this sweetener, and they taste pretty close to the real thing!\n\n\n>**Monk Fruit:** I recently tried ChocZero which has monk fruit. It is the hardest to find since it is rarer. It is very, very good.\n\n\n> **Allulose:** The new Quest cereal bars use this one. It tastes great, like really really really good. It has not impacted my blood sugar and I trust Quest largely because their protein bars have been a staple for many ketoers, so this may change as further research comes out, but it is a new sweetener.\n\n\n> **Swerve/Truvia/Sukrin:** These are ~~two~~ three hybrids that mix sweeteners and they are GREAT for baking, coffee, and more. I highly suggest either one if you want to dabble in making your own keto baked goods, they are easy to use--and in the case of Swerve, they come in confectioner’s or granular, allowing you to make frostings! Redditor /u/mymagaboo has also informed me that Sukrin comes in Sukrin Gold which is a brown sugar substitute making it extra useful for baking projects.\n\n\n> **EZSweetz/Liquid Splenda/Sucralose:** Remember how I said Splenda can kind of suck? Liquid splenda is actually great compared to its granular cousin, and you will find it often sold as generic liquid Sucralose. This isn’t the best sweetener ever and is probably the worst on this list of “good ones,” but it’s pretty decent as a drop or two in your coffee. It is VERY potent, meaning a single drop often satisfies what a few TBSP of sugar used to. The Da Vinci and Torani syrups use this to be sugar free as well, and they are safe to use.\n\n> **Aspartame:** A lot of comments about this. Aspartame is pretty hated by a lot of health gurus as a \"bad\" sweetener, but I haven't been able to substantiate any of the hate it's gotten.  I have always had diet soda with it and I have never had any issues. A small percentage of people will have an insulin response to it, but research has proven there isn't one. I personally use it, but YMMV.\n\n\n\n\n***Onto the products***\n\n________________________________________________\n\n\nThe main reason I wanted to make this post is I wanted to suggest some good ones, shame some bad ones, and in general help out new ketoers find their substitute sweet.\n\n\n\n\n***Products that are generally bad***\n________________________________________________\n\n\n>**Russell Stover Sugar Free chocolates**: After nearly six months here, I have seen so many posts about these suckers. They are a sham. They use Splenda and Maltitol, they are not low carb, and they will stall you en masse. If your macros can handle it, having 1 or 2 is a fine treat (and technically better than sugar, as it’s slightly less carbs), but anyone who is snacking on these for their calories will have more cravings and likely be knocked out of ketosis. I have had their sugar free mint patties, one a day, as a dessert for a few weeks to no ill effects but I made sure that I was eating virtually zero carbs the days I did indulge.\n\n>**Hershey’s Sugar Free Bars/Reeses/etc**: Same deal as Russell Stovers, avoid.\n\n>**Werther’s Originals/Gummy Bears/Twizzlers/Jelly Belly SF Beans**: Same deal.\n\n>**Asher's Chocolates**: Same deal.\n\n\n>**La Nouba**: La Nouba’s stuff tastes so good. Sadly most of it uses maltitol. It is a huge shame because they make sugar free marshmallows that taste perfect. They do have chocolate bars with Stevia that are OK.\n\n\n>**Atkins Bars and Candies**: These are another sham. They use maltitol, they will make you feel sick, and their carb count is a bold lie because of the sweetener they use. When they say 3g carbs, it’s really more like 15-20g *per* bar. If you achieve success eating them, it’s likely because you stayed under calorie counts or already ate virtually zero carbs meaning you were still in keto after eating one. They aren’t worth it.\n\n\n>**Beef Jerky**: I just wanted to put this one out here, a lot of people eat jerky without realizing it has been drenched in sugar. Try biltong jerky over the regular stuff as well or get a dehydrator to make your own so you can control what goes in it. Random life tip!\n    \n\n\n\n\n***Products that are good alternatives***\n\n\n________________________________________________\n\n> **ChocZero chocolate**. I love ChocZero. It came out recently and is taking the keto community by storm. But it's really, really good. Their 50% dark is their best by far and they use monk fruit (no sugar alcohols) which makes me love them.\n\n> **Lily’s chocolate bars**. I’m not a shill, but I love these things. They taste great, the only downside is they do use Erythritol. They have a lot of flavors as well, I found their regular milk chocolate to be the best with their coconut to also be good.\n\n> **ChocoPerfection**: These taste nearly identical to Lily’s, slightly harder to get, but just as good. They make a great dark chocolate orange bar.\n\n\n> **Quest bars and Quest cereal bars**: very good protein bars. That said, the cereal bars taste completely different--and I like them a lot more! They taste like cereal granola bars and are 3g carbs a pop, a great dessert.\n\n\n> **Halo Top/Artic Zero**: Some people hate AZ's taste, myself included, but I am including it since so many like it. These two ice cream subsitutes rock. They are very low carb and made with sweeteners that have low GI. If you can afford the calories, add a few TBSP of heavy cream in with them and make it into a milkshake--you will thank me later.\n\n> **Skinny Syrups, Da Vinci Syrups & Torani**: These are sweetened with liquid Splenda and they are awesome for baking as well as coffee and tea. I highly suggest picking these up if you are missing something: I recently did an eggnog flavored tea with their eggnog SF Da Vinci syrup and it was heavenly :)\n\n> **Nutritious Living Hi Lo Cereal**: this one is a mixed bag, it’s about 5-9g of carbs per serving depending on the flavor. It does use cane sugar. That said, it is a minor amount and has never knocked me out of keto as long as I have one serving (½ a cup). I feel like it is a perfect cereal substitute if you are one of those lazy people who sometimes craves cereal in the morning.  Since it is almost all fiber, it is very filling compared to other higher carb low carb products (err, that came out badly, but you know what I mean?).\n\n\n> **Extremely dark chocolates**: These will be low carb naturally, even if they have a bit of sugar. Most have about 5g of carbs a serving. I personally like Lindt’s 85-90% in small squares. Easy to track and a great treat to savor with tea.\n\n> **Biltong jerky:** While most jerky is very sugar heavy, some brands won't be. Additionally, biltong jerky is a style of jerky that is very low on sugar. Always check the label, but even sugar heavy brands often make their biltong jerky have only 1-2g carbs an ounce!\n\n> **Epic Bars:** Epic bars are really good albeit very expensive. They make a bacon bar that tastes amazing with no extra sweeteners or anything. Highly suggest them if you are going for a wholesome, filling snack that won't damage your diet.\n\n> **Homemade goods**: These aren’t as bad to make as you think. Some Swerve, butter, and almond flour literally makes amazing shortbread cookies. In general, you can use almond flour in lieu of regular flour then use Truvia/Swerve/Stevia to cover the sugar and make the majority of the recipes you used to make. There are thousands of awesome recipes online and on r/ketoreceipes. \n\n> **Have any others?** I will add them here, let me know.\n\n\n***The science***\n\n________________________________________________\n\n\nThis is a helpful chart of every GI of every sweetener, including things like honey vs regular sugar. \n\n\n* http://www.sugar-and-sweetener-guide.com/glycemic-index-for-sweeteners.html \n\n\n\n***A few recipes***\n\n________________________________________________\n\nHere are a few recipes I have made while on keto and enjoyed that help with a sweet tooth. There are thousands more, these are just a few I can verify are pretty good and fairly easy to make (I sucked at baking prior!).\n\n* http://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/2016/11/low-carb-cranberry-cheesecake-pie.html\n* http://www.ruled.me/keto-chocolate-cake-mug/ \n* http://www.ruled.me/keto-chocolate-roll-cake/ \n* http://paleomagazine.com/paleo-peppermint-patties-recipe\n\n",

Another to stay away from is the chicory roof fibre based sweeteners like \"just like sugar\".   They use maltodextrim  as a bulking agent similar to Splenda powder.",

Aspartame, isn't bad though cyclimate and saccharine aren't great because they small amounts of dextrose or other sugars. In small amounts (1 or 2 packets) that's fine but in large doeses they have an effect.\n\nPersonally, I can't stand the taste of stevia or its 'hybrids' and so can't use it.

You'll look at store-bought jerky like it's plastic. It's just gross to me now. \n\nRecipe is really simple:\n\n- A few pounds of lean beef (london broil, flank)\n- 1 cup soy sauce\n- 1 cup worcestershire sauce\n- 1 tbsp garlic power\n- 1 tbsp onion power\n- 1 tsp liquid smoke (optional)\n\nFreeze the beef for at least an hour and slice it into thin slices. Throw all the other ingredients in a bowl and add in the beef slices. Mix it all up and then transfer everything to a ziploc bag (including all the liquid!). Put that in the fridge overnight. The next day, drain as much liquid as you can and they put each piece of beef on paper towels to dry off any exterior liquid (otherwise it will caramelize and get sticky and gross). I recommend stacking the beef on doubled-up paper towels to get both sides dried off well. Then throw it in the dehydrator for 8-12 hours and you'll be golden. \n\nDust some ground black pepper on there as you fill up a tray for some extra flavor. You can also throw hot sauce in the liquid mix to add some heat as well. And then try not to eat all of it in one day. It'll be tempting, for sure :)",

    "body": "1. If you eat while you’re cooking, those little snacks add up QUICK. Eating low calorie veggies (baby carrots, cucumbers) while cooking makes it totally negligible, and gives you something to munch on. If you need some flavor, just make yourself a quick  lemon or vinegar dressing with no oil. \n\n2. Tell yourself you can always have more later. Eating past full because you don’t want to be hungry later just means you’re stretching out your stomach and accustoming yourself to larger portions, which makes it much harder to lose weight. Save the rest for later, and eat again when you’re hungry. \n\n3. Prioritize satiety by eating loads of protein and fiber. Fruits, vegetables, meats, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, chia seeds, flax. Adding avocado + fatty things can help make something satiating, don’t be afraid to add a controlled amount so you feel like you’ve had something you enjoy.\n\n4. Monkfruit + Erythritol is the best zero calorie non glycemic sweetener, despite those faulty studies that came out. (If you ask, I will elaborate). Allulose is also fantastic. Splenda, Aspartame, Sweet N Low are awful for you. Do NOT consume maltitol in large quantities unless if you want to absolutely shit your brains out. If you like rootbeer, Virgil’s sells one made with Erythritol and it ROCKS. Smart Sweets makes the absolute BEST caramels, they sell them as Sprouts. Also, the absolute best low sugar (not sugar free) chocolate is sold at Sprouts and it’s by Guittard and it’s sold in baking chips.\n\n5. Keto does NOT mean diet friendly. Keto products, while sugar free, are often extremely high in fat, and thereby very high in calories.\n\n6. Whole Foods plant based people and carnivore people are onto something, and it’s unprocessed foods. Eating majority this way is going to change your LIFE. \n\n7. You need strong stomach acid to properly digest lots of vegetables. If your stomach goes haywire when you eat a ton of fruit + veg, ACV, prebiotic fiber, probiotics, bone broth, low sugar (sugar weakens stomach acid)…whatever you gotta do to FIX YOUR GUT! L Glutamine + Jerusalem Artichoke + flax/chia seeds are great. Blending makes fruit and veg easier to digest. Variety matters.\n\n8. You have NO IDEA what your actual calories are until you get a food scale. If it’s too much for you, don’t torture yourself, but my estimates were OFF. After about 4-6 months of consistent measuring, I can eyeball a lot of things, and I have a lot of calories per serving memorized.\n\n9. Be mindful of your signals. Your body will tell you what foods make you feel awful and what foods make you feel energized. Your body will tell you what it needs, you just need to practice listening. Keep following the light, and you’ll find yourself on an upward spiral.\n\n10. Prioritize actions over results. Instead of focusing on the outcome, and crying when your weight goes up a little because you’re carrying a little water weight, wondering what the point of it all is, wanting to give up…just take the daily action and look at the results every so often (weekly, monthly?). If you put in the effort, the results will come. Don’t be afraid to do waist, chest, hip measurements because sometimes weight stays the same, but body composition changes. \n\n11. Cortisol and Blood Sugar matters. Cinnamon stabilizes blood sugar, ashwaganda helps lower cortisol, so does Magnolia Bark Extract. Piping Rock has all of this stuff for cheap. Getting enough sleep, taking turmeric + ginger lowers inflammation. \n\n12. Focus on loving the journey, being kind to yourself. Weight can be your body holding onto self hate from old traumas. It doesn’t matter how justifiable it is. This is YOUR BODY, like it or not. No matter how much you wish things were different, you can’t snap your fingers and skip ahead to your next goal. You can only put one foot in front of the other, take action today, and make adjustments along the way. Focusing on how you can love yourself, and the positive aspects of becoming healthy makes tackling your goals that much easier.",

    "body": "TLDR at the bottom. \n\nFirst post cus I didn’t think I’d ever need to post but here we are. So last year, I (23M) started seeing a therapist to help with behavioral issues and general help in life. I work as a local delivery driver and earned below minimum wage because I failed college twice. Anyway, my therapist suggested that I needed to substitute bad habits with good habits, such as replacing soda with water, or biting my nails/cracking my knuckles with chewing game/using a sucking candy. You can probably see where this is going. \n\nICEBREAKER SOURS. GODDAMMIT. \n\nEssentially if you didn’t know, Icebreakers have an ingredient called Maltitol, which in high doses can apparently cause stomach issues. So I start this early/mid June. No problems. Then November hits and I GET SICK. Like the full Virus symptoms; coughing, stuffed nose, bloody noses, nausea, weakness. All the common symptoms. And then after a few days I get better, but the cough sticks around.\n\nThen a month goes by and it’s late November/early December and there are multiple days of vomiting. Mostly mucus but some food included as well. So I go see my doctor and there’s little wrong and he gives me antibiotics and cough medicine. They seem to help. \n\nThen January comes around and I’m good until the end of the month when the cough returns. This entire time btw I’ve been pseudo-addicted to Icebreakers and never thought they could be the cause. Yesterday was a fasting day for Catholics called Ash Wednesday (please don’t judge), so since I can’t eat as much, I just snack on icebreakers most of the day and probably eat about an entire case collectively. I go to bed with gassiness and slight stomach issues thinking nothing of it. Then I wake up. HOLY SHIT. \n\nEssentially, I wake up 3 hours before my alarm at like 6am (I know that’s not early for most jobs but it is for me right now). I’m shivering, coughing, and trying to get back to sleep, until I give up and sit up. BIG MISTAKE. As soon as I do I can feel it coming, so I rush to the bathroom and Whoop, there it is. I’ll spare the graphics details for now but after I was done I’m reminded of something my parents said last time, “Could it be the Icebreakers?” So I look it up and bang, YES, YES IT IS THE ICEBREAKERS. That’s when I found out about Maltitol. So yeah, that’s my story. Thanks for reading and any advice to fix this would be greatly appreciated. \n\nTLDR: Icebreakers fucked up my stomach for 4 months and I just found out. FML.",

Tums has some chewable extra strength chewables that are great for small flare-ups and minor to mild stomach pain. They also make a version with simethicone (Gas X) in it that helps if you are having gas pains. For heavier duty pain and flares, Pepcid chewables are wonderful. \n\n3. This should be kinda obvious, but while you're healing, avoid acids like the plague. This includes soda, tomatoes, high acid fruits, juices, and vinegar. Check ingredients until you can go more than three days without pain. \n\n4. The BRAT (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) diet works really well to get through the roughest of it. You need to eat a little, but I highly recommend smaller portions.\n\nLastly, have a conversation with your doctor. You may need an endoscopy to check to make sure you don't have ulcerative spots and to see how severe your stomach lining is irritated. \n\nHang in there and let me know if you have any questions.

Sign me up!\n\nWell, I went to the website to check them out.\n[The nutrition information for them is here](https://extendbar.com/pages/sugar-free-food-products-healthy-food-for-diabetes-protein-bars-for-diabetes)\n\nWhat the heck?!\nSo, the first bar on that site, the Chocolate and Caramel bar.\nShows....23g Carbs total.  3g Fiber. 1g Sugar. 10g Sugar Alcohol.  Ok...some quick math.  There are 9 carbs missing!!\n\nThe first huge red flag...those 10g of Sugar Alcohol are Maltitol.  That's a no-go right there.\n\nThen, the breakdown on the bar says \"23g Carbs - 3g Fiber - 10g Sugar Alcohol - 9g Other carbs\"\nWhat the hell is \"Other carbs\"?!? and why are they subtracting it??\n\nScrolling down the page to other flavors, I finally found an explanation.\n\"Nonfactor Other carbs include Uncooked Cornstarch, and Glycerin, which convert slowly, and thus have a minimal impact on blood sugar\".\n\nI'm sorry, but this is borderline marketing fraud.  (in my opinion)\nThey seem to be counting Net Carbs based on how it affects blood sugar levels??  In that case, they should count Maltitol as a carb, since it spikes levels like no ones business.  \n\nI guess...it just makes me upset that someone that might not be more informed about keto might think that they could eat TEN of these bars and still be under 20 for the day.  It seems very disingenuous to me.\n\nWe need to remain vigilant in these new products that seem to be coming out, and are preying on the low carb advertising.  \n\nThoughts on this?",

Most people don’t call them out, so I understand the confusion. They essentially represent naturally occurring (usually complex) carbohydrates in foods. Fiber is listed separately due to FDA regulations and sugars/sugar alcohols are listed separately because they’re food additives that would not otherwise be found in a naturally occurring product state.\n\nDon’t let the “other” phrasing throw you off. Their math is still completely wrong, but that’s where the obscure “nomenclature” is coming from. Food labeling regulations try to make it easier for consumers to quickly assess foods in order to make better nutritional choices, but many companies still do their best to stir the pot and cause confusion.",

These bars were again ranked according to taste and texture. While the bars were at least two months from their expiration dates, most of the syrup layers were dried up and some coatings were crumbly. I’ve been having these shipped to the province so that could be a factor. I ordered them from Shopee for P130.00 each after discounts. \n\nTheir calories range from 203 (Caramel Chaos) to 242 (Salted Peanut) - higher than Quest’s, and on average, higher than Mars’. Each bar has around 20g of protein, low fiber content, and a relatively high amount of sugar alcohols. A couple of these bars were sweet enough to cause some irritation in my throat. I’ve included macros and ingredients for a few bars at the end.\n\n**[9.0] White Chocolate Salted Peanut** - pleasant base that was dense yet soft, thick white chocolate coating, peanut bits that did really well for the texture, caramel syrup. the base had a sort of white chocolate and peanut (but not peanut butter) flavor. on the sweeter side, overall a very enjoyable bar. taste and texture were similar to Snickers White Chocolate\n\n**[9.0] Oreo White** - rich Oreo base, vanilla creme layer, Oreo pieces, thick white chocolate coating. flavor was on point, especially liked the vanilla creme layer that was reminiscent of powdered sugar. Oreo pieces had some crunch to them. dense and a little chewy.\n\n**[8.5] Oreo** - similar to Oreo White above, but with a milk chocolate coating (more delicious vs other Grenade bars) that was unfortunately crumbly. Oreo pieces were not crunchy and the base was a little *too* chewy, hence the lower rating\n\n**[7.0] Fudged Up** - fudge base, milk chocolate coating, caramel (?) syrup, a few chocolate chips (skimped). typical fudge / brownie protein bar flavor, i like that it wasn't too sweet or rich. noticeable protein powder smell opening the wrapper but not in taste. texture was better after i let half sit in room temp\n\n**[6.5] Dark Chocolate Raspberry** - chocolate / raspberry base, dark chocolate coating, chocolate bits, dried up raspberry caramel syrup. a little tart, i liked the unique flavor on this one. would have ranked higher but the texture was dry and crumbly.\n\n**[6.5] Caramel Chaos** -  subtle caramel base, caramel syrup, crispy toppings, milk chocolate coating. standard caramel flavor that was decent, though base was a little chalky. \n\n**[6.0] Choco Chip Salted Caramel** - dense yet soft chocolate base, milk chocolate coating, chocolate chips, and caramel syrup that was almost non-existent along with the salted caramel flavor. maybe it’s my taste buds? rich and sweet that got too sweet finishing the bar which made my throat kind of itchy. first Grenade bar I tried and this was also the first time I experienced this sensation in my throat. initially a [7.0]\n\n**[6.0] White Chocolate Cookie** - chalky base, caramel (?) syrup, cookie bits, white chocolate coating. hints of vanilla protein powder. got sweeter finishing the bar that felt like my throat was about to be irritated again. bar was alright, nothing that stood out.\n\n**[5.5] Birthday Cake** - vanilla (?) base, sprinkles, white chocolate coating, dried up vanilla creme layer. taste was a miss, lacking flavor compared to Quest's Birthday Cake. wasn't especially sweet but I had that itchy sensation in my throat again, similar to the first Grenade bar I had.\n\n**[4.5] Jaffa Quake** - chocolate / orange base, choco crisps, milk chocolate coating, orange caramel syrup. not a fan of the chocolate and orange combo so my expectations were already low. feels like one of things that you either love or hate. more unpleasant closer to finishing the bar, texture was proper though. initially a [5.5]\n\nMy current favorites from the protein bars I’ve covered are Quest S’mores and Double Chocolate Chunk, the flavoured Snickers Hi Protein bars, and Grenade’s Oreo, Oreo White, and White Chocolate Salted Peanut. Thank you u/SweetDestination23 for the Grenade protein bar recommendation. \n\nMacros for a few bars:\n\nCaramel Chaos - 203 kcal 7F 21P 21C (2g sugar, 19g polyols)\n\nGrenade Oreo - 233 kcal 10F 21P 20C (1g sugar, 17g polyols)\n\nSalted Peanut - 242 kcal 12F 20P 19C (2g sugar, 17g polyols)\n\nCaramel Chaos ingredients:\nProtein Blend (Milk Protein, Calcium Caseinate (Milk), Whey Protein (Milk)), Milk Chocolate with Sweetener (20%) (Sweetener: Maltitol; Cocoa Butter, Whole Milk Powder, Cocoa Mass, Emulsifier: Soy Lecithin; Natural Flavouring), Sweeteners: Maltitol, Sucralose; Bovine Collagen Hydrolysate, Humectant: Glycerol; Bulking Agent: Polydextrose; Soy Protein, Sunflower Oil, Soy Crisp (Soy Protein, Tapioca Starch, Salt), Flavourings, Potassium Chloride, Emulsifier: Soy Lecithin\n\nGrenade Oreo ingredients:\nProtein Blend (Calcium Caseinate (Milk), Whey Protein Isolate (Milk)), Milk Chocolate with Sweetener (20%) (Sweetener: Maltitol; Cocoa Butter, Whole Milk Powder, Cocoa Mass, Emulsifier: Soy Lecithin; Natural Flavouring), Bovine Collagen Hydrolysate, Humectant: Glycerol; Sweeteners: Maltitol, Sucralose; Palm Oil, Water, Fat- reduced Cocoa Powder (3%), Wheat Flour, Wheat Starch, Rapeseed Oil, Bulking Agent: Polydextrose; Sea Salt, Emulsifier: Soy Lecithin; Raising Agents: Ammonium Carbonates, Sodium Carbonates; Acidity Regulator: Sodium Hydroxide; Flavouring\n\nWhite Chocolate Salted Peanut ingredients:\nWhite Chocolate with Sweetener (31%) (Sweetener: Maltitol; Cocoa Butter, Whole Milk Powder, Emulsifier: Lecithins (Soy); Natural Flavouring), Protein Blend (Calcium Caseinate (Milk), Whey Protein Isolate (Milk)), Humectant: Glycerol; Bovine Collagen Hydrolysate, Roasted Peanut Pieces (7%), Water, Dietary Fibre: Polydextrose; Palm Fat, Peanut Paste (2.3%), Flavouring, Salt, Sweetener: Sucralose.\n",

    "body": "I had high expectations for these bars given their excellent reputation in the West - and they did not disappoint. Most of these bars were good, and some were very, very good. Similar to Mars and Grenade, they are much closer to chocolate bars in both taste and texture, unlike Quest and Carman’s with a more ‘functional’ protein bar feel. I like that Barebells had no noticeable protein powder taste, and that most of their bars had a good balance and weren’t too sweet. I’ve ranked them according to taste and texture again below.\n\nThe soft protein bars lined up on the right are an upgrade in both taste and texture, even after I had to refrigerate them. They’re supposed to be softer and fluffier, but got butchered through shipping to the province and arrived in a flat and melted state huhu. I imagine they would’ve been similar to 3 Musketeers - firm, soft to bite into, and with the right amount of chew. The two [9.5]s were so perfect in flavor that they would likely be a [10.0] if they had held their intended shape and texture. \n\nThese bars have 200 calories on average. The soft bars have a lower protein content at 16g versus the original bars at 20g, and they also have more sugar alcohols at 9 to 10g versus the originals’ 5 to 7g. I’ve included macros and ingredients for a couple bars at the bottom. Their website says that Barebells products do not contain added sugar. I did not experience any stomach discomfort or throat irritation with these bars\n\nI purchased the original protein bars from a WiseChoice physical store for P190.00 each. Yes, I know - ripperino. It stung and I had my reservations, but decided that this would be one brand I was willing to pay in full for because of the overwhelming positive reviews online. For the soft protein bars, I ordered them through Shopee for around P165.00 each after discounts.\n\n\n**RANKINGS**\n\n**[9.5] Rocky Road Marshmallow** – chocolate base, marshmallow layer, peanut bits, crisps, milk chocolate coating. delicious bar with amazing texture. great even after refrigerating, peanuts and crisps did wonders. \n\n**[9.5] Salted Peanut Caramel** – nougat / peanut (?) base, salted peanut crunch, caramel syrup, milk chocolate coating. these peanut / peanut butter protein bars have become unexpected favorites of mine and they just keep on giving. the saltiness in the peanut crunch was popping, making this the best peanut-flavoured bar for me\n\n**[9.5] Creamy Crisp** – fluffy base, caramel, crisps, milk chocolate coating. core was straight-up delicious and i’ve got a soft spot for bars with crisps. easily my favorite from the original protein bar line\n\n**[9.0] Salty Peanut** – soft base with a little chew, peanut bits, milk chocolate coating. saltiness was faint, but the bar still delivers. another bar with that Snickers vibe - in a good way!\n\n**[8.5] Caramel Choco** – chocolate base, caramel syrup, milk chocolate coating. stuck to the basics and nailed it. reminds me of Jack n Jill Chooey Toffees i adored as a kid\n\n**[8.0] Cookies & Caramel** – cookie / chocolate base, caramel, crisps, milk chocolate coating. light but pleasant caramel taste, familiar flavors that held up well\n\n**[8.0] Banana Dream** – banana base, caramel, milk chocolate coating. texture is as basic as it gets but the typical banana food flavour was pleasant, something different from the usual chocolate and caramel options\n\n**[8.0] Chocolate Dough** – chocolate brownie (?) base, choco crisps, milk chocolate coating. rich chocolate flavors that satisfy\n\n**[7.5] Caramel Cashew** – caramel base, cashew bits, milk chocolate coating. i liked the cashew bits - i wish there were more, and the caramel flavor was too subtle for my liking, but still a solid pick\n\n**[7.5] White Chocolate** – caramel (?) base, white chocolate coating, almond pieces. white chocolate coating was delicious but somewhat crumbly. the almond and cashew pieces from the bar above were a nice change from the usual crisp texture that i enjoy\n\n**[7.0] Birthday Cake** – vanilla base with sprinkles, crunchy toppings, white chocolate coating. not exactly partial to the birthday cake flavor, but i did like this over Quest’s. noticeably sweeter than other Barebells\n\n**[6.5] Cookies & Cream** – cookie dough base, cookie bits, crisps, milk chocolate coating. decent enough, had those toppings i usually enjoy, but wasn’t eager to finish this one for some reason. this was the first Barebells bar i had and maybe the expectations were initially set too high from all the reviews, or maybe it was the core that was average\n\n\n**MACROS & INGREDIENTS**\n\nMarshmallow Rocky Road - 209 kcal 10F 17P 17C\n\nINGREDIENTS: Milk proteins, sweeteners (maltitol, xylitol, sucralose), humectant (glycerol), hydrolyzed collagen, cocoa butter, bulking agent (polydextrose), whole milk powder, peanuts, soy protein, cocoa mass, soluble corn fibre, soy oil, sunflower oil, fat reduced cocoa, salt, flavourings, emulsifier (soy lecithin), tapioca starch. May contain cereals containing gluten, egg, nuts and sesame seeds.\n\nCreamy Crisp - 200 kcal 8F 20P 19C\n\nINGREDIENTS: Milk proteins, humectant (glycerol), sweeteners (maltitol, sucralose), collagen hydrolysate, polydextrose, cocoa butter, water, cocoa mass, whole milk powder, soy protein, sunflower oil, flavourings, tapioca starch, salt, emulsifier (lecithins). May contain cereals containing gluten, peanuts and nuts.\n\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS**\n\nOverall, Barebells lived up to the hype. The higher quality ingredients were apparent, even in the most basic bar - especially their chocolate coatings. Their good selection, decent macros, solid textures, and more than satisfying flavors have them currently sitting at the top of my list. However, they are expensive and not as widely available. I expect to buy these again only if they go on sale, or if I somehow end up with eff-you money.\n\nMy favorites to date from the protein bars I’ve covered are Quest S’mores and Double Chocolate Chunk, the flavoured Snickers Hi-Protein bars, Grenade’s Oreo, Oreo White, and White Chocolate Salted Peanut, and Barebells Rocky Road Marshmallow, Salted Caramel Peanut, Salty Peanut, and Creamy Crisp.\n\n**P.S.** Shitty weather kept me from work, so I had time to experiment with my elementary creativity. Do they look weird without the backgrounds? Also, sorry for the messy photos of the original Barebells bars - these were taken before I started photographing them more consistently (no wrapper, and without a chunk bitten off hehe) Let me know if you have protein bar recommendations! My side quest has me covering brands with at least 6 flavors, with Carman’s next on the list.\n",

    "body": "There are a lot of store-bought products that I use in my day-to-day diet that need to be shared.  Some of these came from this very subreddit, others just from my general shopping, still others a recommendation from a friend. The point is that I've had to gather these through trial and error and not all store-bought keto products are equal.  \n\n1. If you want something like a lunchable pizza that takes less than five minutes, try making a crust using Joseph’s Bakery [Lavash](http://www1.netrition.com/josephs_bakery_lavash_bread.html) Bread (4g net carbs/serving) or for a thicker crust Joseph’s Bakery [Pita](http://www1.netrition.com/josephs_bakery_pita_bread.html) Bread (4g net carbs/serving). These are stocked at both my local Walmart and my local grocery store, but Netrition also carries them.  The pita breads also make great sandwiches!\n\n2. For a quick, fatty snack that won’t break your calorie budget try [Wholly Guacamole Minis](http://eatwholly.com/products/classic-100-cal-minis/) with pork rinds.  The mini packs are 100 calories and 9g fat, 1g protein, and 2g net carbs per individually portioned pack.  If you like them, you can buy them in bulk at most Costcos and they freeze well. I’ve seen them at Walmart and a few other grocery stores too.\n\n3. Speaking of Costco, they have an awesome [Broccoli Cheddar Soup](http://content.costco.com/Images/Content/Product/9932b.jpg) that is super filling and only [240 calories and 3g net carbs per 1 cup serving ](http://i.imgur.com/M5VARpw.jpg)(Photo courtesy of /u/maskedrolla's post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1wo81j/i_found_this_broccoli_cheddar_soup_at_costco_it/)). Make sure to measure out your serving, because this comes with two 32oz containers of this soup, and it can be easy to accidentally overdo it on the serving. \n\n4. Again at Costco, they carry [LaTerra Fina Spinach Artichoke dip](http://www.laterrafina.com/chunky-spinach-artichoke-parmesan-dip), which is also really filling with 90 Calories, 8g fat, 2g protein, and 1g net carbs per 2 tablespoon serving.  Its super tasty with pork rinds, but be really careful to measure this out because since it comes in a 31 oz tub it's really, really easy to overconsume. Sometimes when I didn't plan well enough I will measure out 4 or 5 servings worth with some pork rinds for an easy, no fuss lunch. The website lists a few other stores where smaller versions can be found: “Meijer, Harris Teeter, Natural Grocers and Safway in Northern California.”\n\n5. Moving away from Costco products lest I sound like an advertisement, Mission has a series of Carb Balance Tortillas. There are three types: [Soft Taco at only 6g per tortilla](http://www.missionmenus.com/en/products/view/carb-balance-flour-tortilla), [Fajita at only 4g per tortilla](http://www.missionmenus.com/en/products/view/mission-fajita-carb-balance-8ct), and [Whole Wheat Fajita at only 3g per tortilla](http://www.missionmenus.com/en/products/view/mission-fajita-carb-balance-whole-wheat-8ct). Every person whom I’ve ever had try these, both keto and non-keto, have loved them. Even my husband thinks they taste just like regular flour tortillas “except better”.  I find these at Walmart and occassionally at Sam’s Club.  They are also available on Amazon and Netrition.\n\n6. For those with a sweet tooth, Breyer’s makes a [Carb Smart line](http://www.breyers.com/product/category/113546/carbsmart) of ice creams that are sweetened with a Splenda and Sugar blend. The Chocolate and Vanilla ice cream is 4g net carbs per ½ cup (remember to measure on a kitchen scale).  Its pretty tasty and curbs that ice cream craving. The only issue I’ve had with it is the same that I’ve had with other regular Breyer’s ice creams - it melts really fast! This can make it a pain to get into the freezer before the top layer has gone melty and might produce a freezer burned taste to the top layer.  I just scrape it off and call it a keto tax.  \n\n[Edit: For future keto-ers looking through this thread. I have since tried both Halo-top and So Delicious brands of ice cream (from recommendations on this thread) and can say that imo they are better than Breyers.  I probably won't buy the Breyers again, but I wouldn't discourage you from getting it if you can't find any of the great brands listed in this thread.]\n\n7. Werther’s makes sugar free versions of their [hard caramel candies](http://www.amazon.com/Werthers-Sugar-Free-Assorted-Original/dp/B004B763OK/ref=pd_bxgy_325_img_y). That link shows the regular caramels, the mint caramels, and the coffee caramels, but there are also a few other versions such as caramel apple and choco-caramel that are really good! I have a snacking fixation, and these are really good for distracting me when I might otherwise try to munch on something that would break my calorie or carb budget (or both).  Best I can tell these are sweetened with a few sweeteners called Isomalt and Acesulfame-K. I haven’t had any negative reactions to it like with Maltitol, and it hasn’t kicked me out of keto, but YMMV. \n\n8. Another hard candy that is really good is the [Sugar Free Jolly Ranchers](http://www.amazon.com/Jolly-Rancher-Assorted-Flavors-3-6-Ounce/dp/B000F8L4I4). These are also sweetened with Isomalt and Acesulfame and again, YMMV, but I haven’t had any negative reaction to them.  They are a nice blend of sweet and tart and taste very much like their full sugar counterparts. \n\n9. LC Foods makes an excellent [Biscuit Mix](http://www1.netrition.com/lc_foods_biscuit_mix.html).  I’ve only found it on Netrition, but I really think its vastly better than biscuits made with the [Dixie Carb-Counter Biscuit Mix](http://www3.netrition.com/dixie_biscuit_mix.html) or the recipe from the [CarbQuik](http://www3.netrition.com/tova_carbquik_page.html) box.  They are 1g per serving (if prepared according to the instructions) and are nice and flaky and totally yummy.  Pro Tip: Be liberal with the butter and don't blend it in too well. The chunks of butter in the mix make the bicuits more moist and give them these little spots of buttery goodness in them. Like chocolate chips in cookies, only butter... in biscuits. \n\n10. Last but not least, to go with those biscuits I like to get Smucker’s sugar free jams and preserves, sweetened with Splenda. There are actual chunks of fruit in them! I can personally vouch than the [Strawberry](http://www.amazon.com/Smuckers-Sugar-Strawberry-Preserves-12-75/dp/B003F2EOZM/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1431366802&sr=8-4&keywords=smucker%27s+sugar+free) and [Peach](http://www.amazon.com/Smuckers-Sugar-Apricot-Preserves-12-75/dp/B000600PBI/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1431366802&sr=8-10&keywords=smucker%27s+sugar+free) flavors are really good, although this is another thing that I really recommend a kitchen scale for because its 3g net carbs per tablespoon.  However, that little bit does go a long way and I never need any more than 1 serving.  \n\n\nThoughts? Suggestions? Do you have any favorites I missed?",

I use a pizza cutter because quick and easy. \n\nPlace in oven for like 8-10 mins and BAM! \n\nAwesome cracker chip things you can use for any dip or whatever uses you may find.

    "body": "I’m not sure if anyone else shares this experience and I know for many it’s obvious, the general advice is to avoid keto friendly products, however .. \n\nWhen I first did keto a few years ago I had no real awareness of keto friendly products. I was just eating basic keto food, always under my net carb limit seamlessly, which meant I was also always in an extra calorie deficit. Weight fell off, I didn’t have the electrolytes totally under control so I felt not so good at times but eventually was doing really good. After a while I discovered quest cookies and enlightened ice cream, occasional carbonaut bread, but would eat them in such moderation that they didn’t affect me much, cause I didn’t really crave them the way I craved normal sweets/carbs. \n\nAfter 4 months, I was nearing my goal weight, feeling nice and getting thin, could feel my hip bones again, and mistakenly thought I could handle a cheat day with my friend when she was visiting, and then I slowly fell off the wagon and ended up quitting keto. Gained the weight all back cause I eventually went back to my previous poor eating habits. Classic story. \n\nI reattempted keto another time, but I gained a new awareness of keto products like Orowheat tortillas (which some people apparently react to similar as regular white bread). All the types of sweets and bars and substitute items. Quest chips every day, orowheat quesadillas every day, etc etc. \n\nI think the problem when you enter keto having pre-existing food issues like binge eating or sugar addiction, you have to really just not touch that stuff. I’m back eating meals I would’ve eaten pre-discovery of these keto snacks. This is obviously just my personal experience but the scale doesn’t move as fast with them in my diet, my body doesn’t change as fast, and I don’t feel very good overall. I feel like maybe for some it’s obvious that there are hidden ingredients or ingredients that react poorly in some of these items, but going through the experience of “clean keto” vs. very dirty lazy keto is like night and day (maybe not for everyone)\n\nThis is like my fifth attempt at keto, only the second go without these keto snacks, I think I will succeed now 🤝\n\nAlso why is maltitol and maltodextrin in like everything, should be illegal ",

        "body": "The absolute best I ever did following keto was strict keto.  Cooked everything myself.  Used coconut oil.  Organic everything for meats (you are what THEY have been eating).  If it didn’t come from the edges of the grocery store, rather than down an aisle (except for pork rinds maybe), it wasn’t in my house.  I grocery shopped every week, sometimes twice a week, to keep only fresh everything in the house.  HWC in coffee for morning meal.  I would allow myself maybe one or two drinks per week, usually a nice red wine or straight (non-flavored) bourbon.  Weight just melted off.\n\nOnce I got to my ideal maintenance weight, which is about when COVID hit, I started drinking a bit more.  Grocery stores were wiped out of a lot of fresh stuff so I had to compromise.  I discovered the Quest stuff and then the Mission low-carb tortillas.  The drinking increased during COVID and I found myself not gaining weight, but my body shape changing.  Started finding more bloat in areas that used to be more bones.  Pooch came back in the belly.  Then my weight started creeping up.  I gained 25lbs of the almost 100 I had lost literally in 3 months.\n\nSo I went -right back- to the early days of Keto.  All natural everything.  Cooking everything or, if traveling, tend to stay with salads and chicken wings or burgers and steaks.  But maybe more importantly…..my alcohol intake went back to 1-2 drinks per week.  I also limited my use of Quest products and Mission low-carb tortillas….still eat them, but not like 2–3 times per day.\n\nHere’s the secret I’ve learned FOR ME.  \n\n1) Alcohol not only stalls ketosis, but you are eating a fairly rich diet of fats.  You aren’t burning the fat, so it gets deposited for future use.  Drink often enough and you are basically NEVER in ketosis and may as well be on an Atkins diet with booze.  Booze is also high calorie (relatively speaking) and the Quest stuff is craptons of artificial junk fillers.   So stay “pure” with your eats and lay off the booze.  \n\n2) You are effectively hacking your body.  And no matter what anyone tells you, keto really works best IF AND ONLY IF you maintain a caloric deficit.  Doesn’t matter if everything you eat is keto-compliant.  If you eat 4000 calories a day and only burn 2000, the rest doesn’t just get pooped out of you.  You MUST monitor your caloric intake or do some light exercises, take dog for more walks, whatever to burn off more than you take in or you’ll simply gain weight.\n\nThose two rules, followed religiously, and I got the 25 lbs back off in a few months and have kept it off for more than two years now.  I know the GLP-1 shots work by basically taking away your desire to eat and I have seen the results of those as well.  But interestingly enough for me, Keto has renewed my desire to eat as a thing I do for enjoyment, not fuel.  I like to take time to plan meals.  I like to cook them.  I have discovered new spices and prep methods and enjoy the freedom to pursue culinary options I never knew existed.  Fall in love with cooking and eating it is part of that change.  But whereas we’d cook for comfort in the past, we now cook for long lives and spending time together.  It’s an enjoyable part of our lives.",

Calories are an important thing to note. I was eating high fat/high protein but not watching my calorie intake and wondering why I’ve gained like 5 lbs in the last few weeks because my eating habits have been all over the place. Also dairy is not my friend.\nI do try and stay away from keto products - but a mission low carb tortilla here and there has never hindered me. I do use monkfruit sugar - besti brand - for when I need something sweet. I do have a sweet tooth. Otherwise I cook EVERYTHING from scratch. I love cooking and I love eating so it’s actually been a fun journey to rediscover how I can make food - like Thai or Cajun or French food keto friendly. It is possible! \nDrinking though—probably part of my problem. I used to be a daily drinker and am no longer—but on a Friday/Saturday I do enjoy having a few drinks. I know it’s a hindrance to my weight loss journey and there’s always another ten pounds I could lose, but I have a hard time being super strict. \nI will say though—you can’t treat keto or low carb like a diet you’re doing for a while. It has to be a forever choice. I slide sometimes but I bring myself back because I don’t want to gain the 60 lbs I’ve lost back. I feel the best I have in so long.

    "body": "I wrote this a few years ago, but I’ve never shared it here. Maybe it will help someone! \n\nLet me know what you would add (or what you respectfully disagree with)! \n\nThis is everything you need to know to start keto, and contributions from our members on things they wish they knew before they started: \n\n* Keto is short for ketogenic which means “creating ketones” \n\n* The Ketogenic diet is a standard of 5% carbs, 25% protein, 70% fats, but some people vary the macros based on needs. Generally, if ketosis is your goal, you need to stay at 5% or less carbs. (Macro calculator: https://calculo.io/keto-calculator, set to sedentary activity and a 20% calorie deficit) \n\n* Total Carbs - Fiber - Sugar Alcohols/Erythritol = Net Carbs! Your carb macro is NET, not total! :) \n\n* The keto diet is NOT safe for some diabetics and other people with certain conditions, please consult with your doctor before starting this or any diet/lifestyle change\n\n* Your HEALTH is the point of a lifestyle change. If keto doesn’t work for your body, that is OKAY! Don’t sacrifice your health for a title or label when that was the goal to begin with.\n\n* The keto diet IS a lifestyle change. You will gain the weight back if you switch back to a high-carb diet like the Standard American Diet (SAD diet) \n\n* Keto is a lifestyle, and as such, you cannot rely solely on Slimfast “keto” products. If you’re going to be keto/low-carb for life, then you have to learn to live that way, even on the toughest days with the least time. Sometimes that is a Quest Bar and a fat bomb, but balance is necessary for nutrition.\n\n* You can gain/lose up to 7 POUNDS of water weight PER day and this is especially apparent in your first week, and after cheat days! \n\n* Keto Flu is completely avoidable if you get enough electrolytes. Get your sodium through drinking broth and adding salted butter and salt to your foods. Get your potassium with avocado or dark leafy greens. Unsweetened cacao also has some. Magnesium is *easiest* to get through a supplement. DRINK WATER. \n\n* Cheat days are not the end of the world, they will NOT make you gain back every ounce you’ve lost, and in my opinion they make special occasions a little more special. Plus, no LIFESTYLE is treat-less, that’s ridiculous! \n\n* There’s a difference between strict and dirty keto, but it comes down to your goals: if you want to lose weight, dirty keto is fine! If your goal is anti-inflammatory, strict keto is more up your alley. \n\n* “Dirty” keto uses artificial sweeteners, trace amounts of wheat and sugar, but keeps you within macros and calories! \n\n* Strict keto avoids all sweeteners, gluten, beans and legumes, dairy, and most grains for anti-inflammatory purposes as well.\n\n* Both methods will put you into ketosis which is the state where your body uses fat as a fuel source instead of carbohydrates/glycogen. \n\n* Things that will kick you out of ketosis- more than 20g (or your limit) net carbs in a day, & MALTITOL, an evil “sugar alcohol” that effects your blood sugar more than table sugar! \n\n* Things that will not kick you out of ketosis - 2g of sugar, one cracker/chip/bite of something “bad” (just count these as 2g+ carbs per piece depending on the item), eating too much protein- a common misconception!! \n\n* Eat your fats early in your day to help you feel full longer - bulletproof coffee, butter/avo with your eggs and bacon/sausage\n\n* You WILL have setbacks and ITS OK. Just hop back on the train! We are all human\n\n* You will lose water weight faster than fat. Don't let it discourage you if you lose 5-10lbs quick then it slows to about .5lbs per 1-2 days. This is normal and HEALTHY.\n\n* Don't forget to eat fiber or you will feel bloated/backed up! \n\n* Water is a MUST, if you want to lose, you’ve gotta give your body enough water to maintain itself so you’re not holding onto excess \n\n* Weight during your period DOESNT COUNT. Just don’t do it, you’ll be fluctuating so often, it’s not worth the stress! \n\n* Take measurements, take pictures, TAKE THEM. You’ll want them for proof! \n\n* Change is HARD to see and accept in ourselves - trust others when they say you’re looking good! \n\n* The second or third time starting keto is often a LOT easier for people because they have more knowledge and/or more support! Never be discouraged by this! \n\n* Egg fasts, ketosis strips, exogenous ketones, and “keto cookbook/28 day program”’s are among the biggest MONEY GRABS of this trending lifestyle change. They’re not at all necessary, and can be unpleasant and a waste of time. \n\n* When in doubt, ASK ASK ASK! This group is full of nothing but wonderful people because that’s the kind of people we let in, and we’re ready to help. We’ve got two admins and a lot of great minds! \n\n* Also, google! Trust it! Just search “ _______ carbs” and make sure that you have either net carb info or carb and fiber info! \n\n* Hard alcohol has no carbs but does have calories! \n\n* Breastfeeding mothers shouldn’t do keto, but modified low-carb as they are at risk of ketoacidosis.\n\n* Intermittent fasting is NOT necessary, but it is a great option and can often help people get through stalls, and lose more weight in general. People also report feeling more satisfied with their meals/satiety levels.\n\n* Satiety = not being hungry. Fat = satiety because in ketosis, your body is using ketones as a fuel source. Ketones are fat based. The ketones your body uses for fuel will come from your food AND your bodies fat storage\n\n* Eat when you’re hungry, but try your best to get 1200 calories a day. Starvation mode is still a real concern and can even stall your weight loss, but your body is using your extra fat storage when you’re not hungry so 🤷🏼‍♀️ listen to your body and do what feels best. \n\n* If you exercise, you need to watch to make sure you’re not feeling faint. Exercising on ketones is way harder. \n\n* I cannot stress enough, drink the water. \n\n* Fats need to be healthy fats. Avocado, coconut, peanuts, almonds, macadamia nuts, butter, etc. Ideally, not vegetable/canola oils, etc. \n\n* Carbs should be mostly healthy choices as well, that are high in fiber.

        "body": "great bible.\n\nThree things stuck out to me:\n\n1. Eating too much protein kicking you out of ketosis and into glycogen burning mode.  Saw this being mentioned in a different thread and went down a rabbit hole of information, which the end of it all saying it's possible, but most likely you wouldn't hit that point, especially if you're active and definitely especially if you lift weights.\n\n2.  Having a cheat day is ok.  I'm only about 5 weeks in and do feel guilty if I do a cheat day.  But I can't kick myself too much if I have it once in a while.\n\n3. Intermittent Fasting is not necessary.  I started doing this early on for some reason I can't even remember (at least on weekdays).  This one I need to consider more.\n\n4. Maltitol.  Never knew what this was.  Just learned yesterday Sucrolose is bad for you.  Maybe this is one more on the list to watch out for.\n\n5. Hard alcohol has no carbs.  Did not know this one.  Thought they we all carbs.  So for keto diet, a shot of vodka is better than a pint of beer!",

    "body": "Since last Friday, I've been experimenting with allulose to keep my blood glucose down. To finish a meal, I've been having strawberries with cream and allulose or a Quest protein bar with cup of tea sweetened with allulose. My 2-hour postprandial BG readings have been stellar--110 mg/dL or lower.\n\nHowever, after lunch this past Sunday, my BG shot up to 137 mg/dL. On that particular meal, I had a Halo Top Keto Ice Cream bar in addition to some strawberries and allulose. Since the ice cream bar has only 2g net carbs, I just assumed that it might have been the extra keto bread I ate (4 slices instead of the usual 2), or maybe it was just a fluke. The keto bread I eat is supposed be to zero net carbs and I've never had a problem just eating a couple slices, but some people have reported BG spikes eating this bread. So, this FUD is always in the back of my mind--maybe I'm just getting away with eating the questionable \"resistant\" tapioca starch that the bread is made of because I'm just able to tolerate 2 slices at a time. Who knows?\n\nAfter that high reading, I started having great BG readings again when eating a Quest bar with tea and allulose to finish a meal. Fast forward to dinner tonight. I decide to try the Halo Top again along with tea and allulose.  My reading this time is 138 mg/dL--almost exactly the same as Sunday! Now I know the reading on Sunday wasn't a fluke.\n\nI decide to check the ingredient list on the Halo Top box again. I see the erythritol, but I know that doesn't cause me issues. I look closer, and I see the problem--god damn maltitol!\n\nI've tried Halo Top ice cream in the carton before, and it was fine, so I guess I didn't look as carefully when I picked up the ice cream bars. Granted, a postprandial reading of 138 mg/dL isn't too bad, but I can only imagine how high it might have been without the help of the allulose.\n\nSo the cautionary tale is that just because you had good luck with keto product by some company, it doesn't mean you're going to have good luck with all keto products by that same company.",

To anyone who stalls, stay strong, keep calm and keto on!!!!  \n  \n  \nEDIT: front of r/keto, damn!  \nEDIT 2: because this makes more sense to put in here:\nWell since people are asking, I found victory in building confidence and strength in every little victory. Whenever I would feel weak I would look at myself and challenge myself to fight it. I know it sounds cliche but I would just keep telling myself when I wanted to cheat on the diet, that I told myself I'd cheat tomorrow, and the next day I'd tell myself tomorrow.  \n  \nMy girlfriend was a big driving force behind my journey as of late, I had been going up and down and up and down but her believing in me when I didn't believe in myself. I used her support to push myself to make the right choices. In the end, it was about me saying no to myself. I always gave in when I craved something, I've learned how to say no. No is a powerful word, especially when you say it to yourself.\n  \nMy biggest ally (besides my loving girlfriend of course) has been carefully minding my intake with MFP.  \nProgram MFP with your macros and track them closely, every day I can nail them exactly it feels like a victory.  \nMake sure you eat vegetables too, I found I lost the most when I would make myself eat spinach and cauliflower and such.  \n  \nMy usual day is bulletproof coffee for breakfast (I use 2 tbsp of coconut oil, no butter, and 2 tbsp of sugar free hazelnut creamer, and a butt load of liquid sucralose), either a salad or something protein and fat balanced for lunch, and dinner high protein with veggies. If by the end of the day I'm low in something, I have contingency plans to make up fat or protein whichever I need to make up.  \n  \nMore advice, maltitol is the DEVIL.

        "body": "Well since people are asking, I found victory in building confidence and strength in every little victory. Whenever I would feel weak I would look at myself and challenge myself to fight it. I know it sounds cliche but I would just keep telling myself when I wanted to cheat on the diet, that I told myself I'd cheat tomorrow, and the next day I'd tell myself tomorrow.  \n  \nMy girlfriend was a big driving force behind my journey as of late, I had been going up and down and up and down but her believing in me when I didn't believe in myself. I used her support to push myself to make the right choices. In the end, it was about me saying no to myself. I always gave in when I craved something, I've learned how to say no. No is a powerful word, especially when you say it to yourself.\n  \nMy biggest ally (besides my loving girlfriend of course) has been carefully minding my intake with MFP.  \nProgram MFP with your macros and track them closely, every day I can nail them exactly it feels like a victory.  \nMake sure you eat vegetables too, I found I lost the most when I would make myself eat spinach and cauliflower and such.  \n  \nMy usual day is bulletproof coffee for breakfast (I use 2 tbsp of coconut oil, no butter, and 2 tbsp of sugar free hazelnut creamer, and a butt load of liquid sucralose), either a salad or something protein and fat balanced for lunch, and dinner high protein with veggies. If by the end of the day I'm low in something, I have contingency plans to make up fat or protein whichever I need to make up.  \n  \nMore advice, maltitol is the DEVIL.

Even though I am slightly active and try to always be moving, I chose ‘Sedentary’. Didn’t want to lie to myself.\nCool. So if I cut 500cals, that would guarantee 1lb loss/week. I went with 800-1000\n\nMyfitnesspal- Many options out there, but I had used in the past, and was comfortable with the interface.\nPlopped in my goals, macros being about 65%fat, the rest for protein.\nAT LEAST MY GOAL WEIGHT IN PROTEIN. 150g everyday. Minimum.\nSome days it was only 130g, but rarely. Big goal, protein.\nCarbs I wanted to cut hardcore (since I was eating fast food and a pint of ice cream a night), so I made a goal of 10 NET. \n\nI stayed between 8-13g NET RELIGIOUSLY.\nWith my morning cup of coffee, I would input my food for the day to see what I would be at. If I was under/over, I would readjust, ALWAYS hitting my macros and NEVER GOING OVER MY CALORIE LIMIT.\n\nThat was key, as there is only 1 way to lose weight: EAT LESS THAN YOU BURN.\nNot the other way around. That was my mantra, because if I ate more, I could lie to myself and say ‘ Oh, well I’ll just do extra cardio’. \nNope. Couldn’t trust myself.\n\nFOOD SCALE: This has been the biggest key to my 100lb loss. I WEIGH EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO MY MOUTH.\nEVERYTHING. If the macros look off, I give myself a buffer, always erring on the higher side, since US nutritional labels can be misleading.\n\nELECTROLYTES!!!!- Day 1. Read the FAQ here and bought Nu-Salt, Potassium Citrate, Salt.\n6500mg Potassium, 600 Magnesium, 1000mg Sodium daily. Mixed in a water bottle with Mio, and drank throughout the day.\n5 bottles in my fridge that I bring everywhere.\nSure, the Citrate makes me GO, but aim used to it now.\n\nAfter a few months and 40lbs lost, I made a new goal each month, with the first being CUT OUT ALL KETO-LABELED FOODS by educating myself on hidden and weird products/hidden sugars, and the Glycemic Index of sugars, especially the artificial ones.\nMaltodextrin, any type of modified starch,\nMaltitol, etc.\nI stick with monkfruit and erithritol. But in moderation.\n\nWorking out?\nI didn’t start until 70lbs lost, and then I dialed it back because it was making me retain water. I’ll get near my goal and up my game.\n\nCHEAT DAYS: None. Why cheat? I wanted to lose weight and change my diet. I miss ice cream and pizza, but going from 3xl to a loose large AND 46in jeans to 35in??? Awesome.\nIt was about changing my mindset.\nI eat a tasty fat bomb of cream cheese/cocoa/coconut oil/nuts EVERY NIGHT, and that hits my sweet tooth.\n\nAnd the biggest contributor?:\nINTERMITTENT FASTING and OMAD.\nI’ve been doing 16:8 since Day One. \nLife is life, and sometimes it would go over, but I ALWAYS fast for at least 4 hours BEFORE sleep, and AFTER waking.\nHormones, cortisol, digestion and stuff.\nMost of the time I eat the majority of calories with dinner, as I love food.\n1lb beef/chicken, and 12-16oz of broccoli are my go-to.\n\nThese are my tips and tricks that have netted AWESOME results. Everyone is different, but the main key to lose weight is BE IN A CALORIC DEFICIT!\nKeto is just a tool to help stay full.\n\nSo. There’s that.\nIf I can do it, anyone can. Just make a plan, don’t lie to yourself, TRACK/WEIGH EVERY PIECE OF FOOD THAT GOES INTO YOUR MOUTH. Just because you didn’t track it doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. :)\n\nLove\n\n ",

    "body": "Hi ladies! \n\nWell. It's been three years. Yes, three years. (With some breaks.) What have I learned, and what does my life look like today? I'M GLAD YOU ASKED. First, the stats (everything below has been true for at least the last year, besides my weight):\n\n1. I started at 156, and now I weigh in at 129. I dropped ten pounds the first 3 months, then took a break, then got back to it. Then another five pounds, and repeat. If I'm strict, I still find that it takes me about 3 months to drop ten pounds.\n\n2. I eat between 1200 and 1600 calories every day. \n\n3. I do bodyweight exercises... poorly. :) About 2x or 3x a week. And I might hike 1x a month. I barely even walk around town. Trying to change this. \n\n4. I do cheat MEALS, not days, roughly once a month, or maybe once every two months, but I don't plan them out. I actually NEVER plan to cheat. That way, if it's a really good opportunity, I'll do it and not feel guilty, and then it's right back to keto, usually the next meal. I NEVER eat two non-keto meals in a row. \n\n5. For the first few weeks, I counted calories all the time, and then I only did lazy keto for years, just trying to keep my carbs under 30g a day. Now I only count calories once in awhile. Actually, it's more accurate to say that I usually count calories in the morning so I know what I'm looking at for dinner, and then I guess on dinner. If I only have 200 calories left, for example, it's good to know that ahead of time. \n\n6. If my weight is creeping up, I make sure to count meticulously on weekends! Weekends can be a killer. \n\n7. I'm still too likely to overdo the protein!  Especially when I don't count calories carefully. Trying to change THAT.\n\n8. I supplement a lot. At least potassium salt in water, and magnesium at night. Bone broth. Zinc. Probiotics. And a bunch of nootropics.\n\n9. Whike we're talking about fat: Cocoa butter? Coconut oil? Grass fed butter? Sure, but just ONE of those per day! A day in which I have two protein bars and coffee with heavy cream and Brie and ice cream will be a day that I inevitably go over. \n\n9a. You can't live on cheese, fat, fake sugar, and caffeine. Sadly. I've tried many times. You end up feeling AWFUL. I have to eat meat and some salad at least once a day, and the more meals I do, the better I feel. \n\n10. Keto does not mean, nor will it ever mean, that I can eat almond butter by the jar. (More on this in a second.)\n\nAnd now, the philosophy:\n\n1. I'm still keto. I got into it to lose weight, real talk, and then I felt so great that I just kept going. Keto4lyfe. \n\n2. I will forever watch what I eat. My boyfriend is a 26 year old construction worker, and HE watches what he eats. Ladies, we all work sedentary jobs and we live in a fast food world. Part of these privileged lives we lead is the fact that we're bored a lot of the time, and calories are cheap in this world. The idea that you'll never have to watch what you eat became extinct around the time of the passenger pigeon. There's worse things in this world. \n\n3. People do have questions occasionally. My excuse, when I need one, is that lowering my sugar intake stabilizes my moods. No one ever questions this. \n\n4. I've dated on keto, and also lived with two different partners, both guys. I feel like any adult understands point number 2. They might not eat the same way you do, but they understand the concept of watching what you eat. My current boyfriend does think it's pretty weird that I scrape the toppings off the pizza, but that doesn't bother me. Of course, your mileage on that may vary.\n\n5. Know. Your. Patterns. If you want to make keto easier, get into a routine with known calorie counts and eat that for several weeks. Then switch it up. \n\n6. Know what substitutes work for you! I make soul bread about once a quarter. I eat a ton of Halo Top, and too many protein bars, especially the Quest Hero bars. I have low carb quesadillas in the fridge, but I don't always use them. I have Healthy Noodle in the fridge, but I don't always use those, either. Same for cauliflower rice. Even so,\n\n6a. STOCK STUFF IN YOUR HOME. It's SO much easier to stick to the plan if I know I can recreate whatever is tempting me when I go home! Have all the substitutes and all the fats and the whey protein ready to go. \n\n6b. If you're going to be some place with a lot of crappy desserts and a lot of time on your hands, for the love of God eat a big meal and bring chocolate protein bars. \n\nAnd finally, things I DON'T do that I want to try!\n\n1. Fat bombs on a regular basis. So much better for you, and more keto, than protein bars!\n\n2. Intermittent fasting. I just got into this and I like it very much. Started at 12 hours, and after a week, I'm getting up to 16. \n\nLOVE TO ALL,\nKCKO.\n\nAddition: Wow, thanks ladies! Glad it was helpful, and thanks for all the wonderful feedback. I will add: something I'm still bad at is drinking enough water. And I get headaches because of it. Don't repeat my mistake! Also when I eat closer to 1600 calories, I end up about 135. Eating 1200, I still lose, even below 129. So I can probably settle on 1300 or 1400 to maintain. And yes, it's that precise. \n\nAlso: go with stevia whenever you can. It's worth the money. Down with fake sugars! Some of that shit gives you cancer. Maltitol bloats me. I have no problem with konjac. And I eat potassium salt because the supplements make my stomach hurt.\n\nOkay, that's seriously enough now, carry on! \n\nOh gods, I can't stop: I believe very sincerely that you should measure your macros by grams, not by percentage, and keep your net carbs under 20 and your protein at half your body weight in grams. NOW REALLY DONE. ",

So for these products you have to add the dietary fiber back into net carbs. \n\nApparently Quest used to use IMO but was forced to change to Soluble Corn Fiber, so the newer Quest protein bars & cookies appear to be fine. The Quest Hero bars using Allulose also appear to be ok as 1g of allulose only digests as about 0.1g of net carbs.\n\nAtkins products are a huge mixed bag. Many use maltitol, which is terrible and a net carb. Others have vegetable glycerin and polydextrose which I'm not sure about.\n\nPersonally I had fallen into a rut of eating a ton of these protein bars and keto snacks and unknowingly set my progress back a lot. :( I'm going to try to stick to real food more often and save these kinds of bars for emergency snacks.",

Men and women experience keto differently. Hormones matter\n2. Find out how much fat works for you. Not everyone needs or will benefit from MCT etc. \n3. Always prioritise protein\n4. The older you get the more impact your calorific intake has. One can put on weight on keto. \n5. Keto is not magic. You still have to sort out your sleep, caffeine intake, and exercise. \n6. Sober keto is much more effective for weight loss. \n\nGood luck!",

About the only liar food product I do occasionally use is a tortilla and I keep the total carb count for it in mind.  I use lots of seasonings and real food combinations to achieve tasty satisfying meals.   Artificial sweeteners create cravings in me so I envy those who can drink “diet” soda or water flavorings because I just “chase” the sweet with more food, that may not be a issue for you.   Suggestion is for you to try a very easy short personal experiment, cut out all artificial sweeteners for a couple of weeks and be cognizant of the impact on your “desire “ for sweets.  Speaking of liars… I have lied to myself all of my life about portions especially salad dressing.  I began to use one of the multiple measuring spoons I bought especially for this purpose, measuring out salad dressing or other condiments.  I eat much much less cheese and almost no peanut butter because they are snacks that are a portion control problem for me and there are much better sources of protein.   I am eating collard greens and sausages for my dinner today!    At the end of the day I’m still an only lightly active short old lady and calories matter.   Have fun !!!!",

I am actually eating meals. Before I had snacks throughout the day, hardly having a huge meal. Now, I make a big breakfast every day along with a lunch. The habit of making food is becoming more familiar and I actually have energy throughout the day.\n\n3. Loss of cravings, unnecessary hunger. As I said I was a huuuuge snacker. Chips here, cookie there, toast here, frappe there, crackers here. Now I just have breakfast, sometimes a cheese stick or salami, lunch, then a dinner shake. I eat, I get satisfied, and I stay full.\n\n4. Saving so much money on not eating out. Me and my SO would get lazy and eat out probably 3-8 times a week, whether it was fast food or restaurant or dessert place it still cost a lot. Since I've start we've gone out 4 times, to Chipotle and In-N-Out. This is a huge deal, lots of money saved\n\n5. Actually learn about nutrition and what goes in my body. It's pretty sad that growing up in the American education system I was never taught about diet and how healthy a person should actually eat. All I heard was LOW FAT and DIET ITEMS. I would eat blindly, because you know, the tumblr post said I should eat what I want it's my body. I have learned and continue to learn about nutrition which is an exciting thing. \n\n6. You lose carvings for sweets. Okay, trust me, I was (deep inside still am) the most sweet tooth ever. My mummy had sweets a lot when I was in the womb but I can't blame that. I have a cavity on every teeth. My aunt found me with my hand in the sugar at 5 in the morning when I was 8. I'm a huge baker so I make things and then eat them all. I Love Love Love Love Love sweets. So when I learned about Keto I was distraught. No way can me and my bbz sugar break up, no way. But I did. And it was terrible. And I missed it and looked up substitute recipes and made them to satisfy my sweet tooth. \n                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n\n I learned the consequences of Maltitol. I learned the goodness of Erythritol. But now, even after I make the recipes, I don't even crave to have them as much. I just made a whole batch of keto cookies and was fine just eating one, because I didn't crave it that much anymore. I would literally eat a whole box of Chewy Chocolate Chip cookies, and now I'm fine with just one? \"I don't believe you\" Me neither! But you will get there. Trust. From one sugar addict to another. Your first weeks will be sadness and dreams of carbs, but the addiction will slowly wear off, and you'll feel better. :)\n\n7. You just feel better about yourself. You're not just daily thinking, \"I should stop binge eating, I shouldn't have one more cookie, I shouldn't go have that crepe, I shouldn't be eating this whole tub of ice cream by myself, I should be doing something about my health, etc...\" I've been, for years, saying how tomorrow I'm going to start. Tomorrow I'm going to cut this out of my life, tomorrow I'm going to start that exercise plan, but never ever stuck to it. Which made me feel bummed which made me eat more. Now, even though I'm very slowly losing weight compared to other stories, I just feel good. Good that I'm doing something to help my body heal from the years of sugar and unhealthy eating. Good that I'm sticking to it, not having a cheat day, not once cheating because I couldn't handle it. It feels good to do something good for yourself. So whether it takes months or years, I'm doing it. I'm making a change and I'm sticking to it. \n\n8. Bacon. All of it.\n\n\nSo if you're on the brink of when to join, just do it. It's okay if you mess up or if you found out that there's carbs in carrots after snacking on them or if you used the wrong tortilla on your birthday...But as long as you get back on track and get back on your feet and stick to the plan, then you're fine. That's what /r/keto is for, to ask questions. Or to look for help when you're feeling unmotivated. Or when you have a success story. Trust me when I say you're not only going to get weight loss from Keto, you're going to get so much more.",

    "body": "So MIL was babysitting 11 month old LO a couple of hours yesterday... When we came to pick him up she said everything \"went fine, except he does have a bruise on his forehead, from falling one time on the door threshold\" (I have told her to watch out for thresholds and to keep her hands under LO's armpits when walking over them so that she can catch him if he falls...) \n\nWhen we arrived home I saw that LO has 2 bruises from falling on his head, one bruise on each leg, and one small bruise on his bum. A total of 5 bruises. He did not get all of these from falling just once! I showed it to my SO and he was very angry at his mom for obviously lying and obviously not looking after LO correctly. He said he will go home and tell her today that if she doesn't do better than that we won't let her babysit again. I'm very concerned about the lying. \n\nAlso when we came she said she knows we don't want LO eating sugar until he's atleast 3 years old (and even then we will be very strict with sugar ) so she bought and gave him some \"sugar free cookies\" as soon as I heard \"sugar free\" I asked to see the box. She pulls out a \"sugar free digestive\" box. It contains both isomalt and maltitol.... Both of them affects blood sugar just as much as sugar does, and sweeteners have other bad side effects on the body. Honestly I'm  more against sweeteners than I am sugar so I told her not to give him any more. She said she didn't know they contained sweeteners.... I mean who gives a baby new food without reading the package??  I just don't understand WHY she has to give a baby something sweet, she eats SO much sugar herself it's unbelievable. She believes digestive cookies are \"healthy\" and \"good for the intestines\" since \"they contain oats\" so she eats them every day, especially the ones covered in chocolate. Then she wonders why she won't loose weight... We have alredy told her not to give LO juice, milk, soda, cake or ice cream and she is obsessed with giving LO juice since \"all her kids had juice when growing up\"...  And I mean WHY did she just HAVE to give him cookies the very first time babysitting alone? She obviously just can't stop herself!! \n\nI just needed to went somewhere. SO is angry but ofc wants to give her more chances since she's his mom. But I feel like she won't ever respect us or what we tell her about how to care for LO. \n\nOne funny thing though, she has been talking to SO like she is way better taking care of babies than I am, being very judgy about my parenting, to the point that he believes his mom is some kind of expert on taking care of babies. But now he saw her struggle with basic stuff like changing a diaper, giving LO sweeteners, sending him home with bruises and lying, and also he had chapped lips so she hasn't been giving him enough water. So now SO clearly sees who is taking the best care of LO and it is definitely me, not his mom. i'm happy he has shown a bit of shiny spine in this, usually he's a big momma's boy. \n\nI will try to minimize the time MIL and LO spends together to a minimum,  definitely when alone",

That way grandma has the approved snacks and maybe if grandma likes to bake, you can give a recipe for oatmeal cookies (that is without honey or sugar, but with just raisins, dates and cinnamon for sweetness) to make together with LO.\n\nIn regards to the lying: definitely address it. But in regards of continued having your hands under his armpits I think that could be a bit too much. Kids build self-esteem by doing it themselves, also the falling part (as long as it isn't dangerous ofcourse). But 5 bruises in one sitting is definitely way too much!",

We never left our first with my in laws (with out us) until she was about 1.5 years old. LO had been dairy free since she was 5 months old.  They let a 1.5 year old eat 2 pieces of cheese pizza because they never believed us. She vomited all night.  They weren’t going to tell us! My plans changed so I ‘surprised’ picked her up the next morning so she was still visibly not feeling well. I was talking to LO and could see something was off. I kept pushing and asking all kinds of questions and finally my MIL caved and said that FIL (deflecting blame) gave her pizza.  I lost it. I told her off.  She was over  3 years old before we let her stay the night again. When we knew LO could say no and knew what she could and couldn’t eat. \n\nMIL is still a pain in the ass and is a complete know it all. The only plus side is my husband will call her out and I don’t have to be the mean DIL. \n\nIt’s really just weird to me. My family just doesn’t behave like that.

They sell ice cream bars with anywhere from 3-8g of net carbs in each bar.\n\nWe picked up the chocolate peanut butter and salted caramel swirl and were amazed! Usually low carb ice creams are more \"icey\" than \"creamy\" like Artic zero. This brand however was extremely creamy. They each had a ribbon of peanut butter or caramel swirled inside it that tasted like the real thing. They've got many more flavors too!\n\nBest of all, no maltitol which means no stomach aches!\n\nWe found ours in Pathmark, though they should also be in some Stop and Shops.\n\nThe only con is that they're a little pricey.

    "body": "* **Meal prep, meal prep, meal prep** \\- if you're like me and work an office job, meal prepping is extremely helpful for keeping yourself on track. I plan next's week's menu every Friday night and make a list of what I need, shop for said ingredients on Saturday, and meal prep on Sundays. This has been one of, if not the biggest keys to my success so far.\n* **Keep it simple when you're just starting** \\- don't get overwhelmed by all of the recipes out there. Focus on meat, chicken, cheese, eggs, butter, bacon, avocado and green veggies like broccoli and spinach. Riced cauliflower will also be a very close friend of yours. Once you've got keto down, you can always branch out to other recipes.\n* **Track your macros and keep your electrolytes up, especially when you start keto** \\- this will help you avoid keto flu. You'll find yourself peeing so much that you lose a lot of electrolytes, which in turn can mean keto flu.\n* **Speaking of electrolytes \\- If you've got a muscle cramp/feel light\\-headed, you're likely low on electrolytes.**Quick fix is to drink pickle juice \\- it's full of electrolytes and will help your symptoms subside rather quickly. But make sure you are also taking daily supplements to get in those electrolytes \\- potassium, sodium, and magnesium.\n* **Make sure your sugar\\-free candy does not have maltitol in it.** It will leave you shitting your brains out and will spike your blood sugar. As tempting as those Albanese sugar\\-free gummy bears are, it's not worth sitting on the toilet for hours and then stalling on the scale. Trust me, I speak from experience on this \\(and damn those gummy bear for being so good\\). Stick with sweeteners like erythritol or stevia. Liquid sucralose is also okay to consume.\n* **Drink plenty of water!** If you don't like water on its own, invest in some Mio to squirt in there. Also, add pink Himalayan salt to your water for extra electrolytes. It tastes GREAT with Mio, especially Blue Raspberry \\(I may or may not be drinking it at work right now\\).\n* **Do not let the scale dictate your success \\- weight loss is NOT linear.** I repeat, WEIGHT LOSS IS NOT LINEAR. Trust the process and keep going \\- do not give up. I have had many frustrations and stalls, but I have pushed through them every time.\n* **Take full\\-body photos of yourself on your first day of keto, and keep taking photos along the way.** You will be SO happy you did this, even if you hate how you look at the beginning/try to avoid full\\-body photos. I have not heard of many people regretting taking a day 1 photo \\- most people regret not taking a before photo.\n* **Bake your bacon in large batches** \\- set the oven to 400, lay your bacon strips in a pan on tin foil, bake for \\~15 minutes \\(depending on your bacon's thickness\\). Oven bacon is the best way to make bacon taste\\-wise and time\\-wise.\n* **If you're starting off larger like me, break your weight loss goals into mini\\-goals** \\- it's way less daunting and keeps you motivated when you hit smaller goals. I like the Happy Scale app for this because it breaks your weight loss goals up into little chunks for you to focus on.\n* **Have goal clothing along the way** \\- it is such an amazing feeling to be able to fit into clothes that were too tight when you started, but now fit. Take pictures each time you try it on \\- it's super cool to see how it fits better and better each time.\n* **Costco \\(if you can swing it\\), is your friend** \\- my go\\-to items are Kerrygold butter, Aidell's chicken sausages \\(I like the Bacon, Mushroom, and swiss\\), blocks of cheese \\(shred it yourself and save a carb per serving vs. buying pre\\-shredded\\), Sukhi's coconut chicken curry \\(4g net carbs per serving, serve it over riced cauliflower\\), 88&#37; ground beef \\(I take the 6 pounds and put it into 1 gallon bags, flatten it out for easy storage in the freezer\\), steaks, rotisserie chicken, eggs, nuts \\(stick with macadamia, almonds, or pecans\\)\n* **Trader Joe's is another favorite** \\- my go\\-to items are the mozzarella cheese, roasted and salted pecans \\(these are my FAVORITE nut to snack on\\), heavy cream, eggs, uncured dry rubbed bacon \\(this is my FAVORITE bacon \\- I will go to TJ's just to get this bacon and nothing else\\), pork belly, gyro meat \\(this is a little higher carb than I prefer but still decent\\), chopped onions, jalapenos, mashed cauliflower, riced cauliflower\n* **Don't try fasting until you're fat adapted** \\- fasting is great for breaking plateaus, but should not be done from the start. Your body will let you know when it's ready.\n* **BPC \\(bulletproof coffee\\) is NOT required on keto** \\- but it can be a fantastic breakfast replacement. I drink it during the work week and it gives me fantastic energy, keeps me full until lunch, and makes it so I don't have to meal prep breakfast. Some people prefer to eat their calories, and that's okay, too!\n* **If you go off keto after being on it for a while, you'll find that your body starts to crave being on keto.** So get right back to it \\- your body will thank you for it.\n* **Join instagram or this subreddit for support** \\- you will find if you surround yourself by other ketoers, you'll be inspired, you'll find great recipes, and you'll get support for when you're struggling. This has been a HUGE key to my success and I've made some amazing friends through instagram.\n* **Make fathead pizza** \\- it's delicious and is a keto game\\-changer. So is chicken crust pizza and pizza casserole. Keto pizza is so good.\n* **If you are craving something that is non\\-keto, and you can't shake that craving \\- research keto\\-friendly versions of whatever it is you're craving.** This has helped me out quite a few times when I've been hit with a serious craving. 90 second bread has swooped in for the save when I am really wanting a breakfast sandwich, or even a grilled cheese. That being said, you'll find yourself craving non\\-keto foods less and less as time goes on.\n* **Invest in a good kitchen scale and weigh everything you eat.** You'll be surprised at how much you THINK a 4 ounce serving is vs. what a 4 ounce serving is.\n* **Don't force yourself to exercise right away.** For many of us who are starting keto and have been pretty sedentary, we should focus on changing what we eat first. Adding in exercise can be a bit overwhelming for some. I did not add in exercise until nearly 11 months into keto \\(as in, back to the gym 2 days ago\\). Weight loss comes from your diet \\- add in exercise when you're ready and consider it just to benefit your overall health vs. weight loss. Also, don't get discouraged when you add in exercise if you stall/gain on the scale for a few weeks. Your body is adjusting to moving a LOT more than it did before.\n* **Celebrate scale victories and non\\-scale victories** \\- NSV are actually my favorites. Do you know how good it felt to be on a plane again and not require a seatbelt extender? Or how good it felt to fit into that sweatshirt I bought last year and could barely hit over my stomach? Or how about being able to actually use the rowing machine at the gym because my stomach isn't in the way? The scale is not everything. Celebrate these moments and BE PROUD.",

    "body": "My wife and I have been Keto since mid-December, aiming for under 25g net carbs. We've been getting plenty of extra electrolytes, drinking extra water, and carefully tracking all our food. During this time we've seen some results, losing weight and feeling better, but then gaining weight back and feeling awful. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTried so hard to figure out the problem, lowering net carbs to 20 the last couple weeks, not going out to eat at all to be sure of what we're having, using a food scale, etc. We're at the point of giving up as we don't know what else to try, but the last thing we wanted to test was eliminating all sugar alcohols. Suddenly I remember reading about the different sugar alcohols when we first went keto, and I sprint to the kitchen to check our sugar-free snacks. ALL OF THEM HAD MALTITOL!. Sugar free Reeses, Russel Stover Sugar Free, Werther's Sugar Free, \"2g net carb\" snack bars from Aldi. We've each been getting 20-30g of net carbs a day from these, kicking ourselves out of ketosis and going back through keto flu over and over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSO excited to give it another few weeks without them, and hopefully we finally see the consistent weight loss and elevated energy that everyone on here raves about. Don't be us, check your sugar alcohols!",

I'm a businessman, so naturally, I took the opportunity to cash in on this deal. I had the suggested serving size of 3 peanut butter cups as soon as I got to my car (yes, I'm a fatass). Now, it is approaching midnight (PST), and I have to be up for work early in the am. But my stomach will not let me rest my weary mind and body. Upon further research on threads as old as 9 years ago, it appears that it is the maltitol in these candies that are causing me my discomfort. Somehow this happens once a year and I forget about it a week later. I still have the full bag, and I don't want it to go to waste. Would it be malicious of me to bring them to work for my coworkers to enjoy?",

We can make *more* ethical decisions, but realistically, the labor that goes into getting us \"good\" foods is also heavily exploited. I once tried to hire a teenager to \"work\" in an air conditioned office in the US (it was an internship where she was looking at tweets, nothing strenuous) and she had more protections than a younger farm worker. Farm work is exempt from a lot of labor laws, or the standards are less stringent. You can be hired as a farm worker as young as 12 years old in the US, and many farms don't have OSHA visit them because they're not big enough, so untrained workers end up using machinery in an unsafe manner because they're not taught how to use it.

I have a different experience, if i dont withhold myself from those foods i find myself in a never ending binge- chocolate for example, one small block of it and the next thing i know its an entire bar and then two, and then the excruciatingly massive urge to buy chocolate at every corner. It becomes almost impossible for me to think about anything else. If i dont restrict myself\nCompletely it ultimately ends up in a massive binge. I know my triggers- and its quite literally anything processed and sweet. Chocolate, marshmallows, cereal, sugary drinks ect. They send me spiraling and CRAVING for days. As hard as it is it is definitely much easier for me im the ling run to completely abstain from any type of processed sweet in order to *Avoid a relapse in bingeing. So in that regard i do veiw them as bad foods. Not only because of the ingredients and the fact that they are inherently unhealthy for your body/digestive system ect- but because of their affect on my disorder. I dont see anything wrong with eating those things in moderation if it does not affect you negatively or cause you to spiral. \nIn the same regard though im sure there are some people out there who refrain from eating what would be considered “good” foods because of their affect on their binging. I know i had a problem with rotisserie chicken a while ago, while its not necessarily a “bad” food, it was for me because i couldnt not stop myself from eating the entire chicken in one sitting. Taking it out the equation completely was the best way for me to avoid binges, it doesnt mean it has to be forever, in time i was able to add it back in and and stay within a healthy limit- however when it comes to sweet things im not sure i will ever be able to have them in just “moderation”. Which is why for the forseeable future they are MY “bad” foods that i stay away from at all costs.",

It depends so much on the individual. Some people do best with moderation, and find that completely cutting foods triggers cravings or binging. For them, moderation likely is best! But for me, there are some foods that I find unsatisfying in the moderate quantities that would fit in my diet, and that tend to trigger cravings or binging once I start eating them. For me, the easiest time to stop eating those foods is before the first bite. The next easiest time is … well, never, because I want to eat them continuously. For years I bought into the idea that moderation is ALWAYS best and tried to keep those foods in my life — and the result was like cutting down to one cigarette a day, rather than quitting: it was just enough to keep me constantly in a miserable state of craving and withdrawal. I feel much better just fully cutting them, or putting them on my “foods I only eat outside the home or on certain days” list. \n\nActually, this week I binged three times — for the first time in 13 months — and it was because I felt peer pressured to try a moderation approach to a few foods that I had cut because they were triggers. That did not work well for me!",

        "body": "In my opinion, value judgements are not helpful.  There are healthy foods, there are less healthy foods, there are unhealthy foods, but none of those foods are \"good\" or \"bad\".  When we start to view food as \"good\" or \"bad\", by extension we start to view ourselves as \"good\" or \"bad\" when we eat them/crave them, and that headspace is where eating disorders thrive.\n\nLeafy dark green vegetables are very healthy - they provide a ton of nutrition and they're risk free outside of the occasional recalls for bacteria or what have you.  AND some people don't like them, and struggle to eat them.\n\nDonuts are unhealthy - they provide very little to no nutrition, and they are full of sugar and other things that our bodies don't really need.  AND a lot of people really enjoy them, and struggle with cravings for them.\n\nTo call leafy dark green vegetables \"good\" implies that people who don't like them are \"bad\" ; to call donuts \"bad\" implies that people who like them are \"bad\".  It doesn't matter whether or not that's your intention - that's the implication.  It's also an invitation for shame, and shame is a huge trigger for disordered eating.\n\nI do get where you're coming from - there are definitely foods that are very unhealthy and unwise to consume.  There are foods that have no nutritional value whatsoever and wreak havoc on our bodies.  But often they bring enjoyment and do have some value outside of the context of nutrition.  When we deny ourselves the things we enjoy and call ourselves bad for enjoying them, we experience shame and self hatred, which makes us less likely to make healthy choices.  It's a spiral, and it's very easy to get caught in.  \n\nWhen we instead work to be in a mindset without value judgements, we can make choices based on what we actually want which is much more sustainable than chasing \"objective\" ideals.  Personally, I want to be healthy.  I want to play tag with my kid.  I want to breathe easily.  I want to spend time outside, go for walks, go fishing.  I want all of that, and because I want that, I am willing to do what I need to do to be healthy - to take care of my body.  In my case, that means more iron, more fiber, less sugar, more exercise.  I'm not working towards being good anymore, I'm working towards feeling good in my own body.  And sometimes what my body needs is a treat.  Yesterday my kid made cookies with me, so I ate some cookies.  Are they healthy?  Absolutely not.  But I got value out of them, I felt good about myself, and I moved on.  In the past, where I assigned value judgements to food, I might've felt guilty for eating cookies or felt like I needed to make up for it or felt like \"well I've been bad anyway I might as well eat more\".  Now they're just some cookies.",

Me, being blissfully unaware of my digestive tracks fate decided to watch television, when I hear a thunderstorm, coming from my lower intestine, when hits me, is \"Maltitol in the fucking ice breakers?\" I push my sorry ass into the other room to look at the empty canister of icebreakers. I then mutter the most fitting word in this situation \"Fuck\" I guarantee it does not take too much imagination as to the anal rupture that occurred that night. It was a horrifying mess of all kinds of horrid sound, I feared for my life. There is nothing to tell here but a cautionary tale. For those fleeing from those hell bears, be aware of the Ice breakers, you never know when all hell could break loose.",

    "body": "***Edit! -*** u/BerdLaw *linked me t**hree* *studies on sake -- one specifically about sake extract.* *I've linked them all in the sources below.*\n\n*One in vitro (meaning in a dish or tube) study showed that rice wine increased  \"the expression of procollagen and laminin-5,\"\\*⁴ which is one of the key components in the intercellular makeup of the layer that holds the epidermis to the dermis. Additionally, \"laminin 5 also accelerates the assembly of basement membranes and may enhance the recovery of damaged skin.\"⁵* *In the same study, experiments were done on hairless mice (in vivo) and showed that topical application protected the mouse from photo-aging.*\n\n*Another study* *show**ed* *that sake extract inhibited tyrosinase, both in vivo (in a living organism) and in vitro, though it is unclear how many subjects were involved based on the abstract alone.⁶*\n\n*More notes: First study comes from Doosan Group R&D, which seems primarily interested in vehicles, construction, electrical, etc., while the second study was paid for by AMOREPACIFIC R&D.*\n\nHiyas!\n\nMany of you love Kiku's High Moist, so I picked it up the last time I went to my local Murakai market in SoCal so I could try it out and figure out what all the hype was about.\n\nThis is a bit of a review slash ingredient breakdown, so I hope you enjoy!\n\n\\---\n\n>*Full Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol ,* ***Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake)****, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Leucine,* ***Ceramide 3***, ***Ceramide 6***, ***Placental Protein***, ***Arbutin***\\*\\*,\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (Licorice Root Extrac\\*\\*\\*\\*t)\\**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein, Maltitol, Methyl Gluceth-10, Peg-6 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Fragrance.*\n\nI've highlighted the ingredients that are worth discussing a bit in detail.\n\n# Ingredient Breakdown\n\nSake is a fermented product made from [rice](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/01/sake-rice-how-sake-is-made-rice-varieties-brewing-sake.html), [water](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-school-the-importance-of-water-in-sake-making-where-does-sake-come-from.html), [koji](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/koji-the-miracle-mold-how-sake-is-made.html), and [yeast](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-yeast-temperature-yeast-strains.html). Ferments have been all the rage recently, with *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (living yeast) extract and *Saccharomyces ferment* being the two I see the most. While I could not find any clinical dermatology studies done on sake as a ferment in skin, we may be able to glean some understanding into the benefits of sake by examining both ferments and koji (kojic acid) itself.\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of yeast used for brewing beer. In one study, saccharomyces cerevisiae extract (SCE) was studied in several formulations. One contained SCE, and/or vitamins A, C, and E, and was patch-tested on the back of volunteers. The subjects were then tested for transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin moisture (SM), skin microrelief (SMR), and free radical protection in 3 hour, 15 days, and 30 day intervals.\n\n>*\"Our results suggest that vitamins and SCE showed effects in \\[skin moisture\\] SM and \\[skin microrelief\\] SMR. Only formulations containing SC had long term effects in the improvement of SMR. Thus, these kinds of evaluations are very important in cosmetics development to evaluate the best risk and benefit correlation.\"¹*\n\nAnother fungi ferment, saccharomyces ferment, has similar benefits. It is obtained through the fermentation of saccharomyces - a genus of fungi that is known as the baker's yeast - in the presence of metal ions. The yeast is credited with promoting good skin condition and is frequently found in products that reduce redness.\n\nThe other half of sake worth discussing, koji (kojic acid) is a skin-lightening agent and antioxidant. It is a tyrosinase (an enzyme that controls the production of melanin) inhibitor, but not as effective as other tyrosinase inhibitors like licorice extract. \"In combination with allantoin and other proper ingredients in sunscreen preparations, the mixture can inhibit UV-caused erythema and accelerate wound healing.\"² Unfortunately, it can also be sensitizing to some skin and create irritation.\n\nFrom this break down, we can assume that sake contains some sort of very mild exfoliating, humectant, and whitening properties, though it is important to keep in mind that there are no studies that I could find into the benefits of sake when applied topically, so this is all assumptions based on the chemical makeup.\n\nThe next ingredients on the list are ceramides 3 and 6. If you've been following my writings, you already know that ceramides are naturally found in the skin and help maintain the skin barrier. In fact, our skin's natural lipids are 35-40&#37; ceramides.\n\nSlightly more exciting is placental protein. Derived from animal placenta ([in this case, horse](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5fgonk/psa_kikumasamune_does_not_use_ingredient_derived/)), it is considered to be a safe ingredient that does not deliver any metabolic or endocrine activity. Again though, there was not much precedent that I could find on the benefits of including this ingredient specifically, however egg whites have been used for centuries on skin to make skin temporarily feel tighter and appear smoother.\n\n*Fun fact: Umbilical extract has precedent for unrestricted use in Japan, except for certain products.³*\n\nFinally, we arrive at the stars of this product: arbutin and licorice root extract. Arbutin, an ingredient primarily used for it's antioxidant properties as well as skin bleaching. It is a natural hydroquinone, derived synthetically or from bearberry plants. Once on the skin, it converts into hydroquinone and acts as a tyrosinase inhibitor. While not as effective as hydroquinone, it lacks the concerns of hydroquinone thus has become more popular in recent years.\n\nLicorice root extract is similarly a tyrosinase inhibitor as well as an anti-irritant - with some studies signalling that it may be able to absorb UVA and UVB rays. It is more effective than kojic acid and some studies put it at 75x more effective than ascorbic acid ([though Dr Dray raises some interesting points regarding the efficacy of L-AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JxO6sVMJzM)). \"The chief constituent of licorice root is glycyrrhizin, present in concentrations that range from 5 to 24 percent depending on the variety of licorice used.\"²\n\n# My Experience\n\n**My skin type:** Rosacean, acne-prone and extremely irritation-prone\n\nFirstly, the pump on my bottle broke off rather spectacularly when my bottle took a tumble from my tiny bathroom counter top. I'm not sure why this product comes with a pump applicator in the first place, as it frequently would dispense more product than I needed, which I suppose is fine as I was able to spread it down my neck and chest, but it was still was a bit of a shock to get a whole handful of it on the first pump. This experience doesn't seem limited to me, so I really recommend decanting this product into a better dispenser if you can, like a spritz top bottle.\n\nPackaging aside, the first time I used the High Moist lotion, I was pretty nervous. It's a very runny product, sharing a consistency with water, and if you've read my blog at all you know that I am a fairly dry-skinned lady. To my surprise and delight though, it was *uber* moisturizing. I applied it fresh out of the shower, in place of my HadaLabo Premium, and instantly my skin just felt soft and supple. I imagine much of this is due to the placenta protein filling in the gaps of the skin cells and creating a \"smooth\" texture as well as the ceramides, which tend to plump up my skin and make it feel softer.\n\nThe fragrance was also so mild that frankly, the smell of sake overpowered it. Thankfully this smell seemed to dissipate after a few minutes of application, and my rosacea did not flare up from the inclusion of fragrance. Over the next few days, I used the High Moist in place of my HadaLabo, and then began to combine it at night with the HadaLabo Premium on top. It worked well with oils and other moisturizing products on top - no pilling or strange film to report.\n\nIn two weeks, my skin looked brighter and felt smoother, though none of my dark spots had faded. Unfortunately, like most products with ferments, it began to break me out after this time. The good news though is that it doesn't appear to break me out immediately, unlike every other ferment, and the smoothness lasted for a few days after I discontinued use, which means I may try to use it sparingly once my skin heals.\n\n# Sources\n\n1.

    "body": "I bought the Glucose Goddess book when it came out a few months ago and found it pretty useful. Below I am putting the 10 hacks she mentions in the book hoping that people in this forum who don't have the book might find it useful. Please note these are neither medical advice nor my words not promotion for the book and all credits go to the Glucose Goddess author Jessie Inchauspe :)\n\n#1: Eat food in the right order: veggies first, protein second and carbs at the end. Eating fibers first slows down the absorption of carbs and therefore decreases the likelihood of a glucose spike.\n\n#2: Add a green starter to all your meals: The goal is to include more fiber in your meals which prevents a glucose spike.\n\n#3:Stop counting calories: Foods that are high in glucose could be low in calories and food high in calories could be low in carb but more fulfilling and beneficial for our body. For example a donut and cup of yogurt both contain 150 calories but the donut will cause a glucose spike but the yogurt will not because of the protein and fat content.\n\n#4: Flatten your breakfast curve: cereal with milk, fruit smoothie, muesli and fruit juice all cause a big glucose spike.A good breakfast that won't cause a glucose spike is usually savory and contains a good amount of fiber, fat, protein and optional starch and fruit. Our body is very sensitive to glucose following breakfast because it has been in a fasting state for a long time. Also, given how well maintained the glucose spike was after breakfast- our body is better able to manage the blood glucose level for the rest of the day. See image for examples.\n\n#5: All types of sugar are the same: Basically there is no difference between maple syrup, honey and white or brown sugar. One is not healthier than the other when it comes to causing glucose spikes. The best types of sweeteners that have no side effects on glucose and insulin levels are: Allulose, monk fruit sweetener, stevia (pure stevia extract), erythritol. Artificial sweeteners recommended to avoid are aspartame, maltitol., sucralose, xylitol, acesulfame-k.\n\n#6: Pick a dessert over a sweet snack: Taking a sweet snack over an empty stomach causes glucose spikes. If you are craving something sweet, take it after a meal as a dessert. \n\n#7: Reach for vinegar before you eat: Taking 1 tablespoon of vinegar in a tall glass of water taken before the meal (with a straw to avoid causing problems with tooth enamel) decreases the glucose spike. The acetic acid in vinegar temporarily deactivates alpha-amylase which is an enzyme that turns food into glucose in our body. Additionally, acetic acid encourages our muscle to take glucose faster than the bloodstream without releasing additional insulin. \n\n#8: After you eat, move: Doing a 20 minutes exercise within 70 minutes after a meal is shown to reduce glucose spikes.\n\n#9: If you have to snack, go savory: Most popular snacks like potato chips, granola bars etc are carb heavy and cause a glucose spike when taken as a snack. See the attached image for savory snack suggestions.\n\n#10: Put some clothes on the carb: When you have to get something on the go, choose meals that combine starches/ sugars with fat, protein and fiber. Basically putting some clothes on the carb and not taking them alone. Example, some apple/ pear with nut butter.\n\nGood luck!",

        "body": "The fact about not counting cals isn't that good no one is going to be that consistent with choosing the right carbs everytime so counting calories is a very good tool that releases your hands and you can eat what you can enjoy in moderation so you are free to eat what you like while being aware and control yourself you can't eat the exact same calories everyday by going blindly  not counting people can get away without counting calories for so long but on everything else seems reasonable but again like I trained right now very hard and after that I enjoyed my Sunday high protein ice cream that I found in the super market so yeah I had protein sugar and fat snack that on an empty stomach that will definitely increase my glucose spike but....do what!!! Am I at risk of something most definitely no cause I work a physical job I dont sit around all day watching movies or YouTube or tiktok I train haard and being progressive so I think all those tips are for most average lazy people it's like she's saying OK since you can't be disciplined enough to be active and use your body instead of only using your mind literally only that hahahah just focus on doing these glucose spike tips to not get worse that's definitely gotta be the case buy hey that's not very popular with people right who likes getting yelled at and to be pointed of how bad they are doing. But keep in mind the first step to change is to accept that your are living the wrong way and that you know no better than people who's job and research is to study the human body.peace to everyone enjoy everyday life outside and relax don't get stressed at our end little things matter and don't let anybody discourage you I believe in anyone who read this that if you are doing amth wrong if you are perhaps fat low on energy everyday study your routine think about what are you doing wrong and fix one small thing everyday just 1 not more and by the time you realise you are doing good your body will already look awsome",

    "body": "Hiii,\n\nI'm writing this post as i'm trying to motivate myself to get back into keto. I figure that people new to keto might find this list helpful. If you're new to keto, please understand that keto versions of things rarely taste like what you're used to.\n\nIn general, everything tastes better when you cook/bake it yourself but sometimes we might not have the time to make things, or it's not worth the effort/cost. Here are my fav keto products.\n\nNot gonna lie, these products are kind of expensive (but keto in general is?). I've tried many different brands/products but the ones I list here are the ones I continuously buy. PLEASE remember to check the ingredients for allergies.\n\n**Disclaimer**: I'm adding links from the online store I use but I am not associated to these companies nor earn anything from your purchase.\n\n**Sweeteners** (0g net carbs unless otherwise specified):\n\n1. Natural granulated-Sugar replacement:\n   1. [Lakanto Golden Monkfruit Sweetener](https://naturamarket.ca/lakanto-golden-monkfruit-sweetener-235g.html) tastes like sugar with no aftertaste. This also comes in the white/classic version. I like the Lakanto brand over many brands because it dissolves better/faster than other branded erythritol\n   2. [Volupta Erythritol & Monk Fruit Zero Calorie Sweetener](https://www.costco.ca/volupta-erythritol-%2526-monk-fruit-zero-calorie-sweetener%2C-907-g.product.100780235.html) from Costco. Doesn't dissolve as fast but good value. I use this a lot for baking when more of this is required\n   3. Allulose: an alternative if you don't like/can't have sugar alcohols (which the previous 2 were)\n2. Honey replacement: [Wholesome Yum Zero Sugar Honey Substitute](https://www.wholesomeyumfoods.com/shop/syrups/keto-honey/). They now have flavored honey - haven't tried them yet though. The original is great. Thick like real honey and really tastes like actual honey\n3. Maple Syrup replacement: [Wholesome Yum Zero Sugar Maple Syrup](https://www.wholesomeyumfoods.com/shop/syrups/maple-syrup/) (2g net carbs/30ml (2 tbsp)). As close to the real deal. Doesn't have an aftertaste like other brands\n4. Simple syrup / liquid syrups: [Wholesome Yum Sugar Free Simple Syrup](https://www.wholesomeyumfoods.com/shop/syrups/simple-syrup/), [Wholesome Yum Sugar Free Coffee Syrup](https://www.wholesomeyumfoods.com/shop/syrups/coffee-syrup/). Allulose-based. I like to use this for cold drinks because you don't have to deal with the granulated sugar replacements that just won't dissolve in the cold (cold coffee lattes, cocktails)\n\n**Essentials / Pantry Items**\n\n1. Bread: [Carbonaut Keto Seeded Multigrain Bread](https://naturamarket.ca/carbonaut-keto-seeded-bread-544g.html) (2g net carbs/slice). Tip: get it at Costco. This honestly tastes like AND feels like your regular sandwich bread. Texture stays moist, even after keeping in the fridge. NOT gluten-free. I like this one better than the blue package one. Carbonaut has the best keto breads and has keto gluten-free breads. I've tried their hamburger bread, hot dog bread, bagel. Superb! They have more options like [tortillas ](https://naturamarket.ca/carbonaut-7-5-keto-tortilla-original-6-pack.html)etc.. and it's sooo good\n2. Nutella replacement: [NutiLight Keto Milk Chocolate Hazelnut Spread](https://naturamarket.ca/nutilight-milk-chocolate-hazelnut-spread-312g.html) (2g net carbs/20g (1 tbsp)\n3. Jam: All [Good Good jams](https://naturamarket.ca/food/nut-butters-fruit-spreads/jam-jellies-preserves.html?diets=344) are great (1g net carbs/tbsp). I personally love their fig jam the most (2g net carb/tbsp). **Edit**: I've tried the ChocZero jams and I think they have an aftertaste that I'm not fond of.\n4. Almond Butter: [Kirkland Signature Creamy Almond Butter](https://www.costco.ca/kirkland-signature-creamy-almond-butter%2C-765-g.product.100417607.html) (0g net carbs/tbsp). We all know Costco has good stuff. I personally love this one because it not only tastes great but also for its 0 net carbs factor.\n5. Rice replacement: [Better Than Foods Organic Konjac Rice](https://naturamarket.ca/better-than-foods-organic-konjac-rice-385g.html) (0g net carbs/package and 50 calories for the package! People also like cauliflower rice which is probably cheaper long term. **Edit: if you don't like the slight chewiness of konjac rice,** [**Kaizen rice**](https://naturamarket.ca/catalogsearch/result/?q=kaizen+rice) **has the closest texture to real rice, but at 6g net carbs/serving, it's a little on the high side for carbs. Here's hoping they make a lower carb version like they did with the pasta.**\n6. Pasta/Noodles: **Edit: The pasta closest in terms of flavor and texture are the** [Kaizen ](https://naturamarket.ca/kaizen-high-protein-2-net-carb-pasta-fusilli-226g.html)**ones (2g net carbs/56g).** For noodles, [Better Than Foods Organic Konjac Thai Style Noodles](https://naturamarket.ca/better-than-noodles-organic-konjac-thai-style-noodles-385g.html), [Better Than Foods Organic Konjac Penne Pasta](https://naturamarket.ca/better-than-pasta-organic-konjac-penne-385g.html) (0g net carbs/package). Better Than Foods also have different pasta shapes like spaghetti style etc...Don't forget to rinse them because they smell fishy?!\n7. Pasta Sauce: There's lots out there but [Rao's](https://naturamarket.ca/brands/rao-s-homemade.html?diets=344) lineup is great (5g net carbs/125 ml). Their marinara sauce is available at Costco\n8. Cereal: [Magic Spoon](https://magicspoon.com/) (4-5g net carbs/37g). 12 varieties. Personally love Fruity (like Fruit Loops), Cocoa (like Cocoa Cocoa Puffs), Blueberry Muffin.\n9. Flour: [King Arthur Baking Company Keto Wheat Flour Blend](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/keto-wheat-flour) (4g net carbs/30g). Like all-purpose flour. Wheat is possible on keto apparently! If you're sick of using almond flour or coconut flour, give this a try!\n10. Pancake Mix: Yes yes you can make your own but this is so convenient! I've tried so many pre-made mixes but hands down [King Arthur Baking High Protein Keto Pancake Mix](https://naturamarket.ca/king-arthur-baking-high-protein-carb-conscious-pancake-mix-340g.html) is the closest you can get to a real pancake texture. You know why? It's the gluten loll. It's not dry and grainy like most mixes, which usually contain almond flour. Definitely follow the Baker's tip instructions for the richer taste. Gluten-free option: [Wholesome Yum Keto Pancake Mix](https://www.wholesomeyumfoods.com/shop/baking-mix/keto-pancake-mix/). It's the best gluten-free option that I've tried- a little drier than the King Arthur one.\n\n**Snacks**:\n\n1. Yogurt: If you're in Canada, this is the lowest net carb version I could find is the **Activia Plain 0% Yogurt** (4g net carbs/170g). The 2% version is 5g/serving. I usually like to use the liquid/simply syrup from Wholesome Yum to sweeten it first. Then add some keto-friendly granola, berries, and finally topping it with the keto honey replacement. \n2. Chips replacements\n   1. Pork Rinds: I get the Utz brand from Costco (0g net carbs/15g)\n   2. [Whisps Cheese Crisps](https://naturamarket.ca/brands/cello-whisps.html?diets=344): this is basically cheese that was baked into a fine crisp. Available at Costco\n   3. Tortilla Chips: [BeyondChipz (a few flavors)](https://naturamarket.ca/brands/beyondchipz.html?diets=344) (2g net carbs/30g). [Mr. Tortilla Crunchy Chips Keto Tortilla Chips Chile Limon](https://naturamarket.ca/mr-tortilla-crunchy-chips-keto-tortilla-chips-chile-limon-227g.html). Thankfully salsa is keto friendly!\n   4. [Atkins protein chips](https://shop.atkins.com/collections/protein-chips) (4g net carbs/bag) are so good! I heard Quest protein chips are great but haven't tried them. \n3. 3. Chocolate/Candies:\n   1. Chocolate Bars: **Hands down -** [**ZoRaw chocolates**](https://www.zorawchocolates.ca/products/variety?variant=43154644336821) **has the richest taking chocolates** and are 1-2g net carbs PER bar (depending on the flavor). [Lily's](https://naturamarket.ca/brands/lily-s.html?diets=344) lineup is ok - so many choices and they offer chocolate chips. I like the simple [Lily's Milk Chocolate Style Creamy Milk](https://naturamarket.ca/lily-s-stevia-sweetened-40-chocolate-creamy-milk-85g.html) (1g net carb/40g (half the bar)). **Edit: the creamy milk chocolate has lately tasted a little chalky. I have since discovered** [Atkins Endulge Crunchalicious Bars](https://ca.iherb.com/pr/atkins-endulge-crunchalicious-bar-5-bars-0-78-oz-22-g-each/126296) **(1g net carb/bar), which mimics the CRUNCH bar (with the rice krispy-like filling). Note: their lineup is great but avoid the ones with maltitol as that sweetener spikes insulin levels.**\n   2. Reese's replacement: [No Sugar Company Keto Bomb Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter](https://naturamarket.ca/no-sugar-company-keto-bomb-dark-chocolate-peanut-butter-30ct.html) (1g net carb/piece). Available Costco online usually?\n   3. After Eight (Chocolate with mint filling) replacement: [No Sugar Company Keto Bomb Dark Chocolate Mint](https://naturamarket.ca/no-sugar-company-keto-bomb-dark-chocolate-mint-10ct.html) (1g net carb/piece). Available Costco online\n   4. Turtles replacement: [No Sugar Company Keto Shellz Chocolate Caramel Pecan](https://naturamarket.ca/no-sugar-company-keto-shellz-dark-chocolatey-caramel-pecan-9-pieces.html) (1g net carb/each)\n   5. Gummies: **Edit: new discovery on** [**Shameless Snacks gummies**](https://eatshameless.com/collections/all) **(3g/50g package) - they have versions of Fuzzy Peach, Watermelon slices, Green Apple, Sour Cheery Blasters and more!** [Kiss My Keto Tropical Rings Gummy Candy](https://naturamarket.ca/kiss-my-keto-tropical-rings-gummy-candy-50g.html) (2g net carbs/50g package). mango, orange, pineapple flavor in each package. I also like this brand's Fish Friends version. Avoid the watermelon one.\n4. Other Sweets:\n   1. **Ice Cream:** [**Enlightened Keto ice creams**](https://eatenlightened.com/collections/pints) **(2g/serving).** I like the chocolate and vanilla one the most. The others pint flavors are just ok. I don't love the ice cream bars.\n   2. **Granola**: [**Carbonaut Granola**](https://naturamarket.ca/catalogsearch/result/?q=carbonaut%20granola&diets=344) **(3g net carbs/serving)**. Best taste and texture\n   3. **\"Rice Krispies\":** [**Magic Spoon Treats**](https://magicspoon.com/products/treats-variety-4-boxes) (2g/serving). It's not like a classic Rice-Krispies flavor per se but texturally similar\n   4. **Poptarts** replacement: [Legendary Foods protein pastries](https://www.eatlegendary.com/collections/pastries) (4g net carbs/each)\n   5. \"**Oreo**\" replacement: [No Sugar Company Sandwich Cookiez](https://thenosugarcompany.ca/collections/all/products/no-sugar-sandwich-cookiez-240g-ca) (1g net carb/each).  [Catalina Crunch Chocolate Vanilla Sandwich Cookies](https://ca.iherb.com/pr/catalina-crunch-keto-friendly-sandwich-cookies-chocolate-vanilla-16-cookies-6-8-oz-193-g/107051) (5g net carbs/2 cookies) - it's a little high in carbs but it does the job\n5. Beverages:\n   1. [Sugarlolo Konjac Jelly Drinks](https://img.skmonline.com.tw/App_Images/727/ERPItem/2022/0719/87bf4dd0-127f-4fb7-b8e3-fa293517fda3.jpg) (1-2g net carbs and \\~5 calories/each (150g)). Can find them at Korean supermarkets. It's kinda like a juicy boba drink replacement\n   2. [Bai Antioxidant Infusion](https://www.drinkbai.com/bai5) drinks (1g net carb/530ml bottle). I suppose it's kinda like vitamin water but with more exotic flavors\n\nThese are my favs based on my experience. Might update the post if anything else comes to mind.\n\n**Edit**: I've added product recommendations for chocolate, sweets, tortilla chips, pasta, ice cream, granola.  \nBased on everyone's feedback, i've managed to try ChocZero products (jams, nut spreads, honey). Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed with the flavor because there's definitely an after-taste that ruined it for me.  The honey was alright but doesn't hold a candle to Wholesome Yums' honey substitute. Sorry for the bitterness on ChocZero, i think i'm still pissed that I had to throw it all out and wasted so much money.",

While the goal is to eat healthy and sustainable, sometimes it's not financially/emotionally feasible to do things like the carnivore diet with 100% organic grass-feed beef ribeye twice a day, or organic produce that requires a lot of cooking. It takes time to get there and, for someone with ADHD, time to budget and learn what is the best for me, AND what makes me feel the healthiest.

    "body": "NOTE: Sorry for the WEIRD MARKDOWN. The new Reddit's editor is a damn mess and I am constantly cleaning its crummy markdown.\n\nHi, SCA.\n\nSomeone requested more reviews and breakdowns, so I figured I would post this here. I originally posted it in r/AsianBeauty where I got some excellent feedback and thoughts.\n\nThis is a bit of a review slash ingredient breakdown, so I hope you enjoy!\n\n\\---\n\n>*Full Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol ,* ***Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake)****, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Leucine,* ***Ceramide 3***, ***Ceramide 6***, ***Placental Protein***, ***Arbutin***,***Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (Licorice Root Extract)****, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein, Maltitol, Methyl Gluceth-10, Peg-6 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Fragrance.*\n\nI've highlighted the ingredients that are worth discussing a bit in detail.\n\n# Ingredient Breakdown\n\nSake is a fermented product made from [rice](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/01/sake-rice-how-sake-is-made-rice-varieties-brewing-sake.html), [water](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-school-the-importance-of-water-in-sake-making-where-does-sake-come-from.html), [koji](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/koji-the-miracle-mold-how-sake-is-made.html), and [yeast](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-yeast-temperature-yeast-strains.html). Ferments have been all the rage recently, with *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (living yeast) extract and *Saccharomyces ferment* being the two I see the most.\n\nA couple of studies on sake (specifically rice wine and sake extract) showed multiple benefits. One in vitro (meaning in a dish or tube) study showed that rice wine increased  \"the expression of procollagen and laminin-5,\"⁴ which is one of the key components in the intercellular makeup of the layer that holds the epidermis to the dermis. Additionally, \"laminin 5 also accelerates the assembly of basement membranes and may enhance the recovery of damaged skin.\"⁵In the same study, experiments were done on hairless mice (in vivo) and showed that topical application protected the mouse from photo-aging.\n\nAnother study showed \\*that sake extract inhibited tyrosinase, both in vivo (in a living organism) and in vitro, though it is unclear how many subjects were involved based on the abstract alone.⁶\n\nIt's important to note that the first study I mentioned comes from Doosan Group R&D, which seems primarily interested in vehicles, construction, electrical, etc., while the second study was paid for by AMOREPACIFIC R&D - a popular skincare company.\n\nWhile these studies are minimal, we may be able to glean some deeper understanding into the benefits of sake by examining two of the most popular (and more studied) ferments as well as koji (kojic acid) itself.\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of yeast used for brewing beer. In one study, saccharomyces cerevisiae extract (SCE) was studied in several formulations. One contained SCE, and/or vitamins A, C, and E, and was patch-tested on the back of volunteers. The subjects were then tested for transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin moisture (SM), skin microrelief (SMR), and free radical protection in 3 hour, 15 days, and 30 day intervals.\n\n>*\"Our results suggest that vitamins and SCE showed effects in \\[skin moisture\\] SM and \\[skin microrelief\\] SMR. Only formulations containing SC had long term effects in the improvement of SMR. Thus, these kinds of evaluations are very important in cosmetics development to evaluate the best risk and benefit correlation.\"¹*\n\nAnother fungi ferment, saccharomyces ferment, has similar benefits. It is obtained through the fermentation of saccharomyces - a genus of fungi that is known as the baker's yeast - in the presence of metal ions. The yeast is credited with promoting good skin condition and is frequently found in products that reduce redness.\n\nThe other half of sake worth discussing, koji (kojic acid) is a skin-lightening agent and antioxidant. It is a tyrosinase (an enzyme that controls the production of melanin) inhibitor, but not as effective as other tyrosinase inhibitors like licorice extract. \"In combination with allantoin and other proper ingredients in sunscreen preparations, the mixture can inhibit UV-caused erythema and accelerate wound healing.\"² Unfortunately, it can also be sensitizing to some skin and create irritation.\n\nFrom all of this, we can assume that sake contains some sort of very mild exfoliating, humectant, anti-aging, and whitening properties, but the studies are fairly minimal thus far. To add, it is important to remember that not all skin ingredients penetrate deeper than the first few layers of the stratum corneum (the upper-most layer of the epidermis, what we see with our eyes), so long-term studies in vivo over many years tend to be the most reliable (hence why your doctor may be more apt to prescribe you tretinoin \\[Retin-A\\] than a newer drug).\n\nThe next ingredients on the list are ceramides 3 and 6. If you've been following my writings, you already know that ceramides are naturally found in the skin and help maintain the skin barrier. In fact, our skin's natural lipids are 35-40&#37; ceramides.\n\nSlightly more exciting is placental protein. Derived from animal placenta ([in this case, horse](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5fgonk/psa_kikumasamune_does_not_use_ingredient_derived/)), it is considered to be a safe ingredient that does not deliver any metabolic or endocrine activity. Again though, there was not much precedent that I could find on the benefits of including this ingredient specifically, however egg whites have been used for centuries on skin to make skin temporarily feel tighter and appear smoother.\n\n*Fun fact: Umbilical extract has precedent for unrestricted use in Japan, except for certain products.³*\n\nFinally, we arrive at the stars of this product: arbutin and licorice root extract. Arbutin, an ingredient primarily used for it's antioxidant properties as well as skin bleaching. It is a natural hydroquinone, derived synthetically or from bearberry plants. Once on the skin, it converts into hydroquinone and acts as a tyrosinase inhibitor. While not as effective as hydroquinone, it lacks the concerns of hydroquinone thus has become more popular in recent years.\n\nLicorice root extract is similarly a tyrosinase inhibitor as well as an anti-irritant - with some studies signalling that it may be able to absorb UVA and UVB rays. It is more effective than kojic acid and some studies put it at 75x more effective than ascorbic acid ([though Dr Dray raises some interesting points regarding the efficacy of L-AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JxO6sVMJzM)). \"The chief constituent of licorice root is glycyrrhizin, present in concentrations that range from 5 to 24 percent depending on the variety of licorice used.\"²\n\n# My Experience\n\n**My skin type:** Rosacean, acne-prone and extremely irritation-prone\n\nFirstly, the pump on my bottle broke off rather spectacularly when my bottle took a tumble from my tiny bathroom counter top. I'm not sure why this product comes with a pump applicator in the first place, as it frequently would dispense more product than I needed, which I suppose is fine as I was able to spread it down my neck and chest, but it was still was a bit of a shock to get a whole handful of it on the first pump. This experience doesn't seem limited to me, so I really recommend decanting this product into a better dispenser if you can, like a spritz top bottle.\n\nPackaging aside, the first time I used the High Moist lotion, I was pretty nervous. It's a very runny product, sharing a consistency with water, and if you've read my blog at all you know that I am a fairly dry-skinned lady. To my surprise and delight though, it was *uber* moisturizing. I applied it fresh out of the shower, in place of my HadaLabo Premium, and instantly my skin just felt soft and supple. I imagine much of this is due to the placenta protein filling in the gaps of the skin cells and creating a \"smooth\" texture as well as the ceramides, which tend to plump up my skin and make it feel softer.\n\nThe fragrance was also so mild that frankly, the smell of sake overpowered it. Thankfully this smell seemed to dissipate after a few minutes of application, and my rosacea did not flare up from the inclusion of fragrance. Over the next few days, I used the High Moist in place of my HadaLabo, and then began to combine it at night with the HadaLabo Premium on top. It worked well with oils and other moisturizing products on top - no pilling or strange film to report.\n\nIn two weeks, my skin looked brighter and felt smoother, though none of my dark spots had faded. Unfortunately, like most products with ferments, it began to break me out after this time. The good news though is that it doesn't appear to break me out immediately, unlike every other ferment, and the smoothness lasted for a few days after I discontinued use, which means I may try to use it sparingly once my skin heals.\n\n# Sources\n\n1.

    "body": "Obligatory photo: http://imgur.com/HNXgBL3\n\nI can't even begin to thank this forum for all the help I've gotten, mostly from the joy I get from reading all of your stories (both the highs and the lows!). This has certainly been quite a journey for me, a wonderful one but certainly a learning experience. I've learned of the many wonderful uses of heavy whipping cream, the strangeness that is Shirataki noodles, and the colon blow that is Maltitol/Maltitol Syrup (small doses only!).\n\nThe last time I weighted in under 200 pounds was July of 2008, nearly 7 years. I feel like I've lost 7 years off my age, too: my skin looks better, my clothes are loose and comfortable again, and I'm just getting started! \n\nI've been on this road before, and I've lost more weight than this before too, but I've never taken control of my health so well while still enjoying food everyday and always ensuring that I never go to bed feeling like I cut corners and left myself deprived. Just yesterday consisted of both a second lunch and a dinner of delicious beef brisket from my local supermarket with a solid 1/2 inch layer of fat. It was extradinary. If this is the diet I must stay on the rest of my life to continue losing weight and eventually maintaining a healthy body, I think I will survive!\n\nThanks again, /r/keto, and here's to the next phase of my journey: losing the next 25 pounds while also regaining muscle!! I really couldn't have done it without the support here. ",

I’ve been on keto before (lost 100+ pounds and gained it all back during Covid lockdowns) and the biggest issue have been all of the “keto friendly” packaged foods. I am not saying they aren’t keto friendly but the wide variety of sweets, even sugar free ones, made it harder, not easier. \n\nIn the past 2 months it’s been easier to just say no to anything that doesn’t fit the bill than to “cheat” with all of the keto friendly snacks out there. This is especially important since a lot of them say they’re friendly but are not really. They all sneak in terrible sweeteners like maltitol and you tell yourself that the package says friendly so it must be and it throws you out of ketosis. \n\nIt turns out that snacking on Jamon, dry salamis and amazing cheeses in Spain is a lot more satisfying than grabbing a slightly more convenient breakfast bar with a whole list of unnatural ingredients. \n\nI even ordered an entire leg of jamon after returning from my trip. 19lbs of meaty and fatty goodness :)\n\nI thought I’d be bored with the limited variety of foods but in reality I look forward to it every day. \n\nI’ve already made a post about cured pork fat (salo) I now eat for breakfast daily with a variety of cheeses and 2 months later I wake up craving it more and more :)\n\nIt feels like a cheat day every day. \n\nThe health benefits have been amazing as well. My acid reflux symptoms are gone. Stoped taking Pantoprazole altogether. Plenty of energy. \n\nSo far so good, now on to my morning coffee :)",

After really hating on the quest bars I got, I realized I had sneaked another protein bar from another company into my shopping cart. It said Peanut Caramel or something, the front print said it had less than 3 net carbs, and it smelled so good, even still wrapped up! Like chocolate! Real chocolate! The ingredients list (I WILL NEVER EAT SOMETHING WITHOUT CHECKIN FIRST!) was hidden in the fold of the wrapper, smart kids know that can't be good, right? Not me, I bought it! And, much to my dismay and regret, I also ate it. Or, half of it. As I felt kinda funky after eating a half quest bar the day before, I had at least that much self control and caution to only eat half of it at once.\n\nWell, nothing happened for like 30 minutes. Then, I realized how my tummy started to swell, gurgle and bloat, my pants got tight and I had the worst thirst.... And then I had to burp. Like, burps that could make a 400 pound beer drinking 7 foot man turn his head in envy. And not once, not twice... I spend the rest of the afternoon burping. I was burping at my computer, burping in my car, burping in the woods while walking my dogs... I thought maybe I would lose my speech and burp for the rest of my life! Also, I dreaded what might be coming AFTER the burps, AND I wondered what horrible stroke of bad luck may have caused me this burping trouble, because, mind you, I still haven't checked that damn food label. Around FIVE hours later, as my husband came home, I was still secretly burping to myself (I think I invented a technique that sounds like a mix of sighting and breathing out so he doesn't think he married a big, hairy man with a thirst for beer). And besides the fact that it was kind of stressful to try NOT to burp every 2 minutes or so, I think I could smell my dinner from 3 days ago in my burps - it was not very pleasant. I tried blaming the dogs for any weird smells but I don't think I was too successful with it, as they preferred to sleep in another room... Meh.\n\nThe next morning, I was covered in mosquito bites. Ever since starting Keto, neither my husband nor I did get any, even while having all windows open when sleeping. Needless to say, he didn't have any, just me. Like 4. On my hand, on my foot, my leg, and very well placed on my butt cheek. Thanks, mosquitos. It still itches. Also, I woke up and immediately craved sweets, besides heaving a headache. Like coffee syrup or chocolate, which I didn't even use when I was eating sugary stuff. Hopped on the scale and, tadaa, nice, I gained almost 3 pounds of water overnight, beautiful! I tested my blood glucose and ketone levels. Blood glucose at 90 after 14 hours of fasting, and ketone levels of 0.4.... I was so shocked, I burped.\n\nNow, after a day of finally not burping and losing the 3 pounds again, I got my hands on the other half of the uneaten protein bar. I quickly resisted the urge to eat it (OH MY GOD, ARE YOU INSANE?!) and decided to search for the ingredients, which I found after a bit of fumbling inside the fold. It says very prominently \"sweetener: Maltitol\". Straight after protein and some fiber. So it's safe to say, that thing had plenty.\n\nThere you have it. Don't eat it. Don't even eat half of it. I am not sure what would have happened if I had eaten the whole protein bar, but I guess it wouldn't have stayed at burping. I read about the \"butt didgeridoo\" on Xylitol before and I'm pretty sure exactly \\*this\\* will happen. At best. Now, I need to find someone I truly hate, because I have another one of these Maltitol sweetened protein bars in my drawer.",

    "body": "#A little note:\nSince many of these can be tricky to find and can be expensive (like Quest bars being $30 a box usually, Nicks being $10 a pint), I wanted to make a review/discussion post for anyone curious about them\n\nMany of these that I’ve tried, I haven’t tried recently (as in last few days/weeks) since it’s taken some time to try them. But I am doing my best to remember and give helpful reviews. Feel free to ask questions or make any comments below! Even if you see this months later, I’ll still answer if I can\n\nI also wanna add with ratings, something like 6/10 isn’t disappointing to me, rather something like 8.5 or higher is just REALLY good. Or in my opinion. This is all just my opinion, making a review to hopefully help someone out :)\n\nFor your convenience it is all labeled and categorized by brand, with a miscellaneous section for random things. Also I'm gonna have to post the rest in the comments, this is slightly longer than Reddit's 40,000 character limit\n\n#QUEST PRODUCTS\n\n**Peppermint Bark bar** - Really good texture, covered in a layer of white chocolate, not much dark chocolate in it, so no layer for that. It has mint peppermint sprinkles embedded in the white chocolate coating. This is basically the exact same as birthday cake, BUT it has a minty fresh flavor. Not overpowering mint either. I like to bake all quest bars and these are no exception. Top it with the lily’s mint chocolate chips before baking to really take it to the next level! 9/10\n\n**Pumpkin Spice bar** - Similar to peppermint bark but with a thicker white chocolate coating and a STRONG pumpkin spice flavor. Like, wow it has some kick kind of spice. Not overpowering, but noticeable. It kind of reminds me of the chunks you’d have in pumpkin spice flavored ice cream? Anyway, 8.5/10\n\n**White Chocolate Raspberry bar** - It mostly just tasted like plain sweetness, like oatmeal chocolate chip without the chip, and it has raspberry seeds in it. Not my cup of tea, 6/10. I’d have one if it was free, but the price of quest bars means they really gotta be yummy\n\n**Birthday Cake bar** - A white chocolate coating, fluffy texture, tastes kinda like a typical, what would you call it, a white cake, a vanilla cake? Mostly just fluffy sweetness, one of my favorites. 8.5/10\n\n**Chocolate Brownie** - Just a chocolatey bar, no chocolate chips or anything. It’s really good though, very close to an actual brownie when microwaved, maybe just a little less sweet. Also the lowest cal standard quest bar flavor, at 170. Small difference, but it makes this nice flavor even nicer.\n\n**Double Chocolate chunk bar** - Not very sweet, mostly just plain chocolate flavor with chunks in it, it’s good, just not amazing. 6.5/10\n\n**S’mores bar** - Not a very strong marshmallow or graham cracker flavor, unless you bake it, then it kinda gets a caramel-like flavor to the outside, much like an actual toasted marshmallow. However… when I ordered 2 boxes off amazon, one box had “dry” chocolate chunks. I don’t really know how to describe it, it’s like the chocolate was left out on a table for weeks, exposed to the air and not stored properly or something. It only affected the texture, but that still made it less of a fav, 7/10.\n\n**Maple Waffle bar** - AMAZING. Very sweet, it has syrup parts that get all gooey when you bake it, this is an S tier protein bar. White chocolate chunks in there, too. 9.5/10, marked slightly higher than peppermint bark cause mint is a niche flavor, gotta feel festive for it y’know\n\n**Oatmeal Chocolate chip bar** - It was kinda underwhelming, not any oat flavor that I noticed. 5/10\n\n**Cookie Dough bar** - It does taste a lot like cookie dough, but the texture isn’t quite there, even when baked. 6.5/10\n\n**Cookies and Cream bar** - Not very much “cream” or frosting flavor, it was like a generic slightly sweet white bar with ground up “cookie” in it, not much like an Oreo at all, if that’s what it was mimicking. 6.5/10.\n\n**Peanut Butter chocolate chip bar** - A good peanut butter flavor, much like cookie dough. Bit dry and not as fluffy as some of these can be. 6/10\n\n**Chocolate Sprinkled donut bar** - It’s basically like a chocolate layer version of birthday cake. Some people compare it to a Hostess cake but I don’t quite see it. Not too shabby though, and fairly soft, 7.5/10\n\n**Caramel Chocolate chunk** - Kind of like a less sweet, more salty birthday cake flavor. The bar itself is the “caramel”, there seems to be no actual caramel bits or swirls. Basically just a sweet and salty bar with chocolate chunks. While a birthday cake or pumpkin pie quest bar wouldn’t be like an actual cake or pie, this is further from “caramel chocolate chunk” than I’d expect. Still decent and could be amazing with some PB2, caramel/chocolate drizzle. But even so, 6/10.\n\n**Blueberry Muffin** - Very reminiscent of an actual blueberry muffin, especially when baked. There's not much blueberry flavor but plenty of muffin flavor, although there are dried blueberries in the bar. Pretty good! 7.5/10\n\n**HERO bar caramel pecan** - Tasted kinda odd to me, maybe it’s because it has chunks of nuts in there, hero bars are different from the regular bars. I prefer the regular kind though, 6/10.\n\n**HERO crispy chocolate coconut** - Tastes *glorious*. It's like a rice krispie covered in chocolate and coconut. Excellent texture, really good flavor, 9/10. Also really good baked (a little messy) or frozen!\n\n**Salted caramel snack bar** - They look visually more like a granola bar. It tasted pretty good, the caramel drizzle on it tastes more like caramel flavor white chocolate? Not quite caramel. 7/10, but mind you these are less of a protein bar and more of a granola bar, a bit different than most quest bars\n\n**Quest ranch tortilla chips** - They were really good actually, my one thing is that the chips are fragile so aren’t ideal for dipping, and aren’t all that filling due to being chips. Still tasty though, 7.5/10. Also wanna mention these are similar to the Atkins ranch protein chips, I couldn't even tell the difference between the two, in fact.\n\n**Quest Double Chocolate protein cookie** - Not as sweet as I’d expected a cookie to be, but it has a good texture on par with most cookies like this. 7/10\n\n**Quest PB protein cookie** - It does taste like a peanut butter cookie and has the right texture, however it lacks just a bit of that salty sweet flavor imo. 6/10\n\n**Quest Chocolate Chip protein cookie** - Kind of underwhelming, not particularly soft or chewy, and the sweetness/saltiness is overall a bit bland. It's just alright, I'd rather make my own protein chocolate chip cookie, especially for these cals. 6/10.\n\n**Quest chocolate frosted cookie** - Now this did taste like a little debbie or hostess product to me, coated in chocolate and they’re really good dipped in PB2 or frozen. Also, very soft and cakey. 8/10\n\n**Quest gooey caramel candy bar** - This is indeed like a candy bar, although which to compare it to, I’m not sure. It has caramel, chocolate, and peanuts, similar to a Snicker’s. 8.5/10\n\n**Quest PB cup** - These are slightly larger than a Reese’s peanut butter cup, don’t have that little paper wrapper surrounding each one, and the peanut butter filling doesn’t have that “gritty” texture of regular Reese’s. The chocolate also tastes a bit darker. Still good, but less crumble for lack of a better word. 7/10\n\n#THINK BARS\nI forget the exact flavors, chocolate brownie and a peanut butter one I think, but I am looping them together at 4/10, the texture is fine, although they don’t have much sweetness compared to other protein bars, so no real reason to get them, the ones I’ve tried don’t really compete with these other protein bars on the list\n\n#BUILT BARS\n**Double Chocolate** - Mostly just a dark chocolate gooey flavor, it’s like the texture of caramel, sticky, but it’s chocolate flavor. 5/10\n\n**Salted Caramel** - It does have a salty caramel like flavor, but the texture seems too stretchy and not gooey/sticky enough like caramel would be. Gelatin is in the ingredients, so that explains the “gummy” texture. 5/10\n\n**Coconut Almond** - Tastes similar to an almond joy, but that gummy texture of the others is still there, and it doesn’t have whole almonds like an almond joy has. 4/10.\n\n**Coconut** - Less of a gummy texture than the others, actually pretty decent, 6/10\n\n**Cookies and Cream** - Mostly has a dutched cocoa flavor, not really any cream taste to it. Same gummy texture as most of them. 5/10\n\n**Peanut Butter Brownie** - The filling actually has a somewhat similar texture to peanut butter, I quite like it. There's little nut fragments too. 6.5/10\n\n**Churro** - The texture was rubber. Taste is fine, but the texture, literally like rubber. Churros are supposed to be like donuts covered in cinnamon in regards to taste and texture, this one is softer but there wasn’t any cinnamon flavor. 2/10.\n\n**Coconut Marshmallow** - Also basically just as rubbery in terms of texture, it tasted pretty good, still wouldn’t recommend the flavor though. Well, the rubber texture is nicer here since actual marshmallows already kinda have such a texture. Reminds me of chocolate covered marshmallow bunnies you’d find around easter. Even so, 3.5/10.\n\nI probably won’t buy Built bars again due to the textures of them being a fruit snack or rubber, unless I found a good deal on individual bars to get a feel for any flavors I may like. The only reason I see to get these is that built bars are lower cal, 130-180 cals typically, with 15-19g protein. Mostly on par with other protein bars. If they were cheaper, I would probably buy them again. Although I will say that the “100% chocolate” statements about the bars are accurate, the chocolate coating (usually dark chocolate) is excellent, amazing even. It’s just a shell though, as I discovered, Built bars are basically expensive chocolate covered protein fruit snacks.\n\n#BARBELL PROTEIN BARS\n**Caramel Cashew** - It was alright, didn't really have much caramel flavor, but the texture was very nice. Just kinda reminds me of a chocolate bar with nuts, which is always good anyway. 7.5/10\n\n**Cookies and Cream** - This was actually AMAZING. They're covered in rice bits or crispy things of some kind (whey protein crisps I'm guessing). Flavor is kinda like the Oreo cookies and cream candy bar, if I remember the taste correctly. 9/10.\n\nPeople recommended I try these, and I see why, both were really good :)\n\n#Pure Protein bars\n\n**Lemon Cake** - So far the only one of this brand I’ve tried, very good though! Definitely has a lemon cake flavor, a bit of the texture of a lemon bar too. Also amazing microwaved! I’d say it has the general flavor of Quest, and the texture of Think bars (which was my favorite thing about those). Great texture and flavor. 190 cals and 20g protein, so it’s comparable to other bars. What’s more? Most the protein bars of this brand are much more affordable, like half the price of other brands, which is AMAZING. I’m giving it a 9.5/10 for all these reasons.\n\n**Chocolate Mint Cookie** - Basically a two layered \"cookies and cream\" type of flavor, with a subtle mint taste. Noticeable, and I think it's just enough that both people who do and don't like mint, would enjoy this. The texture is also dense and chewy, sort of like a granola bar, not as fluffy as the lemon cake flavor. Good frozen, and it’s REALLY good heated since it's already like a brownie. Worth noting, this bar has 16g Maltitol from what I can tell. It's a sugar alcohol that might not be as easy on the gut as erythritol. YMMV. Anyway, 8/10. I like lemon cake a little more.\n\n**Birthday Cake** - Covered in a white chocolate or frosting coating of some kind, and it's got actual sprinkles on it! You know those frosted animal cookies? This is exactly like those, but softer/cakey in texture. When microwaved for a while, it's even BETTER than Quest birthday cake, I'd say. Or at least, it's more like an actual cake should be. There's a slight protein-y aftertaste present in this, and every other Pure Protein bar I've tried. Still really good though, more affordable too, as usual for the brand. 8.5/10\n\n#LILY'S CHOCOLATE\n\n**White chocolate chips** - Tastes like white chocolate, super tasty. I have used them in peppermint bark overnight oats before! Stevia/erythritol sweetened. 8/10\n\n**White chocolate baking bar** - So it's basically just a white chocolate baking bar, plain white chocolate that you could temper or chop for baking. Or eat like a candy bar. Tastes pretty much just like white chocolate, and the chips. But I do like it better than the chocolate chips, simply because a bar form means you can make chocolate shavings easily, or chop it up. More versatile that way. That being said, like regular white chocolate, it's very \"rich\", just a little is enough to satisfy. Although I do prefer dark chocolate. Anyway, 9/10\n\n**Mint chocolate chips** - These are like semi sweet or slightly dark chocolate chips, with a minty flavor. Would also be good in chocolate cookies. Peppermint bark cookies, too! 8.5/10\n\n**Lily's gummy bears** - They're pretty good, although a little firm and not as fruity as I remember regular gummy worms being. Still nice though, 7/10\n\n**Lily's sour gummy worms** - Pretty much same as the other, the texture was a little different than I thought it would be, and the sourness was like just a coating rather than in the whole gummy like I remember for regular gummy worms? Better than I previously remember though, a second try and they were nice and sticky like gummies should be. For all the Lily's gummies, it's worth noting they're super high in fiber though, like around 24g in one bag if I remember. 7.5/10\n\n#LAKANTO\n**Chocolate chips** - They’re decent like lily’s, however the “crunch” or “snap” isn’t quite the same as with regular chocolate chips. Nowadays I usually prefer regular chocolate chips for that reason, texture is a little different. 6/10\n\n**Erythritol Monkfruit Sweetener** - Tastes just like sugar and can be used as such in recipes needing granulated sweetener, erythritol is usually 70% as sweet and that’s why it has monkfruit in there as well. 8/10 but you can get another brand of sweetener, basically the same flavor\n\n**Brown erythritol monkfruit sweetener** - Pretty much just like brown sugar, in terms of both taste and texture! It even clumps together similarly, too. A little fancier to use in oatmeal or PB2, 8.5/10\n\n**Maple syrup cinnamon** - Doesn’t seem as thick as I remember maple syrup being, but it definitely has the sweetness down. Not very much cinnamon flavor though. 8/10\n\n#CATALINA CRUNCH\n\n**Cinnamon Toast** - Not really like cinnamon toast crunch, unfortunately. The texture is pretty much there, but the sweetness is a little off, and the cinnamon flavor is underwhelming. I don't think this would leave you with that DELICIOUS cinnamon milk after a bowl of this. You could add cinnamon of course, or use both this AND cinnamon toast crunch, but even so, I'd give it a 6/10. Totally palatable, but pretty dang expensive.\n\n**Peanut Butter and Chocolate** - Okay this one, it's straight up awful. The chocolate pieces taste like a chocolate flavor of ice cream (so not really like chocolate) and the peanut butter also has a really artificial flavor to it. 4.5/10. Instead I'd recommend the cinnamon flavor and adding PB2 plus chocolate chips, cocoa powder, or whatever.\n\n#HALO TOP\n\n**Birthday Cake** - So far the only Halo Top flavor I've tried, of their recent \"softer and creamier\" rebranding, worth noting, since it could be different if you haven't had Halo Top recently. Anyway, it's basically vanilla ice cream with sprinkles. Pretty good, I think the sprinkles are actually made of sugar. But it's softer and more \"watery\" than Nick's for example, probably because it has less fats. Best way to describe it is that this would be more like yogurt than a rich ice cream. Nick's is better in my opinion, but this was still delicious, good taste and texture overall. 7.5/10\n\n#NICK'S ICE CREAM\n**Vanilla** - Tastes pretty much exactly like plain vanilla ice cream, it is vanilla. I’ve used it for pumpkin spice milkshakes before, very good. ALL Nick’s ice cream has been comparable, in my opinion, to regular ice cream. 8/10. Smooth texture, not a brick like Halo Top (never had it before, that’s just what I have heard about it)\n\n**Chocolate** - This is the basic chocolate flavor, no swirls or chunks, etc. but it's still pretty good! Somewhat creamier than Nicks usually is I think. If you're into chocolate ice cream, this is pretty much what you'd expect. 7.5/10\n\n**Chili Mango** - Spicy with what seems to be swirls of caramel in there. It is quite spicy, enough so that I think I experienced a “Taco Bell effect” from it. Spicy ice cream is an unusual combo in my opinion, so while I wouldn’t say I’d buy it again, it was worth trying and pretty much what I expected. 6.5/10\n\n**Salted Caramel** - Pretty much just a more salty version of vanilla, with caramel swirls in it too. Really good with some PB2 on top, maybe some apple chips as well. 9/10\n\n**Peanut Butter Caramel** - Just like salted caramel it has swirls of caramel, and it is also more peanut buttery. I made a PBJ inspired milkshake with some of this, another fun idea is a Snicker’s milkshake, just add cocoa powder, a little PB2, and some almond milk. 8.5/10\n\n**Peanut Butter swirl** - This was FANTASTIC. Tasted more like a coffee type of nutty flavor, but since when was coffee ever a downgrade? It has a really creamy texture, and the swirls of what's either chocolate or coffee (can't quite tell) are delicious. Maybe my favorite flavor? 9/10\n\n**Mint chocolate chip** - It tastes like regular mint chocolate chip ice cream, and if I remember correctly, has chocolate chips as opposed to chopped chocolate chunks. That’s just a difference in the shape of said chocolate, but still worth a mention I thought. 8/10, especially if you like mint as I do.\n\n**Cookies and Cream** - Mostly just vanilla and chocolate chips as I recall. Also, this used regular sugar according to the label, which means less erythritol. A little higher cal, but perhaps less likely to give the “Haribo Sugar Free gummy bear effect”, 7.5/10\n\n**Hazelnut Fudge** - So something interesting with this flavor, I noticed it was vegan. If anyone wants a safe vegan ice cream, THIS IS IT. But, it doesn’t have a strong hazelnut flavor at all. It has little chocolate or caramel-like swirls in it, and that’s the “hazelnut”. Maybe top with nutella or some other hazelnut flavor thing, cause this just didn’t like hazelnut to me. Still good though, 7/10\n\n**Hazelnut Cream** - Not vegan like the other one was, tasted better in my opinion, similar to those Ferrero Rochers I’d say, it’s pretty good! Has a bit of a richer texture too, and the chocolate chunks are kinda like a wafer in terms of texture. It’s a little higher cal, yet quite delicious so 9/10\n\n**Pumpkin Spice Swirl** - Not a very strong pumpkin spice flavor, it tastes more like actual pumpkin than pumpkin flavored ice cream to me. So, very good if you like how real pumpkin tastes. It also has fragments of pecans, which takes the texture to the next level. This would be fantastic for topping a baked apple with. 8.5/10\n\n**Peppermint** - Yet another festive flavor, themed after a candy cane! Very similar to candy cane/peppermint flavored regular ice cream, although the pieces remind me of dried fruit almost. They aren’t really crunchy, unlike how I remember other brands of peppermint ice cream being. I like Mint Chocolate Chip more I’d say, but festive seasonal flavors are still really fun, so this is a 8.5/10, an especially good flavor to use in milkshakes.\n\n**Chocolate Cherry** - The cherry flavor is pretty subtle, similar to fruit flavored chocolates/protein bars, but still noticeable. It has chunks of chocolate, which is pretty good. With some actual cherries on top (frozen, dried or otherwise, but you'll want the pits taken out first) it would be amazing. 8/10\n\n\n\n**Raspberry Swirl** - The fruity flavor is subtle, as with cherry. More as if there’s chunks of raspberries in there. Also, it has raspberry seeds! If you like those, you’ll probably enjoy this flavor. Especially great with raspberry fragments on top, they’re an excellent topping since they usually have fragmented pieces anyway. Worth noting, the chocolate isn’t noticeable, so might wanna top with some choccy chips! 8/10\n\n**Rocky Road** - Chocolate, nuts, and marshmallow, the typical stuff of the rocky road flavor. It’s maybe a bit denser in texture (a bit tougher to scoop), and it’s also quite a bit higher cal than other Nick’s flavors. It’s alright, but with that in mind, I wouldn’t buy it again, and that’s a first for this brand. 5/10. Although I suppose if you like rocky road ice cream, this could be really good.\n\n**Chocolate Chocolate** - A double chocolate flavor, this one is pretty good as far as chocolate ice cream goes, although it’s simple and wouldn’t be my go-to, nothing stands out about it. 7/10\n\n**Strawberry Cream** - Another vegan flavor! Probably the best vegan flavor I've tried, of any ice cream in general. Tastes pretty much like a regular strawberry ice cream/strawberry milk, with what seems to be freeze dried strawberry pieces here and there. The texture is soft, but not quite as rich/creamy as others, probably because it's vegan and isn't using dairy. Still, it's pretty good. 8/10\n\n**Strawberry Cheesecake** - AMAZING OMG. The flavor is good, cheesecake-y, and there's graham cracker bits in it. The taste isn't exactly what makes it special, all the things combined is what's so nice. A very \"fun\" flavor, if that makes sense. There's just enough going on in this one, and I'm all here for it. 9/10.\n\n**Strawberry Swirl** - Kind of underwhelming like most the fruity flavors, I'd say this tasted almost exactly like the vegan strawberry cream flavor, except this has a good texture like most the other dairy flavors of Nicks. 7.5/10 (lower cause amongst non-vegan flavors, it's comparatively worse for what it is)\n\n**Swedish Munchies** - I don't feel too strongly about it, but like strawberry cheesecake, the texture has some VERY nice heterogeneity. Good quality, and this ice cream is more like regular ice cream, pleasantly firm. Not a solid chunk of ice, but firm enough it isn't instantly soft when removing from the fridge. So not a personal favorite, but I think it's good. If you like heterogeneity, cookie dough, and brownies, you'll probably love this. 8.5/10.\n\n**Lemon Bar** - Once again, it doesn't have a very strong fruit (lemon) flavor, but it's still there as a nice subtle note. Also much like salted caramel, there's lemon flavor swirls in here! The texture is exactly like salted caramel pretty much, but lemon. Excellent texture. 8.5/10\n\n**Key lime/cheesecake** - Really good! Like flavor stuff like yogurt generally doesn't appeal to me, but this was nice, and the flavor is strong, but not too much so! Also a firmer ice cream, so it doesn't melt too quickly. 9/10\n\n**Campfire S'mores** - Not much marshmallow or graham cracker flavor, but it does have chocolate and graham cracker chunks. Reminds me more of a cookie dough flavor. Still really good though, both in taste and texture! Nice and dense. 9/10\n\n**Nick's Vanilla Cream sandwich** - Really good, higher cal than most Nick's ice cream I think, although it's still amazing. The vanilla somewhat reminds me of those oatmeal little debbie oatmeal cream sandwiches, except in this case it's ice cream. The cookies have chocolate chips in them, too. 9/10.\n\n**Nick's Triple Chocolate sandwich** - Basically chocolate ice cream between double chocolate cookies, really good. 8.5/10. That being said, I prefer regular Nick's ice cream still, over the sandwich variants.\n\n#NICK'S PROTEIN BARS\n**Chocolate peanut butter** - Like a mix of a quest bar and a larabar in terms of texture. It had peanut bits on top, which I really liked. Not much of a peanut buttery flavor, but definitely a chocolate flavor, good texture, fairly low cal. It's a refrigerated protein bar. 8/10\n\n**Strawberry Cashew** - Good flavor, kinda tastes more like a granola bar with the fruity flavor, but has the same texture as the larabar/quest situation in the other refrigerated bar. Like 7/10.\n\n**Nick's Crispy Nougat** - Also reminded me of a cookies and cream flavor, albeit less so. Pretty good. 8/10\n\n**Nick's Peanut Chokolad** - Very amazing, reminded me almost exactly of a Snicker's in both taste and texture. Peak protein bar, right here, might be the best flavor of any protein bar I've had. 9.5/10\n\nI'd say they're okay for protein bars, definitely feel more decadent than most protein bars, although I think I still prefer Quest overall. If I were to rank brands, it'd be Built -> Think -> Nick's -> ONE bar -> Pure Protein -> Quest bar -> Barbell.\n\n#FIBER ONE\n\n**Fiber One Cinnamon Coffee Cake** - I was hyped to order this, since each bar is 70 cal and some good fiber as the name suggests. The pictures make the bars look bigger, these are actually quite small, no more than 2-2.5 square inches, or about 5 centimeters. They do taste really good, like a cross between coffee cake and a pop tart! Great when heated, too. However with some oat fiber/erythritol/PB2 you can basically make your own fibrous coffee cake in the oven, and for a more satisfying portion. With that in mind, 6/10\n\n**Fiber One chocolate chip cookie brownie** - Once again, kind of disappointing. It has a firmer texture than cinnamon coffee cake, plus being a little less sweet, both of which I like. But it could use a slightly salty flavor like a choc. chip cookie should be. The box also shows chocolate chips in the bar, but there's none, it's just a wavy chocolate icing. An *okay* flavor, but like the coffee cake it's very small. And it could use some chocolate chips. I'd just recommend a Quest chocolate chip cookie. 5/10.\n\n**Fiber One Fudge Brownie** - Pretty much the same thing as with the coffee cake and cookie brownie, small, but it tastes pretty good, indeed like a brownie. Probably my favorite, but it's easy to make my own brownies/mug cakes. 6.5/10\n\n**Protein One strawberries and cream** - They're pretty small, about half the size/protein of a regular protein bar, but also half the cals. Tastes pretty similar to the strawberry filling of a pop tart, especially when microwaved! Kind of a sticky/sweet texture and artificial flavor. While I did enjoy them, strawberry just doesn't speak to me, and I see no reason to buy these over the other protein bars here (except for being 90 cal, I suppose). 8/10\n\n**Protein One peanut butter chocolate** - Has a similar flavor to the strawberry one, actually. Not fruity though, but it also doesn't really taste anything like peanut butter. Has some chocolate flavor, but not much. 7/10\n\n\n\n#Jordan’s Syrups\n\n**White chocolate syrup** - Doesn’t have the “creamy” flavor of white chocolate like the pudding mix did, this is a liquid though, so it makes sense. A couple tablespoons is really nice in some baked goods, tea, hot chocolate, or coffee though! Or PB2, oatmeal, yogurt, smoothies, milkshakes, etc. anything that a liquid sweetener could be useful in. There’s a nice neutral sweetness to it that goes with a wide variety of things. Although it does have some noticeable artificial taste, so I like to combine it with erythritol, or sweetening whatever I’m making with some fruit. 7/10, very versatile.\n\n**Vanilla** - Doesn’t have a very strong vanilla flavor, but it’s there, and fairly sweet still. I’d say it’s most like a vanilla candy in terms of flavor, like the vanilla tootsie rolls. 7.5/10\n\n**Salted Caramel** - Definitely has a noticeable salt and caramel flavor! Tastes exactly as I would hope. The flavor can be a little overpowering, but used as a small splash, it’s really good and puts me in the fall vibes. 8/10\n\n**Mocha** - Doesn’t really taste much like coffee, or chocolate, but that’s pretty much what I expected. I’d use this to augment actual chocolate or coffee flavors, although if used as the main flavor in something, it may be a little underwhelming. Still pretty decent though, 6.5/10\n\n**Caramel** - Much like salted caramel but of course, the salty flavor is less present, so it’s a bit less overpowering and more of a plain caramel flavor. I think I’d use this more often, but I’d really say it’s just as good as the other :) 8/10\n\n**Butter Toffee** - Tastes basically just like toffee, the toffee covered peanuts I used to have. Really good! This is probably my favorite of all the syrups, and it’s so versatile. Doesn’t have much “artificial” flavor either, although it is still quite sweet. 9/10\n\n**Hazelnut** - The hazelnut flavor is very much present! I’m not really sure how to describe it, but it feels like a more potent version of the hazelnut flavor in some coffee creamers. My second favorite flavor, I think. Mixed with some cocoa powder and PB2, you could make a “Nutella” out of this. Really yummy! 8.5/10\n\n**Peanut Butter cup** - It does indeed taste quite a bit like a peanut butter cup, so it's really good in oatmeal, a mocha, or hot cocoa. Not much else to say about it, it's as good as I expected, if not maybe a little more so. But it's also not the most versatile flavor. 7/10.\n\n**Vanilla Bean keto** - First off, I wanna mention that despite the name of this syrup, all Jordan's syrups would be considered keto (all that I know of, at least). This kind has MCT (Medium Chain Triglyceride) oil added, so it's not zero cal, but still fairly low. Has a richer texture, a little bit more like a creamer! Good in lattes I think, but I probably won't buy it again, I was curious about what the MCT oil would do. Seems to be a bit thicker (still very much a liquid though) and it also doesn't taste as sweet. I suppose it could work better in baking, since it has oil. 6/10\n\n**Barista Chai** - Definitely has a chai flavor! I could almost make out all the spices. With some almond milk, it should definitely take coffee (or some tea )to the next level. 9/10\n\n**Chocolate Coconut Macaron** - Noticeable coconut flavor! That's kind of the main taste, the chocolate is off, so I'd add cocoa powder if you want more chocolate flavor to whatever you make. Coconut though, yum! 8.5/10\n\n**Peppermint Bark** - Tastes like mocha, with a slight peppermint aftertaste to it. Not very minty at all, even less so than actual peppermint bark, I would say. 7/10\n\n**Christmas Cookie** - Mostly just generic sweetness, it does taste somewhat like a sugar cookie though. 7.5/10\n\n**Salted Caramel Mocha** - The deep \"rich\" flavor of caramel goes really well with mocha, so for them to be combined is definitely a welcome flavor. Feels festive, and still like it could be a versatile flavor. 8/10\n\n#MIO\nSince these are sugar free ways to add flavor to something, I wanted to review all the flavors I've tried, so y'all can decide which ones you'd want to get and maybe have some ideas from this post. If you're unfamiliar with what these are, they're basically little bottles of a concentrated liquid that you squirt into water, yogurt, smoothies, or other things to add flavor to them, pretty simple. They’re also excellent for homemade Jell-O!\n\n**Lemonade** - Tastes sweet and lemon like, it's decent with some sparkling water or lemon juice, 7/10\n\n**Berry blast** - Tastes sort of like mountain dew voltage, minus the carbonation, it's pretty good, 7.5/10\n\n**Orange tangerine** - Pretty good, I've mixed it with Greek yogurt and frozen it for something that tasted shockingly like an actual creamsicle. Also great in sparkling water for an orange soda of sorts. So with that in mind, 9/10\n\n**Black cherry** - A somewhat bitter cherry flavor, this one has caffeine too. I like to add it to homemade jams for some tartness, 8/10\n\n**Cherry blackberry** - Slightly more of a sweet cherry flavor, tasted a lot like V8 energy cherry flavor, if you've had it before. 6.5/10\n\n**Orange vanilla** - It does taste like what it sounds like, but vanilla in drinks is kinda weird, although combined with something cherry flavor, it can be really good. Safe cherry coke, anyone? 8.5/10\n\n**Blueberry lemonade** - Kinda a combo of berry blast and lemonade, 7/10. Good but kinda weird too.\n\n**Strawberry watermelon** - Doesn't really taste like either, it's good with some lemon juice, or to make homemade Jell-O, but otherwise it's not that good, 6/10\n\n**Lemon lime** - Tastes like the yellow/green color lemon lime flavor of Gatorade, it's actually pretty good, if you'd like that you'd probably like this, 8/10\n\n**Tropical fusion** - Yeah, tastes kinda weirdly tropical, hard to describe. Sort of like mango I think? Not bad, but the flavor doesn't go particularly well with anything else (like yogurt) so I'd give it a 6.5/10\n\n**Watermelon lemonade** - It's a bit more sour than the lemonade one, pretty refreshing with some ice cold water. 8/10\n\n**Orchard apple** - Has a kinda \"spicy sweet\" apple flavor, sort of like apple cider or apple flavor things around the fall. With some sugar free salted caramel syrup, it might be interesting. I haven't seen it in a long time, so I haven't been able to try out that idea. 7.5/10\n\n**Arctic grape** - Tastes like grape flavor stuff, not too bad with some sparkling water. 6.5/10.\n\n**Sweet tea** - Has a kinda brown sugar/root beer sweetness to it, not very fruity like the rest of these. Honestly don't like it, but maybe you would. 5/10.\n\n**Fruit punch** - Tastes fruity but not of any specific fruit, maybe like Kool aid, 7.5/10\n\n**Cranberry raspberry** - Not as tart and tangy as actual cranberries or cranberry sauce, but it does taste really good, not overly artificial tasting, 8/10\n\n**Blackberry raspberry** - Doesn't taste very good, this one is sweetened with stevia instead, but as that's less potent, the bottle will last half as long. It's a bad deal, and doesn't taste as good either, 4/10. Wouldn't recommend it, unless you particularly want it because of stevia. There's also a stevia sweetened cherry flavor, though I forget what it's called.\n\n**Berry Grape** - A little less on the grape side and more on the berry side, pretty good, although the flavor is less recognizable as most of these. Arctic grape, I could tell was grape for example. 6.5/10\n\n**Peach Mango** - Pretty good, but the mango flavor isn't very strong, I wish it were more even between the two. Still, probably one of the better flavors, 8/10\n\n#RIP VAN WAFFLES\n\n**Leo Mint cookies** - These are supposed to be like mint Oreos, but I don't think they're as good. For one, they're a bit smaller than I remember mint Oreos being. Another thing, the filling is white and tastes more like toothpaste than it should. Also, one package is 200 cals. Which I REALLY don't like, since that means I'd just have half an open package laying around. It's like those protein cookies where a serving is half a pack. WHAT. Anyway, these have more fiber/protein and low sugar I guess so they're \"safer\" but these aren't ideal either. But they could be good in a milkshake or crumbled over oatmeal, I suppose. 4.5/10.\n\n**Leo cookies and cream** - The standard \"Oreo\" version that isn't mint. Same general things apply, but it doesn't really taste like toothpaste. And I'd say they're most comparable to a regular Oreo in terms of frosting amount, so not really \"double stuff\" or anything. 5.5/10.\n\n**Honey and Oats waffle** - For those who've never had stroopwaffles before, they're basically like thin waffle cookies, often filled with honey, syrup, caramel, etc. but they come in lots of types and flavors. Anyway, this was DELICIOUS like how I remembered stroopwaffles to be. I like keeping them on top of a hot cup of coffee or tea, so the inside gets all gooey. It's amazing. Not particularly low cal, but I don't care, WORTH IT. 9/10",

        "body": "The last of them here:\n\n#SUGAR FREE PUDDING MIX\n**Vanilla** - Has more of an eggy french vanilla flavor, in my opinion. This is great actually, you can make low cal egg nog with it! Me and other people on this subreddit have already made recipes for this before. 8/10\n\n**Banana** - Regardless of brand, these usually just taste like vanilla with an artificial yet delicious banana flavor. Like banana laffy taffy, for example. It’s pretty good in strawberry and banana smoothies! Although you could use vanilla pudding mix and add banana extract. 7.5/10\n\n**Butterscotch** - Goes well with PB2 for peanut butter butterscotch overnight oats, one of the tastiest combos I’ve found. 7.5/10\n\n**Pistachio** - It’s alright, although it has actual pistachio and chunks of nuts in it. Unexpected for pudding, not my usual, but nice. 7/10\n\n**White Chocolate** - Really good, it has a creamy sweetness like white chocolate, great for oatmeal, smoothies, etc. and goes well with pumpkin and peaches I’ve noticed. Also one thing I love about it, sugar free white chocolate pudding mix is probably the best way to get that distinct white choccy flavor while still being low cal. Cocoa powder gives a low cal chocolate flavor, but white chocolate is a little more tricky to replicate, so it gets bonus points here. Good for peppermint bark oatmeal as well. Also nice for baking! 9.5/10\n\n**Lemon** - Probably one of my favorite flavors, but the lemon part is pretty subtle. I like adding a little lemon juice/zest to up that up a bit. It's also good for baking lemon cookies! 8.5/10\n\n#MISC PRODUCTS\n**Oat fiber** - Seems to give baked goods a snap, I have used it to make low cal oreos before, with a very similar crunch. It also has a flavor some consider “chalky”, although I like it. With that said, I still wouldn’t have oat fiber by itself. I also like using it in smoothies, oatmeal, and to thicken pudding, PB2, etc. 7/10, very useful although unlike pudding mix, isn’t my go-to for making a smoothie etc. super yummy\n\n**Xanthan gum** - helps emulsify stuff, for example it keeps a smoothie or milkshake from separation, you could blend yogurt and lemon juice together with this, and it would make separation less likely. So, it’s mostly just a good thickener for texture and stuff. It also helps imitate the stretch of gluten in dough that doesn’t have any, which is why I use it often in my oat flour recipes. Good deal no matter where you get it, since even just ½ a tsp really goes far. 9/10\n\n**Enlightened brand Mocha Choc Chip Ice cream bar** - I have only really tried this from their brand so it goes here. Good coffee flavor and the bars are pretty substantial, nice creamy texture too, 8/10, nick's is still my favorite safe ice cream brand so far though.\n\n**Powdered Pumpkin Seed** - This was basically like PB2 but had like 50% more protein and had a flavor similar to goldfish crackers I would say. Nice for savory things, 6/10\n\n**Fulfill Salted Caramel protein bar** - Kinda has a candy bar vibe, really good actually. Reminds me maybe of a \"Mr good bar\" or \"Krackel\" I think? Had a pretty excellent texture and taste, so much so I'd consider it a protein candy more than a bar, like the Quest ones. 9/10, worth trying for sure.\n\n**Handheld Milk Frother** - While this is more of an appliance, they’re really nice for making beverages, adding a layer of foam similar to what drinks from Starbucks may have. Helps mix drinks too, so if you got hot cocoa or a protein shake with some clumps, these can probably help. I also think a milk frother could do awesome things with egg whites or tomato soup, definitely lots of creative potential here. 9/10, some almond milk with flavor syrup infused with coffee will reach a higher level when frothed.\n\n**Millie’s Tomato Basil broth bag** - These are basically like savory tea bags, made exactly the same way as regular tea. They taste similar to ramen seasoning packets. Very good for making soup broth! Along with some nutritional yeast (which dissolves in water) it’s an easy way to make some delicious and cozy soup. 7/10\n\n**Birch Bender’s Protein Pancake Mix** - AMAZING. I got 16oz of this mix for under $6 on amazon, which I’d say is a really good deal. It doesn’t taste like much, but the texture is excellent, and you can substitute the water for sugar free syrups, chocolate almond milk, coffee creamer, or soup broth for adding flavor. So many possibilities! Speaking of the water, this mix only requires water! Which I like, since it’s easier. But I’ve also done add-ins, like oat fiber, erythritol, cocoa powder, extracts, and flavor syrups for Nutella protein pancakes! 9/10, I really recommend it. Affordable, which cannot be said for everything on this list.\n\n**Truvia Confectioners erythritol** - This is the erythritol equivalent of powdered sugar, the fine stuff you often use in frostings, topping French toast/pancakes, etc. and it tastes just like it. I suspect that every brand will basically be the same, that's been my experience with erythritol. The differences are mostly the form it takes (brown, white, confectioners, etc.) 8/10\n\n**Hershey's special dark cocoa powder** - The brand has regular cocoa powder, and a special dutched version. This dutched/alkalized cocoa is less bitter than most cocoa powder, the best way to describe it is like the flavor of a chocolate cake, or an Oreo (that's the type of cocoa powder they use). I love this cocoa powder, it's my go-to and I've used it for years. But I should mention, since the cocoa powder is much darker in color, most of the baked goods you make will appear charred. 9/10\n\n**Atkins Nutty Caramel treat bar** - Basically exactly like a candy bar, really good. It's fairly big and low cal, but worth noting it's not a protein bar, and it has 17g fiber, so might cause gut discomfort, and for that reason I probably won't buy more. Great when frozen, too! 8/10",

First order I had brownie batter and cinnamon bun.  This order I have another cinnamon bun, butter pecan and cookie dough.  I think butter pecan is my favorite. \n\nI throw a serving into the microwave for 35 seconds and its pretty much a brownie/cookie.  Throw a slab of kerrygold on top and YUM.\n\nAll of the ingredients are awesome.  The only warning is the cookie dough flavor contains maltitol.  The rest are stevia/erythritol.   \n\nEDIT: added link to pure formula site with all nutritional info ",

After a moment of disbelief, I am totally OK with it.\n\nIf someone had told me on Memorial Day that I would be **fifty** pounds lighter soon after Labor Day I would not have believed it. All it took was a season, gallons of heavy cream and more meat than I thought I could ever eat. I hit a stall a couple of weeks ago that did not appear to be Shark Week related. After looking at my eating habits I realized it was Maltitol. Once I cut that out I went right back to ticking off a pound here and there. Then the past few days four pounds just wooshed right off putting me in the 220's for the first time in a decade.\n\nAt this rate I could very well see Onederland by NYE although my goal is to hit it before my 40th in February. I want to thank and hug and air kiss each and every active member of /r/xxketo. All of your mirth, inspirational posts and awesomely collaborative community keep me reaching for the gold ring.

    "body": "I have been strict keto for over a year. I have had the electrolytes in check, but I have been dealing with awful bloating and gas. I know many people have better digestion with keto, but for me it was far worse. I never had any serious digestive issues before keto other than chronic heart burn. When I transitioned to keto, I started eating a lot more low carb leafy green and cruciferous veggies (notoriously harder to digest than the higher carb varieties) and eating less frequent, bigger meals. My digestive system could not keep up. Historically, I have not been able to properly stomach more than 40g of protein at once, which has posed a big issue when I need 180g of protein a day (I'm a lifter working on building up strength) and only eat two meals a day. Pre keto I was eating 7-8 small meals a day which gave my stomach time to properly digest each meal rather than overloading it with too much food at once.\n\nAfter months of experimentation, it turns out the root cause has been low stomach acid. I have had issues with heartburn my entire life, and so have been on antacids for years at the direction of my doctor. It turns out this was just making everything worse and wrecked my gut to the point I had a mild case of SIBO. I am off the antacids and have been working to acidify my stomach. I had to temporarily limit fiber and veggies while my gut recovered and I worked to properly acidify my stomach. (On a side note, the carnivore diet is great if you have SIBO or many other gut issues and are trying to repair your gut health - then after a month or two you can slowly start reintroducing fiber and veggies into your diet - or just stay on it - but personally I feel better eating lots of veggies). I have a morning apple cider vinegar drink and another one before my two big meals of the day. Additionally, I have been taking 2-3 Betaine HCl/Pepsin/Gentian Bitters capsules alongside a good digestive enzyme supplement (I like the Dr Matthew #1 Digestive Enzymes on Amazon) with every meal. These are life changing for me. Without them, I cannot properly digest large amounts of protein or food in general; I just got used to feeling uncomfortably bloated, distended, and gassy for hours after every time I ate. My stomach is a machine now. Steak? Brussels sprouts? Ribs? Broccoli? All completely pulverized, and I feel amazing afterwards.\n\nThere are a lot of common keto foods I also discovered were huge triggers for me and I still have to avoid. Avocados were the main one. I'm still trying to work up a tolerance to them. Inulin/chicory root fiber is an ingredient in a **lot** of keto foods, and I also have major issues with it. Even a single serving of Lily's chocolate results in horrific gas for hours. Soluble corn fiber I actually have no issue with it all, which is great because I love Quest bars and Choc Zero. The Kirkland/Costco bars on the other hand give me awful gas and bloating - and I guess it turns out the tapioca starch/IMO in them is a fake non keto friendly fiber anyways, so I won't eat them for that reason anyways.\n\nSome people have had issues with some of the keto friendly sweeteners, even erythritol and allulose. After much experimentation, none of them cause me any issues at all, not even Xylitol. I have never been brave enough to try maltitol, not that it's even keto friendly. I'm staying away from sucralose for now while I heal my digestion - I don't think it has been causing me any issues, but there is inconclusive research that points to the potential that it **might** cause some disturbances with our gut flora. The small amounts found in protein powders and Quest bars I'm not worried about, but I have stopped using the oceans of Torani sugar free syrups and sucralose drops I was previously.\n\nA few other things I have implemented which have made a big difference:\n\n* Avoiding combining berries with protein. Apparently the enzymes used to digest both are very different, and so these do not digest well together for me. If I have my 1/2 cup of berries, I have to space it out at least 30 minutes apart from large amounts of protein.\n* Limiting consumption of packaged keto foods that include a lot of added fibers. I can still handle the occasional Quest bar or premade keto pancake or baking mix, for example, but I find I do better eating more whole foods.\n* Eating cooked and fermented veggies rather than raw. Raw veggies are almost always harder on the digestion. Cooking veggies does not drain them of their vitamins and minerals unless you are **over**cooking them or boiling them and pouring out the water used to boil them (and even then, most of the nutrients stay in the cooked veggies). The fermentation process also helps to sort of predigest veggies for you, along with injecting some friendly probiotics into your system.\n* I now avoid broccoli stems. I can tolerate the crowns when cooked, but the stems still give me issues, along with many others.\n* Certain magnesium supplements, namely magnesium citrate found in the Natural Vitality Calm and Ultima electrolyte powder that a lot of ketoers use, can give me major GI distress if too much is taken too quickly, but the right amount can help me have my BM in the morning. Still, I have to limit myself to about 150mg of magnesium citrate per day which is half a serving of the Natural Vitality Calm powder. I try to get the rest of my magnesium from non laxative forms, or better yet, whole foods. Be very careful with magnesium supplements, and electrolyte supplements in general.\n* Caffeine causes me major bloating issues if taken around a meal. I find it's best taken on an empty stomach shortly after waking up (although some research is showing it's best to wait 30-45 minutes after waking to have your caffeine) or pre workout on an empty stomach.\n* Which brings me to coffee. Cold brew is so much easier on my stomach. I highly recommend giving it a try if you love coffee but find coffee irritates your stomach.\n* Chia seeds - these are great, but soak them before eating! I was putting them raw directly into my smoothies. Bad idea.\n* When eating beef, it's important to properly chew. Ground beef also seems easier to digest. When I eat steak, I make sure to eat slowly and chew thoroughly. And again, the Betaine HCl/Pepsin/Gentian Bitters capsules come to the rescue here especially with beef.\n* Eating more slowly in general. I had a bad habit of snarfing down my food, which caused me to swallow a lot of air which caused bloating. Eating slowly and mindfully is an all around better strategy in any case. You can properly enjoy your food and limit overeating.\n* Too much water can actually bloat you, and cause electrolyte imbalances. Drink when you are thirsty - don't force water into your system simply because you think you need it. I try to limit the amount of water I drink with big meals, too, and right before bed.\n* We all need plenty of sodium on keto. But too much sodium can still cause bloating issues. Balancing it out with proper levels of potassium is important too. If I've had too much salt, I might drink a small glass of water with about 100mg worth of potassium from Nosalt and I feel better within about 15 minutes. Note you should never ingest large amounts of potassium at once from lite salt, Nosalt, or any of those others, as this can be dangerous. Stick to 1/4 tsp portions or less. And ideally get the majority of your potassium from whole foods.\n* I now supplement with psyllium husk, acacia fiber, and glucomannan. I tend to need at least 30-40g of fiber to have regular BMs. If I don't have my BM in the morning, I know the rest of the day I will be miserable. I unfortunately haven't worked up my digestive system to the amount of veggies I'd need for 30-40g of fiber, so the fiber supplements work great. I take these hours apart from my main meals (other than 1/4 tsp acacia fiber before meals which I can tolerate), as otherwise I risk too much bloating. Note I had to gradually introduce these into my diet over time. Caution is always advised with fiber supplements.\n* Fennel seeds are amazing after eating for digestion. The tea is great, but honestly I prefer just chewing on 1/2 tsp of them for about five minutes and then swallowing.\n* Ginger and turmeric are great to have before or during meals. I put 1/4 tsp each into my pre meal apple cider vinegar drinks, but some people use 1/2 tsp. Although for turmeric you could just take a good turmeric/circumin capsule.\n* Heather’s Tummy Tamer peppermint oil softgels are amazing. I take one first thing every morning on an empty stomach with a sip of water and then wait 15 minutes before drinking anything else. This is important so it makes it out of the stomach intact. It’s not pleasant if it dissolves in the stomach. I also take one 30 mins before eating if I know my meal might cause me possible issues. \n* Collagen has been great for my gut health and joint health. I consume one serving a day of collagen peptide powder (type 1 and 3) plus a cup of chicken bone broth for type 2.  \n* Gas-X is my hero if I'm still feeling bloated 15 minutes after eating, which fortunately is a less and less frequent occurrence. It's generally safe to take this as frequently as you need it, as the main active ingredient (simethicone) never gets absorbed into the bloodstream and stays in the digestive tract. Many people with particularly bad digestive issues take 4-6 of these every day.\n\nI can't say my digestive issues are 100% solved, but the gas and bloating is probably 20% of what it was a couple of months ago. Just wanted to share in case anyone else out there has had some of the same issues.",

My solution was to only consomme dairy like heavy cream (very low in lactose and casein) and hard cheeses like parmesan and feta which were fermented enough to have their lactose and protein content transformed into ones that are easy to digest and anti inflammatory for the human body. I discovered that I am sensitive to some veggies (garlic, onion, leek, asparagus, mushrooms) which make me bloating and causes acne. \n\nI am now trying to introduce fermented food in my diet (kombucha, kefir, pickles) to have some probiotics while i'm eliminating some food.

Others really don't like the taste of stevia. Someone might be willing to use it sometimes, but don't want to have so many sugar replacements.\n\nIts expensive. A person might be hesitant to spend that much with little experience in with it. Manufactures and people might not want to use it because many people don't know the different types of sweeteners well enough to understand differences. Manufactures might choose a cheaper option (malitol) or a more commonly known one (splenda). \n\nIts confused with other alcohol sugars. Some sugar alcohols cause sever gastro-upset in some and blood sugar issues in others. After having an issue with one sugar alcohol, many avoid all -itol sweeteners. \n\nMany just don't know enough about any of the sugar replacements to know enough to seek it out.

I loved to stock up on Atkins bars and have this back-up pile for variety/treats/grab'n'go meal. \n\nI loved the reassuring \"total carbs - polyols = net carbs\" line on the wrapper. It's Atkins after all, surely they know what they are talking about. Now I knew that not all sugar alcohols are equal, but I couldn't be bothered to remember which one is which, so I grouped them in my mind as \"basically sweeteners with 2 kcal/g that should be treated like fiber\".  \n\nSugar alcohol | GI | kcal/g\n---|---|---\nSugar | 100 | 4\nMaltitol syrup| 52 | 3\nPolyglycitol | 39 | 2.8\nMaltitol |36 | 2.7\nXylitol | 13 | 3\nIsomalt | 9 | 2.1\nSorbitol | 9 | 2.5\nLactitol | 6 | 2\nErythritol | 1 | 0.2\nMannitol | 1 | 1.5\n\nAtkins is mainly maltitol syrup with a bit of sorbitol. It does have a slower release compared to sugar, but so does pasta and anything that is not pure sugar. \n\n[Actual net carb count for Atkins bar](http://i.imgur.com/OHjDllC.jpg)\n\nEDIT: For an estimate I counted polyols as 1/2 because of half GI, but thinking again maltitol has 3 kcal/g, which means it is 3/4 absorbed (max is 4 kcal for a carb). So instead of subtracting full 12.6g we only have to subtract 25% of 12.6, since the rest is absorbed, GI of other foods is not taken into account when calculating their net carbs after all. \n\n[Recalculated Atkins carbs](http://i.imgur.com/JutPFHF.jpg)\n\nA general rule of thumb is - if it gives you diarrhea (like sorbitol in sugar free gummy bears), it is not impacting your blood sugar, if it doesn't (like maltitol in Atkins products) - it is impacting your blood sugar. \n\nI feel betrayed. Sure, it is best to avoid low carb \"junk food\" and graze on a celery stick dipped in peanut butter, but IMO the more options there are, the more sustainable it is. \n\nSeeing every single keto entry on MFP getting it wrong, including /r/keto Script, prompted me to make this post.

    "body": "\n#A little note:\nSince many of these can be tricky to find and can be expensive (like Quest bars being $30 a box usually, Nicks being $10 a pint), I wanted to make a review/discussion post for anyone curious about them\n\nMany of these that I’ve tried, I haven’t tried recently (as in last few days/weeks) since it’s taken some time to try them. But I am doing my best to remember and give helpful reviews. Feel free to ask questions or make any comments below! Even if you see this months later, I’ll still answer if I can\n\nI also wanna add with ratings, something like 6/10 isn’t disappointing to me, rather something like 8.5 or higher is just REALLY good. Or in my opinion. This is all just my opinion, making a review to hopefully help someone out :)\n\nFor your convenience it is all labeled and categorized by brand, with a miscellaneous section for random things. I posted something like this a few months ago, thought I’d post an update though since there’s like 20+ more things I added, so seemed like people might appreciate it :)\n\n#QUEST PRODUCTS\n\n**Peppermint Bark bar** - Really good texture, covered in a layer of white chocolate, not much dark chocolate in it, so no layer for that. It has mint peppermint sprinkles embedded in the white chocolate coating. This is basically the exact same as birthday cake, BUT it has a minty fresh flavor. Not overpowering mint either. I like to bake all quest bars and these are no exception. Top it with the lily’s mint chocolate chips before baking to really take it to the next level! 9/10\n\n**Pumpkin Spice bar** - Similar to peppermint bark but with a thicker white chocolate coating and a STRONG pumpkin spice flavor. Like, wow it has some kick kind of spice. Not overpowering, but noticeable. It kind of reminds me of the chunks you’d have in pumpkin spice flavored ice cream? Anyway, 8.5/10\n\n**White Chocolate Raspberry bar** - It mostly just tasted like plain sweetness, like oatmeal chocolate chip without the chip, and it has raspberry seeds in it. Not my cup of tea, 6/10. I’d have one if it was free, but the price of quest bars means they really gotta be yummy\n\n**Birthday Cake bar** - A white chocolate coating, fluffy texture, tastes kinda like a typical, what would you call it, a white cake, a vanilla cake? Mostly just fluffy sweetness, one of my favorites. 8.5/10\n\n**Chocolate Brownie** - Just a chocolatey bar, no chocolate chips or anything. It’s really good though, very close to an actual brownie when microwaved, maybe just a little less sweet. Also the lowest cal standard quest bar flavor, at 170. Small difference, but it makes this nice flavor even nicer.\n\n**Double Chocolate chunk bar** - Not very sweet, mostly just plain chocolate flavor with chunks in it, it’s good, just not amazing. 6.5/10\n\n**S’mores bar** - Not a very strong marshmallow or graham cracker flavor, unless you bake it, then it kinda gets a caramel-like flavor to the outside, much like an actual toasted marshmallow. However… when I ordered 2 boxes off amazon, one box had “dry” chocolate chunks. I don’t really know how to describe it, it’s like the chocolate was left out on a table for weeks, exposed to the air and not stored properly or something. It only affected the texture, but that still made it less of a fav, 7/10.\n\n**Maple Waffle bar** - AMAZING. Very sweet, it has syrup parts that get all gooey when you bake it, this is an S tier protein bar. White chocolate chunks in there, too. 9.5/10, marked slightly higher than peppermint bark cause mint is a niche flavor, gotta feel festive for it y’know\n\n**Oatmeal Chocolate chip bar** - It was kinda underwhelming, not any oat flavor that I noticed. 5/10\n\n**Cookie Dough bar** - It does taste a lot like cookie dough, but the texture isn’t quite there, even when baked. 6.5/10\n\n**Cookies and Cream bar** - Not very much “cream” or frosting flavor, it was like a generic slightly sweet white bar with ground up “cookie” in it, not much like an Oreo at all, if that’s what it was mimicking. 6.5/10.\n\n**Peanut Butter chocolate chip bar** - A good peanut butter flavor, much like cookie dough. Bit dry and not as fluffy as some of these can be. 6/10\n\n**Chocolate Sprinkled donut bar** - It’s basically like a chocolate layer version of birthday cake. Some people compare it to a Hostess cake but I don’t quite see it. Not too shabby though, and fairly soft, 7.5/10\n\n**Caramel Chocolate chunk** - Kind of like a less sweet, more salty birthday cake flavor. The bar itself is the “caramel”, there seems to be no actual caramel bits or swirls. Basically just a sweet and salty bar with chocolate chunks. While a birthday cake or pumpkin pie quest bar wouldn’t be like an actual cake or pie, this is further from “caramel chocolate chunk” than I’d expect. Still decent and could be amazing with some PB2, caramel/chocolate drizzle. But even so, 6/10.\n\n**Blueberry Muffin** - Very reminiscent of an actual blueberry muffin, especially when baked. There's not much blueberry flavor but plenty of muffin flavor, although there are dried blueberries in the bar. Pretty good! 7.5/10\n\n**HERO bar caramel pecan** - Tasted kinda odd to me, maybe it’s because it has chunks of nuts in there, hero bars are different from the regular bars. I prefer the regular kind though, 6/10.\n\n**HERO crispy chocolate coconut** - Tastes *glorious*. It's like a rice krispie covered in chocolate and coconut. Excellent texture, really good flavor, 9/10. Also really good baked (a little messy) or frozen!\n\n**Salted caramel snack bar** - They look visually more like a granola bar. It tasted pretty good, the caramel drizzle on it tastes more like caramel flavor white chocolate? Not quite caramel. 7/10, but mind you these are less of a protein bar and more of a granola bar, a bit different than most quest bars\n\n**Quest ranch tortilla chips** - They were really good actually, my one thing is that the chips are fragile so aren’t ideal for dipping, and aren’t all that filling due to being chips. Still tasty though, 7.5/10. Also wanna mention these are similar to the Atkins ranch protein chips, I couldn't even tell the difference between the two, in fact.\n\n**Quest Double Chocolate protein cookie** - Not as sweet as I’d expected a cookie to be, but it has a good texture on par with most cookies like this. 7/10\n\n**Quest PB protein cookie** - It does taste like a peanut butter cookie and has the right texture, however it lacks just a bit of that salty sweet flavor imo. 6/10\n\n**Quest Chocolate Chip protein cookie** - Kind of underwhelming, not particularly soft or chewy, and the sweetness/saltiness is overall a bit bland. It's just alright, I'd rather make my own protein chocolate chip cookie, especially for these cals. 6/10.\n\n**Quest chocolate frosted cookie** - Now this did taste like a little debbie or hostess product to me, coated in chocolate and they’re really good dipped in PB2 or frozen. Also, very soft and cakey. 8/10\n\n**Quest gooey caramel candy bar** - This is indeed like a candy bar, although which to compare it to, I’m not sure. It has caramel, chocolate, and peanuts, similar to a Snicker’s. 8.5/10\n\n**Quest PB cup** - These are slightly larger than a Reese’s peanut butter cup, don’t have that little paper wrapper surrounding each one, and the peanut butter filling doesn’t have that “gritty” texture of regular Reese’s. The chocolate also tastes a bit darker. Still good, but less crumble for lack of a better word. 7/10\n\n#THINK BARS\nI forget the exact flavors, chocolate brownie and a peanut butter one I think, but I am looping them together at 4/10, the texture is fine, although they don’t have much sweetness compared to other protein bars, so no real reason to get them, the ones I’ve tried don’t really compete with these other protein bars on the list\n\n#BUILT BARS\n**Double Chocolate** - Mostly just a dark chocolate gooey flavor, it’s like the texture of caramel, sticky, but it’s chocolate flavor. 5/10\n\n**Salted Caramel** - It does have a salty caramel like flavor, but the texture seems too stretchy and not gooey/sticky enough like caramel would be. Gelatin is in the ingredients, so that explains the “gummy” texture. 5/10\n\n**Coconut Almond** - Tastes similar to an almond joy, but that gummy texture of the others is still there, and it doesn’t have whole almonds like an almond joy has. 4/10.\n\n**Coconut** - Less of a gummy texture than the others, actually pretty decent, 6/10\n\n**Cookies and Cream** - Mostly has a dutched cocoa flavor, not really any cream taste to it. Same gummy texture as most of them. 5/10\n\n**Peanut Butter Brownie** - The filling actually has a somewhat similar texture to peanut butter, I quite like it. There's little nut fragments too. 6.5/10\n\n**Churro** - The texture was rubber. Taste is fine, but the texture, literally like rubber. Churros are supposed to be like donuts covered in cinnamon in regards to taste and texture, this one is softer but there wasn’t any cinnamon flavor. 2/10.\n\n**Coconut Marshmallow** - Also basically just as rubbery in terms of texture, it tasted pretty good, still wouldn’t recommend the flavor though. Well, the rubber texture is nicer here since actual marshmallows already kinda have such a texture. Reminds me of chocolate covered marshmallow bunnies you’d find around easter. Even so, 3.5/10.\n\nI probably won’t buy Built bars again due to the textures of them being a fruit snack or rubber, unless I found a good deal on individual bars to get a feel for any flavors I may like. The only reason I see to get these is that built bars are lower cal, 130-180 cals typically, with 15-19g protein. Mostly on par with other protein bars. If they were cheaper, I would probably buy them again. Although I will say that the “100% chocolate” statements about the bars are accurate, the chocolate coating (usually dark chocolate) is excellent, amazing even. It’s just a shell though, as I discovered, Built bars are basically expensive chocolate covered protein fruit snacks.\n\n#BARBELL PROTEIN BARS\n**Caramel Cashew** - It was alright, didn't really have much caramel flavor, but the texture was very nice. Just kinda reminds me of a chocolate bar with nuts, which is always good anyway. 7.5/10\n\n**Cookies and Cream** - This was actually AMAZING. They're covered in rice bits or crispy things of some kind (whey protein crisps I'm guessing). Flavor is kinda like the Oreo cookies and cream candy bar, if I remember the taste correctly. 9/10.\n\nPeople recommended I try these, and I see why, both were really good :)\n\n#Pure Protein bars\n\n**Lemon Cake** - So far the only one of this brand I’ve tried, very good though! Definitely has a lemon cake flavor, a bit of the texture of a lemon bar too. Also amazing microwaved! I’d say it has the general flavor of Quest, and the texture of Think bars (which was my favorite thing about those). Great texture and flavor. 190 cals and 20g protein, so it’s comparable to other bars. What’s more? Most the protein bars of this brand are much more affordable, like half the price of other brands, which is AMAZING. I’m giving it a 9.5/10 for all these reasons.\n\n**Chocolate Mint Cookie** - Basically a two layered \"cookies and cream\" type of flavor, with a subtle mint taste. Noticeable, and I think it's just enough that both people who do and don't like mint, would enjoy this. The texture is also dense and chewy, sort of like a granola bar, not as fluffy as the lemon cake flavor. Good frozen, and it’s REALLY good heated since it's already like a brownie. Worth noting, this bar has 16g Maltitol from what I can tell. It's a sugar alcohol that might not be as easy on the gut as erythritol. YMMV. Anyway, 8/10. I like lemon cake a little more.\n\n**Birthday Cake** - Covered in a white chocolate or frosting coating of some kind, and it's got actual sprinkles on it! You know those frosted animal cookies? This is exactly like those, but softer/cakey in texture. When microwaved for a while, it's even BETTER than Quest birthday cake, I'd say. Or at least, it's more like an actual cake should be. There's a slight protein-y aftertaste present in this, and every other Pure Protein bar I've tried. Still really good though, more affordable too, as usual for the brand. 8.5/10\n\n#LILY'S CHOCOLATE\n\n**White chocolate chips** - Tastes like white chocolate, super tasty. I have used them in peppermint bark overnight oats before! Stevia/erythritol sweetened. 8/10\n\n**White chocolate baking bar** - So it's basically just a white chocolate baking bar, plain white chocolate that you could temper or chop for baking. Or eat like a candy bar. Tastes pretty much just like white chocolate, and the chips. But I do like it better than the chocolate chips, simply because a bar form means you can make chocolate shavings easily, or chop it up. More versatile that way. That being said, like regular white chocolate, it's very \"rich\", just a little is enough to satisfy. Although I do prefer dark chocolate. Anyway, 9/10\n\n**Mint chocolate chips** - These are like semi sweet or slightly dark chocolate chips, with a minty flavor. Would also be good in chocolate cookies. Peppermint bark cookies, too! 8.5/10\n\n**Lily's gummy bears** - They're pretty good, although a little firm and not as fruity as I remember regular gummy worms being. Still nice though, 7/10\n\n**Lily's sour gummy worms** - Pretty much same as the other, the texture was a little different than I thought it would be, and the sourness was like just a coating rather than in the whole gummy like I remember for regular gummy worms? Better than I previously remember though, a second try and they were nice and sticky like gummies should be. For all the Lily's gummies, it's worth noting they're super high in fiber though, like around 24g in one bag if I remember. 7.5/10\n\n#LAKANTO\n**Chocolate chips** - They’re decent like lily’s, however the “crunch” or “snap” isn’t quite the same as with regular chocolate chips. Nowadays I usually prefer regular chocolate chips for that reason, texture is a little different. 6/10\n\n**Erythritol Monkfruit Sweetener** - Tastes just like sugar and can be used as such in recipes needing granulated sweetener, erythritol is usually 70% as sweet and that’s why it has monkfruit in there as well. 8/10 but you can get another brand of sweetener, basically the same flavor\n\n**Brown erythritol monkfruit sweetener** - Pretty much just like brown sugar, in terms of both taste and texture! It even clumps together similarly, too. A little fancier to use in oatmeal or PB2, 8.5/10\n\n**Maple syrup cinnamon** - Doesn’t seem as thick as I remember maple syrup being, but it definitely has the sweetness down. 8.5/10\n\n#NICK'S ICE CREAM\n**Vanilla** - Tastes pretty much exactly like plain vanilla ice cream, it is vanilla. I’ve used it for pumpkin spice milkshakes before, very good. ALL Nick’s ice cream has been comparable, in my opinion, to regular ice cream. 8/10. Smooth texture, not a brick like Halo Top (never had it before, that’s just what I have heard about it)\n\n**Chili Mango** - Spicy with what seems to be swirls of caramel in there. It is quite spicy, enough so that I think I experienced a “Taco Bell effect” from it. Spicy ice cream is an unusual combo in my opinion, so while I wouldn’t say I’d buy it again, it was worth trying and pretty much what I expected. 6.5/10\n\n**Salted Caramel** - Pretty much just a more salty version of vanilla, with caramel swirls in it too. Really good with some PB2 on top, maybe some apple chips as well. 9/10\n\n**Peanut Butter Caramel** - Just like salted caramel it has swirls of caramel, and it is also more peanut buttery. I made a PBJ inspired milkshake with some of this, another fun idea is a Snicker’s milkshake, just add cocoa powder, a little PB2, and some almond milk. 8.5/10\n\n**Mint chocolate chip** - It tastes like regular mint chocolate chip ice cream, and if I remember correctly, has chocolate chips as opposed to chopped chocolate chunks. That’s just a difference in the shape of said chocolate, but still worth a mention I thought. 8/10, especially if you like mint as I do.\n\n**Cookies and Cream** - Mostly just vanilla and chocolate chips as I recall. Also, this used regular sugar according to the label, which means less erythritol. A little higher cal, but perhaps less likely to give the “Haribo Sugar Free gummy bear effect”, 7.5/10\n\n**Hazelnut Fudge** - So something interesting with this flavor, I noticed it was vegan. If anyone wants a safe vegan ice cream, THIS IS IT. But, it doesn’t have a strong hazelnut flavor at all. It has little chocolate or caramel-like swirls in it, and that’s the “hazelnut”. Maybe top with nutella or some other hazelnut flavor thing, cause this just didn’t like hazelnut to me. Still good though, 7/10\n\n**Hazelnut Cream** - Not vegan like the other one was, tasted better in my opinion, similar to those Ferrero Rochers I’d say, it’s pretty good! Has a bit of a richer texture too, and the chocolate chunks are kinda like a wafer in terms of texture. It’s a little higher cal, yet quite delicious so 9/10\n\n**Pumpkin Spice Swirl** - Not a very strong pumpkin spice flavor, it tastes more like actual pumpkin than pumpkin flavored ice cream to me. So, very good if you like how real pumpkin tastes. It also has fragments of pecans, which takes the texture to the next level. This would be fantastic for topping a baked apple with. 8.5/10\n\n**Peppermint** - Yet another festive flavor, themed after a candy cane! Very similar to candy cane/peppermint flavored regular ice cream, although the pieces remind me of dried fruit almost. They aren’t really crunchy, unlike how I remember other brands of peppermint ice cream being. I like Mint Chocolate Chip more I’d say, but festive seasonal flavors are still really fun, so this is a 8.5/10, an especially good flavor to use in milkshakes.\n\n**Chocolate Cherry** - The cherry flavor is pretty subtle, similar to fruit flavored chocolates/protein bars, but still noticeable. It has chunks of chocolate, which is pretty good. With some actual cherries on top (frozen, dried or otherwise, but you'll want the pits taken out first) it would be amazing. 8/10\n\n**Raspberry Swirl** - The fruity flavor is subtle, as with cherry. More as if there’s chunks of raspberries in there. Also, it has raspberry seeds! If you like those, you’ll probably enjoy this flavor. Especially great with raspberry fragments on top, they’re an excellent topping since they usually have fragmented pieces anyway. Worth noting, the chocolate isn’t noticeable, so might wanna top with some choccy chips! 8/10\n\n**Rocky Road** - Chocolate, nuts, and marshmallow, the typical stuff of the rocky road flavor. It’s maybe a bit denser in texture (a bit tougher to scoop), and it’s also quite a bit higher cal than other Nick’s flavors. It’s alright, but with that in mind, I wouldn’t buy it again, and that’s a first for this brand. 5/10. Although I suppose if you like rocky road ice cream, this could be really good.\n\n**Chocolate Chocolate** - A double chocolate flavor, this one is pretty good as far as chocolate ice cream goes, although it’s simple and wouldn’t be my go-to, nothing stands out about it. 7/10\n\n**Strawberry Cream** - Another vegan flavor! Probably the best vegan flavor I've tried, of any ice cream in general. Tastes pretty much like a regular strawberry ice cream/strawberry milk, with what seems to be freeze dried strawberry pieces here and there. The texture is soft, but not quite as rich/creamy as others, probably because it's vegan and isn't using dairy. Still, it's pretty good. 8/10\n\n**Strawberry Cheesecake** - AMAZING OMG. The flavor is good, cheesecake-y, and there's graham cracker bits in it. The taste isn't exactly what makes it special, all the things combined is what's so nice. A very \"fun\" flavor, if that makes sense. There's just enough going on in this one, and I'm all here for it. 9/10.\n\n**Swedish Munchies** - Not a very descriptive flavor name, so it's basically a chocolate vanilla swirl, with brownie and cookie dough pieces. I don't feel too strongly about it, but like strawberry cheesecake, the texture has some VERY nice heterogeneity. Good quality, and this ice cream is more like regular ice cream, pleasantly firm. Not a solid chunk of ice, but firm enough it isn't instantly soft when removing from the fridge. So not a personal favorite, but I think it's good. If you like heterogeneity, cookie dough, and brownies, you'll probably love this. 8.5/10.\n\n**Lemon Bar** - Once again, it doesn't have a very strong fruit (lemon) flavor, but it's still there as a nice subtle note. Also much like salted caramel, there's lemon flavor swirls in here! The texture is exactly like salted caramel pretty much, but lemon. Excellent texture. 8.5/10\n\n**Key lime/cheesecake** - Really good! Like flavor stuff like yogurt generally doesn't appeal to me, but this was nice, and the flavor is strong, but not too much so! Also a firmer ice cream, so it doesn't melt too quickly. 9/10\n\n**Campfire S'mores** - Not much marshmallow or graham cracker flavor, but it does have chocolate and graham cracker chunks. Reminds me more of a cookie dough flavor. Still really good though, both in taste and texture! Nice and dense. 9/10\n\n**Nick's Vanilla Cream sandwich** - Really good, higher cal than most Nick's ice cream I think, although it's still amazing. The vanilla somewhat reminds me of those oatmeal little debbie oatmeal cream sandwiches, except in this case it's ice cream. The cookies have chocolate chips in them, too. 9/10.\n\n**Nick's Triple Chocolate sandwich** - Basically chocolate ice cream between double chocolate cookies, really good. 8.5/10. That being said, I prefer regular Nick's ice cream still, over the sandwich variants.\n\n#NICK'S PROTEIN BARS\n**Chocolate peanut butter** - Like a mix of a quest bar and a larabar in terms of texture. It had peanut bits on top, which I really liked. Not much of a peanut buttery flavor, but definitely a chocolate flavor, good texture, fairly low cal. It's a refrigerated protein bar. 8/10\n\n**Strawberry Cashew** - Good flavor, kinda tastes more like a granola bar with the fruity flavor, but has the same texture as the larabar/quest situation in the other refrigerated bar. Like 7/10.\n\n**Nick's Crispy Nougat** - Also reminded me of a cookies and cream flavor, albeit less so. Pretty good. 8/10\n\n**Nick's Peanut Chokolad** - Very amazing, reminded me almost exactly of a Snicker's in both taste and texture. Peak protein bar, right here, might be the best flavor of any protein bar I've had. 9.5/10\n\nI'd say they're okay for protein bars, definitely feel more decadent than most protein bars, although I think I still prefer Quest overall. If I were to rank brands, it'd be Built -> Think -> Nick's -> ONE bar -> Pure Protein -> Quest bar -> Barbell.\n\n#FIBER ONE\n\n**Fiber One Cinnamon Coffee Cake** - I was hyped to order this, since each bar is 70 cal and some good fiber as the name suggests. The pictures make the bars look bigger, these are actually quite small, no more than 2-2.5 square inches, or about 5 centimeters. They do taste really good, like a cross between coffee cake and a pop tart! Great when heated, too. However with some oat fiber/erythritol/PB2 you can basically make your own fibrous coffee cake in the oven, and for a more satisfying portion. With that in mind, 6/10\n\n**Fiber One chocolate chip cookie brownie** - Once again, kind of disappointing. It has a firmer texture than cinnamon coffee cake, plus being a little less sweet, both of which I like. But it could use a slightly salty flavor like a choc. chip cookie should be. The box also shows chocolate chips in the bar, but there's none, it's just a wavy chocolate icing. An *okay* flavor, but like the coffee cake it's very small. And it could use some chocolate chips. I'd just recommend a Quest chocolate chip cookie. 5/10.\n\n**Fiber One Fudge Brownie** - Pretty much the same thing as with the coffee cake and cookie brownie, small, but it tastes pretty good, indeed like a brownie. Probably my favorite, but it's easy to make my own brownies/mug cakes. 6.5/10\n\n**Protein One strawberries and cream** - They're pretty small, about half the size/protein of a regular protein bar, but also half the cals. Tastes pretty similar to the strawberry filling of a pop tart, especially when microwaved! Kind of a sticky/sweet texture and artificial flavor. While I did enjoy them, strawberry just doesn't speak to me, and I see no reason to buy these over the other protein bars here (except for being 90 cal, I suppose). 8/10\n\n**Protein One peanut butter chocolate** - Has a similar flavor to the strawberry one, actually. Not fruity though, but it also doesn't really taste anything like peanut butter. Has some chocolate flavor, but not much. 7/10\n\n#Jordan’s Syrups\n\n**White chocolate syrup** - Doesn’t have the “creamy” flavor of white chocolate like the pudding mix did, this is a liquid though, so it makes sense. A couple tablespoons is really nice in some baked goods, tea, hot chocolate, or coffee though! Or PB2, oatmeal, yogurt, smoothies, milkshakes, etc. anything that a liquid sweetener could be useful in. There’s a nice neutral sweetness to it that goes with a wide variety of things. Although it does have some noticeable artificial taste, so I like to combine it with erythritol, or sweetening whatever I’m making with some fruit. 7/10, very versatile.\n\n**Vanilla** - Doesn’t have a very strong vanilla flavor, but it’s there, and fairly sweet still. I’d say it’s most like a vanilla candy in terms of flavor, like the vanilla tootsie rolls. 7.5/10\n\n**Salted Caramel** - Definitely has a noticeable salt and caramel flavor! Tastes exactly as I would hope. The flavor can be a little overpowering, but used as a small splash, it’s really good and puts me in the fall vibes. 8/10\n\n**Mocha** - Doesn’t really taste much like coffee, or chocolate, but that’s pretty much what I expected. I’d use this to augment actual chocolate or coffee flavors, although if used as the main flavor in something, it may be a little underwhelming. Still pretty decent though, 6.5/10\n\n**Caramel** - Much like salted caramel but of course, the salty flavor is less present, so it’s a bit less overpowering and more of a plain caramel flavor. I think I’d use this more often, but I’d really say it’s just as good as the other :) 8/10\n\n**Butter Toffee** - Tastes basically just like toffee, the toffee covered peanuts I used to have. Really good! This is probably my favorite of all the syrups, and it’s so versatile. Doesn’t have much “artificial” flavor either, although it is still quite sweet. 9/10\n\n**Hazelnut** - The hazelnut flavor is very much present! I’m not really sure how to describe it, but it feels like a more potent version of the hazelnut flavor in some coffee creamers. My second favorite flavor, I think. Mixed with some cocoa powder and PB2, you could make a “Nutella” out of this. Really yummy! 8.5/10\n\n**Peanut Butter cup** - It does indeed taste quite a bit like a peanut butter cup, so it's really good in oatmeal, a mocha, or hot cocoa. Not much else to say about it, it's as good as I expected, if not maybe a little more so. But it's also not the most versatile flavor. 7/10.\n\n**Vanilla Bean keto** - First off, I wanna mention that despite the name of this syrup, all Jordan's syrups would be considered keto (all that I know of, at least). This kind has MCT (Medium Chain Triglyceride) oil added, so it's not zero cal, but still fairly low. Has a richer texture, a little bit more like a creamer! Good in lattes I think, but I probably won't buy it again, I was curious about what the MCT oil would do. Seems to be a bit thicker (still very much a liquid though) and it also doesn't taste as sweet. I suppose it could work better in baking, since it has oil. 6/10\n\n**Barista Chai** - Definitely has a chai flavor! I could almost make out all the spices. With some almond milk, it should definitely take coffee (or some tea )to the next level. 9/10\n\n**Chocolate Coconut Macaron** - Noticeable coconut flavor! That's kind of the main taste, the chocolate is off, so I'd add cocoa powder if you want more chocolate flavor to whatever you make. Coconut though, yum! 8.5/10\n\n**Peppermint Bark** - Tastes like mocha, with a slight peppermint aftertaste to it. Not very minty at all, even less so than actual peppermint bark, I would say. 7/10\n\n**Christmas Cookie** - Mostly just generic sweetness, it does taste somewhat like a sugar cookie though. 7.5/10\n\n**Salted Caramel Mocha** - The deep \"rich\" flavor of caramel goes really well with mocha, so for them to be combined is definitely a welcome flavor. Feels festive, and still like it could be a versatile flavor. 8/10\n\n#MIO\nSince these are sugar free ways to add flavor to something, I wanted to review all the flavors I've tried, so y'all can decide which ones you'd want to get and maybe have some ideas from this post. If you're unfamiliar with what these are, they're basically little bottles of a concentrated liquid that you squirt into water, yogurt, smoothies, or other things to add flavor to them, pretty simple. They’re also excellent for homemade Jell-O!\n\n**Lemonade** - Tastes sweet and lemon like, it's decent with some sparkling water or lemon juice, 7/10\n\n**Berry blast** - Tastes sort of like mountain dew voltage, minus the carbonation, it's pretty good, 7.5/10\n\n**Orange tangerine** - Pretty good, I've mixed it with Greek yogurt and frozen it for something that tasted shockingly like an actual creamsicle. Also great in sparkling water for an orange soda of sorts. So with that in mind, 9/10\n\n**Black cherry** - A somewhat bitter cherry flavor, this one has caffeine too. I like to add it to homemade jams for some tartness, 8/10\n\n**Cherry blackberry** - Slightly more of a sweet cherry flavor, tasted a lot like V8 energy cherry flavor, if you've had it before. 6.5/10\n\n**Orange vanilla** - It does taste like what it sounds like, but vanilla in drinks is kinda weird, although combined with something cherry flavor, it can be really good. Safe cherry coke, anyone? 8.5/10\n\n**Blueberry lemonade** - Kinda a combo of berry blast and lemonade, 7/10. Good but kinda weird too.\n\n**Strawberry watermelon** - Doesn't really taste like either, it's good with some lemon juice, or to make homemade Jell-O, but otherwise it's not that good, 6/10\n\n**Lemon lime** - Tastes like the yellow/green color lemon lime flavor of Gatorade, it's actually pretty good, if you'd like that you'd probably like this, 8/10\n\n**Tropical fusion** - Yeah, tastes kinda weirdly tropical, hard to describe. Sort of like mango I think? Not bad, but the flavor doesn't go particularly well with anything else (like yogurt) so I'd give it a 6.5/10\n\n**Watermelon lemonade** - It's a bit more sour than the lemonade one, pretty refreshing with some ice cold water. 8/10\n\n**Orchard apple** - Has a kinda \"spicy sweet\" apple flavor, sort of like apple cider or apple flavor things around the fall. With some sugar free salted caramel syrup, it might be interesting. I haven't seen it in a long time, so I haven't been able to try out that idea. 7.5/10\n\n**Arctic grape** - Tastes like grape flavor stuff, not too bad with some sparkling water. 6.5/10.\n\n**Sweet tea** - Has a kinda brown sugar/root beer sweetness to it, not very fruity like the rest of these. Honestly don't like it, but maybe you would. 5/10.\n\n**Fruit punch** - Tastes fruity but not of any specific fruit, maybe like Kool aid, 7.5/10\n\n**Cranberry raspberry** - Not as tart and tangy as actual cranberries or cranberry sauce, but it does taste really good, not overly artificial tasting, 8/10\n\n**Blackberry raspberry** - Doesn't taste very good, this one is sweetened with stevia instead, but as that's less potent, the bottle will last half as long. It's a bad deal, and doesn't taste as good either, 4/10. Wouldn't recommend it, unless you particularly want it because of stevia. There's also a stevia sweetened cherry flavor, though I forget what it's called.\n\n**Berry Grape** - A little less on the grape side and more on the berry side, pretty good, although the flavor is less recognizable as most of these. Arctic grape, I could tell was grape for example. 6.5/10\n\n**Peach Mango** - Pretty good, but the mango flavor isn't very strong, I wish it were more even between the two. Still, probably one of the better flavors, 8/10\n\n#RIP VAN WAFFLES\n\n**Leo Mint cookies** - These are supposed to be like mint Oreos, but I don't think they're as good. For one, they're a bit smaller than I remember mint Oreos being. Another thing, the filling is white and tastes more like toothpaste than it should. Also, one package is 200 cals. Which I REALLY don't like, since that means I'd just have half an open package laying around. It's like those protein cookies where a serving is half a pack. WHAT. Anyway, these have more fiber/protein and low sugar I guess so they're \"safer\" but these aren't ideal either. But they could be good in a milkshake or crumbled over oatmeal, I suppose. 4.5/10.\n\n**Leo cookies and cream** - The standard \"Oreo\" version that isn't mint. Same general things apply, but it doesn't really taste like toothpaste. And I'd say they're most comparable to a regular Oreo in terms of frosting amount, so not really \"double stuff\" or anything. 5.5/10.\n\n#SUGAR FREE PUDDING MIX\n**Vanilla** - Has more of an eggy french vanilla flavor, in my opinion. This is great actually, you can make low cal egg nog with it! Me and other people on this subreddit have already made recipes for this before. 8/10\n\n**Banana** - Regardless of brand, these usually just taste like vanilla with an artificial yet delicious banana flavor. Like banana laffy taffy, for example. It’s pretty good in strawberry and banana smoothies! Although you could use vanilla pudding mix and add banana extract. 7.5/10\n\n**Butterscotch** - Goes well with PB2 for peanut butter butterscotch overnight oats, one of the tastiest combos I’ve found. 7.5/10\n\n**Pistachio** - It’s alright, although it has actual pistachio and chunks of nuts in it. Unexpected for pudding, not my usual, but nice. 7/10\n\n**White Chocolate** - Really good, it has a creamy sweetness like white chocolate, great for oatmeal, smoothies, etc. and goes well with pumpkin and peaches I’ve noticed. Also one thing I love about it, sugar free white chocolate pudding mix is probably the best way to get that distinct white choccy flavor while still being low cal. Cocoa powder gives a low cal chocolate flavor, but white chocolate is a little more tricky to replicate, so it gets bonus points here. Good for peppermint bark oatmeal as well. Also nice for baking! 9.5/10\n\n**Lemon** - Probably one of my favorite flavors, but the lemon part is pretty subtle. I like adding a little lemon juice/zest to up that up a bit. It's also good for baking lemon cookies! 8.5/10\n\n#MISC PRODUCTS\n**Oat fiber** - Seems to give baked goods a snap, I have used it to make low cal oreos before, with a very similar crunch. It also has a flavor some consider “chalky”, although I like it. With that said, I still wouldn’t have oat fiber by itself. I also like using it in smoothies, oatmeal, and to thicken pudding, PB2, etc. 7/10, very useful although unlike pudding mix, isn’t my go-to for making a smoothie etc. super yummy\n\n**Xanthan gum** - helps emulsify stuff, for example it keeps a smoothie or milkshake from separation, you could blend yogurt and lemon juice together with this, and it would make separation less likely. So, it’s mostly just a good thickener for texture and stuff. It also helps imitate the stretch of gluten in dough that doesn’t have any, which is why I use it often in my oat flour recipes. Good deal no matter where you get it, since even just ½ a tsp really goes far. 9/10\n\n**Enlightened brand Mocha Choc Chip Ice cream bar** - I have only really tried this from their brand so it goes here. Good coffee flavor and the bars are pretty substantial, nice creamy texture too, 8/10, nick's is still my favorite safe ice cream brand so far though.\n\n**Powdered Pumpkin Seed** - This was basically like PB2 but had like 50% more protein and had a flavor similar to goldfish crackers I would say. Nice for savory things, 6/10\n\n**Fulfill Salted Caramel protein bar** - Kinda has a candy bar vibe, really good actually. Reminds me maybe of a \"Mr good bar\" or \"Krackel\" I think? Had a pretty excellent texture and taste, so much so I'd consider it a protein candy more than a bar, like the Quest ones. 9/10, worth trying for sure.\n\n**Handheld Milk Frother** - While this is more of an appliance, they’re really nice for making beverages, adding a layer of foam similar to what drinks from Starbucks may have. Helps mix drinks too, so if you got hot cocoa or a protein shake with some clumps, these can probably help. I also think a milk frother could do awesome things with egg whites or tomato soup, definitely lots of creative potential here. 9/10, some almond milk with flavor syrup infused with coffee will reach a higher level when frothed.\n\n**Millie’s Tomato Basil broth bag** - These are basically like savory tea bags, made exactly the same way as regular tea. They taste similar to ramen seasoning packets. Very good for making soup broth! Along with some nutritional yeast (which dissolves in water) it’s an easy way to make some delicious and cozy soup. 7/10\n\n**Birch Bender’s Protein Pancake Mix** - AMAZING. I got 16oz of this mix for under $6 on amazon, which I’d say is a really good deal. One serving is super filling, made about six pancakes using a 1/4th measuring cup for the batter onto the pan, for 130 cal. It doesn’t taste like much, but the texture is excellent, and you can substitute the water for sugar free syrups, chocolate almond milk, coffee creamer, or soup broth for adding flavor. So many possibilities! Speaking of the water, this mix only requires water! Which I like, since it’s easier. But I’ve also done add-ins, like oat fiber, erythritol, cocoa powder, extracts, and flavor syrups for Nutella protein pancakes! 9/10, I really recommend it. Affordable, which cannot be said for everything on this list.\n\n**Truvia Confectioners erythritol** - This is the erythritol equivalent of powdered sugar, the fine stuff you often use in frostings, topping French toast/pancakes, etc. and it tastes just like it. I suspect that every brand will basically be the same, that's been my experience with erythritol. The differences are mostly the form it takes (brown, white, confectioners, etc.) 8/10\n\n**Hershey's special dark cocoa powder** - The brand has regular cocoa powder, and a special dutched version. This dutched/alkalized cocoa is less bitter than most cocoa powder, the best way to describe it is like the flavor of a chocolate cake, or an Oreo (that's the type of cocoa powder they use). I love this cocoa powder, it's my go-to and I've used it for years. But I should mention, since the cocoa powder is much darker in color, most of the baked goods you make will appear charred. 9/10\n\n**Atkins Nutty Caramel treat bar** - Basically exactly like a candy bar, really good. It's fairly big and low cal, but worth noting it's not a protein bar, and it has 17g fiber, so might cause gut discomfort, and for that reason I probably won't buy more. Great when frozen, too! 8/10\n\n***EDIT - 4/13/2023***: Added like a dozen Jordan's syrups, more Nick's/Quest/MiO/Fiber One flavors, lotta stuff. Removed a little unnecessary details, cause this post is getting long 😅",

    "body": "I'm sure there have been hundreds of posts like this. But when I first started, it was hard to figure out exactly what I should buy, what are good brands, what I should avoid, which sweeteners are ok, good restaurants, etc. I've had this in my iPhone notes for awhile and figured it would be good to share. All this info can be found, but I like easy to consume info and easy to consume food, so this excludes a lot of recipe stuff. For those just starting out, I hope this makes it a little easier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Good Groceries** (Always check the carb content. I've made the mistake of assuming something was safe, buying it, and realizing at home that I shouldn't eat it.)\n\n* Fresh Whole Rotisserie chicken (I love these, Costco's is really good)\n* Steaks, chicken, fish, whatever protein you want. Just watch out for rubs or marinated stuff that could have sugar.\n* Eggs on eggs. One of my favorite things to make is a breakfast casserole that will take a dozen. Includes a pack of bacon, roll of sausage, ton of cheese, spinach, mushrooms, and a little onions/peppers. Add a little seasoning and it's pretty great.\n* Deli meats (Be careful of honey ham and other cured meats as they typically contain carbs)\n* Salami\n* Pepperoni\n* Cheese\n* Beef sticks, Jerky (Duke’s and Old Wisconsin are my favorites. Duke's is more expensive but so good.)\n* Sardines (Wild Planet)\n* Smoked Salmon (I just bought a 1lb bag at Costco and it was great but I can't remember the brand name, I’ll get it next time I’m there)\n* Low-carb pickles (Love Vlasic with Tobasco, watch out for bread and butter varieties)\n* Kimchi\n* Blackberries\n* Strawberries\n* Spinach, Celery, Avocado, Asparagus, Mushrooms are all on the low end for veggies. Most green leafy veggies are acceptable. Carrots and onions are both pretty high. The more obvious starches like potatoes and corn are definitely to be avoided.\n* Blue cheese and ranch dressings are both usually low carb. Balsamic, Italian, and Caesar is usually ok but check.\n* P3 Protein Packs (Turkey, almonds, colby jack is my favorite)\n* Baked cheese chips\n* Pork rinds (Just tried Mac’s Spicy Buffalo flavor and they are amazing)\n* Almonds, other nuts\n* Heavy cream (I put this in my morning coffee and in Stōk and I may never be able to go back)\n* Olive oil, Avocado oil for cooking\n* Morton's Lite Salt (For ketoade, detailed below)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Drinks**\n\n* Unsweetened Almond Milk (I like Silk Unsweetened Vanilla)\n* Stōk Unsweetened Coffee (With some heavy cream, it's my favorite new drink)\n* Starbucks Double Shot Espresso, Light Cream (5g carbs)\n* Mio Electrolytes (For **KETOADE** \\- I started feeling better once I started drinking this because I was probably dehydrated and my electrolytes were out of whack. It's just water, Morton's Lite Salt (has higher potassium vs. regular), a squirt of Mio Electrolytes, and I add Magnesium Citrate but that's optional. I HIGHLY recommend getting the liquid kind of magnesium citrate vs. the powder. I bought a huge bag of powder for cheap on Amazon and it doesn't dissolve and makes it kind of powdery and gross.)\n* Bai Bubbles (I just had these for the first time and I think they are my new favorite soda. Sweetened with Erythritol and absolutely delicious.)\n* Zevia (Cherry Cola and Dr. Zevia are my favorites. I haven’t tried many non-caffeinated flavors, but I was disappointed in Mountain Zevia. Nothing like Mountain Dew. Cream Soda was alright.)\n* Zevia Energy Drinks\n* Bang Energy Drinks (I want to try these. There are over 20 flavors and they have been tested as keto friendly, but 300mg of caffeine is ridiculous. They even have a Keto Coffee version as well.)\n* Other soda options: Coke Zero, Mountain Dew Kickstart Ultra, whatever other Diet soda floats your boat. I used to drink more of these but I’m trying to veer more towards the healthier options like Bai and Zevia.\n* [Guide on alcohol.](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/alcohol-guide) Liquor and wine aren’t bad if they don’t have added sugars. Beers tend to have carbs. When I’m out, I will typically order a vodka soda with lime or a whiskey and Coke Zero.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sweet Snacks**\n\n* Rebel Creamery (Haven't tried this yet but really want to. Apparently it's at Central Market. Halo Top and the other \"healthy\" ice creams are too high in carbs)\n* Quest Protein Bars (These will occasionally go on sale at Amazon and I will buy a few boxes when they do. Cookie Dough, Cookies and Cream, and Oatmeal Choc. Chip are my favorites. Buy from Amazon when on sale.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sweeteners**\n\nI just bought Splenda Zero for the first time which is liquid Stevia. It's pretty good and I will probably keep using it.\n\n[Here is a good visual guide for the effect sweeteners have on blood sugar.](https://i.dietdoctor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/LC-Sweeteners3-2.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=800&h=655&fit=crop)\n\nIn order of desirability:\n\n* Allulose (New so not much is known about long-term effects, but it’s supposed to be the most similar to regular sugar)\n* Stevia\n* Erythritol\n* Monk fruit\n* Sucralose\n* Aspartame\n\n\nDo not consume (these effect blood sugar):\n\n* Maltitol (Look for this in ingredient lists. Several items will be marketed as \"low carb\" but will contain this which is pretty crappy.)\n* Xylitol\n* Agave Syrup\n* The common no-cal sweeteners, Splenda, Equal, & Sweet'n Low,  do have a small effect on blood sugar levels. Not terrible but I would just use Stevia instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Amazon**\n\n* Quest Protein Bars (They will have sales and that's when I buy)\n* Moon Cheese (A little expensive but delicious)\n* Almond Flour, Lilly's Dark Chocolate Chips, and Swerve Sweetener for baking\n* Starbucks Double Shot Espresso, Light Cream (Will also go on sale and will be a good deal, but 5g carbs)\n* Liquid Magnesium Citrate for Ketoade\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Restaurants**\n\n* Pluckers (Only in Texas but the best wings. Baker's Gold and Mild are the favorites of what I've tried.)\n* Wing Stop (Mild, garlic Parmesan are my go to)\n* Buffalo Wild Wings (My least favorite of the 3)\n* In-N-Out: 3x3 or 4x4, which will be 3 or 4 pieces of cheese and meat patties. Get it protein style (lettuce-wrapped), no spread, add grilled onions if you can spare it.\n* Five Guys\n\nThere are obviously many many more places you can eat at, but these are all easy to eat keto without having to worry about substitutions and stuff like that. Basically for wing places, you are going to want to avoid any BBQ and Teriyaki type flavors. Check the nutrition info but the flavors listed above are all low carb, like 0.5g carbs per wing. Any place you can get a steak or some other protein and green vegetables is most likely fine, but check their info. You will get very familiar with googling \"X restaurant nutrition\". An easy go-to is usually Caesar salad with chicken. No croutons, though. I LOVE chopped salads too but again, check before you just go and order.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Trader Joe's** (I haven't had these yet, but these are what I'm wanting to try when I get a chance to go. I'll report back.)\n\n* Blue cheese dressing\n* Columbus hard salami\n* Green dragon hot sauce\n* Bacon end and pieces\n* 1000 day aged Gouda\n* Quattro Formaggio shredded cheese\n* Ciao pepperoni\n* Nova salmon\n* Kerry gold butter\n* Sunflower seed butter\n* Pre-cooked pork belly\n* Truffle Marcona almonds, pecans, other nuts\n* Pumpkin Seeds\n* Broccoli florets chips\n* Chomps snack sticks\n* Dried meats\n* Everything but the bagel sesame blend\n* Salami snack sticks\n* Coconut flour\n* Cauliflower rice and bread",

    "body": "I wanted to make one post with various tips that people need from time to time. I am sure I can add/remove various points, so please comment and I will edit accordingly, thanks!\n\n**For ALL KETO NEWBIES:**\n\n* DON'T BE AFRAID OF FATS. \n\nedit to add: If you have weight to lose, part (to all) of your fat macro WILL be covered from your body fat. Dietary fat is a TOOL to help you NOT FEEL HUNGRY throughout the day. If you cover ALL your caloric needs for fat from food, you will not lose body fat. Also dietary fat is NOT bad for your health, and if you are at maintenance mode you WILL need to get your energy from dietary fat. My point of -DON'T BE AFRAID OF FATS- is about the fact that fats are NOT bad for your health, and their caloric density does not mean anything by itself. That said, use fats wisely according to your weight loss/maintenance/energy requirement goals.\n\n Even at a calorie deficit, keto is a high fat diet (part or all of it body fat). If you are in maintenance weight and do only protein and low carbs without fat, you will not get the full benefits of keto. Plus, you need good fats as a BUILDING BLOCK to build:\n\nLiterally ALL cell membranes, neurotransmitters, nerve cells, muscles, hormones, cell signaling molecules, ketones, gallbladder enzymes, etc etc etc.\n\n* Pick good fats (butter, olive oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, lard, tallow, fish oil) and avoid seed oils (canola, soy, margerine, sunflower, safflower, etc)\n\n**Feeling foggy/shitty/tired/numb/tingly:**\n\n* Electrolytes. Get more salt, potassium and magnesium as seen on the FAQ.\n\n**BLOOD PRESSURE**\n\n* If you are afraid of salt and blood pressure, don't be. It's much more closely correlated with carbs. If you are taking medication, monitor your blood pressure and share any changes with your doctor, and ask them to adjust your medication accordingly.\n\n**Keto insomnia:**\n\n* Add two tablespoons of vinegar in half a glass of water. Sip through a straw until you get sleepy (you don't need to drink all of it). Vinegar lowers blood pressure and blood glucose, making you intensely sleepy for 5-15 minutes.\n\n**Slow weight loss or stall:**\n\n* Wait for two weeks. Weight loss isn't linear. When you lose fat, your fat cells take up water and lose it suddenly after a while. This will make your weight not change for a few days or a couple weeks, and then lose a few pounds suddenly.\n\n* TAKE YOUR MEASUREMENTS. you might be gaining muscle at the same time as losing fat, so the scale doesn't move while you are losing volume.\n\n* TRACK YOUR CALORIES AND CARBS WITH AN APP. If you are not currently tracking, your carbs and calories may be adding up.\n\n* Recalculate your macros with your CURRENT WEIGHT. You may need to adjust your calories if you've lost weight since the first time you calculated.\n\n* Cut dairy for at least a few days and see if the scale moves down. Dairy can be very insulinogenic for some people.\n\n* Cut ALL nuts for at least a few days.\n\n* Cut ALL berries for at least a few days.\n\n* Cut ALL ready made processed foods and artificial sweeteners for at least a few days. For some people, artificial sweeteners can cause insulin spikes.\n\n* Recheck your artificial sweeteners: ENTIRELY ELIMINATE maltodextrin, maltitol, sucralose. Prefer stevia, erythritol, xylitol. If you have pets, make sure your sweeteners are not toxic for them just in case. \n\n* If all else fails, go back to the very keto basics: fats, eggs, meat, green leafy salads, or even do a day or two of zero carb or bone broth.\n\n* If nothing out of these works for more than two weeks, maybe visit an endocrinologist that is knowledgeable on low carb/keto diets to see if your hormones are functioning as they should.\n\n**If your hormones are wonky:**\n\n* Eliminate entirely any and all sources of seed oils: Canola, corn, safflower, sunflower, soy, margerine etc. These oils are not keto friendly  eitherway, and they can mess with your hormones.\n\n* Try to avoid non fermented soy products and other phytoestrogen containing foods. Fermented soy is better since the phytoestrogens are broken down with fermentation. To be entirely fair, as far as I know the effect of phytoestrogens is not 100% established/proven, but I think it's something worth checking out if you are having issues. (link me studies if you have them)\n\n* If there is no change, visit an endocrinologist that's knowledgeable on low carb/keto.\n\n**If your cholesterol/triglyceride ratio is off:**\n\n* Eliminate all seed oils and processed/ready made/restaurant/fast foods. Almost ALL ready made foods are cooked in seed oils, easy to oxidate and become harmful. Also eliminate oxidative factors from your life as much as you can.\n\n* Check everything for hidden sugars or unsuitable sweeteners.\n\n* check processed foods for unsuitable oils.\n\n**If your HbA1c is high:**\n\n* Recheck all your sweeteners and throw away anything with a Glucemic Index higher than ZERO.\n\n* Make sure your carbs don't add up too high using a tracking app.\n\n**If your inflammatory markers are high up:**\n\n* Eliminate seed oils, as seen above.\n\n* Stop smoking.\n\n* Stop drinking alcohol.\n\n* Check them sweeteners.\n\n* There are other exposure factors like pollution/pesticides/herbicides that are really harmful but not nutrition related that can affect your heath.\n\n**If you have an autoimmune or chronic disease:**\n\n* Look up keto-paleo autoimmune/chronic protocols, up to 95% fats and 5% protein.\n\n**GENERAL TIPS:**\n\n* For some people's bodies, sweeteners should be a treat, and at low quantities. High everyday amounts can mess with your gut bacteria and are starting to get correlated with diabetes onset in some individuals. Some others can handle it better. It's not fair, but sometimes we have to stick to our own personal body manual after trial and error. Be mindful of symptoms after consuming sweetener treats, like: Getting snacky/hungry, getting feelings of sugar crashing, toilet trouble, sleepiness, fatigue, etc and adjust usage accordingly. Personal opinion: Home made sweetener treats are better than store bought and I personally prefer them as I have more control over the ingredients.\n\n* Exercise! Do HIIT and resistance training to help with your bone density! It's not necessary for weight loss AT ALL, but it's great for wellness!\n\n* Most of the time, if there is a lifestyle caused health problem, there is something you need to REMOVE from your lifestyle instead of something that's missing, unless it's a nutritional deficiency. (like, remove smoking, alcohol, stress, etc)\n\n* Drink enough water! Fat burning REQUIRES water!\n\n* Get enough sleep! Sleep is closely related to hormones regulating appetite and fat burning!\n\n* If you cheat on keto, think of it as a GPS: If you miss a turn, your GPS recalculates and gets back on track, it doesn't give up and throw you off a bridge for one mistake. One cheat meal doesn't ruin everything. You start again on keto, and keep going on.\n\n\n* If for any reason you go off keto, the important lessons to keep with you are: No seed oils, MINIMAL sugar preferably as a treat rarely and not every day, MINIMAL grains, just a few fruits and tubers. Enjoy and listen to your body!\n\nI am sure I am missing a few good points, and maybe need to update some info on the existing points. If you have any pointers that I'd need to add, please comment and I will edit!\n\nKCKO and be healthy :)\n\nedits: formatting \n\nEdit two: more stuff!\n\nMORE STUFF:\n\n**FASTING AND EATING FREQUENCY**\n\n* Don't eat if you're not hungry! \n\n* Don't chew gums while fasting! The sweeteners can make you feel snacky.\n\n* Try to incorporate Intermittent Fasting into your keto routine-don't eat 16 consecutive hours out of the day (including sleep). It's antiaging, antiinflammatory and rejuvenating. That means either skipping breakfast or dinner.\n\n* If you get hungry while fasting and don't want to end your fast, there's a two step solution: \n1. electrolytes! Get some salt and potassium with a glass of water!\n2. If that doesn't work, small amount of PURE fat! Fat is the one nutrient that raises insulin the LEAST, so a slice of butter or coconut oil will give you a boost, help with hunger, and not affect your fasting as much as any other type of food.\n\n* Acceptable drinks for a fast: Water, Carbonated water, Green or black tea (no milk or creamer), herbal teas with no artificial flavours (they're usually sweetened), BLACK coffee (no dairy or creamer). Avoid drinks with artificial sweeteners, they will probably make you hungrier than you were and mess with your fast.\n\n* MIND YOUR ELECTROLYTES in extended fasts! An overweight person can fast for even more than 50 consecutive days depending on their extra weight, but YOU NEED TO MIND YOUR ELECTROLYTES DAILY.\n\n* If you take medications, ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT FASTING. Some medications HAVE to be taken with food. \n\n* If you do an extended fast, (more than 48 hours) do not refeed with big quantities of food. The best option is to start refeeding with sips of bone broth or meat soup and then, slowly, other animal products. Listen to your body closely, and read up on how to best start refeeding!\n\n* DO NOT PUSH YOURSELF. If you feel nauseous, weak, or sick and electrolytes do not help you feel better, BREAK YOUR FAST. Lifestyle choices SHOULD NOT make you feel weak.\n\n* Keto and fasting are supposed to make your body feel WELL. If you are having any bad body feelings, LOOK UP YOUR SYMPTOMS. There is NO REASON for you to suffer on keto or fasting, and you can fix it!\n\n**CALORIES**\n\n* If you DON'T get enough calories, to the point of a sense of INTENSE HUNGER (unless you are fasting) there is a real chance that you are recalibrating your metabolism to run slower. Especially if you are eating **too little fat** . Set your calorie deficit for 20% on a macro calculator. Keto is NOT a starvation diet. If you make yourself intensely hungry, you are not doing it right.\n\n**SUBSTITUTE FOODS**\n\nIf you are new and feel like you miss carby foods, DEFINITELY try to find some keto replacements! They are definitely not necessary, but if it makes the transition easier for you, DO IT! There's substitute rice, pizzas, cookies, breads and all sorts of other stuff. It doesn't matter if you make them daily or once in a blue moon, as long as it's what you want, what you enjoy, and it's not kicking your carbs way up!\n\n**CHOOSING YOUR PROTEIN**\n\nEXTRA CREDIT: The best protein and fat source you can get is free range, grass fed, grass finished animal products (meat, eggs, butter) OR wild fish because of the ω3 to ω6 fatty acid ratios. Grain fed animal products and farmed fish do NOT have a good ω3 to ω6 ratios, and if you want to have the best balance, you'll need to supplement ω3. You want to keep that balance at 1:1 ideally. Seed oils are AWFULLY high in ω6 and that's one of the reasons it's important to avoid them.\n\nRealistically, a lot of people cannot afford grassfed and grass finished animal products.That's ok. Regular animal products are still good enough. If you want the best budget ω3 animal products you can go for eggs. If you want ω3 supplements, you want to look into brands that store their products in fridges and in dark tinted glass containers, and get their oils from wild fish and not farmed.\n\n",

        "body": "“Even at a calorie deficit, Keto is a high-fat diet.”\n\nI really wish people would stop saying this. It’s flat out not true. How much fat you “need” is 100% determined by how many calories you’re going to consume that day, period, end of story. It’s literally the only variable thing in your diet. So yes, you should not be afraid of fats, but it’s probably the thing you most need to be aware of, too. Why? Because the more fat you eat, the more your body will use that for fuel rather than your own fat. Once you’re fat adapted, you can get your body burning more of your own fat by sticking with protein and only eating enough fat to not feel hungry. (Your body will always burn fat you consume over stored fat.)\n\nIn my case, at a 1000 kcal deficit, at the beginning of the day (before my active calories are added), my macros are 94g protein, 20g carbs, and 34.6g of fat. Fat is nearly 1/3rd of my protein goal. I wouldn’t call that “high fat”. Now, literally every single active calorie added over the day can come from either fat or protein, it’s up to me. I prefer to have higher protein snacks / meals vs high fat, again, because I’m focused on burning my own fat. But if you don’t treat fat like a goal, you can burn more fat than your deficit suggests.\n\nOf course, everyone’s deficits can be different (mine is fairly aggressive), and their macros are different, too. I’m within 20lbs of my goal weight, so my starting BMR is under 1800 right now. But it doesn’t change the math ... your protein and carb macros are stable, and fat “allowance” is the only thing that changes. People forget, though, that it’s absolutely fine to go over your protein. Just because you have “fat calories” left, doesn’t mean that’s what you have to eat. And the fat you’re already eating give you plenty to handle all the metabolic processes you describe.\n\nMost of the rest of your advice is pretty good. The one thing I will caution people on with regard to sweeteners is that Xylitol should be avoided. Not because of any Keto issues, but because it’s a little too good at killing bacteria, including the helpful kind. (I’ve used it as part of a sinus rinse to deal with sinus infections.) It’s also highly toxic to pets for the same reason.\n\nOne thing I’ll add when it comes to handling a stall is to up your water intake. For whatever reason, I find that increasing my water intake when I feel a little “sloshy” seems to convince my body to let go of some of the water it’s holding onto.",

I'm also always looking for collaborators for future experiments. If you’re interested in collaborating on scientifically rigorous self-experiments with low-carb foods or anything else, let me know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis post is an update on my experiments measuring the effect of low-carb foods and dietary supplements on blood sugar.\n\nThis week, I have the results from low-carb ice creams. Next week I'll have low-carb breads.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Testing Queue:**\n\n* Low-carb foods:\n   * Meal replacements: in queue, ([Ketochow previously reported](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2020/10/effect-of-dietary-supplements-low-carb.html))\n   * Flour replacements: in queue\n   * Tortilla: [Reported](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2021/08/low-carb-tortillas-how-do-different.html)\n   * Bread: 9/4/21\n   * Snack bars: in queue\n   * **Ice cream:** **This post**\n   * Cereals: [Reported](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2021/08/testing-blood-glucose-impact-of-low.html)\n* Supplements:\n   * Vinegar: in queue\n   * MSG: [Reported](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2020/10/seeing-strange-effects-of-msg-on-blood.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Ice Cream\n\n**Summary:**\n\nI tested 6 low-carb ice creams from 4 brands (Enlightened, Halo Top, Keto, & Rebel).\n\nAll held up to their claims, with relatively low blood sugar impact and taste similar to regular ice cream.\n\nThe 6 ice creams  had relatively similar blood glucose impact by weight (3-4% of glucose for peak BG/g & 7-10% for iAuC/g) and volume (18-27 mg/dL/cup peak BG & 3,200-4,600 mg/dL/cup iAuC). Of the set, the Keto brand ice cream was \\~25% higher than the next worst. Not enough to stop me from eating it, but noticeably worse.\n\nOn taste, my favorites were the Rebel Chocolate and Cookies & Cream, but they were all pretty good except for the Keto Triple Chocolate Brownie. Keto brand used erythritol as the only sweetener in the brownie pieces and it crystallized, giving a gritty texture that I really didn't like. It also didn't have a strong enough chocolate flavor for my taste.\n\n*Does anyone know any other good low-carb ice creams or other low-carb foods I should try?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Details:**\n\n**Purpose**\n\n* To identify low-carb foods that taste good and have minimal effect on my blood glucose.\n* To determine the effect of popular, literature supported dietary supplements on my blood glucose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Background**Over the past few years, a number of brands of low-carb cereals have come out, with many available in supermarkets. Most of them replace milk with heavy cream and use erythritol or allulose as the primary sweeteners, [so I expect their blood glucose impact to be relatively small](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2020/09/measuring-effect-of-low-carb.html), but I wanted to test myself to confirm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Design/Methods***Foods*I tested 6 low-carb ice creams from 4 brands:\n\n* Enlightened\n* Halo Top\n* Keto\n* Rebel\n\nFull nutrient and ingredient info [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e0anum7myenu255/foodEffectSummaryData.xlsx?dl=0). Key nutrition facts in the table below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwjx99tlh3k71.png?width=3484&format=png&auto=webp&s=f56e24c96cab138049466d8dfdd9781f43ab9aaa\n\n*Procedure*\n\nAt 5:00a, I took 4.5u of Novolog (fast acting insulin, duration of 2-4h), then drank a Ketochow shake ([website](https://www.ketochow.xyz/), [BG testing](https://www.quantifieddiabetes.com/2020/10/effect-of-dietary-supplements-low-carb.html)) at 5:30a. After that, no food or calorie-containing drinks were consumed and no exercise was performed. Non-calorie-containing drinks were consumed as desired (water, caffeine-free tea, and decaffeinated coffee). At 11am-12 pm, the substance to be tested was eaten as rapidly as comfortable and notes on taste and texture were recorded (before observing any change in blood sugar).\n\nBlood sugar was monitored for 5h using a Dexcom G6. Calibration was performed 15-30 min. before the start of each experiment.\n\n*Data Processing & Visualization.* iAUC was calculated using the [trapezoid method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule) (see data spreadsheet for details). Data was visualized using [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/trial/tableau-software?utm_campaign_id=2017049&utm_campaign=Prospecting-CORE-ALL-ALL-ALL-ALL&utm_medium=Paid+Search&utm_source=Google+Search&utm_language=EN&utm_country=USCA&kw=tableau&adgroup=CTX-Brand-Priority-Core-E&adused=RESP&matchtype=e&placement=&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1-3yBRCmARIsAN7B4H0KdNFFM8h8JNRqf7LJf6u-DaCjMUCt3BBjGGgzToGk2l0l5wcNSsYaAu49EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).\n\n*Medication.* During these experiments, I took long-acting basal insulin each evening at 9pm (Lantus, 1.52u) and 2000 mg of metformin and multivitamin each morning at 5am. I did not dose for the experimental food ingested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Data**\n\n* [Formatted raw data, peak blood glucose, iAuC, and time to peak data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0su5qoxjrwcurj3/foodEffectData.xlsx?dl=0)\n* [Summary data, ingredient details, and taste assessments](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e0anum7myenu255/foodEffectSummaryData.xlsx?dl=0)\n\n**Results & Discussion**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4oiedroh3k71.png?width=2688&format=png&auto=webp&s=af433ab8d6cc5b4d9f87b8512c37c934ae100f6f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xm36g9zph3k71.png?width=3416&format=png&auto=webp&s=eccd991bba3046181375a9dba80148ada800224c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vsgid8xqh3k71.png?width=1684&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb4d38842ad7c001607edaad3a953f6af7861b67\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sz4q9cbsh3k71.png?width=3084&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2db65797fca35137caba6acae01332f7179928d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/510vi24uh3k71.png?width=3118&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8ebe0f230ea46aa4291ff4cdd53be1d9fb4ba72\n\nChanges in blood glucose as a function of time are shown in Figure 1. All ice creams show a longer time to initial rise and longer duration of impact than glucose, though Halo Top is much faster than the rest. This is likely due to the use of skim milk, which contains lactose.All brands had relatively similar blood glucose impact by weight, ranging from 3-4% of glucose for peak BG/g & 7-10% for iAuC/g. The different brands had significantly different amounts of overrun (air mixed into the ice cream), resulting in different densities. Since I typically eat a pint of ice cream in a sitting, I also looked at the blood glucose impact by volume. With the exception of the Keto brand, this resulted in even less variation, 18-20 mg/dL/cup for peak BG & 3,200-3,700 mg/dL/cup iAuC. The Keto brand ice cream was \\~25% higher than the next worst, at 27 mg/mg/dL/cup for peak BG & 4,600 mg/dL/cup iAuC. Not enough to stop me from eating it, but noticeably worse.On taste, my favorites were the Rebel Chocolate and Cookies & Cream, but they were all pretty good except for the Keto Triple Chocolate Brownie. Keto brand used erythritol as the only sweetener in the brownie pieces and it crystallized, giving a gritty texture that I really didn't like. It also didn't have a strong enough chocolate flavor for my taste.Note: taste and texture observations were recorded when I ate the food. I.e. before I knew its impact on my blood sugar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thoughts & Next Experiments** \n\nAlthough the results were good, this study was a lot less interesting than the previous ones. No surprises or significant differences between brands. Generally, it seems like there's not much variation in the methods to make ice cream low-carb. The one exception I know of, which I didn't test, is Breyer's Carb Smart ice cream. They use maltitol as the sugar substitute, [which has about half the impact of regular sugar](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/maltitol-keto) (hence why I didn't test it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Does anyone know any other good low-carb ice creams I should try?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs always, please let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- QD",

Halotop I havent been able to consistently find the keto versions.\n\nMy experience with these brands is that, overall, Halotop seems to soften the quickest and Rebel takes the longest. This isnt just a preference thing... keto ice cream you *really* need to let it soften. I will add that the Rebel triple chocolate, since it was on your tests and seems to have done well, was an exception. This one seems to soften quite fast compared to the other Rebel flavors.\n\nI say all this because when I'm at the store trying to sell myself on the idea of buying some, I think \"oh, I'll just buy it and not eat any right away\". Then when I get home from the store, my mind is singing a different tune: \"Hey, that trip from the store was just long enough that it's probably ripe for eating\" and it always is. And every freaking time it actually is stored and I try to wait for it to soften it seems like I judge it wrong and it makes it harder to resist having it when getting back from the store. Ice picking a dessert is frustrating, not enjoyable.\n\nSo... getting the kind that softens quicker leads to less binging in my opinion/experience.",

Oil, Safflower (Carthamus Tinctorius) Oil, Squalan, Saccharide Isomerate, Niacinamide, Butylated Hydroxytoluene, Disodium EDTA\n\nConsistency : lightly creamy+lightly runny. \n\nFragrance : Divine🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼\n\nMy thoughts : \nSo this mask claims to smoothen out your hair right? \nBut imo, it is not that effective.\n\nI don't have too much frizz, but it still doesn't manage my hair as much as I'd like.\nAfter applying the mask, hair stays in place for... I guess 2 days?\n\nIt only partly works in the middle part of the hair, and doesn't really soften the split ends. \nAfter 2 days, hair's back to dry and starts flying away vehemently, and i have to take the help of serums which I don't like since they weigh my hair down. \n\nThe only pro is that the smell remains till the next wash, and every time I open my hair, my room gets filled with floral fragrance.\nBut it's still not enough to pay for this tub.\n\nIt might be good for someone with not too much of a frizz problem and thick hair (people with already smooth hair you know🙃).\n\nI got it for 199 with a coupon a few months back, so for that price, it's okay.\nBut I wouldn't repurchase, and would like to try some other hair mask.",

I wanted a shampoo that would cleanse without making my hair dry . So that’s when BA ultra smoothening shampoo came into play & it’s been the only one I have been using since back then . The ultra smoothening hair mask is also my HG if u have ultra rough + fine hair . Probably not the best for thicker hair types . I have seen considerable improvement in my scalp health cz the shampoo would cleanse without stripping moisture . Also , if you sweat a lot or use lot of products & theres buildup on ur scalp , this won’t be enough. You might have to add a clarifying shampoo once in 2 weeks or a month . I have used their smoothening hair serum but unfortunately that didn’t work . Their hair growth serum seemed promising cz it did reduce my hair fall considerably. Their anti-dandruff range is bad , my brother used it & got more dandruff instead .",

I used a stevia/erythritol sweetener, which was fine for digestion, however on Sunday night I was CRAVING more sweets. I tried to satisfy myself with cheese and nuts, but it wasn't hitting the spot. I finally binged on some sugar free hard candy I had hidden in the cupboard for occasional treats.

My poor DH was trying to be as kind and supportive as possible, but also couldn't keep from laughing at me. Honestly, I was laughing a lot, too. Farts are funny.\n\nPlease, learn from my mistake.

Unless you want to be chained to the toilet for hours, and erupt in the loudest, most exuberant bursts of flatulence all night long, limit your sugar free candy intake.",

    "body": "Inspired by a previous thread about sugar substitutes and by my recent involvement in keto diets and inability to achieve ketosis despite being on what I thought was a \"low-carb\" diet, I decided to do some research. Many keto-advocates may already know some or all of this data, but it took me some time to discover it myself so I thought that I'd make it easier on others who are just starting out. Im sure the new year will bring about many resolution-ketoers. So here we go.\n\nFirst a couple of definitions:\n**Sweetness:** Sucrose (table sugar) has a sweetness of 100 and everything else is compared to it. So a compound having a sweetness of 50% is half as sweet as sucrose (gram for gram).\n**Glycemic index (GI):** The ability of a food product to induce an blood glucose spike and thus an insulin response. The higher the glycemic index, the higher and faster your insulin spikes after consuming it. Glucose has a glycemic index of 100 and everything else is relative to it. For keto diets, *the lower the GI, the better*. This is a very important aspect of keto diets, and you have to do your best to understand the concept. More info [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index).\n\nSecond, a disclaimer: *Your overall goal as a keto dieter should be to lose your desire for sweetness*. That sounds hard to do, but once you cut out as many sweet foods as possible, youll find that your taste buds are sensitive enough to enjoy subtle nuances of flavor without bombardment with sweetness. I hear this takes about 4-6 weeks. Once you achieve that, you will need none of the information below.\n\nNow, here we go ...\n\nI compiled a list of most of the compounds that are used for sweetness. To start, the most common sugars include sucrose (table sugar), fructose (fruit sugar), glucose, and high-fructose corn syrup are commonly found in many foods. All of these are digestable carbohydrates and thus are 4 cal/g. The glycemic indexes of each are as follows:\n\n* Glucose: 100\n* Sucrose (table sugar): 60\n* Fructose: 20\n* High fructose corn syrup (HFCS): 57\n\nYou may not be able to completely stay away from them because they are so pervasive (especially HFCS) but you have to try. A particularly bad feature they all have in common is that they are not satiating (do not make you feel full) and, in excess, are quickly converted to fat - which is the opposite of what you want in a keto diet.\n\nSugar alcohols are what most \"low-carb\" or \"sugar free\" foods include for sweetness. Most of them provide sweetness but have reduced calories because they are not digested. Generally speaking, the more undigestable, the more likely to cause gut upset such as flatulence and diarrhea.**Maltitol** is particularly common. It has about 75% the sweetness of sucralose. Not all is absorbed, so provides less energy content (usually about 2-3cal/g), and the non-absorbed part is likely to induce cramping and diarrhea in large quantities. The GI of maltilol is relatively high at 52, so although it is not a sugar (and foods containing it can claim to be \"sugar free\"), your body responds to it nearly the same as it would for high fructose corn syrup. Another commonly used sugar alcohol is **hydrogenated starch hydrolysate**, which is [safe](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8234920) but still has a high GI, at 39, about twice that of fructose. That's another \"sugar-free\" product that really isn't. There are quite a few other sugar alcohols including the following with their respective glycemic indices:\n\n* **Xylitol** (used in sugar free gums): 13\n* **Isomalt** (not often used because of gut upset): 9\n* **Sorbitol**(found in sugar-free gums and medicines): 9\n* **Lactilol** (found in medicines, \"sugar-free\" chocolate): 6\n\nAlthough all the above have quite a low GI, they can cause significant gut upset and thus are used by the industry in small consumables, like gum, breath mints, a medicines. They all provide 2-2.5 cal/g so are not calorie free, but since each breath mint, as an example, uses so little of them, the manufacturer rounds down and says the breath mints have 0 calories.\n\nAnother two sugar alcohols of note are **mannitol** and **erythritol**. Both of these have a GI of *zero*. They are absorbed in the gut so they will not induce flatulence or diarrhea. They produce low calories (mannitol=1.5cal/g, erythritol=0.2cal/g) and have been shown to [reduce body fat accumulation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19602832). They sound ideal and I've found no data to suggest that they cannot be a good part of a ketoers diet who has a sweet tooth. Mannitol is more expensive but apparently bakes really nicely and [amazon has it](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_tl?ie=UTF8&keywords=mannitol&tag=pediatricresi-20&index=aps&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325) for about $18 a pound. As for erythritol, it is a bit cheaper and can also be used in [baking](http://www.ehow.com/how_6175971_bake-erythritol.html) as a simple substitute. [Amazon has it](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_tl?ie=UTF8&keywords=erythritol&tag=pediatricresi-20&index=aps&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325) for about $8 a pound.\n\nFinally come the sugar substitutes. These include **saccharin**, **aspartame**, and **sucralose**. These compounds are found in Sweet 'n' Low, Equal, and Splenda respectively. All of these are carb-free, calorie-free, and have a glycemix index of zero. HOWEVER ... and this information was really hard to find because a quick google search usually reveals information from each respective manufacturer ... since these compounds have a very high sweetness index (saccharin is 400x, aspartame is 180x, and sucralose is 600x sweeter than sucrose) additives are added to the powdered form so that one tea-spoon of splenda has the same sweetness as one teaspoon of sucrose. The additives? It's difficult to find objective data on this but *the additives are very likely carb based*. So although a packet of Spelnda may say it is zero-calorie, that's just because they can round down and the glycemic index is very likely higher than 0, probably as high as 50. Pure liquid sucralose exists, and is [sold on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_tl?ie=UTF8&keywords=liquid%20sucralose&tag=pediatricresi-20&index=aps&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325) for about $13 for 2oz. It is safe and will satisfy your sweet tooth but be careful because of the sweetness, youre likely only going to use 1-2 drops per recipe.\n\nSo there you have it - some of my research on sugar substitutes. What bothered me most while doing this research is how sneaky manufacturers are. It is actually very difficult to find \"diet\" foods that really are healthy and that will actually help you lose weight. As someone in another thread said, even Atkins diet bars will not help you stay in ketosis.\n\nFinal disclosure - the links I provided to Amazon have a referral code in them. If that bothers you, please go straight to Amazon without using the link.\n\nedit:formatting",

I just want to throw it out there, for whoever needs to hear it, that for most intents and purposes, *yes* you can trust nutrition labels. \n\n* Are they infallible? Of course not. Typos and errors happen sometimes too.\n* Do *some* food companies abuse loopholes in rounding regulations to make the food appear to be \"zero\" in something? Sure (but usually this is based on convenience for the general population and not malice).\n* Are there specific ingredients popular in food products these days, that aren't necessarily adequately represented by nutrition facts as listed? Yeah, unfortunately.\n\nHowever, all of the above are *not* reasons to toss the baby out with the bathwater. \n\nTake things case by case. In almost every instance of a food being questionable, you'll be better served by evaluating the results and impacts for you individually and that's hard to predict from the label alone. Maybe that keto bread makes you feel bloated. Maybe the sugar-free chocolate upsets your digestion. Sometimes we can look back at the ingredients list and identify a specific culprit, like maltitol. But that's still a relatively narrow subset of \"all nutrition labels.\" \n\nI'm not saying \"imbibe the information on the package uncritically and dismiss all your experience to the contrary.\" I personally think it is good to exercise caution and be wary if something seems too good to be true when it comes to nutrition. \n\nAlso, it is typically beneficial to not rely heavily on specialty low-carb products over against meat and vegetables. I'm not saying \"never have them\" as a rule. I am grateful to live in a time when such things are available because it's nice to have options and treats. But the price you pay for that luxury is trusting the labels and vigilance toward specific ingredients. This is a self-imposed problem in most ketogenic diets, and if it causes you undue stress, cut it off at the source rather than letting it psych you out.\n\nBut my main point is simply this: I've been eating this way for years and I *promise* that your mental energy is better spent on attending to your overall mindset, habits, and discipline than on stressing over Big Food lying about nutrition facts.",

Switching from low carb to moderate carb and back regularly is bad for you, so these people unbeknowning are harming their health.  This is the primary anti-keto argument rational doctors give, because you really do want to be strict with your diet to be healthy.\n\nI don't worry about the nutrition label, but I do worry about a large percentage of the keto community not reading the nutrition label correctly, in that they don't adjust for the serving size they plan on using.",

This is an extraordinary group and I am very grateful to be among you.  This journey is so much better with you in it 😊\n\nMy favorite NSV since starting this lifestyle had been the seemingly total elimination of inflammation (such a surprise), but my latest NSV has trumped that in my eyes.  \n\nI live in the Buffalo/Niagara Falls area and have shoveled snow most of my life, accompanied by the usual exhaustion, etc.  This year has been totally different as I can shovel snow repeatedly and with vigor I have never displayed before, with no exhaustion or aches and pains, just a great sense of accomplishment (shoveling my property takes about 45 mins.).\n\nI am guessing this is a result of fat adaptation but correct me if I am wrong.  What a blessing it is to have sustained energy during physically challenging tasks at age 60 and not be wiped out.\n\nWould love to know if any of the snow-laden among us have experienced similar results when shoveling snow because of keto.\n\nGood luck to all and have had some success so want to share my insights…. maltitol is the devil in chocolate clothing, 90% of any issue you are having can be resolved with electrolytes IMO, and feed the gnaw with water and a dill pickle or some olives and wait a bit before diving into a meal - you might find out it is all you truly need at the moment.\n\nKeep on ketoin’ on and all the best to you!\n",

The next day I did 100 laps and really felt like I could keep going almost indefinitely. That same day I took my dog for a 3 mile walk. It has to be my body using stored fat for fuel, right? \n\nI had not even thought about how easy snow shoveling has been this year, but now that you mentioned it it is kinda fun...

While challenging, it was manageable and became easier as the weeks went on. After our 3rd week we calculated our macros, buttoned down our caloric intake and focused on protein as well. Fast forward to our 5th month on Keto, besides focusing on our macros, we now focus on other aspects of weightloss like what spikes our insulin higher than other substances and avoid them. (Maltitol, Maltodextrin etc.) For example, I recently took the time to read the ingredients on my sunflower seeds which I use in salads and found maltodextrin! Watch out for those seemingly innocuous \"keto\" foods! Another aspect we focused on was Intermittent fasting. Starting slowly with a 15 hour fast, then moving up gradually to a 20 hour fast.\n\n \nIt is a wonderful journey, where there is constant learning and understanding how the body works and it is incredible! \n\n\n\nThat being said, I am now 20lbs away from my High School weight 20 years ago, my wife is nearly in Onederland and I have helped friends and family lose dozens of pounds! This WOE gives a new lease on life, a bounty of energy and I can't say enough about it. I constantly break the #1 rule of keto because I am so passionate about it!\n\nIf you are even remotely considering Keto, do your research, read the sidebar and don't be afraid to ask questions because most people here are appreciative of what keto has done in their life and are equally as passionate about helping out as I am.

It's satisfying to see an outsider take down women presenting themselves as rich and powerful when we're not. That's why viewers aligned themselves so heavily with Bethenny early on - and it's something she totally failed to understand as she accrued power, through the show and outside of it.\n\n**Her caustic humor and constant** negging **already began to wear out their welcome in her return to Real Housewives.** By that point, she had become the breakout star of the show, and clearly had more social and production power than any of the other contestants. Suddenly, the same biting asides about her coworkers started to look like bullying - or plain old bitterness.\n\n**\"Big Shot\" is the logical extension of this behavior, and of Bethenny's blithe indifference to it.** Where she once charmingly self-deprecated and poked friendly fun at others in equal measure, she's now resorted to aggressively declaring her own importance. Where she once acknowledged the luck she'd found in surrounding herself with people who could help her launch a product line, she now insists her (actually quite modest) business success is the result of pure capitalist bootstrapping. **Every episode is stuffed with talking-head shots of Bethenny complaining about the crop of contestants she's got**, their overall lack of professionalism and experience — and she somehow fails to realize the quality of her applicant pool speaks to *her* level of success, and to how attractive a company she's built to legitimate executives.\n\n**The most disturbing part is watching her dress down unknown 20-somethings and stir up drama** over slights such as \"I was kept waiting for 15 minutes at a photo shoot and my time is valuable.\" It's one thing to watch her dismiss and condescend to fellow rich white ladies on Housewives; but seeing her take the same tack with literal *job applicants* feels... icky.\n\n**She constantly reminds contestants that they're in a job interview** — a two-month-long, publicly broadcasted, game show job interview — **and should behave professionally**, all while wearing sequined jumpsuits and loudly announcing to contestants just how chaotic and consuming the job will be. She never once attempts to sell herself, the company, or the job, to contestants - if it was a job interview, any reasonable candidate would be running the other direction. (Which it sounds like is exactly what the ultimate \"winner\" of the VP of Operations job, >!Milokssy!<, [promptly did after the show finished filming](https://tasteofreality.com/big-shot-bethenny-milokssy-fired-salary/)?)\n\nEven if she'd run a normal job interview process, it wouldn't surprise me if Bethenny struggled to fill an executive position with anyone who has decent business sense and isn't just in it to be on TV. **I'd never actually looked into her company before - but after doing a deep dive, it's a total joke. Some highlights:**\n\n* Separate webpages for almost every product line (yet products cannot be purchased on any webpages). There's [https://skinnygirlsnacking.com/](https://skinnygirlsnacking.com/), [https://www.skinnygirlcherry.com/](https://www.skinnygirlcherry.com/), [skinnygirlpopcorn.com](https://skinnygirlpopcorn.com/), [skinnygirlcocktails.com](https://skinnygirlcocktails.com/), [https://skinnygirlproducts.com/](https://skinnygirlproducts.com/) (just dressings and preserves... plus, inexplicably, a separate link to the \"snacking\" site), and then [https://bethenny.com/](https://bethenny.com/), which attempts, halfheartedly, to create some semblance of a hub for all her licensing ventures, from cauliflower crust to eyewear.\n* Many of her \"businesses\" are just licensing deals to put the Skinnygirl name on existing products - like [Orville Redenbacher popcorn](https://www.amazon.com/Orville-Redenbachers-Skinnygirl-Microwave-Popcorn/dp/B00KB21TF2?dchild=1&keywords=skinnygirl+popcorn&qid=1615839223&sr=8-3&linkCode=sl1&tag=betterbitesll-20&linkId=fd7835b0ed155eee06100e8a6c38a25b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl). Speaking of which, the first result if you google Skinnygirl popcorn is [skinnygirlpopcorn.com](https://skinnygirlpopcorn.com/), which has weirdly been taken over by Bush's Baked Beans \"Chili Pride\" promo with no mention of Skinnygirl.\n* Her food and drinks products page [here](https://bethenny.com/food-and-drink/) links to:\n   * [An Amazon store page for her coffees](https://bethenny.com/food-and-drink/) (all but one of which are unavailable, probably discontinued)\n   * A defunct Amazon listing for [salad dressings](https://www.amazon.com/Skinnygirl-Sugar-Salad-Dressing-Bundle/dp/B017QLI7MS?hvadid=312350984569&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=18121686993255836341&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9005966&hvtargid=pla-568556738062&psc=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=betterbitesll-20&linkId=01c85df1926c929865513c6f44e01489&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)\n   * An Amazon listing for Skinnygirl-branded [Orville Redenbacher popcorn](https://www.amazon.com/Orville-Redenbachers-Skinnygirl-Microwave-Popcorn/dp/B00KB21TF2?dchild=1&keywords=skinnygirl%2Bpopcorn&qid=1615839223&sr=8-3&linkCode=sl1&tag=betterbitesll-20&linkId=fd7835b0ed155eee06100e8a6c38a25b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&th=1) (which, as an aside, contains exactly the same number of calories as Act II Butter Lovers)\n   * An Amazon listing for [cocktail-themed preserves](https://www.amazon.com/Skinnygirl-Sugar-Preserves-Merlot-Grape/dp/B08BBF6P93?&linkCode=sl1&tag=betterbitesll-20&linkId=3887abaae7c5d9b13a5bcc554ef0291d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) (finally, we got a winner!)\n   * A defunct *entire website* for \"[Skinnygirl Syrup](https://skinnygirlsyrup.com/)\"\n   * A [separate section on her own website](https://bethenny.com/forever-young/) for her new Forever Young wine label?\n   * [An error page on HSN](https://www.hsn.com/products/skinnygirl-5-pack-8-cauliflower-gluten-free-flatbread-p/10085317?query=skinnygirl%20pizza&isSuggested=false) for her cauliflower pizza crust\n   * A flashy, contentless website for [Skinny Girl Cherry Juice](https://skinnygirlcherry.com/), offering:\n      * The option to \"subscribe & save for 15% off,\" with no link to do so\n      * Several \"example product\" listings on the home page left over from the web template\n      * A big \"Shop Now\" link on the homepage that leads to... a [product page](https://www.skinnygirlcherry.com/collections/frontpage) that contains only the text \"Sorry, there are no products in this collection,\" because this cherry juice doesn't actually exist.\n* [Skinnygirlsnacking.com](https://skinnygirlsnacking.com/) is my favorite of her websites. Please be sure to take the quiz at the bottom of the page, which uses information about your lifestyle to help you choose between the *three products* offered on the site — and will proudly direct you to their wheat-based wafer bites if you indicate you're gluten free. (It's ok though, because they don't list ingredients on their site so you have no way of knowing unless, unlike Bethenny, you're web-savvy enough to Google the ingredients list in a new window!)\n   * Sidenote: [Skinnygirl Sandwich Creme cookies](https://skinnygirlsnacking.com/product/sandwich-creme-cookies/), which replace about 1/3rd of the sugar in Oreos with Maltitol and monkfruit (gross), still somehow manage to have *exactly* the same number of calories as Oreos.\n\n**For someone so single-mindedly fixated on her \"brand,\" it's almost impressive how chaotic and unprofessional it all looks.** She even alternatingly refers to the line as \"Skinnygirl\" and \"Skinny Girl.\" I'm always amazed by the general incompetence of rich people on reality shows — I'm no businessperson, but I honestly think I could fix up Bethenny's site in a matter of days if I had to. Which it appears is what she actually needs, given that on Big Shot she claimed to be hiring a VP of Operations but presented *strictly* challenges related to marketing and social media.\n\nIt's actually a bit baffling to me that anyone could be so busy, so \"hardworking,\" so detail-oriented, and so insistent on running a tight ship, and still manage to build a \"brand\" this chaotic. How does this happen?",

    "body": "🦋 **Skin type:** Oily, slightly dehydrated\n\nSensitive (inflammation and acne-prone, malassezia/fungal acne, slow healing), ever present PIH+PIE. Similar issues on my back, mostly closed comedones (clogged pores) and scarring from them.\n\n🦋 **Climate:** Mumbai monsoon. Ranges from slightly cool to slightly warm, humid.\n\n🦋 **Current routine:**\n\nI avoid using shower gel or anything on my back, just plain water. No moisturizer, either (I just do my arms and legs). And use just this glycolic toner on my back on alternate days.\n\n🦋 **Age:** Early 30s\n\n🦋 **Usage timeline:** From Dec 2022 to Oct 2023, used twice a week at first, then alternate days. Finished the 200ml bottle.\n\n#✨️Ingredient list: \n\nAqua/​Water, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Lysine, Histidine, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Tocopherol, Threonine, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Proline, Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Methionine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Cysteine, Aloe Vera Extract, Oat Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, D-Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Hexylene Glycol, Sodium Lactate, Propanediol, Xylitol, Erythritol, Maltitol, Trehalose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride\n\nNotably contains \"17 amino acids\", and a couple soothing ingredients. pH is a low, low 3.6. \n\nI have the old packaging, which unfortunately listed the ingredients out of order, but hopefully the new one corrected that issue.\n\n🦋 **Price:** MRP ₹549 for 200ml, currently available for ₹429 on Amazon. Also available in 100ml pack.\n\n#✨️Texture, consistency and fragrance\n\nHas no added fragrance, but smells distinctly acidic, like apple cider vinegar. Smell doesn't linger, and dissipates fast (can't speak for use on the face), but it may be a turn-off for some people. Not a spa experience, almost medicinal 😂\n\nIt's a watery consistency. A yellow-brown tinted liquid.\n\n🦋 Packaging - a twisting nozzle-top bottle. Very convenient. Easy to use, you can change the rate of dispensing with how much you twist it open (perfect for the watery texture) - all the pros of the Ordinary product (AFAIK) at a lower cost. \n\n#✨️Effects\n\nSinks in fairly quickly on towel-dried skin, and doesn't stain or affect clothing in any way. It's pretty strong, so any scratches or broken skin sting for a bit when applied - getting a little on my underarms post shaving is an immediate emergency rinse 🥵\n\nOver the course of a couple months, it largely resolved my comedonal back acne, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and overall texture on my back. My skin heals pretty slow, so people may see faster results. I still have some comedones, texture etc. on my back, but I'm satisfied with it as is. I think that's realistic results for acne-prone skin. \n\nIt hasn't done much for scar tissue bumps from the ocassional cyst, maybe just softened their appearance slightly.\n\n#✨️My experience and final thoughts\n\nHaving used a spray product for bacne before, I much prefer this packaging. I have mild hand dexterity issues, a spray nozzle gets hard to press repeatedly. As convenient as it sounds in theory, it was also hard to position it so the spray would get on the right areas. This product is easy to just dribble over your shoulders and down your back, then spread with your hands. \n\nThe results were what I expected, so I'm satisfied.\n\n🦋 **Repurchase status:**\n\nWRP - just placed an order for a new one 😂 5/5 for body acne. I'm very basic when it comes to body care, and this is a seamless part of my routine now.\n\nI can't speak to use on the face, of course. It's quite a strong product, and I currently prefer using the Minimalist 10% AHA serum on my face, because it's gentler and has a nicer texture and overall experience. \n\nHope this was interesting and/or helpful ☺️ Byee!",

Tried it on face once or twice then nope, went back to body. \n\nWas eyeing this for body piggmentation, and it looks like I'll be trying it after my current product finishes!\n\nEdit - rephrased few words to better convey original intent",

Over the years, I've tried so many sugar free chocolate things to replace my former habits. (Yes, that's probably not the best idea.) But occasionally, I still need something sweet. These offerings tend to be expensive, particularly if they avoid things like Maltitol and other ingredients that for me personally have side effects or worse - trigger a sugar-like reaction when I eat them. If they work for you, great.\n\nOver time, I've figured out that Cocoa Powder + Coconut Oil + Sweetener can take you to many places, and they are relatively cheap (and I've heard the first two can be acquired at a dollar store, but I've not experienced that yet) when compared to the readymade confections.\n\nThis wasn't intended to be a recipe post, but I'd be happy to share specifics if anyone would like. Cocoa Powder, Coconut Oil, and Sucralose Drops (or the sweetener of your choice) can be used for all these goodies:\n\n- Chocolate drops/fat bombs (combine and freeze, eat cold)\n- Chocolate covered things (combine with nuts of choice and freeze in ice cube trays or in little piles on parchment paper, eat cold)\n- Chocolate dip (for berries)\n- Chocolate pudding (combine with peanut butter (or PB powder) and heavy cream)\n- Hardened coating for keto ice cream or anything frozen (pour on something frozen, it hardens much like magic shell)\n- Hot fudge (combine with heavy cream, heat a bit)\n- Brownies (combine with your choice of flours, eggs, baking powder)\n- Mug cakes (same as above, but not so much flour)\n\nI'm sure there are other uses, but you get the idea. And BTW, almost all of the above is made better by adding whipped cream if that's your thing. \n\nChocolate goodness that won't break the bank or spike your blood sugar and it's easy to track because you know exactly what's in it. Give it a try!\n",

So I was hoping to get support from the doctor while starting/continuing Keto and staying on medication. I've had concerns about things like Eg. My Ketomojo monitor giving \"concern\" messages about my high blood sugar. And I've been having such a hard time getting into and staying in ketosis. Or I'll be in ketosis but still have highish blood sugar. \n\nLast time I did keto was 4 years ago and I lost 20 pounds in my first month then I unknowingly fell for some garbage keto products that had Maltitol in them. I've been much more careful this time. \n\nSo long story short I was surprised that she didn't seem to know much and/or didn't feel comfortable with it.  Are most doctors like this in the US? Do you all find yourself defending keto? or having to explain it? \n\nThis is the second doctor to offer very basic information and no real concrete lifestyle options. The first one only wanted to push drugs on me. And the second told me to exercise more and eat plant based, thats it. She nodded her head when I told her that I came across info about keto possibly being bad for diabetics. But she offered no explanation. And I realize now she may be one of those people who doesn't care for keto period. I'm really disappointed.",

Swerve is great (esp the brown sugar one!) when you don't need to use a ton of it, tho it does have that slight cooling effect.

And my thoughts.\n\nHalo Top (240 per pint, Varies). - Decent tasting, and common and cheaper, but since price doesn't matter for me, I avoid these. Like the others more.\n\nNicks (220-300 calories per pint) - They have the BEST pints. Taste amazing, 240 calories a pint, or 220 for a few of them. Chocolate caramel is my favorite \n\nEnlightened (70-100 cal per bar) - bars are better than halo tops, and lower carb. Love the bars, but prefer nicks pints than theirs.\n\nArctic Zero (160 cal per pint). - My favorite pint to eat in one sitting. Everyone shits on them, but they've reformulated, and they taste SO good. Plus I can eat an entire point for 160 calories. \n\nBreyer Carb Smart (60 cal per bar) - bars and pints are OK, but they use maltitol now, which is digested like sugar. So I've stopped buying them. Plus, I like these the least.\n\nPS: smartcakes are great too! Super expensive, but 76 calories for 2 cakes, taste like cupcakes.\n\nEdit: I remember seeing an ice cream/frozen desserts that was like 15-20 cal per 1/2 cup, but I forgot the same. Anyone remember what it was?",

One from Atkins 4/$7.88 and another from MuscleTech 4/$6.88. Price wise, just slightly less than a Quest bar when buying a case for $25, however taste leaves much to be desired. Both were found at Wal-Mart.\n\nMuscleTech bar - first impressions were WOW, look at all that chocolate. After taking a bite however, I was quite disappointed. The chocolate is very bitter, I am talking 95% cacao bitter. The bar itself tastes bland, is very chewy and does not have the cookie dough taste we all love from quest. In short, I would pay $1 a bar for these, but would not pay the same premium they are charging that Quest can get away with.\n\nThe Atkins bar has a similar consistency to Quest. The large chunks of raw almonds frankly were a turn off. We buy these bars for their chewy, dough like consistency, and having those crunchy almond pieces in it were not very welcomed. Like the MuscleTech bar, they were not nearly as sweet as quest bars, and had a bland caramel flavor. Overall, slightly better than MuscleTech, but no where close to matching or beating Quest.\n\nFull Album here including a peak inside the bar\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/kpkkG",

Sure, it's only by two tenths of a point, but I'll take it. \n\nEvery time I went to the doctor, he brought up my weight. It really irritated me. I just wanted to be like, \"I have the flu. Can we just worry about that right now?\" During my last visit, the nurse said that my doctor has a lot more patients lose weight than the other doctors do. So *maybe* it helped.\n\n**Clarification: My doctor was right to bring up my weight, as all doctors should, but I don't agree with the way he went about doing it.**\n\nAnyways, I have lost 36 pounds in the past 9 months. Pretty slow compared to many here, but I'm a short woman.\n\nI haven't really tried to lose weight before. But I was starting to feel that the extra weight was effecting my health: varicose veins, body aches, bursitis, neck issues. I needed a change.\n\nThings I have learned along the way:\n\n1. Maltitol is not my friend. Neither is inulin. Erithrytol and stevia are my friends though.\n\n2. Electrolytes are important. Read those numbers carefully. I thought I was getting enough in the beginning, but I was way off.\n\n3. Having low carb snacks with you (in your car, at the ready) is important to keep you from making poor decisions. I use Quest bars because they're easy, but some find them addictive.\n\n4. I'm interested in a lifestyle change, so I chose a carb range that I feel I can handle for the rest of my life. It's higher than most people here, but it works for me. But I did start out with the recommendations here. \n\n5. I stopped driving past places where I used to go to eat (ice cream in particular). After a while, I could drive those same routes and not think about going to eat in those places.\n\n6. It's hard to imagine in the beginning that you can drastically change your eating habits and still enjoy eating, but it can be done.  And it affects other aspects of your life positively. If you start today, in nine months, you'll be so glad that you started when you did!",

    "body": " *TL; DR aka “Bullet point form of what I’ve learned” at the bottom and NSFW because I swear. And mention periods and defecation.*\n\nI’ve always been slim.\n\nAs a teenager I would scarf down a chocolate bar for lunch, chase it down with a soda and then joke that I was “maintaining my feminine figure”.. Yeah, I was an annoying little twerp. Most teenagers are. I’m told it’s glandular.\n\nThen I became an adult, and sure, my hips grew a little and my C cup turned into DD's, but my waist was still there and an hourglass figure like that is nothing to scoff at. I still ate what I wanted and since I was happily (and proudly) working myself half to death at the time, I hardly had the presence of mind to do anything else. I reached a weight of 90 kg (to my 175 cm) and promptly upped my amount of exercise to 10 hours a week, cut away fast food and voilà: Down to my perfect 78 kg again. Because who needs sleep or calories when you can be slim?\n\nNow, I am aware that the outdated and highly fallible voice of BMI would tell me that I am still overweight at 78 kg, but my collar bones were sharply marked and I had NO rolls of fat ANYWHERE, so I maintain that it was a good weight for me. I may have been thin-fat, but that is beside the point of what I am getting to.\n\nThen the stress got to me. I won’t get into the circumstances – as that would make this long ass tale drag on even longer! – I’ll just remind everyone that you are not your jobs! And status is worth nothing if you don’t have your health.\n\nAnd at 32 years I got sick. Like, ***REALLY*** sick. I’ve battled bouts of stress induced depression since I was 14 years old, but had never really had it looked into. It had always been ignored as teenager weltschmertz, laziness or something just as easily dismissed. But it was real and had never been treated, and now it was back with a vengeance. Turns out that if you ignore mental health that way, it gets worse. Huh. Who knew??\n\nI was put on Citalopram, sent to a therapist and told to be patient; because mental health is like broken bones. If you put strain on the injured limb before it is healed, you will make it worse and possibly cripple yourself for life.\n\nAnd who better to judge when I was healthy again than me?\n\nIn a completely unforeseen turn of events, it was not me.\n\nWhen you have lived with on/off depression since before you became an adult, you don’t know what *“normal”* and *“healthy”* feels like. I got back to the point I were at before my breakdown and decided I was good. So I found a job. In the same business and as the same thing I did before. And I got sick. Again. (Sounds kind of obvious when I put it like this).\n\nAnd this is when my body kind of started pouting. I had convinced it I was incapable of making the right decisions (true) and we were going to starve to death (huh??) so it piled on the weight. AND IT JUST KEPT PILING ON THAT WEIGHT!\n\nMy knee went, couldn’t keep up. I was sick with flu and colds every few months. I was always tired, to the point where I frequently slept 14-18 hours at a time. My cholesterol was inching towards alarming numbers. I was ashamed of my body when I could no longer shop clothes in regular stores, but had to go to “Big Girl” stores (why is it that we women are stripped of our sexuality and reduced to “girls” when we are obese?!), and I could feel people judging me as much as I judged myself when eating or simply walking on the streets. I was fat.\n\nNow, the timeline here is something like: 28 years = 78 kg and top form! 38 years = 116 kg and, well, not so much.\n\nThen one day, around mid-July 2018 I was reading a book on nutrition. I do that periodically, since my career was nutritionally based and it is still a hobby of mine. I’ve given up that career and am now hired as a sometimes personal assistant by a decision scientist, and that pays the bills and leaves me plenty of time for myself. My head is working now, but still fragile. Stress of any magnitude and type will send me spiraling. I have accepted this as my new normal, and I’ll wager that I am a lot happier in my everyday life now, than I ever was back when.\n\nThe book I was reading was “Why we get fat and what to do about it” by Gary Taubes. Books on the science of weight gain had been vacuumed down by me these past years like white truffles by a Piedmontian hog. I knew I had plenty of self-discipline, because that was what broke me in the first place! But still I ended up eating like my life depended on every bite even when knowing I shouldn’t. It had to be instinct, brain chemistry or genetics. Something! And Taubes had excellent points, points that could readily be looked up in the sources he provided. So I read on in literature referenced or recommended and ended up following a rabbit trail of Jimmy Moore, Robb Wolf and Jason Fung all the way to Keto.\n\nWhen I was halfway through “Why we get fat” I put down the book, looked up sources, references, called a few academics, bought books to cross reference with, and then bogged down to read again. About 50 pages later I got up, threw out all sugar and sugary foods as well as all our bread and flour. I then went on reading. I may have poured out my half-drunk soda too. The knowledge I was gaining on what sugar did to my body was making me feel nauseated. I could recognize *SO MANY* symptoms of insulin resistance! And please note that this was knowledge I in my almost 20 year career as a chef and baker had never encountered other than thinly referenced and then dismissed!\n\nI should here mention that I am on the Asperger spectrum. I have it easy compared to others as I am extremely well adjusted but I do still get obsessive about subjects. I “fall in love” with projects and live and BREATHE for them! This became one of those. I did nothing but read science, theory and the experiences of people on keto for a week. Sleep is not really a priority in those instances. Of course I was prepared. I could not fail. I had everything lined up. I had bough bacon and eggs a plenty. Broccoli and cauliflower. I bought extra supplements: potassium, magnesium and salt tablets which we would take to mitigate the flu.\n\nA week later we (my extremely supportive bf and me) had gone from tentative but enthusiastic low carb into full blown keto. I thought I was well prepared. I had read up on EVERYTHING I could find!\n\nIn yet another completely unforeseen turn of events, I was NOT prepared.\n\nDear lord, the keto flu. And the FUCKING sugar withdrawals! I was ***SHAKING***! And my beautiful vegan bf who chose to go (non-vegan) keto to support me? Funny how a stomach that hasn’t encountered red meat in 8 years will react when you eat a load of it suddenly and with no warning. And the headaches! Then our skin broke out everywhere trying to flush out toxins and we were, frankly, peeing out both arse and, well, where you normally pee from.\n\nWe were completely utterly miserable.\n\nBut like I earlier mentioned, I do self-discipline quite well. So does he. And we persevered. I bought ox-bile enzyme tablets for my poor bf whose stomach **seriously** didn’t recognize red meat as a food-stuff! And for myself, whose stomach rejected all fat to the point where I knew to just sit there on the toilet and wait, exactly half an hour after eating. Might as well. Other option was Disaster Pants.\n\nI bought bone-broth and coconut oil to fix our fucked up digestive system (I could make the broth myself, but I will choose store bought over “I SHOULD be doing this, but probably won’t” any day).\n\nI bought psyllium husk capsules to put a stopper in our sad ragged arses when nothing else worked (No, we ate them. What is wrong with you people!)\n\nI also bought sweeteners, and BOY let me tell you! That is a whole fragging science unto itself! I am, as mentioned, a trained pro in nutritional stuff. As in, I am a Chef and have worked as a head chef for years in nice places. I am also a pro trained Danish Baker (not TM but it almost should be with the harrowing workhours and the sexual harassment from a male based prehistoric workforce). I know a lot of shit about food and the making there of. But cooking and baking with sweeteners? I have grey hairs now I did NOT have a year ago and I am certain this is the cause! It will NOT act the way sugar does! As a perfectionistic slightly obsessed chef and baker, I have not been happy with the recipes out there, let me tell you! I have – after a year’s hard work - perfected enough recipes that I am more or less happy now, though.\n\nI digress. I do that a lot. I’m told it’s charming.\n\nThe point is: We slowly figured it out. And no matter how miserable the first week was for my bf, and the first month was for me (yeah, I really hit the jackpot on the horrors of starting keto) we finally had ketosis. Eureka. And the weight started peeling off. Because it works.\n\nIt’s now been a year of lazy keto (we went for maintainable over effective to make sure I didn’t grow tired of the regime, food is life for me). I’ve lost 30 kg and am at 86.2 kg now. I’ll probably lose more, and that’s great. If I don’t, that’s great too. I am damned proud of the body I have now, because I have worked hard for it!\n\nIn the year that went, IF started happening all by itself, and we now only eat between 12 and 20; usually one big meal with some light snacking here and there because we like it that way. I’ve done a few longer fasts, because I was curious about it, and it was cool. A week with only water, tea, broth and electrolytes are totally doable, but not really for me. Nice to know I can if I need to, though.\n\nWe also started working out again. My knee can finally support me, and I need to put on some muscle to fill out my skin. Which has generally snapped back beautifully, except for on my arms. Guess I’ll just have to hulk all out on them gains for that, then.\n\nHas it been all roses, sunshine and ribeye steaks since we got through the keto flu? Fuck no. I’ve fallen in a couple of times. Planned and unplanned. But I learn from it every time. I find what triggered the unplanned mess up and learn to handle that better or avoid it. And for the planned slips, I learned from my body’s reaction to carbs.\n\nI love carbs. Carbs love me. But we have an unusually toxic relationship of the kind where someone will in the end come to grief. And I’m pretty sure it is me. So we’ve broken up and I am never going back. Sure, we can be friends. I can do low carb. But only in the company of people I trust and in well-lit public places.\n\n**The promised TL;DR**\n\nRemember that this is all stuff that worked FOR ME and the bf. YMMV. Some of it is just opinions. Ignore if you don’t like them.\n\n* Don’t talk about keto to people unless they ask. (I'm told this should be the first rule?)\n* Either read up on the why and how keto works, (like, why you should eat cruciferous veggies and not bananas), or follow a proven and acclaimed keto diet guide. I recommend the one in Jimmy Moore’s Keto Clarity. Don’t half ass it, you may actually harm yourself if you do.\n* Buy potassium, salt and magnesium GLYCERATE. NOT CITRATE! That is a laxative in the amounts you will need it!\n* Don’t force yourself to eat. Also don’t force yourself to fast unless you know what you are doing. IF will often happen all on its own when your body is ready for it. If you are curious on fasting, please read up on it first, for your own sake.\n* Drink your water. I personally need 2-2.5 liters a day. I have a dedicated Water Glass that I know the measurements of, and I know I need to fill and drink it 4-5 times a day.\n* Guess what else can be used for a laxative? Salt in large amounts, is what. Space it out during the day or Disaster Pants will happen.\n* Read the ingredients list on everything you buy. I was shocked to find that they put dextrose (sugar) in pâté! Seriously?! And some mayo has it to!! (I RAGED at that. Mayo should only be egg yolk, salt, vinegar and oil!!!!!!! Raaaaah!) You may have to google your way around some of the sneaky names they give ingredients to make them seem friendlier or unrecognizable but take the time. It pays off. (Aaand how about the number of names for sugar, huh? 61 and – probably - counting: [https://sugarscience.ucsf.edu/hidden-in-plain-sight/#.XUrsKDtMSUk](https://sugarscience.ucsf.edu/hidden-in-plain-sight/#.XUrsKDtMSUk))\n* Having bad cravings? Suck on a piece of Himalaya salt. Drink some coffee or tea. Give your mouth something to taste and do. If it gets really bad, I make myself a cup of bone broth or just go ahead and make the meal of the day if I haven’t eaten already. I you have eaten and the cravings are this bad, then odds are you have had too many carbs somehow or didn’t get enough protein.\n* Period on keto: It will be messed up. Hormones got trapped in the fat you stored on your body, and then gets into your bloodstream when you lose it. But it will sort itself out in time. I’m personally almost back to the flow, cramps and schedule I had a sixteen. For better or worse (ouch!)\n* Readymade store bought keto food stuffs. Yeah, no. Not for me. Low carb protein bars tried to kill me a couple of times (#AlwaysCheckForMaltitol, #NeverForget, #IWasWarnedButDidntListen, #VigilForMyBum) and usually the other stuff I find still has way too many carbs, just disguised. They’ll sneak it in there somehow, because carbs are cheap fillers that make your reptile brain yell for more. I’ve learned to make my own stuff or go without.\n* Sweeteners are your enemy. They will lull you into a false sense of security then either give you carb-cravings or make you spray paint the inside of the toilet. Don’t trust them.\n* Have a backup plan for when you don’t want to or can’t cook. Find somewhere that makes lettuce wrap burgers or no bread sandwiches or something. Stock up on pork rinds. Have cheese in bulk in the fridge, whatever works for you. But do have a plan B. I’ve learned the hard way to have a huge supply of macadamia nuts and pork rinds for the days when cooking. Is. Not. Happening.\n* Screw ketones. If you have been eating low enough carbs for a month or more you are DEFINITELY in ketosis. More ketones will not make you more in ketosis. It is a switch, not a scale. Spending money on keto-sticks and stuff like that is only relevant if you are diabetic and also need to measure blood sugar to make sure you don’t enter ketoacidosis. But if you ARE diabetic you need to talk to a doctor if you are going to do this, anyway. Please talk to a doctor if you are going keto and are diabetic! Or if you have medical issues of any kind!\n* People react differently to carbs and keto. My bf was in ketosis within 24 hours. I went a month before seeing results. We ate the same damned things. Some resentment may have been had. I still struggle when passing a bakery or candy store, after a year on keto. He’s always been able to take carbs or leave them. It’s not fair, but it is as it is. And as always we have to learn to play the cards we get dealt.\n* Boredom, emotional distress and just plain regular stress will make almost anyone cravy, because most of us get taught to eat our emotions aka comfort eat. Find a way to deal with this BEFORE it becomes an issue to you. The scale for handling this goes from therapy if it is REALLY bad, over sobbing on the shoulder of a good friend to hugging a teddy bear or a nice cup of tea. Remember that you are allowed to have and experience your feelings. In fact you really should. But don’t let them control your actions.\n* Get your blood checked. I did it after 6 months and was so low in potassium and salt that my doctor was alarmed. Despite taking supplements. Apparently I'm a special snowflake that needs more of those things than usual. Yay me.\n* The only sweeteners that doesn't affect our ketosis are Erithnol, Stevia and Monkfruit. Erithnol will give you Disaster Pants i large amounts and have a weird cooling effect in your mouth, and stevia and monkfruit both have aftertastes. Monkfruit is slightly bitter alcohol-ish to me, and stevia tastes like liquorice. Every other sweetener fucks with our ketosis. Every. (I would love to try allulose, but it is not available in Europe).\n* Have you gone full carnivore/zero carb? Remember your vitamin C. Really. Scurvy is a thing, you know.\n\n**Bonus list:**\n\nGastrointestinal distress? Here’s a checklist:\n\n* Have you drunk enough water? 2-3 liters a day is commonly needed. (Dehydration clogs you up)\n* Have you taken your supplements? (Magnesium and potassium helps everything along)\n* Have you had enough (*any*) fiber? (Psyllium husk may help get things moving and will also STOP things moving if they are moving too much. But only if you drink enough water with it)\n* Have you had any MCT oil? (If you have, stop it, it’s probably that! It is really hard on the stomach unless you are used to it)\n* Have you had any sweeteners? (Was it maltitol? Bet it was. Maltitol will do that to you. **It is the devil**)\n\nStill struggling with digestion? Try getting some ox-bile based digestive enzymes. You may not have the needed bacterial flora to handle the amounts of fat and/or meat you are eating now. Get them as a crutch and support that poor gallbladder until it has accustomed itself to your new diet. Eating lots of bitter green will also help on this point as tasting bitterness activates the gallbladder. Think rocket lettuce, endive and strong tea.\n\nI know my TL;DR was still too long.

    "body": "\nTomorrow will mark one full month of eating keto and I thought I’d share some of the foods I’ve enjoyed in this first few weeks. I’ve lost half a stone this month and adjusted my goal weight from 8.5 stone to 8. Enjoying better, more even energy levels, no bloating, less hunger and ability to go longer between meals. Sleep was very disrupted the first 1-2 weeks with crazy dreams and getting up to pee several times, but that has settled down now to pre-keto sleeping patterns. I’m generally feeling less sleepy in the evenings and falling asleep later, but am able to get up at the same time as usual feeling better than pre-keto. \r\n\r\nHaven’t drunk much alcohol this month but when I have I’ve found the hangovers particularly awful, especially wine (no carbs to line the stomach??). Have enjoyed the odd Bud Light with spicy chicken wings and found I could fit in in my macros fine.\r\n\r\nI made some ‘keto bread’ the first week, but haven’t made any again since. It was fine but I just haven’t had the urge to eat pretend bread again really. I tried fathead pizza dough and honestly it was the first thing I’ve eaten on keto that’s given me digestive issues (too big a cheese dose possibly?!) so I won’t be rushing to make it again. My favourite vegetable dish discovery has been cauliflower cheese with the cauliflower sautéed until soft with garlic and onion, covered in a sauce made of cream cheese, cream and grated cheese, then grilled until browned. Seriously good. \r\n\r\nOne thing that’s been great is placing an order with Farmdrop; new customers get a £25 discount off £60 minimum order which makes it a real bargain. Ordered basically all (quality, free range) meats – pork belly, beef shin, brisket, chicken wings, 80/20 beef mince, stock bones - and everything has been really good so far. \r\n\r\nWeekdays I mainly take breakfast to work with me and eat this late morning. I usually pack lunch too but have been treating myself to a bought lunch about once a week. I’ve found Itsu, Chilango and Wrap It Up! have decent keto-compliant options, and Sainsbury’s hot counter does some great chicken thighs which are a cheaper option. I’m super into all the posh pork scratching options that are around now; particularly enjoying The Snaffling Pig maple flavour and The Curators salt and vinegar pork puffs – great for a former crisp addict! Splurging on Pukka herbal teas has been a good tool for curbing the urge for something sweet. \r\n\r\nI’ve found Reddit to be a great resource for keto and have been listening to a few keto/keto-related podcasts for motivation (favourites: Keto for Normies, Balanced Bites, Ketogenic Athlete). I’m also totally addicted to the Keto Connect YouTube channel. Looking forward to seeing how I feel after longer eating this way! \r\n\r\nTypical day of eating (weekday)  \r\n\r\n-\tFirst thing: Coffee with 1tsp double cream \r\n-\tLate breakfast: Egg mayo made with 3 hard boiled eggs with ½ tbsp full fat mayo OR 2 eggs mixed with half an avocado, big handful of baby plum tomatoes \r\n-\tLate lunch: Roasted chicken thighs or tinned sardines/mackerel in olive oil, leafy salad \r\n-\tDinner: Beef chilli made with extra mushrooms and courgette, sour cream and cheese \r\n-\tAfter dinner: Fat bomb, Sainsbury’s 85% dark chocolate, keto peanut butter cookie\r\n-\tSnacks: Pork scratchings/crunch, jerky, Quest bars, babybel cheese, gherkins, pecans \r\n-\tDrinks: coffee with a splash of cream, tea with a splash of whole milk, Pukka herbal teas, Aqua Libra (kinda like La Croix, pricy but they hit the spot for me), soda water with fresh lemon/lime (with or without gin)\r\n\r\n\n[Pic collage](https://imgur.com/gallery/JngvYaQ)\n\r\r\nPhoto collage pics, left to right\r\n\r\nTop row: \r\n1. Cookies and Cream Fulfil bar. I think these are my favourite protein bar. I have tried a lot of the Quest flavours and like most of them, but to me they do have a strong sweetener taste and very much ‘protein bar texture’ whereas this Fulfil bar doesn’t. 8.2g carbs per bar of which 4.4 polyols = 3.8 carbs net. The sweetener in this flavour is erythritol and stevia. Watch out, this is not the case for all of the flavours - many have maltitol. \r\n2. A common weekend breakfast of bacon, eggs, tomatoes and avocado. \r\n3. [Itsu](https://www.itsu.com/menu/asian-salads/omega-3-poke-zerosalad/) omega-3 poke zero’salad. Uses zero carb shirataki noodles. Meal total 398 cals, 8.2g carb, 30g fat, 20g protein. This does not include the dressing pot which Itsu don’t count in their nutrition calculations and is carby. However, it didn’t feel like it was needed; there is also some kind of creamy dressing underneath the avocado and the noodles tasted like they had been flavoured with sesame oil too. \r\n\r\nMiddle row:\r\n1. Low carb [crackers](https://www.wholesomeyum.com/recipes/paleo-crackers/). So easy to make using just almond flour, egg and salt, with a good crunchy result. I added caraway seeds to half (meh) and dried Italian herb seasoning plus garlic powder to the other half (very tasty). Roll as thin as possible for best results. I used a piece of clingfilm between the rolling pin and the dough and it worked great. \r\n2. Sautéed seasoned beef mince, tomatoes, avocado and a little raw onion with a ketofied copycat [Big Mac Sauce](https://www.wholesomeyum.com/recipes/big-mac-salad-cheeseburger-salad-low-carb-gluten-free/) which was excellent. Will definitely be making this regularly. I used less sweetener than the recipe. \r\n3. Delicious maple pecan cupcakes from [Yummzy](http://www.yummzy.co.uk/), a low carb bakery in Greenwich. They aren’t able to supply exact nutrition info yet but assured me that everything is below 5g carbs per portion. They’re using stevia to sweeten, and I think most things or maybe everything is suitable for vegans. \r\n\r\nBottom row: \r\n1. Turkish lamb kofte box with extra jerk chicken portion from [Wrap It Up!](https://www.wrapitup.co.uk/our-menu/). Comes with garlic mayo, tomatoes, cucumber, cos lettuce. I preferred the jerk chicken to the lamb koftes, has a nice spicy dry coating on it. Unfortunately not possible to gauge exact macros as their online nutrition info is only for the wrap version of each meal. \r\n2. Quick lunch of hard boiled eggs, tomatoes and chicken thigh meat (ready cooked flavoured kind from Sainsbury’s hot counter). \r\n3. Keto granola. A nice change from an egg/bacon/avo based breakfast. I looked at a few different online recipes and improvised a bit. About 300g dry ingredients (100g each hazelnuts and almonds, 25g ground chia seed, 25g linseed, 100g dried coconut flakes, 2 tsp cinnamon), roughly blitzed in a blender. Mixed in 30g salted butter melted with 30g erythritol and 6 stevia drops, then I added an egg white for good measure. Packed onto a lined backing tray, baked for about 15 minutes. Once cooled broken up into small pieces. Counting this as about 10 portions (around 35g) each one is 157 cals, 2.4g carb, 14.6 fat, 4g protein (would double up for a full breakfast).",

Factors such as medications may upset this delicate balance. The aim of this commentary is to provide physicians who are treating patients with a ketogenic diet, with a step-by-step guide. A list of unsuitable excipients was established. A flowchart with the title \"Can this drug be prescribed to a patient following a ketogenic diet?\" was then drafted. The first step is to determine the international nonproprietary name, dosage, form and composition. The amount of unsuitable excipients is calculated. Suitable alternatives may be discussed with the pharmacist. As a last resort, the ketogenic diet itself may need to be adapted. The answers provided are included in a database. Determining the amount of unsuitable excipients is a complex task requiring pharmaceutical expertise. Our flowchart can be used in order to provide a clear pathway for answering such questions.\n\n\\----\n\n## Impacts on practice\n\n* A list of suitable and unsuitable carbohydrates for use in a ketogenic diet was created.\n* A flowchart was designed to provide standardized information for pharmacists and physicians when prescribing medications for patients on a ketogenic diet.\n\n# Introduction\n\nA ketogenic diet (KD) is characterized by a low intake of carbohydrates and a high intake of lipids. Protein intake is based on the age and weight of the patient. During a KD, the body synthesizes ketones to use as energy substrates instead of carbohydrates. The most commonly used ratio is the 4:1 diet: 4 g of fat intake per gram of non-fat intake (carbohydrates and proteins). The KD has been in use since 1921 \\[ [1](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR1)\\] in children with drug-resistant epilepsy, i.e. after failure of two or three appropriate anti-epileptic drugs. A KD may also be used in specific metabolic disorders responsible for epilepsy syndromes such as Glut1 deficiency (De Vivo syndrome), pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, Doose syndrome, Dravet syndrome, infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Tuberous sclerosis. It has been shown to be effective in several randomized controlled trials: in general, half of all patients treated with a KD have at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency \\[ [2](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR2)– [5](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR5)\\]. A KD needs to be initiated in the hospital setting in order to ensure optimal patient monitoring, to control any adverse effects, to teach the parents how to implement the diet and to prevent possible complications. The patient’s oral intake is modified to achieve ketosis over a period of 3 days. The effectiveness is monitored by measuring urinary ketones. The patient can be discharged after 5 days as long as no adverse effects are recorded. The ketogenic diet should be continued at home and followed up every month. The reduction in seizure frequency is evaluated after 3 months. For children who tolerate the diet and achieve > 50% reduction in seizure frequency, the KD should be continued for at least 2 years. In patients with infantile spasms or status epilepticus a shorter duration may be appropriate, however for other patients such as those with Glut1 deficiency syndrome and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, a longer duration is likely to be necessary. This may also be the case in other forms of refractory epilepsy, based on individual responses \\[ [6](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR6), [7](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR7)\\].Anti-epileptic drugs as well as other chronic/temporary medications may unbalance the effects of the KD as they potentially contain carbohydrate excipients. Moreover, liquid formulations, often containing a lot of carbohydrates, are frequently used in the pediatric population. In order to improve palatability and therefore compliance, carbohydrate intake from medications should be limited so that more carbohydrates in food may be allowed. International guidelines for the management of the KD suggest that neurologists should review all current medications with a pharmacist to determine their content in unsuitable excipients and to consider the most appropriate alternatives \\[ [7](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR7)\\]. Unsuitable excipients include those metabolized into glucose, i.e. certain sugars and alcohol \\[ [2](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR2), [6](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR6), [7](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR7)\\].Our objective was to provide physicians treating patients on a KD with a prescribing aide, in order to avoid disturbing ketosis. The flowchart can be used in any setting; however the list of the unsuitable excipients may vary in accordance with local practices.In this commentary, we report the current management of patients on a KD in a French University Hospital. The patients are all followed up in our Tertiary Center for children with Rare Epileptic disorders by a multidisciplinary team (including Pharmacists, Pediatric Neurologists and Dieticians).\n\n## Ethics approval\n\nThis study was carried out without any human or animal participant involvement, therefore, local ethics board approval was not required.\n\n## Our findings\n\nCarbohydrates and alcohols used as excipients in drugs were identified using the *Handbook of pharmaceutical excipients 6th edition* \\[ [8](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR8)\\]. A list of unsuitable excipients was compiled after review of the medical literature and discussion with the multidisciplinary team. The list is reported in Table  [1](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#Tab1). A flowchart (Fig.  [1](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#Fig1)) was developed to help answer questions such as: “Is it possible to prescribe this drug in a patient on a KD?”. The first step on the flow chart is to find out general information: the molecule, dosage and formulation. The next step is to determine the excipients based on the product characteristics summary (SmPC), either by contacting the laboratory directly, or by a scientific literature search. Analysis of the composition of the drug enables any unsuitable excipients to be identified. If none are found, the drug can be used in a KD. If the drug contains unsuitable excipients, it is necessary to find an alternative treatment (such as another route of administration, a different formulation or possibly another molecule). If the alternative is an oral solid form, it is necessary to check if administration is possible (absence of a swallowing disorder) and if not, to check the possibility of crushing or diluting the medication. In the absence of any satisfactory alternative, it is necessary to determine the amount of unsuitable excipients in “units of prescription”, based on the data available or, as a last resort, with an estimated calculation as discussed in the article by *Denis Lebel.* This involves calculating the maximum carbohydrate content by weighting the drug and then subtracting the weight of both the active substance and all known non-carbohydrate excipients \\[ [9](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR9)\\]. Next, information such as the use of alternative drugs, the amount of unsuitable excipients found and the feasibility of changing the route of administration are relayed to the physician, who then decides whether or not to prescribe the drug. If it is not considered appropriate to use the drug, it may be possible to perform pharmaceutical compounding when the active substance exists as a raw material. The carbohydrate content in the patient’s diet may be reduced or the drug may be changed altogether when no alternative is possible. \n\n Table 1\n\nA list of drug excipients (carbohydrates and alcohols) which are allowed, and those which are not recommended for use in the ketogenic diet, as defined in our institution\n\nExcipient allowed:\n\n* Aspartame\n* Cellulose\n* Gelatin\n* Glycerol\n* Paraffin\n* Hypromellose\n* Lactulose\n* Sucralose\n* Xanthan gum\n\nExcipients not advised\n\n* Dextrin\n* Fructose\n* Glucose\n* Lactitol\n* Lactose\n* Maltitol\n* Maltodextrin\n* Mannitol\n* Sucrose\n* Sorbitol\n* Starch\n* Xylitol\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Fig. 1  Steps to follow when considering prescribing a drug treatment to patients on a ketogenic diet.

To ensure traceability, there is always a written report of this process. The drugs studied are logged in a database for future reference. This database contains drug information (commercial name, maunfacturer, dose and formulation), the presence of unsuitable excipients, the amount of carbohydrates and possible alternatives. It is completed every time a drug is studied, and to date the database currently includes most anti-epileptic medications, antalgics and frequently prescribed antibiotics.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn our study, the excipients which are considered to be unsuitable for use in a KD were determined by the multidisciplinary team; the list is comparable to at least four other publications currently found in the literature; *Thomas J. Feldstein*, the NHS of the United Kingdom, the Charlie Foundation and *Jeff Curless*, with the exception of glycerol \\[ [10](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR10)– [13](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR13)\\]. In our institution, Glycerol is an “acceptable” excipient, whereas other authors disagree. This difference can be explained by studying the metabolism of glycerol. Glycerol is part of carbohydrate metabolism, but it is also produced from fatty acids \\[ [14](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR14)\\]. Given the physiological nature of glycerol production and its (generally) low contribution as an excipient in drugs, we judged the amount of exogenous glycerol to be negligible and therefore acceptable for use in the KD.Approximately 51% of oral medications contain carbohydrates which are considered to be incompatible with a KD \\[ [15](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR15)\\]. This highlights the importance of defining a clear management plan for patients on a KD. Our flowchart, along with the list of acceptable and unsuitable excipients, provides a straight forward pathway in order to help answer this frequent pharmacological dilemma.There are no clear-cut guidelines for initiating or modifying drug therapy in patients on a KD, but the pharmacist should always be consulted due to the specific nature of the problem \\[ [7](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR7)\\]. Pharmaceutical expertise is essential in order to determine the composition of the drug excipients and therefore the quantity of unsuitable excipients. Standard resources (SmPC, contact with the manufacturer) should be consulted as a first step, and if required a review of the scientific literature may be necessary. When using data from the scientific literature, it is necessary to identify the country of origin of the products analyzed, as the composition of the excipients may vary. Lists which originate from different countries are therefore only partially usable and sometimes may not be suitable \\[ [9](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR9), [10](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR10)\\]. The technique described in the study by Lebel et al. (estimation of the quantity of carbohydrate), may be used in the absence of precise data and as a last resort in order to estimate the amount of unsuitable excipients present \\[ [9](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR9)\\]. However, the quantity of unsuitable excipients is frequently overestimated, sometimes by a significant amount. This overestimation may result in unnecessary dietary changes, such as a decrease in the quantity of carbohydrates (from food) allowed in the diet. If the use of unsuitable drug excipients is prioritized at the expense of food carbohydrate intake, this in turn may lead to poor compliance with an already restrictive diet. A simple solution in order to reduce drug carbohydrate “load” is to use the rectal route, because carbohydrates contained in rectal medications are not absorbed. However, it is difficult to recommend this form of administration (except for with antipyretics), due to the unpredictable absorption of active substances \\[ [16](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR16)\\]. Finally, particular attention must be paid when prescribing liquid formulations labeled as “sugar free” as well as pharmaceutical compounding. Indeed, certain sugar-free medicines are likely to contain excipients other than sucrose such as sorbitol, which is also not recommended in a KD \\[ [11](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR11)\\]. Excipients used in compounding must also be adjusted to suit a KD.The transition from inpatient to outpatient care is a complex step for patients on a KD. It is essential to keep the same brand of drug, because the composition and the content of unsuitable excipients is likely to vary between branded medicines and generics forms. During intercurrent illnesses, the pediatrician or the general practitioner may need to prescribe a new medication, and the amount of carbohydrate present must also be taken into consideration. Physicians or pharmacists in this situation should contact the professionals in the institution which initiated the KD to benefit from their expertise.Patient and parental education is crucial in order to ensure compliance and therefore effectiveness of the KD. Two particularly important aspects to consider include: food and drug compliance (to ensure optimal control of epileptic seizures), and self-medication. The latter requires the family to alert their pharmacist or family physician to the fact that the patient is on a KD so that the diet does not become unbalanced by prescription of unsuitable drugs \\[ [17](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR17)\\]. It is important that the dispensing pharmacist, who will probably have less experience of a KD than the hospital team, is also informed and knows who to consult for advice.Several studies confirm the importance of the role of the pharmacist in both the search for unsuitable excipients and the suggestion of alternative drugs \\[ [7](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR7), [16](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR16), [18](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR18)– [20](https://www.springermedizin.de/ketogenic-diet-a-pharmaceutical-guide-for-the-management-of-drug/17807480?fulltextView=true#CR20)\\]. A drug database specifying the content of non-recommended excipients in their various forms needs to be established. Unlike the lists found in the medical literature, this list may also include possible alternatives and should be adapted for use in France. The database should not be considered as standard, due to variations in drug excipients between countries, but may serve as a useful guide. In conjunction with this list, we have created a flowchart intended for universal use.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe flowchart which we have developed in this article provides a valuable resource in order to answer questions about drug use during a kentogenic diet. If the flowchart is followed correctly, it provides a reliable, structured answer about the use of unsuitable excipients, and also offers possible drug alternatives. The authors recommend that all pharmacies involved in dispensing drugs to patients on a KD keep a database of drugs and their excipients specific to their country, along with suggestions of possible alternative treatments.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank the members of the multidisciplinary team in Nancy University Regional Teaching Hospital, including the pediatricians, dieticians and pharmacists, who are all involved in the management of patients on a ketogenic diet.

    "body": "Like an ever-increasing number of kids today, I grew up chubby. I ate the wrong things, and ate too much. I was quite young when the dawn of video games and home computing became a thing, and so I took to that indoor sedentary lifestyle quickly. \n\nI had just finished college when my father passed away. We had become estranged, with this thought deep in my mind that someday we'd patch things up. I went from an obese 250 pounds to over 300 that year. I had an episode where my feet swelled into an almost cartoonish shape and I went on some diuretics. My motivation for change was short lived. I was just not in a good place to maintain it.\n\nI had ups and downs over the next five years, until I found myself hitting rock bottom. Business had collapsed, I was being moved to a location I hated, and I had no real prospects. I embraced this pain and suffering, and began a very restrictive diet of about 300 calories a day in snack packs of very poor macros.\n\nBut it worked. I started exercising. First walking a LOT, doing some light weights. Then jogging more and more of my route. I hit 136 before the stress of moving to a new house and doing work on it got to me. Mind you, I was way too thin by this point, but I couldn't really see it. And my body composition was poor.\n\nAt this point my behavior became a pendulum. Periods of recovery, with holidays and trips being triggers for crazy binge sessions, or at least they seemed crazy then. Today they seem a bit tame compared to what I can put away now. Over the years I would go up and down and up and down, at one point getting over 200, and one time recently getting as low as 137 but with much better composition (more on that later).\n\nOne problem is that as you get older, losses pile up. People you know die, people you care about... die. Bad things happen. To you, to your family, to your country. Life is hard when you feel deeply. You make mistakes, sometimes they cost you more than you think you'll ever recover. And in case I don't make it clear later, this isn't a success story. This is just my story, and I don't know yet how it ends.\n\nBut for 15 years I've struggled with my weight and for part of that I actually started recognizing binging as the disorder. Here's a few things I've learned.\n\nSugar is a drug. We need food. Embrace food. But sugar, and to a lesser extent maltitol (in some sugar free products), is not something we need or should embrace, and even in healthy eaters creates a drug like response, addiction, and endless craving for more. Whether it's a major factor of binging or not, it should be avoided.\n\nMindset is important. I spent years doing 'keto', and so when taking a break or cheat day or cheat week, or whatever, the mindset becomes hazardous, as you rationalize all sorts of bad behavior and scurry to stuff as much non-keto in your face before you have to go back on.\n\nYes, low carb is good, just don't get trapped into the concept of taking breaks from that as an excuse to indulge in the aforementioned drug foods, and always strive, even when eating over your goal, to focus on good macros. High protein, no sugar, limited carbs. \n\nIdentify your quirks. We all have different eating triggers, as well as quirks like removing limitations when the food is free, or if we are out of town, etc. I won't delve into mine, even if a lot of these quirks are shared. Just be on the look out for repeated behaviors that tend to lead to binging, and try to adjust those habits. Raise your standards to lower the amount of trigger foods you keep in your environment.\n\nWhen you've been binging you will feel shame. You will feel like recovery is impossible. For me I've felt that way more times than I can count. But it's never true. And what I've discovered is the path is more important than the destination. Have faith, come up with or resume your plan, and tell yourself the truth that you are on the path. IT'S OKAY, I AM ON THE PATH NOW. Everything else we want and need, it's just down the path. It's a matter of time.\n\nThe final thing I've learned is that restriction may lead to binging... but I no longer believe it is because of restricting itself, but because of the weight loss that comes with it. Perhaps if you lose slow enough, or perhaps if your genes are right, you can lose weight without binge urges following, but two years ago I bought a treadmill and I stopped restricting.\n\nInstead, I started walking. I walked while watching TV shows. I walked while playing video games (start slow on this one, your body likes to react to stimulus so I about fell off a couple times... okay more than a couple). I even walked while eating (not the smartest thing really). Because most my hobbies allow me to treadmill, I treadmill. And I rack up the calorie count. I eat 2k calories... I burn 2k calories. And I will tell you, I prefer this to a restrictive diet. I  just feel better.\n\nHowever, it did not, or has not, cured me. And the first time I binged, it was one of the worst I had ever done. After a cousin died, and someone brought this amazing PB dirtcake desert to the funeral, like who does that, and so of course I ate a ton of it. I was shocked at my behavior. I spent weeks as a food thief and scavenger and deal hunter, finding every excuse I could to eat more and more sweets.\n\nRestriction is not the problem (not the root imo). My massive weight loss broke my brain, I believe. It doesn't know what a healthy weight should be. It only believes that I am always starving. Always in need of more. This is at least how I view my affliction. And I don't hold out hope that it will heal after all this time.\n\nBut life is still livable, and I am on the path. \n\nI won't be giving up on myself anytime soon. I recently tried to get some prescription appetite suppressant, but was denied. I've started mixing in inositol (can google that if you like) into protein shakes and taking a cocktail of OTC 'herbal' based suppressants with some success, but I'm early into this new experiment. \n\nDon't be afraid to try new things. It's your life, no on else's. ",

        "body": "Thank you for this! A lot of what you’ve shared resonates deeply with me, and it’s so helpful to read from someone else’s perspective. A few things I just haven’t been able to “put my finger on it” in terms of triggers/feelings, you’ve articulated, a light bulb went off for me!! I’ve always been on the “chubby” side, and after my three pregnancies I was technically obese. I tried and battled and gave up to start all over for what feels like my entire life! Five years ago I decided to get braces (as an adult, I was so low about my self esteem all over). That significantly restricted what I could eat, and I lost 60 pounds over about 8 months. Since I’ve gotten my braces off I have put some weight back on, not to where I was pre-braces, but I am terrified knowing it’s VERY possible. I am struggling with the mind-set AND the sugar addiction now. With braces I had to restrict what I was eating, now that I don’t have them I need to do the work on my mental health. That and the sugar addiction is REAL. Anyways, thank you for posting, this was a helpful reminder that I am certainly not alone in any of this.",

        "body": "I resonate with a lot you said. I’m still on a path to find out what leads to the fewest binges, because I know I won’t be able to get rid of it completely. If it happens like twice a month, hell even once a week, I’d be so happy. \n\nI agree with you that sugar is a drug. I tried banning it completely from my diet (minus sugars found in veggies) but honestly that wasnt a great idea. I now try to eat sensibly but still allow sugar here and there. \n\nMindset is everything, I think what gets in people’s way the most is this all or nothing mindset (which I also have in other aspects of life but I’ve improved a lot). \n\nSometimes it feels like food itself is my trigger. Like I binge when I’m happy, sad, angry, whatever emotion. Whether I eat healthy or bad or restrict or eat “normally”, it can still end up in a binge which makes it frustrating. Almost makes me wish I did have emotional trauma lol, at least then I’d know the cause. \n\nWhat I disagree with is that there’s a “cure”. I feel like there are measures you can take to keep it at a low but for me it’s hard to believe that it’ll ever go away completely. Same way some people alcoholics still cannot be around alcohol even though they have been sober for 20 years. Rather than a cure you just managed to avoid it in a way. \n\nAlso, you mentioned choosing to walk a lot over restricting. Isn’t that just a different form of restricting? Like people with ortorexia do. Or maybe it’s seen as purging, anyways, I don’t think solely food restriction leads to bingeing, overexercising def does too. Though I also believe it highly depends on the reason why you restrict. I love fasting as it is WAAAAAY easier for me to not eat than eat a little bit over a long period of time. And incorporating IF has helped with my binges a lot. It def made it worse at times as well because i didnt have the right mindset, but overall it has made my life better. \n\nI’m not so sure about the weight loss theory either, \nyour body won’t think you’re starving unless you’re actually starving? It seems like you lose weight quite rapidly. This could be a shock to your body. I do the same thing, always yo yo, have yet to try losing at a slow pace cause there is always an event i need to get ready for smh. \nBut yeah whether you restrict with food or exercise, I feel like it leads to the same problem. \n\nBut like you I won’t give up because I don’t want to end up like people on my 600lbs life (though my pride and love for exercise would never allow me to get that far but still). Also, I have fitness goals I want to achieve so I’ll fight this disorder every step of the way. \n\nSorry if this was long too haha. Good luck 💪🏽",

Its very new so not many companies use Reb-M (Chobani Zero Sugar uses it).\nThen there is monk fruit. Good studies, some anti-oxident properties. Does have a distinct taste though and not identical to sugar. There are grades of monk fruit and higher grades tend to have less aftertaste. Mostly grades are v30%. Higher grades are typically v40% or v50%. If not stated, likely v30%. Monk fruit is expensive and higher grades even more expensive.\n\nThese are your main natural options for true zero sugar.

    "body": "I was smiled upon by the keto gods today. \n\nI've been sick for a while with a rather sore throat. Decided to make a special trip to the healthfood shop.that carries low carb bread so I could have soup and bread for lunch. Well in line for the bread I find low catb chocolate dip and it isn't full of maltitol!\n\nThen next door to the healthfood shop the fruit shop has strawberries on sale. 5 500g punnets for $5!!! Then I thinking cold strawberries and chocolate dip sounds good on my sore throat (rest of the family has been having icecream and chocolate yoghurt).  Then i think what the hell I'll get some cream too. And lo and behold that was on sale too!\n\nSo i get home and instead of cauliflower soup and toast I dice up a handful of strawberries, whip up some cream and drizzke over the chocolate dip. My husband sees me and says \"that's not lunch that's dessert\". Haha jokes on him the only carbs in it are in the strawberries. It might look and taste like dessert but it's low carb and keto. (For comparison he had fried chicken, chips and a chicken burger for lunch his lunch definitely had way more catns than mine).\n\nSometimes keto is awesome :)",

    "body": "I shop at Sam's Club a lot, and there are a few items there that I haven't really seen mentioned on this sub before that I thought maybe some of you guys would be interested in:\n\n[Pure Leaf Unsweetened Iced Tea \\(18.5 oz. bottles, 15 pk.\\)](https://www.samsclub.com/sams/pl-unsweet-tea-15-18-5-oz/prod13590083.ip?xid=plp:product:1:1)  $10.98.  This is an an easy drink to keep in my fridge when I'm in a hurry, 0 carbs!\n\n[Santa Fe Tortilla Company Homestyle Whole Grain & Flax Tortilla Wraps \\(20 ct.\\)](https://www.samsclub.com/sams/whole-grain-wraps-20ct-2lbs-8oz/prod16390196.ip?xid=plp:product:1:2)  $4.98.  I love these low carb tortillas, 5 carbs per tortilla.  They are cheap and a really good size for making quesadillas.\n\n[Silk Almond Milk Unsweetened Vanilla \\(3 pk., 64 oz.\\)](https://www.samsclub.com/sams/unsweet-almond-milk-vanilla/prod11441022.ip?xid=plp:product:1:1)  $7.98.  Very convenient to find this here!\n\n[Atkins Harvest Variety Pack \\(18 ct.\\)](https://www.samsclub.com/sams/atkins-harvest-nut-18ct/prod21220611.ip?xid=plp:product:1:5)  $13.91.  One of my favorite new finds, these bars are more like a trail mix bar with 1 gram of sugar,  the sweetener is sucralose, only 4 net carbs, and the only Atkins bar I've found that doesn't use maltitol.  \n\n[Bob's Red Mill Almond Flour \\(3lb\\)](https://www.samsclub.com/sams/almond-flour-3-lb/prod20295298.ip?xid=plp:product:1:1)  $13.98.  I've seen this one mentioned before, but thought I'd list it again.  The best deal I've ever found on almond flour.\n\n[Member's Mark Classic Steakhouse Beef Tri-Tip \\(priced per pound\\)](https://www.samsclub.com/sams/steakhouse-beef-tri-tip-rw/prod20390437.ip?xid=plp:product:1:1)  $5.98/lb.  This Tri-Tip is delicious, we make it on the grill.\n\n\nAnyone else have any suggestions about Sam's Club that may have not been listed before?  I think everyone knows they are a good spot to buy nuts, cheese, eggs, cream cheese, heavy cream, fresh meat and veggies, etc.  \n\n",

The only sugar alcohol that has absolutely no insulin response is mannitol and erythritol.\"\n\nI looked at my gum (sugar-free trident layers) and saw that the 2nd ingredient is maltitol and it lists it as 2g carbs per stick.  I was chewing 15 or so sticks a day so there is 30g carbs right there without even eating anything!  ugh  =P   Well, I'm going cold turkey on the gum.  On one hand I'll be sorry to see it go but on the other maybe I can speed up my weight loss now that I will be cutting out ~30g carbs/day that I didn't even realize I was getting.

        "body": "For the people asking from diet doctor:\nAlmost as bad as sugar: maltitol\n\nMaltitol is another sugar alcohol. It is made from the hydrogenation of the corn-syrup by-product maltose. It behaves in cooking and production very much like pure sugar so it is very popular in commercial “sugar free” products, such as candy, desserts, and low-carb products. It is also less expensive for food producers to use than erythritol, xylitol, and other sugar alcohols.\n\nDo not consume maltitol on a keto diet. It has been shown to raise blood sugar and increase insulin response.32\nIt is not good for anyone with diabetes or pre-diabetes. It also has three-quarters of the calories as sugar.33\n\nIt is also a powerful laxative. While 50% of it is absorbed in the small intestine, the remaining 50% ferments in the colon. Studies have shown that maltitol may cause significant gastrointestinal symptoms (gas, bloating, diarrhea, etc.) especially when consumed frequently or in large amounts.34\n\nSweetness: About 80% of the sweetness of table sugar.\nhttps://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/sweeteners",

    "body": "**Apologies for this duplicate posting.**  The previous version is now archived.  I have reposted so I can keep it updated,\n\nIn the following, I have tried to document what Items I include in the weekly supermarket (keto friendly) **specials** list.  I welcome your views on the following, and any additional criteria or brands that I should look for.  I can never include every special, and some keto friendly items are never on special.  Supermarket own brands are often cheaper  nthan amed brands, but they are rarely on special. Updated 29/2/20\n\n**General**\n\n* Select specials for dirty/lazy keto rather than very strict keto.  I leave it up to the user to monitor their own macros and whether they restrict specific ingredients such as soy and gluten..[ https://dirtylazyketo.com/](https://dirtylazyketo.com/)\n* If the carb content is not known but it should be low, I add (check carbs) to the entry. It is up to users to check the nutrition labels.\n* I assume a 20-25 gm carbs per day. On that basis a 7gm carb snack is rather high. (some exceptions, eg Quest bars) Ideally, items should be less than 5gm per 100gm but it depends on what constitutes a serving size.  A 7gm protein bar could be used as a meal replacement so it would be OK.\n* I avoid overseas sourced products when Australian ones are also on special.. This is not a hard and fast rule, Kraft cheddar processed cheese is now made in Australia from 90% overseas ingredients but would be included if a good price.  I prefer Australian olive oil as CHOICE says it is much fresher and scores higher than all the imported ones.  But I also include the imported ones especially if half price.  I look for locally sourced peanuts in \"no sugar\" peanut butters as. I worry about aflatoxins in imported peanut products.\n\n**Products**\n\n* Berries, only frozen varieties preferably local or American sources not Chinese\n* Bread. Lo carb Aldi, Woolworths macro Linseed and Sunflower. Alpine lo carb (but note higher carbs than the others)   Coles new, Vitality Bakehouse Lo carb (very hard to find)  No other lo carb bread or wraps in supermarkets. Empower wraps and No Grainer, much lower in carbs but only in health food stores.\n* Butter/ghee. Always Lurpak, Mainland and Ghee any brand. CHOICE says Aldi butters are very good.\n* Cakes and cake mixes. Only Noshu cakes would be included as some people can fit their higher carbs into their macros. Would also include other Noshu products such as large mud cakes and small individual cakes and doughnuts.\n* Cheeses. Each supermarket has a lot of specials each week, and some (eg. Mersey Valley) seem to be on continuous special. I try to select the best special of each type from each supermarket.   BabyBel, Laughing Cow and Philly cream cheese would always be selected if on special. I would also try to include shredded parmesan and mozzarella, feta and halloumi.\n* Chocolate. Lindt and Well Naturally bars and  no sugar choc coated nuts. Noshu chocolate chips are included but note the maltitol.  Always include Avalanche no sugar hot chocolate cans and sticks but note sticks are higher carbs. Avalanche also have unsweetened coffee sticks, but they are much higher carbs but very convenient so include but note, higher carbs. Cacao powder included under this heading.\n* Crackers. Currently (2 varieties only of olinas) and a couple of OB seed ones. Atkins crispbread.\n* Cream, any special of the thicker varieties. Double cream, or Extra dollop. Also include Aunt Betty’s flavoured unrefrigerated pressure pack, as it has very high cream content and very low sugar. Exclude the other refrigerated pressure pack cream (except Tatua which has no sugar from Costco) as their cream content is low and sugar is high. Exclude IGA sweetened Tatua.   Devondale also does a no sugar version in a pressure pack but not in Coles/Woolies.   Coconut cream is also listed here.   Always Ayams if on special.  Others often adulterated or watered down.\n* Dips, all brands have both high and low carb varieties, so always add (check carbs). Pipel seems to be consistanty  low carb.[https://lovepbco.com/the-best-low-carb-ready-made-dips/](https://lovepbco.com/the-best-low-carb-ready-made-dips/)\n* Drinks. Soft drinks/Sports/Energy if no sugar.  There are usually too many to include in the list.  Include Kirks, Waterfords, Schweppes, Diet Rite.   Always include everything of Nexba brand including Kombucha/Switchel/Kefir.  Amplify kombuchas are very low carb.  Other Kombuchas are higher carbs so mark (check carbs) if included.  Include mineral waters with flavours but no sweeteners, eg Frantelle, Mt Franklin, Aqua pura.[https://lovepbco.com/the-best-low-carb-mixers-and-flavoured-sparkling-waters/](https://lovepbco.com/the-best-low-carb-mixers-and-flavoured-sparkling-waters/)\n* Fish. Fresh/canned/frozen. Smoked salmon cutlets and slices. I never include Basa fish or crumbed varieties. 95g tuna a constant special.\n* Flours.  Almond, coconut, hemp, walnut, hazelnut, sesame, flaxseed, LSA, cricket.  Add Psyllium husk and Nutritional yeast flakes  to this group.\n* Ice blocks, No sugar freezies, Natvia Flippos and Coconut Icies from Woolworths, note maltitol.  No sugar Zooper Doopers from Coles not Woolworths which sell the brand but not the “no sugar” variety\n* Ice cream, include Halo Top and Peters no sugar (add check carbs) as both are higher than Denada. Coles sell Denada. IGA have low carb also but it is never on special. [https://lovepbco.com/the-best-low-carb-ice-cream-in-supermarkets/](https://lovepbco.com/the-best-low-carb-ice-cream-in-supermarkets/)\n* Jams. Natvia no sugar, currently only in Woolies. Others in health food stores. In Tasmania some supermarkets have Hawthorn Hilll Farms.\n* Jelly.  No sugar, currently only Aeroplane Lite. IGA and health food stores have another much higher priced vegan brand but not in Coles or Woolworths.\n* Mayonnaise.  Kewpie, Best Foods, Colway, Heinz, Hellmans, Thomy, Celebrate Health - most have minor sugar but are still low carb, if in doubt add (check carbs) Most egg mayonnaise are lower carb. If available always include 100% Olive or Avocado oil types, but currently not in any supermarket .[https://lovepbco.com/the-best-low-carb-mayonnaise/](https://lovepbco.com/the-best-low-carb-mayonnaise/)\n* Meats. Fresh/Canned/Processed such as Kabanas and Salamis. Sausages if carb content known. If not known add (check carbs).  Bacon, preferably the fatty type. eg \"middle rashers\". Hamper tinned corned beef good for making bolognaise.\n* Milks, Unsweetened almond, coconut, macadamia, Like brand (pea based). Include Barista types but add a note that they are higher carb.  Inside Out is considered best.  Many are longlife milks but if refrigerated add a note (fridge)  [https://lovepbco.com/the-best-low-carb-almond-milk/?utm\\_source=PBCo.&utm\\_campaign=126c5c8f09-Almond+Meal+Launch&utm\\_medium=email&utm\\_term=0\\_a754bb8270-126c5c8f09-127620121&mc\\_cid=126c5c8f09&mc\\_eid=36241322eb](https://lovepbco.com/the-best-low-carb-almond-milk/?utm_source=PBCo.&utm_campaign=126c5c8f09-Almond+Meal+Launch&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a754bb8270-126c5c8f09-127620121&mc_cid=126c5c8f09&mc_eid=36241322eb)  Costco is selling \"Original\" Inside Out almond milk, sweetened with Erythritol and Stevia.\n* Noodles and rice.  Konjac only.  Slendier, Changs and Keep it Cleaner. Also, ready meals and soup including them eg Hart and Soul Pho.\n* Nut/seed butters. Peanut butters Pics, Mayvers, Bega Purely nutz, Simply nuts, no added sugar varieties. Tahini also if on special. Aldi and Coles have \"no sugar\" varieties.\n* Nuts.  Macadamia, Brazil, Pecan, Almonds, Walnuts. Flavoured nuts normally under snacks.\n* Oils.  Extra virgin, olive, coconut (solid and liquid), avocado, sesame and macadamia.  Australian rates higher than imports for freshness by CHOICE. Include powdered MCT\n* Pasta  Specialty low carb pastas eg. Slendier, Atkins, Hermann Brot (at IGA) [https://lovepbco.com/the-best-low-carb-noodles/](https://lovepbco.com/the-best-low-carb-noodles/)\n* Protein bars. Quest bars and cookies as they have no maltitol.  If a brand is low carb but contains some maltitol include it with a (maltitol) comment.. All Aussie Bodies and Atkins bars have some maltitol, and yet they are frequent specials and are reasonably low in carbs (before addition of maltitol carbs)\n* Protein powders, whey and pea unflavoured. eg. Planet from Coles\n* Sauces.  Leggos Providore chili is the lowest carb (not the other flavours) Include also Passata, Val Verde, Essentials, Capriccio and other brands usually under 4gm/100.  Some brands are around 8gm which is strange as there should be nothing but tomato and salt. Include Pete Evans range of simmer sauces and Celebrate Health sauces.[https://lovepbco.com/the-best-low-carb-stir-through-pasta-sauce/](https://lovepbco.com/the-best-low-carb-stir-through-pasta-sauce/)\n* Sauerkraut, refrigerated  if lower carb and not canned.\n* Seeds. Pepita, sunflower, sesame, hemp, flaxseed, chia\n* Snacks. Always Fresh cheese crisps, Pork crackling, Olives, Some pickles and cheese stuffed peppers.  Flavoured black beans, seaweed  and pepitas by Connect Foods. \n* Stocks (bone broth)  Avoid those labelled Style (eg chicken style) they are not real stock. Coles own brand Pho/Ramen is lower carb. Campbells bone broth included but quite expensive.\n* Sweeteners.  Include only Erythritol Stevia (eg Natvia), Monk fruit stevia ( 2 brands incl Lakanto), and Stevia.  Supermarkets don't sell Xylitol.\n* Syrups. Sugar free ones currently the three Queen maple syrup varieties (note have sorbitol)  Also Natvia two varieties, Salted caramel and Chocolate.  Note many vanilla extracts contain sugar.\n* Teas. Assume used as cold water flavouring, so Twinings Infuse, Red Seal, and Tetley cold teas. Liptonsa now have one also.  Twinings 10 pack flavours when on a good special.\n* Vegetables.  Frozen lower carb varieties.  Always include cauliflower and broccoli rice.\n* Yoghurt.  Full fat versions, plain or Greek.  Fruit flavoured without sugar added, usually only Chobani Fit, Danone YoPro. Coconut (depending on carb content) Coyo, Nakula, Coles organic, Nudi but Aldi is best. .

    "body": "So its summertime in the USA and in the West it gets hotter than hell, I love ice cream and could eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner.  Recently discovered that Menchies Frozen Yogurt sells a low carb option, and it tastes DELICIOUS!!!!\n\nThey have locations all across America and some international spots, you can see if one is near you here:\n\nhttp://www.menchies.com/yogurt-shop-our-locations\n\nThey have 18 different low carb flavors, the one at my store in Las Vegas has one out at a time and seems to rotate in a new one every week.  Here is the list of low carb flavors:\n\nhttp://www.menchies.com/frozen-yogurt-flavors#low-carb\n\nIf you click on a flavor you get the nutritional info, the low carb ones are almost all 11g of carbs, of which 3g are sugar, 3g are sugar alcohols, and 3g of fiber.  Most keto'ers would put that at 5g of net carbs since the sugar alcohol is erythritol (not maltitol, thank god!).  Each serving is 1/2 a cup, which really is more than enough.\n\nI've tried the coffee and butterscotch low carb flavors and they are absolutely delicious.  I'm taking my family every weekend after girls soccer for a treat, they have a ton of flavors for everyone else and I get a keto treat!\n\nI think all the toppings are not keto friendly, not sure about the sugar free hot fudge topping though.  I've had it two weeks now and no problems kicking me out of keto, so its a delicious weekly treat for me now!\n\nHere's a picture from someone elses blog so you can see what it looks like:\n\nhttp://www.poormansatkins.com/uploads/6/1/7/0/6170998/9890843_orig.jpg",

It was in a regular cookbook my mom had and I just swapped out the sugar with sucralose liquid.\n\n-heavy whipping cream frozen into an ice cube tray (you control the amount you want to spend on calories. you can cut this with coconut milk as well)\n\n-1/4 to 1/2 cup berries (I like blackberries)\n\n-sweetener to taste\n\n\nBlend the above in a food processor until it's nice and creamy.  A nice way to bulk it up for more volume/less calories is to use a full-fat, sugar free greek yogurt also pre-frozen.  You can add it to the cream or just use it by itself for a frozen yogurt.  \n\n\nLast summer I'd add a scoop of WPI as well if I was low on my protein for the day.  Really easy ice cream that's super indulgent so a little goes a long way and it's free of the chemical taste ArcticZero stuff left in my mouth.",

What was out there, well, it sucked and could barely be called food, and was stupid expensive when you did find it. And there weren't as many good recipes for alternatives to carby food, unless you wanted a cheese stuffed bacon weave. Now that it's the hot new fad diet, which I didn't even realize until a month or so into Attempt 2, it's waaay easier. I make my own donuts, cookies, and thanks to the availability of Allulose, caramel bars and ice cream that are just as good as the \"real thing\", and so on and so forth. I get zero carb bread and bagels online and enjoy sandwiches and french toast plates, low carb candy that *isn't* maltitol powered, there are better low carb tortillas now, biltong at aldi, that new pizza at Blaze, lilly's chocolate at the local stores, carbmaster products at kroger, just lots of ways to make it sustainable.\n\nI'm almost 100 pounds down from my highest in 2018, and have almost as far again to go, but I know that if I keep calm and keto on I will reach my goals.",

Note their shake mix and RTDs are maltitol free.\n\n*\"The range is different in Australia because where possible, we try and make the bars locally and support the local businesses. We also do research on what flavour profiles are liked in Australia and these are different to the USA. Please note our shake mix and RTD’s have no maltitol.* ***And there is a lot of local low sugar bars made without maltitol too so you have lots of options***\\*. Or you are welcome to buy the USA Atkins bars from iherb if that is what you prefer. The good news is that you can live a low carb lifestyle without any of our products - its up to each individual to create a meal plan that works best for you.  We understand that some people prefer not to consume maltitol and that's absolutely fine. Our aim is to help people have a snack / treat option without high amounts of sugar and carbs so people live a more healthier lifestyle. \"\\*\n\nSo I checked every protein bar available on Atkins Australia pages and ALL CONTAIN MALTITOL in various amounts.

However \" **there is some work going on behind the scenes to remove this ingredient so keep an eye out for some new ‘keto – friendly’ products in the near future.\"**\n\nThe company that makes Aussie Bodies also manufactures for some other brands so maybe they may remove maltitol from some of the other brands also.

And surprise surprise, they fit, and fit well! I was shocked and happy. I took my third round of measurements and was so surprised by all of it. I have lost weight in my hips and my face (didn't take measurements for that, haha) and most noticeably for me, my stomach. \n\nWell, bliss didn't last too long. Monday I was scheduled to switch up my birth control for reasons that are another thing entirely. So I decided to go with the lovely arm implant that has worked for me before. Well, today is Wednesday, and ever since the implant, I feel bloated and disgusting. The scale hasn't moved hardly at all but I just feel my stomach is bigger again. I'm guessing its just my hormones fluctuating (again...) and it will go back to normal soon. I'm just hoping this passes because I want to be able to look cute in my clothes again.\n\nOn another note, I just realized a lot of the snacks I had been eating have maltitol in them. Worse than that, it is the first ingredient. Between that, feeling lousy from the hormones and just being generally busy with life, I know I need to quit eating things I probably shouldn't be eating. Or eat them more in moderation. This post is also acting as accountability for me as well. Note to self: Don't eat things with maltitol! And read labels, even if your s.o. says it is fine.\n\nSo I'm just going to KCKO!",

It's taken longer than we wanted but we're finally ready to kick this thing off. \n\nOver the past few months we've been researching product, contacting suppliers, deciding what should be in the box and what shouldn't. We've had many discussions with /r/keto'ers over these topics.\n\nA couple of days ago the /r/keto facebook group mentioned us and it brought up an interesting discussion. I thought I should post it here so that we could get more feedback from the Keto community as a whole\n\nHere is the message I posted on that group. I would love to hear some more feedback from you guys about the questions I propose in this message.\n\nFrom /r/keto facebook:\n\n────────\n\nHi guys!\n\nI'm one of the co-founders of Keto Krate.\n\nFirst of all, what the hell!? I didn't know an /r/keto Facebook group existed. I'm both happy to have found it now and sad to have missed out on it for so long. And also suspicious of all of you for keeping it a secret :p\n\nI noticed you guys had a little discussion about us yesterday and I wanted to make myself available to answer any questions you might have.\n\nI see that the topic of price came up and that we haven't done a very good job at all of providing information about that.\n\nTruth is, although we are tentatively set on a number in the mid $30 range we haven't set anything into stone yet (which is probably a reason the information on our site is lacking)\n\nI would say that many of the specifics of the box itself are still open to community discussion and input.\n\nI'm a /r/keto'er through and through and Scott and I are building this thing for you guys. We would love to have a discussion about price, contents, etc.\n\nSo let's talk.\n\nTo be honest I know that a mid $30 price is high. In choosing a price point we considered all options--from $75 which some boutique subscription boxes are doing, down to $11-$17 like graze and conscious box.\n\nWe are of course concerned with making sure that as many Keto'ers can afford the box as possible--but we are even more concerned with making sure that the subscription itself is a high quality experience.\n\nI've tried a couple of the low end subscription boxes and was quite underwhelmed. They felt exactly like what you would expect--pump and dump.\n\nThe only way companies with that price point make a fair profit is by selling massive amounts of subscriptions--tens to hundreds of thousands of subscribers. Each one just a drop in the bucket.\n\nThe idea of that model is exactly opposed to what I think about when I think of the Keto community. To me, there is no diet community (or otherwise for that matter) that even holds a candle to the Keto community in terms of sharing, togetherness and passion. One of the treats of my day are the many discussions I have with fellow Keto'ers. Where else do you see two people talking so joyfully about a diet?!\n\nWe're interested in starting small, focusing on the community and making being part of Keto Krate more like a fun club than a big dreary city. That's why we're starting with only 200 subscriptions.\n\nI suppose we could entertain the idea of a $25 price point. Our initial plan with Keto Krate was to treat it both as a novelty service such that we're helping people discover new low carb products but also as a supply service such that we keep you stocked up with useful Keto snacks like artisan jerky and various nuts and seeds.\n\nIf we bumped the price down to $25 we would probably have to drop the 'supply' of dried meats, nuts and seeds and focus on the novelty aspect.\n\nWhile we're on the topic of box contents is there anything you guys would specifically like to see in the box? Anything that you definitely don't want to see in the box? As it stands right now the only ingredient that is banned from the box is Maltitol. (Because fuck Maltitol)\n\nWe've also banned a couple products/suppliers (like Julian Bakery) due to selling products which raise blood sugar levels when they claim not to.\n\nOne aspect of the box we're really looking forward to working on is the information in the box. Keto Krate isn't just going to be a box of products. Along with any useful information I can muster we're also partnering with experts in the niche to provide exclusive recipes, wisdom and advice, useful tips, etc.\n\nWe're also very open to any ideas the community has for ways to make Keto Krate more valuable above and beyond the products inside. The other day someone suggested that we find a newly minted convert to the Keto diet and create an ongoing case study to follow in the box. What a great idea! (we'll be auditioning soon :D)\n\nOk enough of my rambling. I want to hear from you guys.\n\nReally looking forward to hearing from everyone and thanks for taking the time to read.\n\nJordan\n\n────────\n\nAs the message says although we have tentative pricing chosen we're still open to discussion over pricing and what should/shouldn't be in the box.\n\nI'd love to hear some thoughts from you guys!\n\nAlso, we're giving away a free year subscription. Quite frankly we want an /r/keto'er or /r/xxketo'er to win. Enter the contest here: https://gleam.io/zrD4o/push-to-200 \n\nThanks for reading.",

    "body": "I have done it! Well, not quite. But I have \"managed\" to stay on keto for a month. It has not really been much of a challenge since I do like the food and dont miss too much from my old diet (Except maybe onion.. Fried onion was my jam).\n\nI started out at 128kg (282 lbs) and am currently 120.8kg (266 lbs) which means I lost 7.2kg (about 16 lbs) over the course of this month. Now I want to go over the pitfalls and challenges of my month as a bit of a retrospective.\n\nWhen I started I remember thinking I couldnt possibly go on keto due to the costs involved. Eating meat for every meal? No way! However I found that if I factor in all the candy I do not buy, and all the fast food and carby stuff I skip then keot really is the cheaper option by quite a significant degree.\n\nMy wife has been a huge support over the course of the month, even tho initially she presented a slight challenge by counting out a lot of food that I could not eat. \"How about we eat this? No wait, that has bread, you cant eat that!\". I got over it pretty quick but it was hard at first. I actually got a bit guilty over going for keto since it also restricted what she would eat much of the time. But she has assured me that it is fine and she enjoyes the difference in diet. She has much of the same food as me but has different sides than me and cooks her portion in oil while I cook in butter.\n\nSnacks! They represented a giant hurdle. I am a huge snacker so at first during the evenings I almost felt like I would if I was quitting smoking. I needed something to hold in my hands and nibble at. At first I went for the classic beef jerky, but I found that a lot of beef jerky around here does in fact contain some amounts of sugar. So just to be safe I am skipping that. Twice this month I made keto caramels, but to save a bit of money I bought a cheaper no-sugar syrup for it. I found out later that it contains maltitol. so that is banned from my house now. The second mistake I made was that I thought I had found the perfect steak sauce \"Jack daniels steak sauce\". However the carb count was way off on the sauce as it had a serving size of one tablespoon. So that one is banned as well. Nowadays if I even need sauce I go for some cream sauce like bernaise.\n\nFatbombs! I found these just in the past couple of days. They will be my saving grace when I get cravings. Awesome stuff. Just gotta mind the carbs (6g in a 150g batch which lasts for a few days.. yes pleaase!)\n\nBread! I have made various attempts at making bread. At first I made a 90 second version which came out all spongy and not bread like at all. But since I have found two recipes, one which makes bread buns which I can butter and taste good, and the second is a type of breadsticks which I have as a side with other food. I think these have helped me get over the worst cravings.\n\nToday I feel great. I have much more energy, some old hobby projects of mine which I had been to tired in the evenings to continue have been rebooted and I sleep better than before.\n\nReddit! I have had lots of help here. Both from reading posts from you guys and the reddit chat. I'd recommend you pop in there and say hi.\n\n10/10, would keto again (and will, aint gonna stop any time soon).\n\nKCKO",

    "body": "Hello friends,\n\nI’m here to talk to you today about a subject very close to my heart - sweets.  Warning: this post contains mention of artificial sweeteners.  If the mere mention of sorbitol makes you fart, please move along, this post is not the place for you.\n\nSo today I was aimlessly wandering through Big W, taking in the wide range of.. stuff.  As I usually do, I took a walk through the lolly aisle to visit the Best Chocolate Ever (Whitman’s Peanut Butter Block), then took a quick look at the sugar free lollies, hoping for something other than the usual Double D’s.\n\nWhat’s this??\n\nThere, on the rack above the gummi bears and strangely textured marshmallows, I found a previously uncharted sweet selection! Enter ‘Whitman’s No Added Sugar’ range!\n\nOn display were 6 or so bags of individually wrapped treats.  After great deliberation, I narrowed my selection down to 3 chocolate coated confections - mint patties in dark chocolate, pecan crowns in milk chocolate, and coconut in milk chocolate.\n\nAs I was buying them, I thought to myself ‘I’m probably going to scoff all these, then spend the afternoon marvelling at my inflating belly and the evening farting like a trombone’.  Although all three packages say ‘made with stevia extract’, all three nutrition panels list sorbitol, maltitol, or both.\n\nPurely for science’s sake, I tried one of each in the car.  I did not expect much.  I’ve been let down before.\n\nWhat a treat!!\n\n‘One Serve’ varied between one and two individually wrapped chocolates, but each single wrapped treat was a nice size for a sweet fix, so the numbers I quote will all relate to a single item.\n\nOf the three, my least favourite was the pecan crown.  That’s not to say it was bad, just that I think pecans are... all right, so (funnily enough) the pecan chocolate was.. all right.  \n\nA bit bigger than a 50c coin, nice milk chocolate on the outside (not hard and crumbly, tasted like actual chocolate that melts in your mouth) surrounded a chewy caramel centre with chopped pecans.  Each chocolate comes in at 68 calories, with 1g of protein, 5.6g of fat (2.7g saturated), and 0.5g of net carbs (0.3g sugars, 1g dietary fibre).  With 7g of maltitol, excessive consumption may cause a laxative effect.\n\nIt’s really a tie as to which of the other two were better - they were both great!  The choc coconut one was maybe a little bigger than the bounty you’d get in a tub of Celebrations.  Again, good, real chocolate, and the coconut filling tasted just like a bounty - I always worry that sugar-free things are going to be overly sweet, but this was not the case.  I like to freeze bounties and cherry ripes, and I think this would be 100% amazeballs frozen.  One chocolate comes in at 59 calories, with 0.5g of protein, 3.2g of fat (2.4g saturated), and 0.8g of net carbs (0.2g sugars, 0.6g dietary fibre).  With 7.3g of maltitol and 1g of sorbitol, excessive consumption may cause a laxative effect.\n\nLastly, the mint patties.  Slightly smaller than the pecan crown, these were somewhere between a 20c and a 50c coin in size.  These were the only dark chocolate one I got, and that dark chocolate packs a punch! The package says it contains 53% cocoa solids, but maybe because of the no sugar it tasted to me like more.  Like the coconut, the mint centre didn’t taste over-sweetened, and it had a good strong mint flavour.  One patty comes in at 68 calories, with 0.6g of protein, 4g of fat (3g saturated), and 0.5g of net carbs (0.03g of sugar, 0.6g of dietary fibre.  With 7.7g of maltitol and 0.6g of sorbitol, excessive consumption may cause a laxative effect.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I thought I was going to come home craving more, gobble too many and end up a human bagpipe, but I have zero cravings for more - what I had was satisfying.  Particularly in the case of the mint patty, I don’t think I COULD pig out on them!\n\nSo there you have it! I found new sweets, and they tasted great and zapped my craving! Do yourself a favour if you’re around Big Dub and give them a try!",

Foods are not required to be free from FODMAPs – small amounts are suitable, as has been proven in various scientific studies about FODMAPs. Whilst honey has more fructose in it than glucose, ie. it has the FODMAP “excess fructose”, the amount of honey present in the food has not impacted on the final laboratory analysis.  That is, all the ingredients together produce a product that has more glucose than fructose and so the final product is low in FODMAPs.\"\n\n\nAlso, here they say they do test for fructans:\n\n\"FODMAP Friendly certification means products have been tested for fructan levels, and if a product has the FODMAP Friendly logo, this means the fructan content per serve is suitable for people on the low FODMAP diet.\"\n\nhttp://fodmapfriendly.com/faqs/",

Other soothing, anti-inflammatory extracts make an appearance here, as well as ceramides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7f77tcs8ku31.jpg?width=280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd7d7db952d0ec115a2a39a569a337f661ac0789\n\n6. **Idebenone Firming Ampoule - 32ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Rosa Canina (Dog-Rose) Fruit Extract, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydroxydecyl Ubiquinone, Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Adenosine, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Human Oligopeptide-1, rh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Acetly Hexapeptide-8, Copper Tripeptide-1, Ethyhexylglycerin.*\n\nIdebenone is the synthetic version of the powerful antioxidant, CoQ10/ubiquinone. CoQ10 molecules are really big though, so it has trouble penetrating. Idebenone has smaller molecules so it can do the job better. I heard that the patent on idebenone ended recently, so maybe we can see more of this goodie in future products. There are also peptides in this ampoule, as well as some soothing & firming ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdnxp8cu8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72616b051ce0532bd51287099a4e28de9871ec0f\n\n7. **Green Tea Peeling Gel - 120ml/4,800 Won ($4.09)**\n\n*Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water(10%), Glycerin, Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Betaine,Beta-Glucan, Arginine, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Allantoin, Sodium Polyglutamate, Carbomer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Hydroxide, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil.*\n\nThis is wildly popular, being so affordable. It's a nice, basic peeling gel. Fragranced with lavender essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cvgwgvv8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b79356fcf60cdd09f5435cd76817e90c5f036c1\n\n8. **Jojoba Lip Essence \\[Original Moisture\\] - 13ml/3,800 Won ($3.23)**\n\n*Polyisobutene, Petrolatum, Diisostearyl Malate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Microcrystalline Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Royal Jelly Extract, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Tocopheryl Acetate*\n\nThis lil' lip balm has been #1 on the Hwahae app for a while now. Which surprises me, personally, as the Korean skincare community is going through a major \"EWG is best source/natural is better\" moment right now. But hey, I guess if it works, it works. Fragranced with orange essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz9arxe39ku31.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff34a25e8bccfe68e01a8ccc85e304df7b1b0826\n\n9. **Saccharo Ferment Therapy Essence - 60ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Saccharomyces/Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Allantoin, Human Oligopeptide-1, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Water.*\n\nI think some of Missha fermented products use Saccharomyces. Whenever you see a ferment ingredient/whatever extract, that means that plant has been fermented to make the nutrients in it more bioavailable for us. Supposedly the fermentation process releases lots more goodies than just using the extract alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/myfq67u59ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecfc805f707759f790b86d6dd65460379b6c9674\n\n10. **Saccharo Ferment Sparkle First Ampoule - 100ml/49,000 Won ($41.70)**\n\n*Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Polyglutamic Acid, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract.*\n\nGalactomyces = SK-II, Bifida = Estee Lauder, though which strains are trade secret or something. A very simple ampoule with ferments, a humectant and some plant extracts. They do have a cream version as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0w9k8ta9ku31.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41a8cd57bde651c10bf016cd3d6cea4a2799e937\n\n11. **Saccharo Essential Mist - 60ml/18,000 Won ($15.32)**\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Beta-Glucan, Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin, Paeonia Suffructicosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6471tkd9ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5903dcfdcc876d4365879230722e61b4da4c2130\n\n12. **Honey Peptide Mist - 60ml/8,600 Won ($7.32)**\n\n*Honey Extract, Water, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Stem Extract, Glycerin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sorbitol, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Beta-Glucan, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Caffeoyl Tripeptide-1, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Butylene Glycol, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allantoin, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.*\n\nA watery, soothing mist with honey, propolis, royal jelly, collagen and peptides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfoo0nzf9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b834384913e4a2a6161fb10bfeed8aeeee4e647\n\n13. **The Calming Essence - 50ml/18,600 Won ($15.83)**\n\nArtemisia Capillaris (Mugwort - Capillary Wormwood) Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Arginine, Cabomer, Pantolactone, Xanthan Gum, 1,2-Hexanediol.\n\nA very simple, soothing mugwort, panthenol, allantoin, and licorice root essence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0fj8zdi9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=915ee84ef3cb6c1dec999de951abe84a8b268783\n\n14. **Dr. Troub Bio Repair Powder Cleanser - 60g/15,600 Won ($13.27)**\n\n*Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Disodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Sobitol, Cellulose Gum, Scutellaria Bicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Artemisia Princeps (Mugwort - Korean Mugwort/Korean Wormwood) Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Citrus Junos Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Human Oligopeptide-1, Acetyl hexapeptide-8, Copper Tripeptide-1, Citric Acid, Arbutin, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower/Leaf Extract, Allantoin.*\n\n\\[Second cleanser\\] An SLS-free powder foaming wash. The surfactants in this (Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate & Disodium Lauroyl glutamate) are extremely gentle surfactants often used for cleansers targeted toward babies and sensitive skin. They're more expensive but provide a bunch of non-stripping foam. We see a lot more of these sort of surfactants in recent years because of the bad rep Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate have gotten, which are used widely because of their cheap cost (whether they are gentle or not depends on the formula and what other surfactants they have been mixed with).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8jz1gqk9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1943c1bb896d85a41596a26febcc48e6a47a684\n\n15. **Dr. Troub Skin Returning Cleansing Milk - 200ml/13,600 Won ($11.57)**\n\n*Water, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Decyl Glucoside, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Diheptyl Succinate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Milk Protein Extract, Allantoin, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n\\[First Cleanser\\] This is a popular cleansing milk that you use like you use an oil cleanser (rub into dry face with dry hands). to remove sunscreen and makeup. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1w3vw2xp9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b0abeef20e0d4ee0787e6101c376d2e70fbb4c3\n\n16. **Galatokside Real Peptide Barrier Moisture Soo Boon Cream - 50ml/29,800 won ($25.36)**\n\n*Copper Tripeptide-1, Glactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Paeonia Suffructicosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Betaine, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Sucrose, Fructose, Glucose, Polyglutamic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium PCA, Beta-Glucan, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Tocopherol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Adenosine, Arginine, 1,2-Hexanediol.* \n\nA nice, soothing cream with tons of humectants/peptides, and centella components. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3ur5mms9ku31.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=480295636783722d34de21a551c16f1fd5a2c4d5\n\n17. **Madagascar Centella Skin - 150ml/14,800 Won ($12.59)**\n\n*Centella Asiatica Extract(97%), Butylene Glycol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol.* \n\nRemember that toners are referred to as \"Skin\" in Korea (Japan = lotion).

I thought there would be more ferments in this, given the name, but I guess not. Thermal water does have a light soothing effect/deposit minerals onto your skin. I thought it was just boring water in a can too, but Labmuffin has a post on it; It's interesting. Korean Pasque Flower is called \"Hal-mi-Kkhot\" meaning \"granny flower\", lol.

Maybe if you just take regular sugar free jelly and then add a whonk of agar agar or something into it you'd get the same consistency?

SCAMMERS ARE TO BE EXPECTED, SO TAKE PRECAUTIONS.**\n\nI've always wanted to do an exchange on /r/snackexchange, but as a diabetic and now a ketoer, I struggle with the amount of carby, sweet snacks that people receive. I'd love to do an exchange where I just get keto-friendly snacks and brighten up someone's day with a nice box of treats! So, would anyone be interested?\n\nI'm in the UK, and I'm thinking about a limit of about $25USD (not including postage) for the first exchange. I'd like to trade with someone from a different country, preferably the EU due to postage costs. I have no allergies so everything, as long as it's low-carb, is good!\n\nThe deal: we agree to send eachother packages. If either of us has any specific requests, we'll negotiate them, as well as a postage date and a total package cost. We'll trade addresses and go ahead :D\n\nIf you're interested in an exchange but would like different terms, post here with your location and preferences and maybe you can find a partner to trade with.\n\n**EDIT:** So, how are we going to do this? Do you guys want to make your own matches, or shall I match everyone up and pm you?\n\n**EDIT 2:** Okay, here's what's gonna happen. I'll leave the sign-up open until Midnight PST tonight, and then I'll pair people up and pm everyone their matches.

    "body": "Long post ahead, sorry in advance :o If more info needed, I'll add it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n28 Female, 59.5kg (\\~130 pounds), 168 cm (5'6), BF 21.4% (measured with machine at the gym so idk if accurate), doing Keto 8 months.I'm sedentary, I don't work or go out of the house. On a normal day I hit maybe 500 steps. On gym days it's around 3-4k (I have a 15min walk to the gym).\n\nHighest weight ever: 110kg, lowest ever: 49.5kg (after chemo, would not rec. I'm all good now though). Tons of loose skin. Not much muscle yet (been going to gym for the last 9 weeks, newbie gains), weight lifting 4x a week (lb/ub, rest, lb/ub, rest, rest  and then repeat). I wasn't going out of the house before then, I had lost all muscle and fat when I hit my lowest (I would have been lighter but I was a sack of loose skin at that point), then I gained to around 68kg in few months, dieted, been maintaining around 59 kg for the last 12 weeks or so.\n\nI eat around 2000-2300 kcal a day (2300 on gym days), and I have no trouble maintaining on that intake (which is weird af, calc says I should maintain on 1500).\n\nI try to eat at least 110g protein a day, I stay under 20 net carbs (most days from veggies. 1-3 a week I'll bake something or have a quest bar), and the rest of kcal is fat (around 170-180g) and extra protein (sometimes I hit 130g protein and lower fat etc). I eat intuitively but same things in same amounts most of the days (I have already portioned frozen stuff, for example 200g of chicken or ground beef patties each same weight etc) and when I counted various days in the last 12 weeks they've been always 2000+ kcal. In the beginning I used a scale and calculated every gram (I'm from Europe) and after months I can do it by eye. I'm not saying I know EXACTLY how much kcal I eat everyday but I'm consistent when it comes to quantity and I also don't skip on tahini or sauces or fat and never go 'oh, I shouldn't add that butter' or anything, I've been maintaining and feeling great so I think I'm doing good. Also, I know 200g of turkey will be less kcal than 200g of bacon. I adjust that kind of stuff.I also do spontaneous check ups (I weight everything during the day and calculate it at the end of the day) and I also come up above 2000+ kcal. I have background in maths so no problems with calculating lol. I do feel warm after eating and throughout the day, I also checked my thyroid and did some blood tests, everything is fine.\n\nThings I eat: any meats (chicken, ground beef, pork, lamb, fish, shrimp etc) excl organs, wurst, cheese, eggs (slightly allergic but ehh I like them), nuts, nut butters, veggies (avocado, brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, bell pepper (small quantity), spinach, kale, etc I stay under net carbs tho), berries, ghee, butter, fat, whipped cream (lots but keep in under net carb) almond milk, almond yogurt, protein powders (isolate), flax seeds, chia seeds,sporadically: baked goods (made by myself with erythritol/stevia) /quest bars/mascarpone protein cubes/keto ice-cream (only with erythritol, no imo or maltitol).\n\nI do IF between 16/8 and 20/4 (I don't get hungry till like 2-3 pm). I did omad in the beginning but I would obsess about the food and my digestion suffered so now I have two big meals and something sweet in between (usually protein powder + yogurt + something like flax/chia/hemp seeds + nuts).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGym: (I do 3 sets of 12 reps, with 4th one till failure, 4x a week (lb, ub, rest, lb, ub, rest, rest  and then repeat)\n\nLB: Incline leg press: 50kg, leg curl: 20kg, abductor: 35kg, adductor: 45 kg, squat with bar: 10-14kg (working on the form), squats with kettle bell 12kg, sumo squat with kettle bell 12kg.\n\nI try to not work on my quads atm because... my form on incline leg press was bad in first weeks and lets just say my quads are my most defined muscles =\\_\\_=.\n\nUB: dumbbell bicep curl: 6-9kg, cable triceps extension: 5-7,5kg (working on it!!!), incline dumbbell shoulder press: 6kg, chest press machine: 12.5 kg, lat pulldown: 20-25kg, seated row: 20kg (I get 'feel good' shivers when doing this one), lower back machine: 10-15kg (need to do this one, my lower back is quite weak there and I see a HUGE change!).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI upped my weights and this is how much I can do after 9 weeks (I couldn't do 2kg bicep curl so yeah...), I'm not gonna do progressive overload atm.\n\nMy questions are a bit complicated - I eat over 2k and maintain, I don't do any cardio, I spend around 1,5h in gym lifting weights (atm muscles get really warm during workout and I try to work on my form rather than the weight amount. I do get some sore muscle next day etc but it's not as bad as it was in the beginning) and in the future I want to concentrate on lifting but... I've been thinking a lot about losing a bit more weight now.\n\nBecause of my loose skin I thought to first fill it out with muscle and that newbie gains helped a lot with how I look now but I still feel like losing some weight before fully committing to gaining muscle.\n\nI don't feel comfortable at this weight and I can lose it no problem - but I also don't wanna lose my newbie muscle gains. So, I do wanna continue with my lifting program without increasing weight (I wanna work on form and getting used to lifting I guess?) and I don't mind not progressing with lifting atm and staying where I am, I don't wanna stress about progressive overload, I wanna do it because it's really fun and I like it and even if I won't lift more weight when doing bicep curl for the next idk 3 months I won't see it as failure - I'm not looking for shortcuts and I wanna make lifting a part of my life.\n\nThe thing is... I suck at cardio. The only thing I'm good at is walking, I can do 5,5km/h on 5% incline and I can walk for 4h and not even be out of breath. I like walking but it takes time and I don't wanna spend 10h on 'slow' cardio. I suck at running tho. I would rather not bike, I don't like it.\n\nElliptic makes me die after 2 mins (wouldn't mind it tho, it means it's working I guess?). Steps machine feels like something for an M's but I might give it another try. I like rowing machine though, even when I do it hard - I kinda close my eyes and imagine I'm at the lake and stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, few questions:\n\n\\- can I keep lifting (and not progressing) when trying to concentrate on losing weight? or should I prioritize cardio? which should I do first? cardio or lifting? (I think lift first then cardio but...)\n\n\\- how much cardio should I add? concentrate on one type I like or pick two or three and change them every week? any recs? how much minutes x week?\n\n\\- I've heard of HIIT but my endurance REALLY sucks. imagine a newbie... and then like 10x worse. I don't think I'm there yet\n\n\\- I DON'T MIND STARTING SLOWLY! Everyone is always 'progressive overload!', 'push yourself everyday!', 'do it till you drop dead!' etc but it is something I want to make a habit of which means I wanna do it with a proper form and not hate it from the start (which would make me quit, probably). I like seeing and feeling progress and I don't have problems with pushing myself but I don't want to come to hate the exercise. slow and steady wins the race?\n\n\\- FOOD: so, a big one, idk what to do here exactly. I'm maintaining at higher kcal than I should be and I don't want to lower my metabolism. When I calculate 20% deficit on ketogains calc I come up with 1214 kcal (103P/20C/80F, with F to satiety I guess? and not a goal?) but that would be almost 1k lower than now. I don't want my body to adapt because at my lowest when I had no appetite I went as low as eating 500-700 kcal and I would gain at 800 kcal (and was sickly cold and just sick... but that's chemo).\n\nI saw an option of setting my TDEE manually on the calc. Should I set it to 2k? Then the 20% deficit comes up with 1600 kcal with 103P/20C/123F. Should I strive to eat at 123g of fat? And try to not go lower?At the moment I eat around 170-180g of fat.I really like how now, I can eat more and maintain and I don't wanna fck it up :/ Of course, I know with weight loss my bmr will go down etc and with less weight I'll eat less but I still wanna maintain that higher metabolism I guess? (idk if I'm explaining it well).  \n\n\nI also don't wanna lean bulk. Would be too much for me. Simple things are easier. I don't have a problem with tracking food macros again, got chronometer. \n\nEdit: Oh, and my electrolytes are okay :) Ketoaid and lots of no-salt/salt and magnesium citrate supplements  :) Supplement  I take every day: multivitamin, biotin, omega 3 oil capsule, magnesium citrate, creatine (4g)",

        "body": "I'm no pro, but the ones I follow say all of the same thing. Cardio is not necessary for weightloss. You burn WAAAY more muscle during and after a good lift session. Building muscle will help with some of your loose skin and so will IF. IF will help because of autophagy but I have read that that is reached with a longer than 20:4 fast. But, no studies show solid times and when autophagy happens varies from person to person. \nI think your best bet and from my experience, is that you stick with lifting and check out the macro calculator so you can get the right macros gain muscle. \nAs for lifting, there are tons of women oriented programs on bodybuilding.com and you can def find one that suites your needs. I did Kayla Itstines \"Bikini Body Guide\" and found it challenging and great but I got burned out. Now I'm doing Bret Contreras Strong Curves\n, Which focuses on building up your glutes and he has some upper body sets thrown in each day. It's a 4 day a week program. I really like his because he promotes the style in which you are currently lifting as well as focusing on proper form and activating the muscles you are working in each exercise. That high reps don't matter, that what is important is that you max out and hit failure by the end of your set. That's how you grow and strengthen your muscles. Aka get dat big booty, lol. \n\nHope some of this has helped, congratulations on winning the fight! Best of luck on your journey.",

This has to be a miracle. Surely it's corn syrup or some other dodgy workaround. \n\nI scan the complete ingredients list, Maltitol.. all my dreams have come true, I can eat these as snacks and stay in keto! \n\nI grab 6 odd bags of different Lollies and we head to the cinema. I pound down like, 2 whole bags through the movie.\n\nBy the end of the movie, I feel a bit bloated, nothing too serious, I just brush it off as being normal.\n\nBy the time I get home though, I feel like someone is stabbing me in the stomach. So much pain. I'm feeling like there's something seriously wrong, the gargling noise coming from my stomach is audible from much further than it should be.. \n\nThen the farting starts, and continues, and continues. Not just little pop-offs.. genuine championship winning gas release. For two whole days after eating those devil lollies I felt like i was shitting my pants, and had to take regular toilet breaks from life, because I wasn't sure whether it was just going to be gas, or a surprise at the end. \n\nI learned a lesson those 2.5 days. Maltitol ain't nothing to fuck with.\n\n\nMaltitol - 1\nOP - 0",

Fairly good price despite the somewhat small protein content. \n\nThe caramel chocolate crunch tastes the best initially, but has a stronger artificial sweetener aftertaste (maltitol & sucralose). The bar is fairly dense and the flavor almost has a slight mintiness to it. \n\nThe peanut butter fudge was lighter and slightly more bland. To it's advantage, it didn't have a noticeable artificial sweetener taste. I also didn't taste much peanut butter either though.\n\nOverall, these aren't bad alternatives to the expensive name brand protein bars. They also don't have that funky texture that most protein bars have. I wouldn't consider these particular bars a good meal alternative, but they function as a nice snack as they advertise in the name.",

    "body": "Dirty weird snack-hacks!!\n\nI saw a post like this once and really took the hacks to heart (I love snacking!) and thought to pay it forward. If I feel like bingeing, these are my go-tos:\n\n1. Protein bars (duh) but refrigerated and cut into pieces. It feels as if I am eating a chocolate bar, and the protein lessens my mighty sweet tooth’s powers\n\n2. Whipped cream and fruit, but smaller and full of fat so that it fills me up. I normally put whipping cream in a small mug, use an electric milk foamer to whip it to cream and add sliced up fruits. Makes for a good friggin’ snack _btw whipping cream with IKEA milk foamers is the best trick i ever invented, i can make so little at a time and so quickly_\n\n3. Latte. Sure, sounds weird, but it makes me so full! I make a good one with coffee, foamed milk(super frothy so very filling) and 0-cal sweeteners. I reeeeally enjoy them too\n\n4. Hot chocolate. Just heat milk and cocoa powder, add some sweetener if you like. Not the most calorie-friendly but like the latte it fills my stomach and I drink it warm which is super enjoyable.\n\n5. Protein bars. Again! Because seriously, just try some new ones if you are sick of them - I eat one a day and it feels as if I am eating cake every day. I never eat any ones with added sugars or maltitol, still I find countless good ones. And the protein somehow removes the cravings after a little while.\n\n6. Hummus (love of my life) and low-cal crackers. Super snack and no cutting of veggies involved (haha)\n\n\n\nNot for everyone but maybe something suits you. For me, 150-300kcal snacks are just so much better than my 1000-1500kcal binges so I try to be preventative.\nWhat is your best snack-hack?",

Our chocolate bars don’t spike insulin levels and have extra healthy fats from MCTs (medium-chain triglycerides) for more energy and satiation. We believe it’s all about getting long-lasting energy from fat instead of a quick fix from sugar.\n\nWe sell our products via our online store and (international) resellers. Our clients vary from active keto/low-carb followers, vegans, diabetics and sports enthusiasts. I’ve launched the MVP in February 2018, we’re now making $20.000 revenue per month, and we're still testing and adapting as we go.\n\n[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/003/715/original/open-uri20191118-4-15v6z6v?1574118559)\n\n### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I’ve always been passionate about health, sports, and nutrition. Growing up, my parents owned a health store and were the distributors of mineral water brands from around the world. In our family, talking about health and nutrition is something we do all the time (which can be a little annoying for friends and boyfriends). After I graduated from a Business study program in 2017, I went traveling in South America. One of the many things I did was visit different cacao farms because I just found it so fascinating and wanted to learn more about it.\n\n[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/003/716/original/open-uri20191118-4-m25uos?1574118559)\n\nI was so intrigued by the beauty of cacao and its health benefits. I love dark chocolate but never knew about the tremendous cacao varieties. During this trip, I spent a lot of time reading articles from different doctors in the US who specialize in natural treatments, health, and longevity.\n\nAt this time, I was already eating low-carb, but when I came across the ketogenic lifestyle, it was such an eye-opener for me. Before keto, I was constantly having food cravings, feeling bloated, tired, and my hormones were all over the place. I never understood why. I already ate quite “healthy;\" a lot of fruit and starchy vegetables while keeping fat to a minimum. I was afraid of eating fat, as they are calorie-dense. Back then I believed this would make me gain weight. Well, now I know better.\n\nWhen I first started Keto, I couldn't find an honest high-fat, low carb chocolate bar with MCTs, high cacao content, and simple ingredients. Especially a tasty one. Of course, there’s chocolate made of 100% cacao and nothing else, but the taste is not for everyone because it’s quite bitter. I did some market research and realized it was not just me - there was a huge demand/need for a bar like that in the market. So I thought to myself, “well, let’s just make one!” I had no expertise in chocolate making, let alone starting a business, but I felt I had to take the risk.\n\n### Take us through the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing your first product.\n\nMy process started with market research on what was already out there in terms of low-carb chocolate with natural ingredients. During this research, I learned that if you want your body to absorb all the good nutrients from cacao, like fat, minerals, and antioxidants it should not be mixed with sugar or dairy products. This includes also other natural sweeteners like honey or agave syrup. I didn’t want to use Maltitol (which you’ll find often in bars) because these still spike insulin levels.\n\nThen I came across Erythritol, which is a natural sweetener that has a glycemic index of 0 and doesn’t have a \"medical aftertaste\" like other sweeteners such as stevia.\n\nAt first, my mom joined me in Brazil, and we visited many different chocolate factories. I thought it was important for manufacturing to stay close to the source of the cacao. But even though I’m half Brazilian, there are still a lot of cultural differences to my Dutch roots. I call it the mañana mañana mentality. Not only did I have trouble finding a factory that fit with my style of working, but I also couldn’t find one who had experience in making sugar-free, lactose-free or soy-free chocolate. To top it all off, the MOQs for making the MVP was way too high for me.\n\nSo, I went back to Europe and visited almost every chocolate seminars/fairs I could find. That’s where I met an award-winning chocolatier who believed in my idea, but who was also able to produce small quantities at his factory.  \n\nI was already adding MCTs to coffee and shakes myself, so I knew I wanted to include this in the bars as well, as it’s such a great energy source. There was no chocolate like that in the market back then, so I spent a lot of my time researching the right ingredients and sourcing them.   \n\nI had a small budget, so I had to test the market before producing high quantities. Looking back at this period, I truly believe you have to share your ideas with others cause you never know who can help you.\n\nI personally formulated our first product and worked with the chocolatier to bring it into life. After a lot of testing with flavors, going back and forth from the manufacturer, sharing samples with friends and family, the first formula was approved. It took around three months.\n\n[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/003/717/original/open-uri20191118-4-1ahuhbq?1574118560)\n\nLuckily, I was able to produce a very small batch from a loan I got from my family. This process took another three months. Everything was handmade, and fortunately, I could use existing molds from the factory. The bars were packed in a white flow pack, so at home, together with my mom and friends, I labeled all the packs with stickers (front and back). During this period of R&D, I started working with an intern to get branding and social media-ready before launching. We created an Instagram, a Facebook account, and a landing page to already share the feeling behind the brand and create awareness. It started as a very feminine and a bit rebellious brand. The idea for the business name, Keto Cacao, came quickly as it’s inspired by the Keto lifestyle combined with cacao.\n\n[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/003/718/original/open-uri20191118-4-bw836j?1574118561)\n\n### Describe the process of launching the business.\n\nWe had our MVP launch at the end of February 2018 at a famous chocolate event in Amsterdam called Chocoa Festival. An event for real chocolate aficionados, which was a great way to receive feedback and sell some bars.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZqcsIx9kjI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZqcsIx9kjI)\n\nWe also started selling the bars via a Shopify site (using a free theme), and I asked my family and friends to help me sell at local fairs.\n\nWe sold 12.000 bars in 6 months mainly through organic search and Instagram. Selling at local fairs wasn’t really successful. Most of the time we just got to a break-even point. The whole high-fat, low carb lifestyle is still something quite unknown here in the Netherlands, but the interest is slowly growing.\n\nWhen launching the MVP online, we received several reviews from customers in the  Netherlands and all over the world, as we’re shipping worldwide. Reviews said that KetoCacao really helped with their cravings, surviving long office hours, and so much more.\n\nHowever, we’ve also received feedback that the taste, packaging, and branding were all things that could be improved. We have this memorable moment where I sent the MVP bars to this lovely famous keto couple called Keto Connect, hoping to receive their honest feedback by email.\n\nLittle did I know that their review would be uploaded on [their Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9XZ_f90QYU%26t=604s) (last year among their 400k subscribers now its doubled). It went viral, but they weren’t impressed with the product. That was quite a bummer, but also very motivating as I’ve always seen this first product as an MVP and the more honest and good feedback we get, the better.\n\nIn the end, I want to create the best high-fat snacks. I want people to enjoy their active life eating good food. All the feedback, good and bad, served as extra energy to take back to R&D, improve the product, and, at the same time, rethink the overall strategy. I think being flexible and open to feedback is something that truly helped me along the way.\n\n**The evolution of our labels:**\n\n[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/003/719/original/open-uri20191118-4-137sc6v?1574118561)\n\n*A before and after shot of our packaging.*\n\nThe entire \"back to R&D\" process to improve the taste and texture of the bars and rebuild the brand took longer than expected. I’ve had an “Out of Stock, we’ll be back soon” note on my website for over six months. It was a long period of time, but I needed it to reflect, test new formulas among our early adopters, and have the new designs created for the packaging.\n\nDuring this period, I also worked as a restaurant hostess and privately taught the Dutch language to expats just to earn some extra money. But after many brainstorming sessions together, my freelancer, my father, and I finally fit it all together. We thought it would be better to change the company name to Funky Fat Foods, as the mission is to motivate, empower and inform as many people as possible to eat more healthy fats and skip the sugars. During this process, my father got more involved in the business regarding our strategic planning and logistics. He’s a nomad and travels all year round, however, we talk almost every day by phone to discuss the business. He’s my go-to person.\n\nSince August this year, we’re back again with a completely new site, new packaging, and new improved flavors. Now I work in the business full time from home. I spend most of my time on product development, customer service, and sales. I learn so much, and every day I feel it’s only getting more serious and finally starting to develop into an actual business. Our main sales channel at the moment is through our (online) resellers. We can’t thank them enough for their trust. Some of our online resellers have been with us since we launched our MVP, so it’s amazing to see their belief in us.\n\n### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?\n\nAlthough we were not selling for 6 months after our MVP, we still kept our site up to date with blog articles, monthly newsletters, and personal Instagram stories. We’re consumer-focused and take care of our customers as quickly and correctly as possible.\n\nI’ve tried Facebook ads and Instagram ads, although we saw an increase in traffic or likes, there were not many sales. I’m learning more about this at the moment.\n\nI believe what is also working for us, is our customer service and the relationships we have created with them. Even today we see huge support from Instagram, as you can talk directly to your (potential) customers all over the world. Basically, just ask them what kind of content they’re interested in, and always reply to their questions.\n\nWe’ve recently started sharing our struggles and learnings via IG stories and see a growth in our engagement. We try to stay in as much contact with our followers as possible and strive to create good and engaging content through social media. As a result, we have been steadily growing our follower base organically.\n\nWe also run contests on Instagram in collaboration with other brands and send our bars to micro-influencers, which really help to increase awareness of the brand but there is still a lot of room to grow in this area.\n\n[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/003/720/original/open-uri20191118-4-15x85dw?1574118561)\n\n### How are you doing today and what does the future look like?\n\nWe’re now reaching 20k a month in sales but not yet profitable. Our product costs are high as we’re producing handmade organic chocolate in small quantities, (compared to the big boys). Having an adequate stock is our biggest challenge at the moment, it’s difficult to forecast. New resellers introduce themselves almost every day, and some of them are placing orders for a large part of our stock. The bars have a shelf life of a year (as we don’t use fillers or preservatives) and investing in stock is locking up cash. We experience that the demand is always higher than we can actually supply. I believe once we can get our production on track, our batches and revenue will accelerate so this is my main focus for now.\n\nThe goal is to enter organic retail here in Europe and meanwhile create more high-fat snacks. I’m also working on creating more valuable, informative and motivational, content for our social media platforms and our site.\n\nFor the future, I hope to find the right distribution partner in the US and Australia as we experience a growing interest there. For myself, I would like to spend more time in creating different high-fat products and empowering people on a personal level via seminars and events.\n\n### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?\n\nI am very grateful that until now, it has been such a learning experience. When starting, I was quite naive when it comes to working agreements and collaborations. In the end, most of your assumptions will turn out completely wrong, but you will only know this if you go out and do it. I misjudged the logistical part of the business. We have a long lead-time and can experience transport issues during the summer period.\n\nThere is always a summer going on somewhere and our chocolate bars above 30 degrees celsius would turn into a chocolate mousse. Delivering or crossing the whole latitude zone between 30 degrees north and 30 degrees south needs cooled/conditioned transport.\n\nSales via our online shop can be improved. We have the site running on Squarespace and the check-out on Shopify, which doesn’t work in our favor for SEO, so we will be switching this soon to one complete Shopify theme. Also, our high shipping costs cause early checkouts.\n\n[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/003/721/original/open-uri20191118-4-1vj5sei?1574118562)\n\nAs I started selling my MVP right away to resellers, they, of course, wanted a continuous supply of stock. So, take the time to plan your inventory properly.\n\nI’m definitely not there yet as I’m making countless mistakes, but I try to see them as lessons and keep going. I know now that we have a product that is perfect for retail and less perfect for worldwide shipping, which is the complete opposite of the idea I had when starting. It’s a really likable product that consumers love to have in their hands. Though, local (online) resellers can distribute it more cost-efficiently in their territories.\n\n### What platform/tools do you use for your business?\n\nFunkyfatfoods.com is run on Shopify, which I think is the best platform for e-commerce business.\n\nAs far as other tools I use:\n\n- Notion for product and task Management\n\n- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/funkyfatfoods.com): our main social media platform\n\n- Linktree: one bio link for Instagram to house all the content\n\n- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/): the digital tool we use for all our written content\n\n- [Planoly](https://www.planoly.com/): Instagram scheduling App\n\n- [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/): for user feedback\n\n- Canva: for our graphics on social media\n\n- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ketocacao/?viewAsMember=true): to connect with B2B clients\n\n- [Yuki](https://www.yukiweb.net/): (Dutch online accounting App)\n\n- [Kickbooster app](https://kickbooster.me/): for affiliate marketing\n\n- Yotpo for reviews on Shopify\n\n- And we’ll start with Recharge on Shopify soon to offer subscription models\n\n### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?\n\nBooks:\n\n- The Big Fat Surprise by Nina Teicholz A diet book that changed my whole perspective on eating fat.\n\n- Lean Startup by Eric Ries. I’ve read this while in college and implemented the three principles into Funky Fat Foods: Understand the problem, Create an MVP, Experiment and measure.\n\n- This is Marketing by Seth Godin. This gave me a great insight to understand to whom you are selling and the story to tell.\n\nPodcasts:\n\n- The Keto Answers - Dr.Anthony. If you want to know more about the low-carb/keto lifestyle in a fun and informative way.\n\n- [Manifestation Babe](https://manifestationbabe.com/). I love listening to Kathrin. Her personal story and implementable tips are amazing. \n\n### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?\n\nIf you are just starting a business, you may be uncertain about how to proceed. This fear is your ego (the voice in your head) that tries to keep you in your comfort zone. Your ego wants to protect you against the unknown, but that won’t make you grow. This means taking action, and I believe in the well-known quote \"learn by doing\".\n\nFor me, a concept is strong if I immediately feel the passion for a product or service and it adds more value to our lives and if it radiates diversity and dares to be a market leader.\n\nAlso when starting, a lot of tasks are ones that you can do yourself, so don’t wait for the perfect moment, the right partners, more money, or a big team to get things going. You can use the Golden Circle from Simon Sinek - Why, how, what. Once you have this clear for yourself, then you can make a step-by-step plan of what you need to start testing, adapting, and growing!\n\n### Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?\n\nI’m always on the lookout for talented people (we also work with people who work remotely) who have a passion for health and want to be part of this journey to make it a success.\n\n### Where can we go to learn more?\n\n- [Website](https://www.funkyfatfoods.com/)\n\n- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/funkyfatfoods/)\n\n- [Facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/funkyfatfoods/)\n\n- Email\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, drop a comment below!\n\n\n\n---\n\nLiked this text interview?

    "body": "Yeah, ideally we should do our own cooking as much as possible and stick with foods that are naturally keto safe instead of continuing to feed our carb cravings with fake food. I'm not that perfect. Sometimes I just need comfort food. What products or recipes have you found that are actually satisfying instead of disappointing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy list so far:\n\n* Bread: [Sola Sweet Oat](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07GK65NJJ/) \\- 3g net carb per (small) slice, but the taste and texture are nearly perfect.\n* Pasta: [Zeroodles](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B071FS2TW5/) \\- 3g net carb per (small) serving, x2 for a meal portion. The texture reminds me of fresh egg pasta and the aftertaste is slight.\n* Ice Cream: [Enlightened](https://eatenlightened.com/) \\- \\~3-8g net carb per 1/4 pint, depending on flavor. Lower carb and much better texture than Halo Top.\n* Granola: [Sola](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B079W2B8RX/) (again) - 3g net carb per typical serving. If anything it's a bit too sweet. It has an actual crispy kind of crunch to it that is very hard to find.\n* Protein Supplements: [Quest bars](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0764FYSNF/) \\- \\~4-6g net carbs per bar. This isn't exactly a secret, but I mention it because I have yet to find any other protein bar that doesn't use maltitol or isomaltooligosaccharide syrup. Both will spike your blood sugar and are NOT keto safe, but will be listed as sugar alcohol or fiber, so the net carbs on the nutrition panel are inaccurate for keto. Look for products that use soluble corn fiber or inulin instead.\n* Chocolate: [Lily's](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/9741849011) \\- \\~3-7g net carbs per serving. Good on its own or as a base to melt down and make your own chocolate treats. I referenced [this](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/12/the-food-lab-best-way-to-temper-chocolate.html) article to temper chocolate in a sous vide bath and it turned out perfect.\n* Tortillas: [La Banderita](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0756PN4JH/) or [Mission](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00B64Q2NS/) \\- 5g (whole wheat) or 6g (white) net carbs per (small) tortilla. I can get these locally so I don't have to pay stupid price. I'll often use them instead of more expensive bread. Especially great for burgers if you don't mind eating your burger like it's a taco.\n* Cake: [Swerve](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07F1DTLFT/) (boxed mix) or [this](https://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/keto-caramel-cake/) recipe (with bonus caramel sauce) - \\~6g net carbs per realistically sized slice. It's really easy to overdo the erythritol, particularly in the frosting. Definitely use allulose or a natural sweetener instead. If you make the caramel sauce, use allulose instead of bocha sweet unless you want to risk quality time with your toilet.\n* Sugar: [Allulose](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BZQF6ZL/) \\- the closest you'll get to real sugar without the carbs. It even caramelizes! The only real downside is the price. If it's a bit spendy for you, mix it 50/50 with erythritol or a popular blend (Swerve/Lakanto).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecipes:\n\n* [Fried Chicken](https://ketofarms.com/blogs/recipes/keto-chick-fil-a-fried-chicken) \\- Perfectly crispy. I was shocked at how much it looked, felt, and tasted just like breading. I tried a lot before finally stumbling on this one (thanks /r/ketorecipes!)\n* [Cheesecake](https://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/lemon-cheesecake-bars-with-shortbread-crust-low-carb-and-gluten-free/) \\- Sour cream based abominations are anathema to me. If that sounds like you, try this instead. Crust optional, but if you do make it, I'd double the cheesecake portion. I also recommend using allulose (see above).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDining Out:\n\n* Burgers - countless places will give you a plain cheeseburger on a lettuce wrap. Red Robin can substitute fresh broccoli for fries.\n* Chipotle - salad with double meat and queso is delicious and quite low carb, especially if you can do without salsa.\n* Starbucks - If you want coffee, stick with the brewed - espresso has \\~0.5 carbs per shot. I order a venti peach tranquility tea, splash of heavy cream, 2 pumps each of sugar free cinnamon dolce and sugar free vanilla syrups. It's only \\~5 carbs and it's delicious.\n* Donuts - I wish. I've had two cheat days in six months of keto and I used both for donuts. I have a weakness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously there's a lot of room for personal taste with some or all of these, but I'm pickier than most (you'll note pizza is not on the list - even fathead doesn't do it for me). If your \"it's good\" has to be followed by \"for a low carb version\" then the search for better still continues! This information is the culmination of much research and trial and error, so I hope it can be a good starting point, especially for newbies. What other top quality recommendations have you found?",

    "body": "I've been experimenting with getting the perfect Ninja Creami base recipe, and I think I've gotten pretty close. The specific ingredients/brands I chose were ones I found to be most cost effective.\n\n* 1 Scoop (31-33g) Protein Powder\n   * I use PEScience because I like the flavor better than other brands. I've also used Optimum Nutrition and it worked well too. The vanilla will work well for most flavors, but I also like to use the same flavor protein as the ice cream I'm making (if available, otherwise I just use vanilla). Aside from the nutritional benefits, protein powder also acts as a stabilizer to further improve texture.\n* 10g Modified Cornstarch\n   * Significantly improves overall texture. I use the Thick-It brand, but there are many others. Jell-O is made with modified cornstarch so will work fine too. Regular cornstarch will **not** work.\n* \\~1/8-1/4 tsp (\\~1.4g) Salt\n   * I eyeball this when measuring so the amount is a rough estimate. Lite salt and NoSalt will also work. Not completely necessary if using Jell-O or another pre flavored modified cornstarch.\n* \\~1/8-1/4tsp (\\~0.7g) Xanthan Gum\n   * I also eyeball this. There's other stabilizers like guar gum that I haven't tried but may work even better than xanthan gum. I haven't felt the need to switch yet though. Don't add too much or the texture becomes...weird.\n* \\~1/8tsp (\\~1.4g) Sucralose Powder (or whatever sweetener you want)\n   * Also eyeball this. I use pure sucralose, not something like Splenda which has extra bulk added. The brand I use is Hard Rhino (on Amazon US). It's very easy to add too much of this, so maybe start with a little and add a very small pinch at a time until desired sweetness.\n* 1 tsp (7g) Corn Syrup\n   * This is to mitigate ice crystals. It's worth the extra 20 calories for the better texture it provides. Honey also works but how well depends on the particular honey. I think it has to do with the amount of invert sugar present. You can read about it's effect on ice cream here: [https://www.seriouseats.com/the-deal-with-corn-syrup-makes-better-sorbet-why-use-invert-sugars](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-deal-with-corn-syrup-makes-better-sorbet-why-use-invert-sugars). For a calorie free alternative, maltitol syrup works (like Smuckers sugar free sundae syrups), but it can also act as a laxative so YMMV.\n* Water (fill it up to the fill line)\n\nAnd that's it, just blend and freeze for at least 12 hours (preferably 16+). I almost never use just the base recipe though because it needs more flavor. For some flavors like the one's below, you can just add some easy to find ingredients to increase the flavor. For others, I use **extracts**. I've found extracts to be the best way to easily add flavor, just make sure to not add too much. In the US, McCormick makes some good quality, easy to find extracts for flavors like Vanilla, Mint, and Coconut. I've also tried Bakto's Butter Pecan which works really well, and I've ordered some Amoretti flavors to try too (they are pretty expensive, though). One brand ~~I unfortunately **cannot** recommend~~ is OliveNation. All of the extracts I've ordered from them have tasted....awful. [Maybe try their flavor fountains though](https://www.olivenation.com/what-is-the-difference-between-extracts-flavors-emulsions-flavor-fountains)\n\nFlavors not needing extracts (although I often add a 1/2tsp of vanilla extract to these flavors, just because) These are to my taste preference so you may need to adjust:\n\n* Coffee - Base (I use PES Snickerdoodle) + 1/4cup (20g) instant coffee\n* Key Lime - Base + 1/2cup (120g) keylime juice.\n* Chocolate - Base (Preferably a chocolatey protein flavor) + 2Tbsp (10-12g) dutch processed cocoa\n* Peanut Butter - Base (I use PES Peanut Butter Cookie) + 2Tbsp (16g) PBFit (better than PB2 IMO). Adding up to 6Tbsp of PBFit (48g) makes it even better, but just be aware there's 70kcal per 2Tbsp\n\nYou can basically add anything (fruits, sauces, powders, etc. to the base to create any flavor you want. With extracts, any flavor will have less than 250kcal per pint.\n\n**For those without a Creami, the base and all flavors will also work as Protein Fluff. Just omit the water, and use 300g ice cubes and only a 1/2cup of whatever liquid you want. Then follow the same process as this recipe:** [**https://laurenfitfoodie.com/how-to-make-the-best-protein-fluff/#mv-creation-23-jtr**](https://laurenfitfoodie.com/how-to-make-the-best-protein-fluff/#mv-creation-23-jtr)",

In a recipe like yours, it's being relied on more for texture than for sweetness/flavor, so its \"off\" flavor when used as the primary sweetener doesn't apply here.\n\nAlso, you should be able to skip the cornstarch if you bump up the xanthan gum and/or guar gum.  (I'm in the process or running a \"thickener throwdown\" between 1/2 teaspoon xan, 1/2 teaspoon guar, and 1/4 teaspoon of each)\n\nFor reference, you can do an almost completely calorie free sorbet with:\n\n3 tablespoons erythritol\n\n1/2 teaspoon of xanthan gum\n\n2 packets of sugar free drink mix (basically, double the concentration of whatever it says to put per pint since freezing mutes flavors).\n\nMix into water up to the fill line, freeze, spin on sorbet mode.",

E.g. sometimes I eat apples and they contain natural sugars. Not sure if that counts on this sub?\n\nOf course I don't eat sweets with sugar, no drinks with sugar, no ice cream, etc. At some point during the first year I started to avoid also some products that have minimal added sugar but is  difficult to tell, like some crackers - why the hell should someone want sugar in crackers is beyond me.\n\nI realized that when they started to taste like sugar, something that I couldn't notice before.\n\nProbably, sometimes I ate added sugar without knowing, since it's close to impossible to know 100% of the time, especially if you eat out. But I've tried to avoid added sugar as much as possible.\n\nStill, it's been a pain especially in year 1. Of course the first month in particular, where I had quite heavy withdrawal symptoms. It felt like I had the flu, twice in a row, that was in 2019 and I still remember it.\n\nAfter a while it got easier, but sometimes it's still hard at social events.\n\nI also don't eat food with erythritol, maple syrup, agave syrup.\n\nI sometimes eat honey, like once or twice x year (I don't like it much)\n\nSometimes I eat some snacks with maltitol, which I'm thinking about quitting as well, but I need to study it a little bit first to understand if it's really that bad. In my experience is not addictive at all compared to regular sugar snacks.\n\n# How it started:\n\nI used to eat mostly food with a lot of sugar. I used to skip launch or dinner and just ate sweets, lol. I don't know why or how, but one day I decided to do an experiment and stop for 1 week.\n\nMy thinking process was some sort of \"challenge\" to give up something I loved for a period of time. Trying to make a sacrifice, and delay the reward\n\nAfter I passed the worst part of the withdrawal symptoms, somehow I got to 1 full month. From there I still wasn't sure of what I was doing.\n\nAt some point I got to 2 or 3 months, and thought: \"Well, if I eat sugar now all this sacrifice will be for nothing\" and then I continued.\n\n# The main benefits\n\nI'm probably missing something, because I never kept a dairy about it. Maybe I forgot some benefits because I got used to them. But:\n\n* Before quitting, I was constantly tired. All the time. Now that's gone. It took a while, but now I'm constantly full of energy.\n* Saved a lot of time, that in general would've been wasted finding / going to places to get sweets.\n* Saved money on something, that in the end, is useless and does more harm than good. A lot of \"useless\" stuff can be important for other reasons, but added sugar is not that important. There are some great alternatives.\n* Fruit and other foods in general, became more tasty. But I'm not 100% sure if it's a bias or if it's really true :)\n* I've reached a point where sweets don't attract me like they used to. Some of them still do, e.g. when I'm in a high-end bakery/pastry shop.\n* No added sugar to me also meant no cocktails obv. So by consequence I quit alcohol drinks as well\n\nIf you want to quit, it's doable",

    "body": "Okay, guys. This topic has come up a lot lately and has been a strong point of debate: what constitutes as \"keto-friendly\" foods?\n\nIf we are being *technical*, anything is keto-friendly if you eat the right amount of it. I realize that a large part of this is semantics; some people define keto-friendly foods as lower carb foods and some just consider any food keto-friendly when eaten in the right quantities. Personally, I think labeling foods as keto-friendly is causing more confusion than not. A lot of people seem to think that a food that has wheat/sugar/starch/etc automatically makes it not keto-friendly and that's not true. Are there some foods that you can have more of while staying within your carb limit? Sure. Do some people consider these foods more keto-friendly? Sure. Does that mean their definition of keto-friendly is correct? No, it's subjective.\n\nKeto is not a food purity diet and I realize that this is said a lot. But it isn't. If you want to limit processed foods or eat grass-fed everything then that's fine. It doesn't mean you're any more \"keto\" than someone who only eats bacon and cheese. And it doesn't really mean you're healthier either but that's a topic for another time. \n\nWhat's happening lately is people are constantly worried about whether or not foods are \"keto-friendly\" and not paying attention to how these foods are actually making them *feel*. Who the fuck cares if xyz is keto-friendly if it makes you feel like shit? For example, I love Quest bars and I eat them daily with no issues. Other people experience blood sugar spikes or gastric issues when eating them. To them, Quest bars probably wouldn't be considered keto-friendly if it's spiking their blood sugar.\n\nNo offense to newbies but I see this commonly amongst them. The answers are the same every time: Does xyz fit your macros? I realize some people don't feel that certain ingredients, even if the product's net carbs are advertised as low carb, constitute as keto-friendly. This has been common among the zero carb breads. Some people consider them keto-friendly and others don't. **In reality, it doesn't matter whether they are considered\"keto-friendly\" or not if you experience negative side effects when eating them.**\n\nAlso, just because something has sugar does not mean you can't eat it on keto. Guys, most vegetables *have* sugar in them. It may be in really small amounts depending on the vegetable but they do have sugar. So no, keto isn't a no-sugar diet. I see this thrown around a lot which is why I addressed it. \n\nPersonally, I am of the belief that any food is okay to eat on keto and that the only limitation is quantity. I don't like labeling foods as keto-friendly or not because it's subjective. Same thing as labeling foods (apart from obvious things like heavily processed junk food) as healthy or not because that is subjective as well. This ties into clean vs dirty keto (which isn't a thing anyway) but that's a separate discussion. \n\nThere is one caveat. While ingredients aren't important in regards to keto I do think IMO's and maltitol are worth mentioning. Both can contribute to misleading net carb counts on products. *I'm not saying you have to avoid them*. I'm just saying it's good to be aware that your body processes these similarly to sugar. Maltitol should generally be counted as half the carbs and IMO's are tricky because you don't know how much of the fiber listed is attributed to the IMO's. *Again, not everyone has issues eating these* but I did think it was worth mentioning. \n\nTo summarize, if you are that concerned over whether or not you can eat something while on keto (Atkins bars, Franz bread, etc) then it may be best to just not eat it. Or, try it out and see how your body responds. But in my personal opinion labeling foods as keto-friendly is pointless and just causes debate and/or confusion. \n\nThis isn't an attack on anyone I just think that rather than being so concerned over what's considered \"keto-friendly\" or not is not where your focus should be. It doesn't matter how \"keto-friendly\" a food is considered if it makes you feel like shit.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a very generalized post. I'm referring mainly to people doing keto for weight loss/health purposes, not therapeutic keto.",

    "body": "... and falling of said diet wagon in the process.\n\n\nSo after the longest time slacking off I decided to try Keto. I had done a “lazy” or “dirty” version of keto before but as always i couldn’t stick to it for more than 5 days. This time I decided to do it right and actually count everything I put in my body, gram by gram. Surprisingly, I went 8 days in a row without slipping up, without cravings and feeling better than ever.... except for one thing.\n\nI have the biggest sweet tooth in the entire world. I am seriously one of those people that feel like they need something sweet right after a meal whether it’s fruit or a piece of chocolate. Well since I am not really eating fruits atm, I decided to go to my local supermarket and try to find some keto friendly snacks. In my hunt I found this AMAZING chocolate filled meringues that not only were around 130 calories for the whole tub of 40-50 meringues, but were also carb free, sodium free and most importantly SUGAR FREE.\nAnd obviously since I have no self control, I went all in and got myself 3 of those containers.\n\nNeedless to say, when I got home I was all over them like a ravenous animal and nearly crying because I didn’t know how much I missed the sweet taste of chocolate. \nLast night I went to bed feeling very pleased with myself for sticking to my diet another day. \nI was feeling a bit bloated and gassy but I chalked it up to my body still adjusting to keto and went to bed. \n\nSo... here’s where the fuck up starts. \n\nI woke up this morning still gassy. Found it weird but just shrugged it off and went on with my day. I had lunch earlier than usual and for some reason I started feeling “food” anxious. It was then when I remembered the meringues and reached for them. The day before I had 2 containers and this was the last one I had left. Knowing this, I ate this one slower but not because I knew I had too many the day before, but mostly because if I finished this one too fast I would have to run to the grocery store to get more and ain’t nobody got time for that.\n\nSo I was, “slowly” eating my meringues until I eventually realized I had finished them all .... and as soon as I looked at that empty container I got the absolute WORSE stomach rumbles ever. Those tummy rumbles that you just KNOW EXACTLY what they are.\nI tried to run to the bathroom but as soon as I got up I felt a horrible stomach pain that made me fall on my knees.\nSo there I was, crawling to the bathroom like an idiot across my whole apartment and clenching those cheeks like I have never clenched them before.\n\nOnce I made it to the toilet, things got bad. It got so so bad I had to reach for the bin because I was 98% I was going to hurl while sitting on the toilet.\nIt felt like a literal ocean of fire was coming out of my butt and had no intention to stop. I even had to open a couple bars of soap and sniff them because the whole place reeked of doom (and also because I forgot to buy air freshener).\n\nFourty minutes later there I am, laying on the floor right outside the bathroom in a fetal position and feeling incredibly nauseous. \n\nAfter another 3 trips to the toilet in the span of an hour, I grabbed my phone and tried to figure out why in the world I was feeling this way. \nI looked at the app where I log my food and found nothing unusual... except for those damn meringues.\nI dragged myself to the kitchen and grabbed the empty container, trying my best not to puke at the smell. And there it was, written in those tiny, tiny letters: \n“This product contains Maltitol (a sugar alcohol) which may cause bloating and flatulence.”\n\nSo turns out the tiny letters weren’t wrong and I experienced all that plus explosive diarrhea which I assume it is because according to google the most maltitol a person can consume a day is around 50mg and I consumed (roughly) double that amount in less than 48 hours.\nAnd now since my whole day went to shit (literally) I’m typing this as I eat a slice of white bread because apparently my body refuses to digest anything that isn’t carbs. Yay me. \n\nTL;DR : Binged on SUGAR FREE snacks that ended up giving me an **explosively** upset stomach and eventually made me cheat on my diet.",
