    "body": "Work a typical 8-5 job. Come home and typically drown 1/2-1/3 of a 750ml-1L bottle of rum or whiskey a night. Don't particularly feel like stopping, but leaving it up to the community. Cheers, gonna go get another glass.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nWow, I honestly didn't expect this overwhelming level of support. I figured given the subreddit, and the topic matter that this would be labeled a shitpost, and downvoted into the void. I didn't post this to farm for karma, or to try to gain anything really, otherwise I wouldn't have used a throwaway. I posted this with the knowledge that I really need to stop, or at least limit my drinking. I set an arbitrary number of upvotes because I didn't expect this score to ever hit a positive threshold. The outpouring of support and advice from the community is far beyond what I ever expected or even dreamed to be possible. \n\nI guess this post has really just made me admit something to myself that I've known for awhile. I've been telling myself it was in my best interest to stop drinking. Heck, I even started making attempts to lower my intake prior to my vacation a few weeks ago, and it was going fairly well. My reward for limiting my intake was being bashed over vacation for still drinking \"too much\". In the real world, I come from a family of alcoholics and drug addicts. I never really get support, rather only criticism. \n\nSo, I'll wrap this up to say this. I appreciate each and every one of you who left a positive comment, or sent an uplifting message. It really means a lot. My plan is to taper myself off by reducing my intake of alcohol by 1-2 drinks a day for the next 2 weeks. September 1st marks my first sober day in months. A lot of people asked for updates, and I don't quite know where I'd even post such a thing, but I'll probably head over to /r/stopdrinking beginning that day.\n\nAgain, thank you.\n\n**EDIT 2**\n\nOver 400,000 people have viewed this. As a software engineer, this may be the most prolific thing I've ever written. Literally, more people have viewed this than live in my (somewhat large) city. It's absolutely astounding. I'm committed to bettering myself, and I've seen hundreds of comments from redditors telling me to update them, if anyone has a good idea where updates would be best served, let me know.\n\n**Edit 2017-09-09** \n\nBeen alcohol free since the 1st of the month. Only a bit more than a week in, and things are looking up. I'm more productive at work (and home). I'm taking interest in things outside of work again. It's amazing how much time you actually have left in your day when you're sober. \n\nThe first 2-3 days were hell. Days 4 and 5 left me feeling more energized. And now I feel pretty much normal.  My only real complaint currently is very restless sleep and strange dreams, which in turn cause me to have a horrible time waking up in the morning. \n\nOverall things are going well. I'll probably do one final update at the end of the month in this post. All future updates will be in /r/stopdrinking. \n\n**Edit 2019-03-09**\n\nI figured I'd come back and update everyone. In 2017, after my last update, I stayed sober for a couple months. After that, I felt it was safe to return to drinking in moderation, and I did. For awhile, things were great, I was doing great at moderation. However, after a few vacations, I fell back into the habit of drinking daily. Never as much as before, but still at a frequency I wasn't comfortable with. \n\nAs of Feb 12, 2019, I'm again taking an extended sobriety break. From all substances (caffeine, cannabis, alcohol, etc). I'll likely return to cannabis at some point in the future, but I'm not sure when or if I'll reintroduce alcohol. I can definitely moderate if I'm conscious about it, but it's when I stop being conscious of it that I begin to slip. It's far easier for me not to take that first drink. \n\nSince quitting again, this time feels different. It's like I've actually lost all desire to even have alcohol. The smell of it makes me nauseous, and I have about as much temptation to drink as I do to place my hand in a blender. ",

The canopy in the coffee pulp area was also four times taller than that of the control area. \n\nThe addition of the half metre thick layer of coffee pulp eliminated the invasive pasture grasses which dominated the land. These grasses are often a barrier to forest succession and their removal allowed native, pioneer tree species, that arrived as seeds through wind and animal dispersal, to recolonise the area quickly.\n\nThe researchers also found that after two years, nutrients including carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous were significantly elevated in the coffee pulp treated area compared to the control. This is a promising finding given former tropical agricultural land is often highly degraded and poor soil quality can delay forest succession for decades.\n\nhttps://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2688-8319.12054",

The only thing you're optimizing is your caffeine addiction and sleep deprivation.\n\nFuck your pomodoro timer. If I wanted to live my life in 25-minute chunks, I'd go back to high school.\n\nFuck your inbox zero - emails multiply like rabbits anyway. Who are you trying to impress?\n\nFuck your 17 different productivity apps that all sync together in some ungodly digital centipede. You spend more time maintaining this shit than actually working.\n\nFuck \"deep work\" when you can't even focus long enough to finish reading this post without checking your phone.\n\nFuck your habit tracker that's giving you anxiety because you missed one day of meditation and now your perfect streak is ruined.\n\nHere's what actually works: Do the fucking thing. That's it. Stop reading productivity on Medium. Stop watching YouTubers tell you how they organize their day in 15-minute intervals. Stop buying notebooks that cost more than your hourly rate.\n\nYou know what made our parents productive? They just sat down and did the work. They didn't need an app to tell them to drink water or take a break. They didn't have \"productivity workflows\" or \"second brains.\" They had a pen, paper, and shit to do.\n\nWant to be productive? Here's your system:\n\n1. Write down what needs to get done\n2. Do the hardest thing first\n3. Everything else is bonus\n\nThat's it. That's the whole system. Not sexy enough? Doesn't cost $99/month? Tough shit.\n\nEvery time you add another layer to your \"productivity stack,\" you're just adding another excuse to procrastinate. Another thing to tweak. Another reason to not do the actual work.\n\nYou don't need a better system. You need to sit your ass down and work. Turn off notifications. Close the browser tabs. Put your phone in another room. And just fucking work.\n\nAnd for the love of god, stop reading productivity subreddits (yes, including this one). The irony of procrastinating by reading about how to stop procrastinating isn't lost on me.\n\nNow go do something useful instead of reading this. And if this post helped you procrastinate for 5 minutes, well... fuck you too. ❤️\n\n  \nedit: my post was removed because of a word(?) by the bot.",

You've pretty much answered all the important things (I've laughed myself silly at your responses with \"my post mentions\").\n\nI would have asked about eye strain... but you've seen an optometrist so there's that.\n\nWhat you have is called myokymia. Typically, after doing the magnesium and all the stuff you've described we say you have 1 of 2 choices:\n\n1. It's very highly likely benign (you should still see a Neurologist) and if it's not bothering you too much then just wait it out. It might \"declare itself\" as something else like a form of atypical migraine but more likely it's literally just plain old twitching.\n2. If it's something that makes you want to \"put your head through a wall,\" then we go for the Botox.\n\nIf you want to see a Neurologist, then get on the waiting list NOW. In many states... you can pretty much assume that your twitching will be long gone well before you are an after thought given how long most patients wait to see a Neurologist. We're in a dire shortage currently.\n\nHope I've helped in any way.\n\nEdit: I meant to ask: does it ever wake you up at night?

I was up really late because I fucked up and didn’t do this assignment that was due in the morning. \n\nI was starting to get really tired so I decided to get a little hit of caffeine. I went down to the garage because we have an extra fridge there and I grabbed a soda. I walked back to the door to go inside but the door wouldn’t budge. \n\nThis is when I realized I fucked up, because not only did I just lock myself out of the house with no shirt, no keys and no phone. I also failed to remember that my home security system was armed. \n\nRight as I finished that thought: \n\n“WooooOOOOOooo WooooOOOOOooo!” \n\nMy surprisingly loud security system went off (there’s a 30 second delay to allow someone to punch in the security code before it goes off).  I start panicking and trying to force the door open so I can shut the alarm off. I realized that wasn’t gonna work and just started pacing and freaking the fuck out. It took longer than I’m proud of realize that I’m in a garage and I can just open the garage door. \n\nAfter I raised the garage I ran to the front door and... locked. Of course. Fortunately for me though there’s 3 other doors on the side and back of the house that I could get into the house from, unfortunately for me those too were locked. I defaulted back to stress pacing until I decided fuck it, the cops will be here soon and maybe they can help me. Well, I was half right. \n\nI open the side gate and walk back to the front of the house when all the sudden someone screams at me “STOP! LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS!” I freeze up in fear because I’m realizing that two cops who are responding to a home invasion are now pointing a gun at me, the weird shirtless guy coming from the backyard. \n\nI complied with their orders and explained that I live here, I just set off the alarm and locked myself out. They looked up the homeowner, my dad, and gave him a call. Needless to say, my dad wasn’t too happy to be receiving a call from the police at 2am asking if the dumbass who locked himself out of his own house was his son. \n\nOnce they were satisfied that I lived there, one officer brought out this device that just sort of popped the door open for me. I thanked them, shut the alarm off, and used the adrenaline coursing through my veins to bust out the remainder of my homework. \n\nTL;DR: I was home alone late at night and got a drink from the garage, not realizing that I locked myself out and that I just set off the alarm. While I was trying to find a way into my house the police showed up and pointed a gun at me, thinking I was trying to break in.",

My wife and I have a built in china cabinet in our home. The kind that's common in 100 year old houses. That's when ours was built. On top of the built in we have 60-70 framed pics of our families and her kids. There is exactly one picture of her and I up there in the mix. One night she was at work and I was home and set the alarm for away on accident. I also stupidly forgot I had set it at all. I was in our bedroom and our dog wanted out. I walked into the dining room to head to the kitchen and tripped a motion sensor. I was pretty quick to shut the alarm off, but missed the call from the alarm company. I was getting ready for bed and turn my ringer off while sleeping. While standing in the backyard the police showed up. Two out front and two out back and all had guns drawn. My dog ran towards them. With my hands up I begged them not to shoot her. She's a big dumb goofy ass loving dog who thought they were there to play with her. I spoke just in time apparently because the cop said he almost shot her. They handcuffed me and brought me through my house to the front porch. I tried explaining to them what had happened and they weren't trying to hear any of it. We had been in the house about 6 months at that point and had previously lived 3 blocks over. When they asked for my ID they again thought I was lying because it still had my old address on it. So I told them to go look at the pictures on the built in and they'd see my wife and I in one of the pictures. One of the officers went in and grabbed the picture bringing it out to the front porch. He asked if it was the picture I was \"claiming\" to be in. Since it was a picture of me and I was super annoyed with the whole situation I made some snide remark. In all fairness I had no beard and shorter hair in the picture but I did tell him exactly where to find the picture. This questions continue for about 10 minutes and they're telling me they're taking me to jail. I was still in handcuffs and I was angry as hell and my attitude probably wasn't helping. The whole time they just kept insisting I was burglarizing the house. Finally I told them to call my wife and she could verify I was in fact allowed to be in my own home. They asked her to come home to see if she could identify me. She's freaking out thinking something's happened to me and flies home. She gets there and they don't ask for her ID or anything. She explained it was obviously all mistake. They uncuff me and tell me next time to be more careful. No apology. No nothing. Spent an hour dealing with them in cuffs and it cost my wife her job. She told her immediate supervisor she was leaving but not her actual boss. Her supervisor gave her permission and vouched for her but it didn't matter because of the zero tolerance policy. She'd never been late or written up. Shitty night for both of us over a serious misunderstanding.",

So, they need to drink more.”\n\n\n>“Our interpretation is these people equate caffeine’s natural bitterness with a psycho-stimulation effect,” Cornelis said. “They learn to associate bitterness with caffeine and the boost they feel. We are seeing a learned effect. When they think of caffeine, they think of a bitter taste, so they enjoy dark coffee and, likewise, dark chocolate.”\n\n\n>“Drinking black coffee versus coffee with cream and sugar is very different for your health,” Cornelis said. “The person who wants black coffee is different from a person who wants coffee with cream and sugar. Based on our findings, the person who drinks black coffee also prefers other bitter foods like dark chocolate. So, we are drilling down into a more precise way to measure the actual health benefits of this beverage and other food.”",

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of coffee drinking have identified genetic variants involved in caffeine-related pathways but not in taste perception. The taste of coffee can be altered by addition of milk/sweetener, which has not been accounted for in GWAS. Using UK and US cohorts, we test the hypotheses that genetic variants related to taste are more strongly associated with consumption of black coffee than with consumption of coffee with milk or sweetener and that genetic variants related to caffeine pathways are not differentially associated with the type of coffee consumed independent of caffeine content. Contrary to our hypotheses, genetically inferred caffeine sensitivity was more strongly associated with coffee taste preferences than with genetically inferred bitter taste perception. These findings extended to tea and dark chocolate. Taste preferences and physiological caffeine effects intertwine in a way that is difficult to distinguish for individuals which may represent conditioned taste preferences.",

He was very gracious and gave a history of sour coffee in the North Bay. The thought is that you can taste a lot more of the complex coffee notes in a lightly roasted and carefully pulled coffee. The heritage of wine tasting in the region led to an increased focus on complex coffee notes that you get from a more sour coffee. \n\nBut it’s still not my cup of tea (so to speak). I much prefer a black Italian espresso. Perhaps I’m one of the few who are genetically predisposed to bitter coffee.",

I initially attributed the feeling to that 2nd cup of coffee I shouldn't have had.  At 2pm it was my hour-long lunch break which I always use for some gym time.  As I was walking out of the office I realized that this wasn't just the caffeine talking.  The possibility that I was in fact, tripping, didn't even occur to me until this point when realized how it could have happened, and sure enough, it did.  Somehow.  Life finds a way.  Saturday morning I had prepared some 'gummy bears' for my friends using the translucent Tupperware lid as the backdrop. Some of the residue must have lived through the night.  On Sunday I made a bunch of pasta and started eating straight out of the Tupperware.  I put the lid on and didn't think twice about it.  Today I ate leftovers at work that must have been contaminated by the container.  Or maybe I laid my fork on the lid, then licked that fork...mmmyeah.  I'm honestly perplexed how eating the pasta could have dosed me since I microwaved that shit for a few minutes and it's my limited understanding that high temperature will often nullify the drug. It did though and by the time I had walked to the gym I knew damn well what was coming my way.   Well anyway, I went to the gym and worked out pretty intensely for 40 minutes in an effort to blow off all the nervous steam and jitters.  The work-out was rather standard except for a brief moment where, lost in concentration, I started walking out of the gym then got slightly disoriented when I didn't know where I was going, or why.  I pulled myself together and took a cold shower then took a nice long walk outside before I had to take the plunge.  I did my best to act like a normal human upon re-entry.  I cracked one joke (that actually went over really well with half the office) before admonishing myself to behave. My behavior was normal except for when I forgot my co-workers name during an introduction.  We had a new team-member start today and I had to give her a tour.   I don't think she could tell I was fucked up but I know I was sweating a lot and rambling.  I now have another 50 minutes before I very non-nonchalantly walk out of the office, secret intact, and take a very long walk home.  What a fucking Monday.\n\nTL;DR: Accidentally dosed myself and had to spend the rest of the day pretending I was a normal, sober, middle-level manager at the office.",

As a special and unusual bonus, they were to be given a monetary benefit which the Commodore explained to them:\n\n\"In addition to your medals, and an increase in rank to Chief Petty Officer for all of you, you are permitted to receive a bonus, in Pounds Sterling for the number of centimeters measured between any 2 parts of your body... the proceeds of which may be spent however you like, but my strong recommendation is that you use this small stipend to get very, very drunk with my blessings.

Top of me 'ead to the soles of me feet SAH!\"\n\n\"Excellent Excellent, you're quite the tall one I see.  Well done.\"  Measurement revealed that Green was 195cm tall, and he took his bonus gratefully.\n\n\"Petty Officer Davies, your choice?\"\n\n\"Sah!  Tip of me middle finger to the tip of me other middle finger SAH!\"  A quick measurement revealed that PO Davies wingspan was remarkable at exactly 200cm.\n\n\"Amazing!  You're quite the swimmer aren't you lad!  Good show!  Very well, Petty Officer Evans, what shall we measure for you then?\"\n\n\"SAH!  Tip of me cock to the bottom of me balls, SAH!\"\n\n\"Not much of a drinker are you Evans? Very well, let's see this monster you keep hidden and get you paid.\"  \n\nUpon dropping his trousers and skivvies, there is a moment of silence... \"My God Evans!

    "body": "I don't know when you're going to read this, but I can tell you when it started: I was out for a walk alone in the woods when the entity came for me. It was beyond a blur. It was, for lack of a better term, absence of meaning. Where it hid, there were no trees; where it crept closer, there was no grass; through the arc it leapt at me, there was no breeze of motion. There was no air at all.\n\nAs it struck, I felt the distinct sensation of claws puncturing me somewhere unseen; somewhere I'd never felt before. My hands and arms and legs and torso seemed fine and I wasn't bleeding, but I knew I'd been injured somehow. As I fearfully ran back home, I could tell that I was less. I was vaguely tired, and it was hard to focus at times.\n\nThe solution at that early stage was easy: a big cup of coffee helped me feel normal again.\n\nFor a while, that subtle drain on my spirit became lost in the ebb and flow of caffeine in my system. You could say my life began that week, actually, because that was when I met Mar. She and I got along great, though, to be honest, I'm pretty sure I fell in love with her over the phone before we even met.\n\nIt was almost as if the strong emotions of that first week made the entity fight back—it was still with me, latched on to some invisible part of my being.\n\nThe first few incidents were minor, and I hardly worried about them. The color of a neighbor's car changed from dark blue to black one morning, and I stared at it before shaking my head and shrugging off the difference. Two days later, at work, a coworker's name changed from Fred to Dan. I carefully asked around, but everyone said his name had always been Dan. I figured I'd just been mistaken.\n\nThen, as ridiculous as this sounds, I was peeing in my bathroom at home when I suddenly found myself on a random street. I was still in my pajamas, pants down, and urinating—but now in full view of a dozen people at a bus stop. Horrified, I pulled up my clothes and ran before someone called the cops. I did manage to get home, but the experience forced me to admit that I was still in danger. The entity was doing something to me, and I didn't understand how to fight back.\n\nMar showed up that evening, but she had her own key.\n\n\"Hey,\" I asked her with confusion. \"How'd you get a key?\"\n\nShe just laughed. \"You're cute. Are you sure you're okay with this?\" She opened a door and entered a room full of boxes. \"I know living together is a big step, especially when we've only been dating three months.\"\n\nLiving together? I'd literally just met her the week before. Thing was, my mother had always called me a smart cookie for a reason. I knew when to shut my yap. Instead of causing a scene, I told her everything was fine—and then I went straight to my room and began investigating.\n\nMy things were just as I had left them with no sign of a three month gap in habitation, but I did find something out of the ordinary: the date. I shivered angrily as I processed the truth.\n\nThe entity had eaten three months of my life.\n\nWhat the hell was I facing? What kind of creature could consume pieces of one's soul like that? I'd missed the most exciting part of a new relationship, and I would never understand any shared stories or in-jokes from that period. Something absurdly precious had been taken from me, and I was furious.\n\nThat fury helped suppress the entity. I never imbibed alcohol. I drank coffee religiously. I checked the date every time I woke up. For three years, I managed to live each day while observing nothing more than minor alterations. A social fact here and there—someone's job, how many kids they had, that sort of thing—the layout of nearby streets, the time my favorite television show aired, that kind of thing. Always, those changes reminded me the creature still had its claws sunk into my spirit. Not once in three years did I ever let myself zone out.\n\nOne day, I grew careless. I let myself get really into the season finale of my favorite show. It was gripping; a fantastic story. Right at the height of the action, a young boy came up to my lounger and shook my arm.\n\nSurprised, I asked, \"Who are you? How did you get in here?\"\n\nHe laughed and smiled brightly. \"Silly Daddy!\"\n\nMy heart sank in my chest. I knew immediately what had happened. After a few masked questions, I discovered that he was two years old—and that he was my son.\n\nThe agony and heartache filling my chest was nearly unbearable. Not only had I missed the birth of my son, I would never see or know the first years of his life. Mar and I had obviously gotten married and started a family in the time I'd lost, and I had no idea what joys or pains those years contained.\n\nIt was snowing outside. Holding my sudden son in my lap, I sat and watched the flakes fall outside. What kind of life was this going to be if slips in concentration could cost me years? I had to get help.\n\nThe church had no idea what to do. The priests didn't believe me, and told me I had a health issue rather than some sort of possession.\n\nThe doctors didn't have any clue. Nothing showed up on all their scans and tests, but they happily took my money in return for nothing.\n\nBy the time I ran out of options, I'd decided to tell Mar. There was no way to know what this all looked like from her side. What was I like when I wasn't there? Did I still take our son to school? Did I still do my job? Clearly, I did, because she seemed to be none the wiser, but I still had a horrible feeling that something must have been missing in her life when I wasn't actually home inside my own head.\n\nBut the night I set up a nice dinner in preparation, she arrived not by unlocking the front door, but by knocking on it. I answered, and found that she was in a nice dress.\n\nShe was happily surprised by the settings on the table. \"A fancy dinner for a second date? I knew you were sweet on me!\"\n\nThank the Lord I knew when to keep my mouth shut. If I'd gone on about being married and having a son, she might have run for the hills. Instead, I took her coat and sat down for our second date.\n\nThrough carefully crafted questions, I managed to deduce the truth. This really was our second date. She saw relief and happiness in me, but interpreted that as dating jitters. I was just excited to realize that the entity wasn't necessarily eating whole portions of my life. The symptoms, as I was beginning to understand them, were more like the consequences of a shattered soul. The creature had wounded me; broken me into pieces. Perhaps I was to live my life out of order, but at least I would actually get to live it. \n\nAnd so it went for a few years—from my perspective. While minor changes in politics or geography would happen daily, major shifts in my mental location only happened every couple months. When I found myself in a new place and time in my life, I just shut up and listened, making sure to get the lay of the land before doing anything to avoid making mistakes. On the farthest-flung leap yet, I met my six-year-old grandson, and I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. He said, \"Writer.\" I told him that was a fine idea.\n\nThen, I was back in month two of my relationship with Mar, and I had the best night with her on the riverfront. When I say the best, I mean *the best*. Knowing how special she would become to me, I asked her to move in. I got to live through what I'd missed the first go-around, and I came to understand that I was never mentally absent. I would always be there—eventually. When we were moving her boxes in, she stopped for a moment and said she marveled at my great love, as if I'd known her for a lifetime and never once doubted she was the one.\n\nThat was the first time I'd truly laughed freely and wholeheartedly since the entity had wounded me. She was right about my love for her, but for exactly the reason she'd considered a silly romantic analogy. I *had* known her my whole life, and I'd come to terms with my situation and found peace with it. It wasn't so bad to have sneak peeks at all the best parts ahead.\n\nBut of course I wouldn't be writing this if it hadn't gotten worse. The entity was still with me. It had not wounded me and departed like I'd wanted to believe. The closest I can describe my growing understanding was that the creature was burrowing deeper into my psyche, fracturing it into smaller pieces. Instead of months between major shifts, I began having only weeks. Once I noticed that trend, I feared my ultimate fate would be to jump between times in my life heartbeat by heartbeat, forever confused, forever lost. Only an instant in each time meant I would never be able to speak with anyone else, never be able to hold a conversation, never express or receive love.\n\nAs the true depth of that fear came upon me, I sat in an older version of me and watched the snow falling outside. That was the one constant in my life: the weather didn't care who I was or what pains I had to face. Nature was always there. The falling snow was always like a little hook that kept me in a place; the pure emotional peace it brought was like a panacea on my mental wounds, and I'd never yet shifted while watching the pattern of falling white and thinking of the times I'd gone sledding or built a snow fort as a child.\n\nA teenager touched my arm. \"Grandpa?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" He'd startled me out of my thoughts, so I was less careful than usual. \"Who are you?\"\n\nHe half-grinned, as if not sure whether I was joking. Handing me a stack of papers, he said, \"It's my first attempt at a novel. Would you read it and tell me what you think?\"\n\nAhh, of course. \"Pursuing that dream of being a writer, I see.\"\n\nHe burned bright red. \"Trying to, anyway.\"\n\n\"All right. Run off, I'll read this right now.\" The words were blurry, and, annoyed, I looked for glasses I probably had for reading. Being old was *terrible*, and I wanted to leap back into a younger year—but not before I read his book. I found my glasses in a sweater pocket, and began leafing through. Mar puttered in and out of the living room, still beautiful, but I had to focus. I didn't know how much time I would have there.\n\nIt seemed that we had relatives over. Was it Christmas? A pair of adults and a couple kids I didn't recognize tromped through the hallway, and I saw my son, now adult, walk by with his wife on the way out the door. As a group, the extended family began sledding outside.\n\nFinally, I finished reading the story, and I called out for my grandson. He rushed down the stairs and into the living room. \"How was it?\"\n\n\"Well, it's terrible,\" I told him truthfully. \"But it's terrible for all the right reasons. You're still a young man, so your characters behave like young people, but the structure of the story itself is very solid.\" I paused. \"I didn't expect it to turn out to be a horror story.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"It's a reflection of the times. Expectations for the future are dismal, not hopeful like they used to be.\"\n\n\"You're far too young to be aware like that,\" I told him. An idea occurred to me. \"If you're into horror, do you know anything about strange creatures?\"\n\n\"Sure. I read everything I can. I love it.\"\n\nWarily, I scanned the entrances to the living room. Everyone was busy outside. For the first time, I opened up to someone in my life about what I was experiencing. In hushed tones, I told him about my fragmented consciousness.\n\nFor a teenager, he took it well. \"You're serious?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe donned the determined look of a grown man accepting a quest. \"I'll look into it, see what I can find out. You should start writing down everything you experience. Build some data. Maybe we can map your psychic wound.\"\n\nWow. \"Sounds like a plan.\" I was surprised. That made sense, and I hadn't expected him to have a serious response. \"But how will I get all the notes in one place?\"\n\n\"Let's come up with somewhere for you to leave them,\" he said, frowning with thought. \"Then I'll get them, and we can trace the path you're taking through your own life, see if there's a pattern.\"\n\nFor the first time since the situation had gotten worse, I felt hope again. \"How about under the stairs? Nobody ever goes under there.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" He turned and left the living room.\n\nI peered after him. I heard him banging around near the stairs.\n\nFinally, he returned with a box, laid it on the carpet, and opened it to reveal a bursting stack of papers. He exclaimed, \"Holy crap!\"—but of course, being a teenager, he didn't really say *crap*.\n\nTaken aback, I blinked rapidly, forgiving his cussing because of the shock. \"Did I write those?\"\n\nHe looked up at me with wonder. \"Yeah. Or, you will. You still have to write them and put them under the stairs after this.\" He gazed back down at the papers—then covered the box. \"So you probably shouldn't see what they say. That could get weird.\"\n\nThat much I understood. \"Right.\"\n\nHe gulped. \"There are like fifty boxes under there, all filled up like this. Deciphering these will take a very long time.\" His tone dropped to deadly seriousness. \"But I will save you, grandpa. Because I don't think anyone else can.\" \n\nTears flowed down my cheeks then, and I couldn't help but sob once or twice. I hadn't realized how lonely I'd become in my shifting prison of awareness until I finally had someone who understood. \"Thank you. Thank you so much.\"\n\nAnd then I was young again, and at work on a random Tuesday. Once the sadness and relief faded, anger and determination replaced them. After I finished my work, I grabbed some paper and began writing. While the weeks shifted around me, while those weeks became days, and then hours, I wrote every single spare moment about when and where I thought I was. I put them under the stairs out of order; my first box was actually the thirtieth, and my last box was the first. Once I had over fifty boxes written from my perspective—and once my shifting became a matter of minutes—I knew it was up to my grandson to take it from there.\n\nI put my head down and stopped looking. I couldn't stand the river of changing awareness any longer. Names and places and dates and jobs and colors and people were all wrong and different.\n\nI'd never been older. I sat watching the snow fall. A man of at least thirty that I vaguely recognized entered the room. \"Come on, I think I finally figured it out.\"\n\nI was so frail that moving was painful. \"Are you him? Are you my grandson?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He took me to a room filled with strange equipment and sat me in a rubber chair facing a large mirror twice the height of a man. \"The pattern finally revealed itself.\"\n\n\"How long have you worked on this?\" I asked him, aghast. \"Tell me you didn't miss your life like I'm missing mine!\"\n\nHis expression was both stone cold and furiously resolute. \"It'll be worth it.\" He brought two thin metal rods close to my arm and then nodded at the mirror. \"Look. This shock is carefully calibrated.\"\n\nThe electric zap from his device was startling, but not painful. In the mirror, I saw a rapid arcing light-silhouette appear above my head and shoulder. The electricity moved through the creature like a wave, briefly revealing the terrible nature of what was happening to me. A bulging leech-like mouth was wrapped around the back of my head, coming down to my eyebrows and touching each ear, and its slug-like body ran over my shoulder and into my very soul.\n\nIt was a parasite.\n\nAnd it was feeding on my mind.\n\nMy now-adult grandson held my hand as I took in the horror. After a moment, he asked, \"Removing it is going to hurt very badly. Are you up for this?\"\n\nFearful, I asked, \"Is Mar here?\"\n\nHis face softened. \"No. Not for a few years now.\"\n\nI could tell from his reaction what had happened, but I didn't want it to be true. \"How?\"\n\n\"We have this conversation a lot,\" he responded. \"Are you sure you want to know? It never makes you feel better.\"\n\nTears brimmed in my eyes. \"Then I don't care if it hurts, or if I die. I don't want to stay in a time where she's not alive.\"\n\nHe made a sympathetic noise of understanding and then returned to his machines to hook several wires, diodes, and other bits of technology to my limbs and forehead. While he did so, he talked. \"I've worked for two decades to figure this out, and I've had a ton of help from other researchers of the occult. This parasite doesn't technically exist in our plane. It's one of the lesser spawns of µ¬ßµ, and it feeds on the plexus of mind, soul, and quantum consciousness/reality. When details like names and colors of objects changed, you weren't going crazy. The web of your existence was merely losing strands as the creature ate its way through you.\"\n\nI didn't fully understand. I looked up in confusion as he placed a circlet of electronics like a crown on my head in exact line with where the parasite's mouth had ringed me. \"What's µ¬ßµ?\"\n\nHe paused his work and grew pale. \"I forgot that you wouldn't know. You're lucky, believe me.\" After a deep breath, he began moving again, and placed his fingers near a few switches. \"Ready? This is carefully tuned to make your nervous system extremely unappetizing to the parasite, but it's basically electro-shock therapy.\"\n\nI could still see Mar's smile. Even though she was dead, I'd just been with her moments ago. \"Do it.\"\n\nThe click of a switch echoed in my ears, and I almost laughed at how mild the electricity was. It didn't feel like anything—at least at first. Then, I saw the mirror shaking, and my body within that image convulsing. Oh. No. It did hurt. Nothing had ever been more painful. It was just so excruciating that my mind hadn't been able to immediately process it. \n\nAs my vision shook and fire burned in every nerve in my body, I could see the reflected trembling light-silhouette of the parasite on my head as it writhed in agony equal to mine. It had claws—six clawed lizard-like limbs under its leech-like body—and it cut into me in an attempt to stay latched on.\n\nThe electricity made my memories flare.\n\nMar's smile was foremost, lit brightly in front of a warm fire as the snow fell past the window behind her. The edges of that memory began lighting up, and I realized that my life *was* one continuous stretch of experience—it was only the awareness of it that had been fragmented by that feasting evil on my back.\n\nI'd never managed to be there for the birth of my son. I'd jumped around it a dozen times, but never actually lived it. For the first time, I got to hold Mar's hand and be there for her.\n\nNo. *No!* That moment had shifted seamlessly into holding her hand as she lay in a hospital bed for a very different reason. Not this! God, why? It was so merciless to make me remember this. I broke down in tears as nurses rushed into the room. I didn't want to know. I didn't want to experience it. I'd seen all the good parts, but I hadn't wanted the worst part—the inevitable end that all would one day face.\n\nIt wasn't worth it. It was tainted. All that joy was given back ten thousand fold as pain.\n\nThe fire in my body and in my brain surged to sheer white torture, and I screamed.\n\nMy scream faded into a surprised shout as the machines and electricity and chair faded away. Snow was no longer falling around my life; I was out in the woods on a bright summer day.\n\nOh God.\n\nI turned to see the creature approaching me. It was the same absence of meaning; the same blank on reality. It crept forward, just like before—but, this time, it hissed and turned away. I stood, astounded at being young again and freed from the parasite. My grandson had actually done it! He'd made me an unappetizing meal, so the predator of mind and soul had moved on in search of a different snack.\n\nI returned home in a daze.\n\nAnd while I was sitting there processing all that had happened, the phone rang. I looked at it in awe and sadness. I knew who it was. It was Marjorie, calling for the first time for some trivial reason she'd admit thirty years later was made up just to talk to me.\n\nBut all I could see was her lying in that hospital bed dying. It was going to end in unspeakable pain and loneliness. I would become an old man, left to sit by myself in an empty house, his soulmate gone long before him. At the end of it all, the only thing I would have left: sitting and watching the falling snow.\n\nBut now, thanks to my grandson, I would also have my memories. It would be a wild ride, no matter how it ended.\n\nOn a sudden impulse, I picked up the phone. With a smile, I asked, \"Hey, who's this?\"\n\nEven though I already knew.\n\n---\n\nAuthor's note: Together, my grandfather and I did set out to write the tale of his life. Unfortunately, his Alzheimer's disease progressed rapidly, and we were never able to finish. He's still alive, but I imagine that, mentally, he is in a better place than the nursing home. I like to think he's back in his younger days, living life and being happy, because the reality is much colder. It's snowing today; he loves the snow. When I visited him, he didn't recognize me, but he did smile as he sat looking out the window.\n\n---\n\n[Blog](http://mattdymerski.com/) [FB](https://www.facebook.com/MattDymerskiAuthor/) [Tw](https://twitter.com/MattDymerski)[.](https://imgur.com/a/cLqsc)",

The most common consequences are the runs (ie diarrhea) and sleep disruption, but you also enhance the chances of rare side effects.\n- “energy drinks” can be pretty problematic as people assume lots of things. There are no standard contents so one isn’t necessarily replaceable for another - you could be doubling your dose of certain things. They can have all sorts of things from taurine to glucuronolactone to ginkgo biloba to guarana. These can have different tolerances, side effects, and even immune responses in different people. This means you could be fine swapping one energy drink to another. Or you could be surprised. We can’t really definitively say if caffeine killed the kid or if one of these other ingredients did. Heck, for all we know the kid was also on a different drug. \n- there is such a thing as a condition you’ve had your whole life and never triggered it. No previous heart condition doesn’t mean the kid had ever had an EKG.\n\nThis isn’t my first time seeing one of these.

There are many forms of tinnitus. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=059qOMgLa_o) is but one of them. \n\nEDIT: I'm glad this is reaching many people. If you have friends or family members, please inform them as well. I often think about why many of us are never taught about the importance of protecting our ears. If you can hear someone's music through their earbuds, then it is most likely far too loud. If you google \"tinnitus definition\" and you expand the definition box, you will see that it's been on the rise lately. \n\n\"[The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that nearly 15% of the general public — over 50 million Americans — experience some form of tinnitus. Roughly 20 million people struggle with burdensome chronic tinnitus, while 2 million have extreme and debilitating cases.](https://www.ata.org/understanding-facts)\" \n\nStay safe everyone. \n\nEDIT 2: Hello everyone, I've been seeing a lot of post here. Thanks for sharing for anecdotes and informing others of how your tinnitus came to be. Just a few things to keep in mind. Not all tinnitus is caused by hearing loss or loud  noise. Tinnitus can occur if you're sick, or if you have an ear infection, **earwax buildup**  or even through medication, or in rare cases if you have TMJ. In these cases they may or may not be permanent (I don't want to scare you), and I would highly recommend going to your ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat Doctor) as soon as possible. Also remember that just because there isn't a cure for tinnitus does not mean there may be professional treatment out there that can significantly improve your quality of life. This is important to remember. See your ENT to get these ruled out! \n\nAs /u/OhCleo mentioned, don't clean your ears by putting cotton sticks in your ear canal. This is how you cause earwax blockage. \n\nEdit3: I've been reading all of your comments. Here I will include some notable suggestions I've read but may be lost in the pool of comments we have. 1) also wear earplugs while motorcycling, drumming, if you're a musician, . \n\n2) ***don't wear earplugs all the time, only when necessary***; wearing earplugs for too long can also damage your ears. \n\n3) **there are earplugs called ~~\"Etymotic\"~~(just search for \"earplugs that don't muffle sound\") earplugs or musician earplugs that actually keep the sounds the same, and in some cases even help sounds sound better but at a lower volume** 4) listening to music for too long even at medium volume can still cause damage, take breaks. \n\n/u/ukralibre said \"Thats interesting but its almost impossible to convince people to use protection before they get harmed.\" However, by then it'll be too late. Take all these anecdotes from your fellow redditors and heed this LPT. \n\nEdit 4: I put more emphasis on not wearing earplugs all the time only when necessary because that's important. It can lead to hyperacusis. You want to protect your ears from loud noises, not every noise. \n\nEdit 5: For many of us tinnitus redditors, if you already have it, it's not as bad as it sounds. Have you ever smelled something that smelled awful initially but after a while you don't even notice it anymore? Or that car smell that you recognize when you first enter a car but after a while inside the car it just \"disappears\". Same with your tinnitus, only it'll take a little bit longer than that.\n\nOur brains are amazing and have crazy adaptive capabilities, also known as [brain plasticity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaDlLD97CLM). Your brain will begin to ignore the phantom ringing, but the ringing itself will not subside. I know how ludicrous this sound, but I have I personally have habituated to the sound myself, and I'm pretty much back to my normal life. Things like stress and caffeine can cause a spike in your T. For now, use background noise like rain drops, or white noise, perhaps a 10 hour video of a busy cafe (on safe volumes, of course). As always, seek medical or professional help nonetheless. ",

        "body": "Something a lot of people, especially younger people, don't realise about hearing loss is how much MORE there is to it than just \"needing to listen to things louder when you're old\" or \"some ringing\" to varying degrees. My father has hearing loss which he incurred on the job - he was a radio DJ in the 60s/70s and between the sound levels at work and the sound levels at concerts he went to for reviewing purposes, he did permanent damage to his hearing. Tinnitus is one element, hearing loss of certain frequences is another. \n\nBut the most toxic thing about his hearing loss is how it's affected his relationships. He is increasingly isolated as time goes by; he tunes out of conversations because he can't understand people in a crowd, so at every party we go to I look over and see him sitting there either playing on his phone or looking glazed or smiling & nodding... but he's always the first one to want to leave somewhere, dragging my mother with him because he's bored. So socializing has just become a chore.\n\nIt's also affected his relationships at home; he never hears us the first time we ask a question, but he's convinced it's because we're mumbling (we aren't). So he gets really ~~irate~~ irritated, even angry, and is frankly always ready to be in a bad mood. \n\nImagine if every single casual question your roommate/wife/husband/sibling/child asked you filled you with annoyance-to-rage. \"What would you like for dinner, Dad? Dad? Can you hear me?\" \"What?\" (said with a cold glare). \"What would you like for dinner?\" \"WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS.\" (said with total irritation, like we're being a huge pain in the ass). All of this rudeness, all of this anger, comes from being deaf as a post. \n\nIt would be tempting to think my dad's just an asshole with no manners, but he isn't - when he has functioning hearing aids and this problem is greatly reduced, his entire demeanor is different. He's easy-going, appreciative, participates, listens. But when his hearing aids aren't working, as they aren't now, he's rude, ornery, dismissive, and critically *doesn't listen anymore* because he know's it's just too much work and he won't hear it all anyway.\n\nI've known several people who've lost their hearing later in life, and they've all experienced this anger. It pushes people away, it isolates you, and leaves you feeling miserable. My great grandfather was stone deaf by his 90s and apparently used to occasionally pick up his walking stick at the dinner table, when people were talking amongst themselves (big family) and if he couldn't hear them he'd just straight up clear the table with the stick. Imagine how angry you'd have to be to do that? This was a man who adored his family, and was never in any way abusive or difficult before his deafness really set in.\n\nThis could be your life, all for the pleasure of hearing some music slightly louder on a bus... or going to a concert without earplugs. It's so unnecessary, and it's so common.\n\n\n*EDIT: Thank you to everyone who's commented/commenting still - I apologize if I've missed replying to anyone, due to the absolute avalanche of replies I received! There have been some really profound, touching and thoughtful remarks, as well as a ton of helpful information shared.*\n\n**EDIT 2: I'd like to add, in response to some comments saying my father's just a big giant douchecanoe, that this was written as one vignette into our lives. My dad's not a monster, and we love him very much. He isn't always angry - these things come & go. It's a struggle that has had a huge impact on our lives, but it doesn't define our lives, and it shouldn't define yours if you're going through the same thing. My father has many qualities that make him a great husband & father, and the thing that always keeps me from despair is that I know if I ever needed him to help me through a hardship he would, without question. If someone you love occasionally lashes out at you because they're in pain, it doesn't mean they don't love you... So if anyone who identifies with my father's perspective is reading this thread and is feeling down because of some of the negativity (a tiny minority in an overwhelming show of support), DON'T. Don't feel like you're an asshole because you have difficulty handling something difficult. Just do your best, and try to be communicative.**",

Since the time our ancient mammal ancestors evolved middle ear structures to expand the utility of that sense, it's played a critical role in sensing threats and hunting prey. \n\nAs we get larger, the utility of discerning smaller animals declines, both as threats and as food sources.  Of course, evolution is always limited to adapting old templates, but in young primates the utility of high pitch is slightly greater.

You shouldn’t be craving ~~a mind altering drug~~ weed(that you are not prescribed) right as you wake up. You shouldn’t be that averse to sobriety. \n\nYou have a problem. Address it.\n\nEdit: I should have clarified that waking up on your day off or whatever is different and am focusing more so on the people who wake and bake before say... going to work, for example— the people who seemingly need weed just to live their basic everyday lives. \n\nEdit 2: I also don’t hold the opinion that it’s *ALWAYS* bad, but habitually doing it more than say, once, maybe twice a week, or staying high all day often, is most likely indicative of a deeper rooted problem.\n\nEdit 3: I smoke weed, about once a week, after I get off work. I still hold this opinion. Even daily smoking is likely indicative of a problem.\n\nEdit 4: To you guys comparing THC to caffeine, I really think that’s an unfair comparison. I can’t respond to all of you, so I’m going to say it, here. CAFFEINE IS VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN THC. It is NOT a good comparison. Weed is notoriously used as an ESCAPE. Wake and Baking is often just escaping, thus why sobriety is mentioned. I understand the need to escape, but first thing in the morning? That is an issue.",

Some have things that tell you it is time to go to sleep. Caffeine jams itself into the lock on the sleepy time box so that your brain can't open it.

        "body": "Caffeine doesn't give you energy. It just disables you from feeling tired. You brain is a pretty well designed machine that will actually tell your body to get tired. Getting tired isn't like being a toy robot with a weak battery slowing down because it's running out of energy, actually humans in particular are kind of special in our ability to store energy. So yea, after a while, your brain releases chemicals that tell your body \"hey bud, I think you've had enough how about a nap?\". The reason it does this is because it would actually be dangerous to use all the energy on your body and collapse like that toy robot with the weak battery, you would literally be damaging your organs and muscles and stuff. Now you can kind of over drive your body using drugs to prevent your brain from releasing the tired chemicals. Caffeine is one of these drugs. Generally it's not bad for you, it has some minor side effects, it is minorly addictive, and generally speaking the degree to which you are able to push your body past the degree your brain under normal circumstances would normally keep you at isn't that bad even if people take stupid amounts of caffeine like with multiple energy drinks per day. On the other hand, drugs like meth will keep you WIDE AWAKE for like 4 days straight using similar mechanisms. Now this is really bad because your body does actually need to shut down and sleep pretty frequently and preventing it from doing something like that will cause problems. A lot of the features of meth addicts you see, generally thin and boney, come from the fact that while you are awake you have to keep metabolizing energy for your body. Humans naturally have like a 20-25% healthy fat composition. This is useful for a lot of things, for instance being totally healthy to just not eat for a days and during those days maybe walk like 50 miles, perhaps with some running to hunt something to eat. This is what gives us our endurance so we can do exterting stuff like running... for 25 mile marathons. Most mamals cant do this, like the health body fat percentage of a chimpanzee is like 5%. Because of this, they have to constantly eat, and while they may be able to run faster than a human they definitely can't out run a human. There is actually a form of deer hunting called endurance hunting where instead of shooting a deer to take it out,a  hunter will just jog through a forest, sometimes with a bag of rocks to scare a deer into running away. The hunter will just keep chasing the deer and scaring it into continuing to run away. After about 4 hours the deer will literally collapse and die, mean while the hunter is just a human who has been jogging for 4 hours. Physically exerting, most of us keyboard jockeys couldn't do that this weekend, but we could easily train to do it because our bodies are built for that kind of endurance. Most animals aren't. Anyways, back to drugs, the fact that a human can even survive smoking something like meth is kind of a testament to human metabolism and endurance because honestly if you made a chimpanzee or deer smoke meth they would go crazy for a few hours until they literally just ran out of fat and stuff to metabolize into energy and just die. This is why meth users are so thin and boney, the drug forces their body to over metabolize it's resources causing them to burn through healthy fat and muscle leaving them emaciated.",

So, if you're a regular coffee drinker, the \"burst of energy\" you feel is nothing of the sort: It's what normal people feel like all the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe method of operation is by blocking adenosine receptors. Adenosine is what the brain uses to determine how sleepy you are. However, with caffeine blocking them, adenosine builds up. When it does hit, it hits hard and there's a lot of it around. (This tolerance model is very much an ELI5!)",

    "body": "This morning, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed, mainly due to lack of sleep. I decided to go to Starbucks for some caffeine to help offset the long day ahead of me, as you do. At a traffic light really close to the drive-thru, I was right behind a large SUV sitting in the rightmost lane. I wanted to turn right, and they did not—I couldn't turn, but no biggie. After a long wait, light turns green, and they decide to turn right spontaneously. I was annoyed, but whatever. (No signs say you can't turn right on red.)\n\nThey turn into the Starbucks drive-thru, blocking me from going and making it so that I'd have to partially block the small road leading into the strip mall or circle around. I had to be somewhere soon, so I took my chances. They didn't pull in all the way, so I stuck out in the small street, annoyed. Luckily no one came behind me.\n\nI guess I was in an extra bitchy mood today, but I just started hating this lady and her stupid massive SUV and the little chihuahua hanging out her car window and the stupid TV's playing cartoons in the car and the 6 frappucinos they had to hand her. I thought, \"I bet she's one of those super shallow people who lives for the rat race.\" I pulled up to the window to get my drink, wanting this clearly shallow-ass lady to leave already.\n\nOnce I pulled up, they smiled, handed me my drink and said, \"The person in front of you paid for your order already.\"\n\nI had never felt so forcefully slapped by the universe before. I could practically hear the words \"shut the fuck up\" ringing in my dumb little brain. Immediately my day got 100 times better and easier.\n\nFaith in humanity restored, and I hope whoever I was so horrifically judging had a wonderful rest of their day.\n\nTL;DR I spent 10 minutes hating and judging the person in front of me, only to find out that they paid for my drink. Made my day, and also changed my life lol\n\nEdit: I posted on this sub bc I felt like a total asshole and like I fucked up being a decent person, I also fucked the 'pay it forward' up so yknow\n\nEdit #2: apparently people have posted very similar stories (to the point where ppl think I'd just copy it? it's not that good of a story lol) those are coincidental and this did actually happen to me this morning but if you think I'm boring and unoriginal don't upvote, just know you're not actually a detective calling me out on my bullshit\n\nEdit #3: sorry for so many edits...consequences to the fuck up were feeling like a complete ass",

I was standing behind this car in the drive thru taking forever to get her drink and then proceeding to chat with the gal in the shop for a good 5 minutes AFTER getting her drink.

Inflammasomes can drive chronic inflammation in the context of an infectious disease or cellular stress, and they trigger the maturation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Here we find that the expression of specific inflammasome gene modules stratifies older individuals into two extremes: those with constitutive expression of IL-1β, nucleotide metabolism dysfunction, elevated oxidative stress, high rates of hypertension and arterial stiffness; and those without constitutive expression of IL-1β, who lack these characteristics. Adenine and N4-acetylcytidine, nucleotide-derived metabolites that are detectable in the blood of the former group, prime and activate the NLRC4 inflammasome, induce the production of IL-1β, activate platelets and neutrophils and elevate blood pressure in mice. In individuals over 85 years of age, the elevated expression of inflammasome gene modules was associated with all-cause mortality. Thus, targeting inflammasome components may ameliorate chronic inflammation and various other age-associated conditions.\n\nYou might notice that the findings of the effect of caffeine aren't mentioned in the abstract, so here's the part of the paper discusses that:\n\n>Since caffeine antagonizes adenosine due to their structural similarity, we next asked whether caffeine levels were associated with inflammasome-module gene expression. To do this, we used a questionnaire consisting of a 15-item survey of dietary and pharmaceutical sources of caffeine (see Online Methods), derived from 120 of the most commonly consumed caffeinated products in the United States in 2007...\n\n...\n\n>We then compared the levels of caffeine and caffeine-derived metabolites in the sera from IMH and IML subjects. To do so, we used the metabolomics data that was previously generated and compared serum levels of caffeine and its metabolites paraxanthine, 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid, theophylline, theobromine and 1-methylxanthine, without adjusting for multiple comparisons. We found that, when considered jointly33, the IML group exhibited significantly elevated levels of these metabolites when compared to the IMH group (P < 0.01) (Fig. 6b). We also tested the effect of caffeine in vitro at concentrations that matched the estimated concentrations found in the plasma of coffee drinkers (10–50 μM)34. We observed a significant inhibition of IL-1β secretion (Fig. 6c) that is due to a decrease in NLRC4 gene expression, as indicated by both qPCR and protein analysis (Fig. 6d). Therefore, caffeine seems to impair the priming of the NLRC4 inflammasome.",

This can happen in several ways like the heart becoming more efficient at pumping blood or vessels getting better at supplying your organs.\n\nNicotine, caffeine, and stress all stimulate your heart to beat harder and faster when you’re at rest without the increased need for oxygen. This is a good effect at the wrong time because the rest of your body isn’t expecting it and doesn’t prepare itself, leading to long term damage overtime.\n\nIn conclusion: Using lots of energy trains your body to get better at sending oxygen to your organs, and makes your organs get better at extracting what it needs. \n\nThe secret to cardiovascular health is heart rate + muscles moving and needing oxygen.\n\nIf these two things don’t happen at the same time you get damage to your vessels, organs, etc.",

    "body": "Before we begin dear readers, a brief bit of backstory.\n\nI have found that every company has a Todd. You will know who your Todd is, because he is who you call when you don't know who to call. When the unthinkable happens and everything is on fire and there is no hope of salvation, Todd steps in to fix it. Todd spends his entire time just fixing the unfixable. He has been with the company since the dawn of time, knows the true names of several demons, and was in the room when the old magic was written. \n\nOur Todd has an elite team to be on call when stuff breaks. Each team member is the highest authority in the company for one specific thing or another. They are the elite. Their word is law and to question them is to question Todd.\n\nOur story begins shortly after I had accomplish greatest goal, and became the newest member of Todd's team. \n\nNow my company works with point of sale. We sell computers, software, printers, card readers, and pretty much anything you need to take money from someone else. \n\nAfter years working in the call center, I proved myself worthy of Todd's attention. I interviewed, tested, and became the specialist of Third Party Integration. My focus is the connection between our product, and whatever wierd stuff your company wants to use.\n\nExamples of this include getting smart lights to change on command from ordering kiosks, letting the staff control the new jukebox you bought with their employee ID cards, or getting the sales data for the day to report to your canadian counterparts in both French and English, but only if someone buys the poutine-saurus surprise that day. And other fun conundrums that only the client can fathom. \n\nIt is important to note that during my time in the call center, I was paid hourly. As a specialist, I would be made a salaried employee, and would be on call. After accepting the position,  I was told that I would have a trial period of one month to prove myself. I would remain hourly, but would have a pay increase to more closely match my expected rate as a salaried employee. I would have the title change and new responsibilities of my job, but I had this month to prove I was worth the extra denaro. \n\nThe first day of my new job. We get a call from one of our more needy clients. They lay out a series of demands\n\n1) all of their stores must be upgraded to Windows 10.\n2) as each store makes about $10k a day, taking them down for a remodel is not acceptable. \n3) All of these upgrades must be done overnight while the store is closed.\n4) if the upgrade fails, the store must be rolled back that night so thet can open hourly.\n5) the window of time to do one of these upgrades is eight hours\n6) the fastest they have been able to do one is ten hours.\n\nAll of this means one thing. They need a specialist to do the upgrades. One that knows their integration. I give Todd the \"Put me in Coach\" nod and a deal is struck. Todd is about to leave on vacation, which leaves me under the control of Steve, the director of The Support Center, who used to be my boss before i worked for Todd.\n\nI am now on overnights. Four nights a week I upgrade these stores. I supervise two to three technicians who are on site in seperate stores. I do all the software. They do the hardware. \n\nThis process is staggered based on timezones, so I generally am pulling twelve hour shifts. The OT is amazing, especially paired with the raise I got.\n\nFast forward a week or two. The initial batch does not go the best. I have a 40% failure rate. This is due to scripts provided to both the client and me by the various third party companies used by the stores, including their music, food delivery, and credit card processors. Everyone on their side knows who is the bad guy here. Talks are in place and we are moving forward. \n\nA meeting between the client and us is schedualed near the end of the week, right in the middle of my off time. As I said I am working twelve hours a day. I live a full hour from work, and for security reasons can't do these upgrades outside the office. I have ten hours to eat, sleep, get up, and eat again before work. Once I get to work, there are no breaks on the upgrade train. No lunch, no stopping. So i get home around 11 am each day. The meeting is set for 4 PM. I can't get any reasonable sleep, before the meeting or after. Steve demands that I be there to account for my failures. I already have another specialist designed as my proxy for these sort of meetings, because sleep is a thing. I also explain that I am still hourly, but he wont hear it. He insists that I need to be there to explain why the project is going so poorly, and that my explanation better not just be throwing other people under the bus. He tries to explain that i am salaried and therefore need to be there when the company needs me. Especially when I am the one who is screwing up. Again I try to remind him of my probationary period but he won't listen. \n\nAnd there my friends, begins the malicious compliance.\n\nI clock in at 10pm the day before the meeting. I do my upgrades, all three of which are successes, due to what I assume is a change in the third party back end. The scripts I am provided with work perfectly this time, and all goes well. The corporate contact I report to in the morning tells me the meeting is just to go over the new changes to procedure we went through that might, and I will get the cliffsnotes in my email. No need to attend the meeting. I thank them and sign out. Then I sit. For six hours I twiddle my thumbs, take a lunch break, (and a car nap) and wait for the meeting. When its time, I walk ipstairs to the top floor and the conference room, where everyone but Steve is shocked to see me. I calmly take my place and wait for the meeting to start, stating that I was asked to be here. \n\nThe meeting lasts 30 minutes, and consists of the new procedure, praise for my dillagence, and a quick overview of how the time table will change because of the past failures. It is noted that my performance has prevented a lot of the sites from failing when they would have otherwise, and the client is pleased with my work. Steve, who had previously blamed me for the failures, sheepishly agrees that I was a good fit for the project. Then the meeting ends with the best part. The person giving the talk states that she knows I am asleep right now, so she will go over the changes with me personally when I get in tonight. Meanwhile, the guy I asked to sit in on the meeting for me will work with them to set up the changes to be deployed, (about three hours of work) so that it's all ready when I get in at ten. The meeting ends. Steve makes a comment about the changes being done by someone with more experience and hints that it should be my responsibility. I cheerfully say that rather than waste my co-workers time, I will just do the changes myself. I have my third or fourth wind by now, and am ready to go. \n\nAt the end of day two, I have spent 36 hours at work. Caffeine is my only salvation, and we are almost done. Near the end, I am basically waiting for a technician at my last store to finish testing, so I tell him to call me, and shut my eyes for about half an hour, just to rest a bit. All is well. I get called, everything is green. The vigil is over. Two of my friends insist on driving me home, where I promptly pass out into the most heavenly sleep I have had in ages. \n\nI wake up to an email, asking me to head into work for a meeting with HR. It is my day off, so I am kind of perplexed. I head on in, and apologize for being fashionably late. The meeting is with the head of HR, who has a report that I was sleeping on the job. There is camera footage of my 30 minute power nap.\n\nI calmly explain that Steve had asked me to show up to the meeting, and then asked me to stay later to set up the changes, and by the time I took my nap (during what I called my paid 30 minute break) I had been in the building for 35 hours. I politely remind the HR head that I am on my trial period, and will be expecting overtime pay for that time. It came out to about 33 hours and change, due to my extended lunch break. \n\nTodd returned from his vacation and tore Steve a new definition of duties. From then on he would not be given control over Todd's team when he was away, and we would report directly to the CEO. The project completed without much incident. And I passed my probation with flying colors.\n\nEdit: a bit more info, since people are asking. Steve would later be fired several months later due to a similar situation where he threw someone so hard under the bus that everyone stopped and saw how uncool that was. He was replaced with new Steve, who is a superior Steve in every way.",

    "body": "I’m currently in bed, huddled under the covers and riding out the shockwaves of trauma from this event. \n\nMy first fuck-up was trying to cut out caffeine a few months ago. I succeeded, but also lost my tolerance for caffeine (was drinking an average of 8 espresso shots throughout the day). \n\nToday, maybe two hours ago, I went to a doctors appointment. This appointment was in a huge hospital, one that had a food court and of course, a Starbucks. It was a mental-health related program, so I was a bit on-edge afterwards. I saw the sign for Starbucks and the clouds of depression began to life. Oh hell yes, the sweet nectar of life beckons to me. \nI get in line and order a medium sized coffee, cream and sugar - something tame, I thought to myself. Not tame enough apparently. \n\nI got in the car and started to drive home. About ten minutes away, I feel a bubbling in my gut. Oh boy. It’s fine, I say to myself, I can make it home without incident. Oh, how wrong I was. \n\nWhile I had been focused on keeping my asshole clenched, I had forgotten that nearly every road and intersection on my way home was clogged up by construction. Detours everywhere. Every time I thought I was getting close to home, I was forced to backtrack and drive a few streets over. At this point, I’m sweating and shaking, my legs are essentially vibrating, and I have no idea how I haven’t passed out at the wheel yet. \n\nAnd then it hits me. The cramps. I got my fucking period. IN THE CAR. \n\nAny person with a uterus will tell you how bad cramps are until they are blue in the face. I will do the same, because when I ovulate, I get cysts all over my ovaries due to PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome). Needless to say, it makes everything way more awful than it needs to be. \n\nMy abdomen tightens up, trying to force all of the coffee-afterbirth and uterine tissue out of me, but I resist. I will NOT shit my car, and I certainly will not bleed onto my seats. That shit isn’t even paid off yet. \n\nI get re-routed for what feels like the millionth time, and finally I see it: a road to home with no construction. I step on the gas and swing around every corner with the gumption and moxie of an F1 driver. In doing this, I have fucked up again. \n\nI currently have an inner-ear infection, and in my haste I have shaken up all the liquid in my cochlea. Vertigo. Vertigo like you wouldn’t believe. \n\nTo recap: I’m holding in a torrent of liquid regret, clenching my pelvic floor muscles to keep as much of my uterus inside of me as possible, and now I’m dizzy enough that I could no longer tell if my eyes were crossed or not. \n\nI fly into my driveway, throw my car in park and yank my keys out. I run to my porcelain throne as fast as my entirely clenched body would allow me, all the while bumping into things in my way because the vertigo hadn’t gone away yet and I was effectively as coordinated as a drunk person. \n\nWhen I say it was a photo finish, I’m not joking. I started shitting BEFORE my ass even hit the toilet (everything landed in the bowl tho, thankfully). I was sitting there for, legitimately, nearly 45 minutes. 100% liquid. And it didn’t stop for more than three seconds at a time. Once it was over I felt like I had run a marathon wearing lead boots. All of my energy was gone. I crawled upstairs on my hands and knees with the intent of getting in bed, but had to make a mad dash for the bathroom once again and do it all a second time. Finally got myself in the shower to rinse off all of my sweat and potential residue of my poor choices... and then had to stop mid-shower for a third round of misery. I feel another round coming, so this is probably the end of my post. \n\nTL;DR - If you’re drinking coffee and have to drive home immediately after, maybe shit before you leave the coffee shop.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the gold, stranger!! I’m glad my story was deemed worthy!\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for ANOTHER gold and also platinum!! To answer some questions - yes I am staying hydrated. My mom bought me an absurd amount of Gatorade once she learned of my rectal exorcism. I also did not expect this to gain any attention whatsoever but thank you for the upvotes and kind words :)\n\nEdit 3: AND two silver? Damn y’all generous. Me and my burning insides thank you <3\n\nEdit 4: Tomorrow there may be a second TIFU in which I gripe about not posting this from my main account. Thank you for all the gold and silver and platinum, readers. I appreciate you!! I’m not feeling quite alright, so my father miiiiight be driving me to the hospital. I’m sure I’m fine but it’s better safe than sorry!!\n\nFinal update: I went to my primary care doctor. It’s not IBS, but apparently I am very much lactose intolerant. Makes sense now.",

One. last. final. warning.\n\nPeople definitely associate bitter flavors with medicine and medicinal effects. Sometimes makers of medicines or pseudo-medicines (the sodas Moxy and root beer, the Chinese syrup called *pipa gao*, and aromatic bitters being good examples) purposely select bitter tasting ingredients, to enhance the placebo effect of having feeling like you've taken medicine. Many active drugs are alkaloids, which like any alkaline substances trigger the bitter receptors. They're able to enter the body and trip receptors by dint of their acid-base chemistry. They're synthesized by plants both for their bitter tastes and their drug effects, both of which are aversive. \n\nI remember teaching my children that the reason you don't just go pick random plants and eating them willy nilly (unless you want to die), is that plants can't run away from things that want to eat them.

Cornelis. \n\nUnderstanding the role of bitter taste perception in coffee, tea and alcohol consumption through Mendelian randomization. \n\nScientific Reports, 2018; 8 (1) \n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-34713-z\n\nLink: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34713-z\n\nAbstract\n\nConsumption of coffee, tea and alcohol might be shaped by individual differences in bitter taste perception but inconsistent observational findings provide little insight regarding causality. We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses using genetic variants associated with the perception of bitter substances (rs1726866 for propylthiouracil [PROP], rs10772420 for quinine and rs2597979 for caffeine) to evaluate the intake of coffee, tea and alcohol among up to 438,870 UK Biobank participants. A standard deviation (SD) higher in genetically predicted bitterness of caffeine was associated with increased coffee intake (0.146 [95%CI: 0.103, 0.189] cups/day), whereas a SD higher in those of PROP and quinine was associated with decreased coffee intake (−0.021 [−0.031, −0.011] and −0.081 [−0.108, −0.054] cups/day respectively). Higher caffeine perception was also associated with increased risk of being a heavy (>4 cups/day) coffee drinker (OR 1.207 [1.126, 1.294]). Opposite pattern of associations was observed for tea possibly due to the inverse relationship between both beverages. Alcohol intake was only negatively associated with PROP perception (−0.141 [−1.88, −0.94] times/month per SD increase in PROP bitterness). Our results reveal that bitter perception is causally associated with intake of coffee, tea and alcohol, suggesting a role of bitter taste in the development of bitter beverage consumption.",

    "body": "Background - My lady love (LL) and I live in a house built in the early 1900’s with mostly original everything, including the sliding no screen having windows.  We typically only crack the windows or put in temporary screens when fully open due to not wanting the cat to get out.  Further, while sleeping I’m typically in the buff unless we have visitors over - story time!\n\nTalk about an amazing weekend... the northwest weather has been treating us well lately.  Saturday we went golfing, rode bikes to go eat and play some pinball, then basically enjoyed each other’s presence for the remainder of the day.  Sunday morning was starting off no different.  Looking forward to a quick walk and talk over some caffeine then commencing with our normal Costco run and likely some yard work, etc.\n\nTime to get up!  After handling some normal morning routines I head to the bedroom while LL finishes her routine in the bathroom.  I try to respect the neighbors by putting on some clothes while walking around downstairs with the blinds open.  The first thing I see are my Adidas basketball shorts from the early years (these things are over 15 years old and still going strong - love em!).  I pick them up, put them on, then hop on the bed and decide to take a tour of reddit.... Here we go.....\n\nNot 10 seconds later I feel that initial sensation you get when an itch creeps up, but on the base of the head of my dick.  (This all feels like slow motion)  I reach down to itch it and from the time I start moving my hand to the time I reached my dick the feeling went from itch to fire..  so instead of itching I pulled my dick out to observe for any visual signs of concern.  I didn’t really see anything... THE PAIN IS INCREASING!!\n\nAt this point I throw my shorts off and as soon they hit the ground I hear “BZZZZZZZZZZZZZBBZBZZ”.   \n\nMe: “BABE!!!!”  \n\nLL runs in asking what’s wrong. \n\nMe:  “I think a bee or wasp stung my dick!”\n\nLL:  “WTH do you mean a bee or wasp stung your dick!?!”\n\nI pointed at the buzzing shorts.  After regaining a bit of my composure I hammer fisted the shorts and confirmed that yes, yes in-fact a wasp was in my shorts and stung my dick.  \n\nLet me say one thing, I consider myself a fairly intelligent person but LL out does me here and in many other areas.. it’s one of the main reasons I adore this lady.  Either way, aside from being a smarty pants LL doesn’t handle high stress situations very well.  At this point my eyes are bugged out and she can tell I’m a bit concerned about my dick.  She grabs her phone and googles “wasp sting dick”.  Really.... anyways, she ends up finding stories about other people’s dick’s getting stung and is laughing... she’s lost god damn site of the mission.  \n\nMe:  “Babe.... maybe just look up wasp sting treatment”\n\nLL:  “ohhhhhh yeahhhhhhh - sorry”\n\nWasp Treatment - Clean with soap, treat with vinegar for 15 min, and then ice.\n\nCleaning with soap - check!  LL brings me a glass of white wine vinegar....\n\nLL: “to soak your dick....”\n\nI have to walk into the office and close the door because I’m so damn embarrassed that I’m soaking my dick in a good drinking cup full of vinegar.  15 minutes pass and I go shower.  Pain is all but gone and there is no swelling.\n\nAs I sit here typing this up I can still smell the vinegar on my finger and can only imagine how bad my dick smells.  This little bastard isn’t going to ruin my day; I have his corpse in a sandwich baggy and he will be going with us to Costco and our other adventures.  This is just in case my dick swells to the size of a grapefruit or something.  \n\nWell, thanks for listening and don’t forget to check your shorts!\n\nTL;DR - Put my shorts on without checking and got my dick stung by a wasp.",

I noticed a few wasps near by but they hadn’t been to close to me at that point. I was wearing a short skirt .... so the bus arrived and I get on and sit down. I jump up immediately as I feel a searing pain in my vajayjay, I’m shouting to my mum “ I’ve been stung I’ve been stung”. My mum asked where I had been stung. And by this point the entire bus is watching me jumping around screaming. I try to signal to my mum that I got stung on my lady garden. Jesus I’ve never felt pain like it. \nTo make matters worse... we get off the bus and go into a department store. My mum asks if they have a first aid kit.... a first aider appears and my mum says ( best enjoyed wet) has been stung by a wasp. Male first aid person asks where about. Commence the teenage humiliation of explaining you have been stung on you labia. The guy goes and gets me some vinigar and then leave us to deal with it. By this point my fouff has swelled up like I’d done the Kylie Jenner Lip challenge on the wrong lips. I can feel it swelling more by the second and can’t bear to look at it, I ask my mum to put some vinegar on it, and she said It looks like 2 fat hotdogs escaping from a bun, Do I want some ketchup and mustard on it too? \nI’ve never wore a thong with a short skirt again in wasp season. Lesson learned",

So this thoroughly freaked me out.\n\nI consider myself lucky though.  It crawled up out of my shorts, onto my back.  Out of all the possible outcomes, this was by far the most desirable.

That should equal to about 100-120mg of caffeine, but it can vary from shop to shop and brew to brew. As far as espresso goes it usually depends on your dosing and ratio. Typically a good barista doses within 10% of his basket size. So if he has a 17g basket he should be dosing near that. Then he has to choose a brew ratio. This can be a Ristretto, ( 1:1 - 1-1.25 ) a Normale ( 1:1.5 - 1:2 ) or a Lungo ( about 1:3 ) Normale is the competition standard for SCAA competition. if you dose 17g you should yield about 25.5 to 29 grams. All this has quite an effect on caffeine content. Shots can range from 40 - 180ish grams of caffeine. So there's far too many variables at a local shop for most baristas to give an accurate guess.\nTL;DR: Too many variables",

Higher genetically predicted blood caffeine levels were also associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. \n\nThe findings suggest that it may be worth exploring the potential for calorie-free caffeinated drinks to play a role in lowering the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. \n\nDr Dipender Gill, senior author for the study, from Imperial College London’s School of Public Health, said: “These findings offer important insight into the potential causal effect of caffeine on adiposity [obesity] and diabetes risk. However, further clinical study is warranted before individuals should use these results to guide their dietary preferences.” \n\nThe study was a collaboration between researchers from Imperial College London, the University of Bristol, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Uppsala University in Sweden.",

Compared to decaffeinated coffee, consumption of caffeinated coffee acutely increases arterial stiffness, and impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Caffeine has also been shown to eliminate the protective effect of ischemic preconditioning. There is evidence of an acutely elevated risk of acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death in the hour after coffee intake, but to our knowledge, there has not been any research to examine the risk of ischemic stroke associated with transient exposure to caffeine and whether the risk varies by the sources of caffeine.\n\nOur primary objective was to examine the association between caffeinated coffee consumption and the risk of acute ischemic stroke in the subsequent hour.\n\nCONCLUSION: Coffee consumption transiently increases the risk of ischemic stroke onset, particularly among infrequent drinkers.",

Saying something is \"good for you\" or \"bad for you\" is very challenging, given the huge variability from person to person. You know those commercials that say \"consult with your doctor before trying this exercise program\"? That's why. Reddit skews young and healthy, but the people I see are old, overweight, and sick. \n\nThere are numerous studies showing that consuming large volumes of caffeinated coffee increases longevity and improves quality of life. Is that because of caffeine? Antioxidants? Social effects? Some confounding variable like a good job or exciting hobby that causes people who would be happier anyway to consume more coffee?\n\nWe know that stress leads to increased levels of hormones like epinephrine (adrenaline) and cortisol. These hormones have wide-ranging effects beyond their immediate effects on the heart. Likewise, we know that exercise has a huge range of effects, from promoting the development of new neurons to promoting lower weight and better cholesterol levels that reduce the risk of atherosclerosis (one of the major forms of disease worldwide). \n\nIn a young person like yourself, drinking caffeine in large amounts will drive your heartrate up. Probably not a big deal. But in general, young people get their caffeine from drinks that have tons of sugar or fat (soft drinks or Starbucks-style abominations), so docs tend to make broad statements like \"drink less caffeine.\" Does that mean we know shit? No. Does that mean it's actually bad for you? Who knows. \n\nExercise is *probably* good for you, but if you're a marathoner with a massively hypertrophied heart and a resting heartrate in the 40s, does that make you much healthier than someone who just exercises a moderate amount, doesn't have bad cholesterol, or generally takes care of their health? I don't know. In fact, it may put you at a disadvantage. Given that most of the health problems in the US revolve around obesity and its consequences, though, docs are very likely to recommend exercise. \n\nCould all of this change? It sure could! Could some forms of chemical stress on the heart be good for it? Probably! But in the meantime, I'll tell you the same things I tell everyone: get some exercise and avoid stress. Life just feels better when you do that stuff. \n\nAnd everyone here who pulls out a study showing one finding or another: I can probably find a study showing the opposite.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold!\nEdit: 3 years later, there is a very good study suggesting that vigorous exercise **is truly beneficial** for overall mortality. I eat some of my words above, as this is truly a high-quality and large study. As to the physiology, I'm not going to speculate.\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2772939",

In fact, in the case of some drugs, the opposite will occur and your blood vessels will constrict. With your heart pushing faster through blood vessel or same or smaller diameter, this results in an increase in blood pressure. It's that chronic exposure to the increased blood pressure that can cause problems - it stresses the muscles in the heart and the blood vessel linings.

        "body": "Exercise Physiology major here with a background in cardiac rehab.\n\nPart of it has to do with the why. With aerobic exercise it's not just that your heart is beating faster. Your heart is beat to supply your body systems with enough oxygen and to remove buildup of CO2. Regular exercise causes your heart to pump more efficiently as your stroke volume (amount of blood pushed per heartbeat) and contractility improve (how hard it is contracting). You also improve in other ways, you develop more capillaries in your skin and muscle. Your muscles become more aerobic in nature by gaining more mitochondria. Your body becomes more efficient at providing oxygen, using oxygen to make ATP, then removing acid and Co2 buildup. Essentially it beats because your parasympathetic nervous system backs off control and your sympathetic nervous system picks it up and says \"GOGOGOGO!\".\n\nNow when your heart is beating fast because of drugs or anxiety it's not because your body needs more oxygen or waste removed. It's the drugs hijacking the receptors that normally control your heartrate and just telling your heart to go balls to the wall. With caffeine the heart rate increase can also be erratic which is more harm than good. To explain this you need to understand how the heart beats. You have atriums and you have ventricles. The heart can move blood because it always contracts the atriums then the ventricles. If the atrium or ventricle contracts twice in a row it is not really moving any blood. This can be very dangerous as it can lead to an arrhythmia or abnormal heart rhythm. \n\nThat being said, caffeine in appropriate doses has been found to be healthy for you for a variety of reasons that could be it's own ELI5 but try to keep it below the threshold that makes your heart race like a baby rabbit.",

This energy partially comes from stores within the muscles, but also from the bloodstream. The energy from within is stored in ways so that is requires very little oxygen to process, but it also only lasts a very short time. The energy from the outside is in the form of (mainly) fat and carbohydrates, and requires oxygen to properly process it. This in turn increases the need for oxygen, and the heart starts to pump faster, and you start to breath faster. Just getting your heart rate up doesn't increase the energy need, so you won't burn the calories. It also doesn't affect muscle and bone restructuring, so you won't get the same hormonal response, which is where a lot of the healthy things happen.",

Doing exercise, say 15 minutes of not holding onto the arms of a treadmill and walking up a slope is a proper way to determine the heart's function under stress, its called \"stress testing\" and will allow us to determine how the heart will respond to a true stressor when attached to an ECG, for example, are we seeing any signs of ischemia (lack of oxygen to the heart). When doing actual exercise, the heart rate increases and the stroke volume increases to a much higher amount than when only drinking coffee, and this increased cardiac output generally lasts for a longer period of time. \n\nSo more cardiac output, for longer = increased heart workout. Don't forget, when working out your muscles and lungs demand more oxygen too which is why the cardiac output goes up so much more than just with coffee or anxiety.\n\nYou can do one test that mimics the effects of exercise on your heart, its called the Persantium stress tests and used for people who can't walk or do the normal cardiac stress test.\n\nAny questions, just ask on here.",

Notice how when you drink the same amt of caffeine for a long period it loses its effectiveness. If you run 5 miles everday, soon your caloric expenditure will drop. This is because of adaptation. Simple example: Say you pound 5 starbucks coffees a day and are obese, or lets say even overweight. Your heart is doing ALL the work, besides the brain of course, to pump all your blood around the extra vasculature. When you exercise and you are overweight or obese, the \"work\" of distributing blood is spread out among lots of other processes and tissues. The heart, the muscles, different neurochemical complexes.. the list goes on and on. So the load is decreased on any one complex or process.\n\nTL;DR Stress is distributed throughout different processes and tissues during exercise vs. just one process or small amt of processes with processing caffeine.

    "body": "Why YSK: Most people can be comfortable if they figure out what causes their discomfort and deal with it and/or try these methods! I recently discovered that years of frequent discomfort was being caused by nipple chaffing, and bandaids basically cured it right away.\n\n1. Do yoga or stretches before and/or after bed. even 10-20 minutes helps, but the more the better.\n2. Take a shower and put on moisturizer right after. Never too hot or too long.  /u/dizzley would add that you should try a range of moisturizers until you find one to suit. People's needs differ. I use a product called Aveeno and my second choice is Aqueous Cream as it's called in the UK.  /u/kikistiel Would like to add to number 2, before you put moisturizer on gently pat a toner on as well. People always forget the toner step but it’s so important! Imagine rubbing lotion on an dry sponge (no toner) vs a wet sponge (toner). It absorbs into the skin so much better and really makes a difference. You can get toners super cheap and I swear it’s like night and day :)\n3. If your skin often feels irritated, try buying softer clothing like undershirts and underwear.  /u/stoicsticks said:  If you're not sure if a fabric is going to be scratchy to wear, try rubbing it lightly against the inside of your wrist. The skin there is more sensitive than your hands or fingertips.  \n4. If your nipples area often feels uncomfortable it could be due to chaffing. You can put on a bandaid with almond or olive oil.\n5. Correct your posture by being mindful of it throughout the day and doing stretches.  *Sleep in a good position with knee and neck support.  If your mattress sucks, biy a mattress topper.\n6. Foam roll and do warmups before and after exercising.  Always follow exercise routines to prevent muscle imbalances and to prevent overtraining.\n7. Take some deep breaths and relax.  Sometimes tension is held unconsciously, but you can consciously release it.  Relaxing on the exhale works very well for relaxing.\n8. Take care of your bodies basic needs which definitely includes exercise.\n\nSource:  [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-benefits-of-yoga](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-benefits-of-yoga)\n\nTips added by commenters:\n1.  /u/sojayn Check your sensory overload.  Sometimes (for some people) background noise/lights/temperature translates into a physical restlessness or discomfit. Especially when working or focused and forgetting about your physicality. Try nature sounds headphones, adjust lighting and dress for the temperature.\n2.  /u/5T6Rf6ut Drink some damn water. You're probably not properly hydrated.\n3.  /u/catfurcoat I recommend the Downdog app for yoga but if you want something for free then the FitOn app has some yoga and bedtime routines (as well as a lot of good exercise videos) or Yoga With Adrienne on YT\n4.  /u/jarredknowledge Strengthening our posterior chain goes a long way in alleviating issues surrounding static lifestyle and the inevitable posture issues that come with that\n5.  /u/skbat As an introvert - get some alone time. Read, watch tv, whatever. Get the house to yourself if possible. When I'm grumpy it's almost always because I need alone time.\n6.  /u/dvof meditate.  clear your mind and focus on yourself and surrounding. You'll become aware of tension in parts of the body that you hadn't before. Also try not to think about anything, your mind will probably wander off to something, but try to become aware of it and dissapate the thought. Then again focus on your body, breathing and surrounding again, actively thinking about nothing but the current moment. This basically gives your brain a moment to pause for a second and it really works.\n7.  /u/YourLocalAnarch Another really good tip from my occupational physiotherapist and especially if you work from home: Always have your mouse at the same level as your elbow. Doing it so won't force your body more than it should, especially your posture.  If possible have your screen at the same level of your eyes as well!  /u/LadyJig adds:  In reference to sitting at a desk:  A good quality chair is super important. You may here the term \"ergonomic\" thrown around a lot, but it's actually incredibly important. Chronic pain often arises from poorly fitted but often used equipment, like a desk chair. Ideally, you want your knees to be at a 90deg angle, good back and neck support, and your arms to rest comfortably at a neutral angle. It's also preferable to keep your head straight as much as possible, otherwise you will fatigue your neck.  If you'd like to see how good your desk is, check out this assessment!  Source: me, a Human Factors Engineering student who did a gigantic project on ergonomics\n8.  /u/rojm Write down the things that are bothering you and what you will do about it or how you should feel or cope or learn from it. I use the checklist in my phone’s notes app. Negative thoughts have been intruding and they are very irrational and I know this and writing down how I felt finally turned off those thoughts.\n9.  /u/Kost_Gefernon Feeling irritated or that you are tensing up or clenching your teeth and can’t seem to stop?  Force yourself to smile, then open your mouth wide to stretch your jaw. Repeat a few times.  Add in some double chins (moving your head back to make a double chin while keeping your head upright), and rub the back of your neck.  Poor head posture can cause a chain reaction of tension that leads to tight jaws and a headache. You don’t know what is causing it, which antagonizes the negative feeling, and the situation feeds itself. You can turn it off by smiling.\n10.  /u/LiezLies Left to right rhythmic movements and things that engage symmetrical body movements - things like walking up and down the hall while on a phone call, swimming laps (particularly breaststroke), knitting or crocheting. We see this in animals when they pace up and down.\n11.  /u/LiezLies Intuitive movement - quite literally shaking it out. Put a song on, and move your body however feels good, don’t try to dance, just move your body, including shaking movements. We see this in dogs when they shake after a tense situation.\n12.  /u/awreathafranklin You might be in actual danger. I'm surprised no one has said this yet. We have been taught to \"rationalise\" warning signs are bodies are telling us. Assess your surroundings. Is there anyone you are unfamiliar with or who just entered the immediate space? Is that when you became \"uncomfortable\"? In the event you need to get out, where are you exits? Does anyone know where you are right now? Is there anyone around you that you can trust? Trust your gut, worst case you're wrong and still safe. Uncomfortable can mean so many things. LPT: Become comfortable with your body and learn to listen. (I'm adding that doing slow deep breathing can take you out of fight or flight mode)\n13.  /u/magicEightballA_A Food is also important. Eat fruit man. Lots of it. I hate eating vegetables but I love fruit so started eat more of that and lemme tell you, it helps. I have lots more energy throughout the day and it definitely helps. I eat bananas in the morning, some citrus like oranges after lunch and sometimes an odd pear or apple with dinner.\n14.  /u/7moonwalker7 Go alone for a walk in a forest or park. Or any nature area. I love going deep into a forest at night, especially in the winter when I can enjoy the stars, northern lights and the snow covered trees.\n15.  /u/Stalinwolf Take some magnesium too. 150mg of Magnesium Citrate is my jam.  /u/ispebblespeople DONT supplement minerals at random! Minerals in too high amounts will poison you. The tip should instead be to take a blood test to check your levels and supplement accordingly, or track your diet for a few days in e.g. chronometer and supplement only if you're consistently low balling certain minerals  (I'll add:  make sure you supplement anything your diet is low in, or adding nutrient dense foods with what you're low in of course is better.)\n16.  /u/Ill_Age_1853 I used to have trouble sleeping until I started stretching my knees out\n17.  /u/shapeshifter83 My discomfort has always come from my lower digestive system. My tips are: smaller portions, keto/low carb (less gas production down there), avoid coffee/dairy/spicy, intake dietary fiber on the regular or take a fiber pill, regular exercise, pants that sit very high and fit right.  Also I'm mildly autistic with the typical autistic tendency to dislike things on my skin while paradoxically also disliking to feel uncovered, sleeping naked underneath a weighted blanket has been great.\n18.  /u/steakndbud I'd recommend a theracane over foam rolling. Much more intuitive to use correctly.\n19.  /u/Mondonodo I'm gonna be the horndog of the thread when I say this, but maybe try masturbating. Can be a nice stress release.\n20.  /u/KeithMyArthe I'd add... listen to any feelings of nagging dread or doubt. \n I developed sepsis due to a blockage in one kidney. There was no pain, pretty much asymptomatic except for an overwhelming fear that something wasn't right.  The ER doctor told me that if I had slept on it I might not have made it to the hospital. He estimated 10 to 12 hours before it became unlikely they could have dealt with it as effectively as they did.\n21.  /u/DopeandDiamonds If you are uncomfortable just ask yourself  \"Am I doing OK?\"  \"Do I feel comfortable?\"  \"How can I be happy in this moment?\"  So much of our internal discomfort comes from simply not checking in on how we are doing mentally. Some people need that outlet of being asked how they are to really take a moment and reflect.  It sounds dumb and simple but sometimes we need to have a mental check in. I have done this and burst into tears without knowing I was holding shit in that I couldn't manage.\n22.  /u/marlboroprincess I’m late to this party, but make sure you’re aware of your stimulant intake. Too much caffeine in a day will give me a “bees in my teeth” type feeling. Like my skin is itchy on the inside of my body. I can’t shake and it can trigger a panic episode until i remember that i had a giant coffee or whatever. Have a glass of water, it will help your body metabolize caffeine :)\n23.  /u/Sapiencia6 Sometimes you might find yourself irritable and annoyed by every little thing, the natural noises of your environment are suddenly grating, the light just isn't right, etc. Stress and anxiety can cause your sensory input to be overwhelming. Even if you don't feel that you would have any reason to suffer from sensory overload, keep some grounding exercises in your back pocket for when something \"feels wrong\" but you don't know why.  1.  Focus on a tangible item in your environment. Think of as many adjectives as you can to describe it using each of your senses. What can you say about its visual appearance? What does it smell like, or what do you imagine it smells like? What would it sound like if you used it to make a noise? What does it feel like? What would it taste like? Do this for as many things in your surrounding as you need until you feel relaxed.  2.  Close your eyes and take deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Count slowly to seven while you inhale, hold for seven, and time your exhale to seven. Then focus on tensing and releasing every muscle in your body, one by one, working down from your head to your toes. You may not realize where your body is holding tension, especially in your face. Tense your forehead, release. Tense your eyes, release. Your nose. Your jaw. Your whole face. Your neck. Your shoulders. Etc. By the time you reach your toes you will have hopefully relaxed your whole body.\n24.  /u/glockGotaDick  Also try the Wim Hof method, super relaxing breathing method",

We're always told there's some mystical perfect posture that iliminates all the pains of the body but it's not true.\n\nWhat is true, is that your best posture is your next posture. Any posture that you stay in for too long is going to give you discomfort, being slouched is okay, being upright is okay, being all twisty and bendy is fine, just switch it up!\n\nThis applies to desk work. You can try to find the best chair, and the best desk, but really what will make a difference is movement. Changing how you sit, standing up (standing desks are great) taking your laptop and going to work on the floor, on the coffee table, etc.\n\nSame with sleep. There isn't an optimal perfect position to sleep in (SLEEPING ON YOUR STOMACH IS FINE!), Just have a minimal amount of pillows (ideally only one) so that your body is encouraged to change positions often in the night. That's how you wake up without being stiff like a board\n\n\nLong story short: movement is your best friend. Always be switching positions. You guys would be amazed at how many \"perfectly straight\" backs I see on a daily basis that are in tons of pain cause they have no idea how to slouch properly.",

Most often these compounds are organics that have leached out of container closure systems into the product (think BPA from a water bottle into water, or in the case of this paper, hydrocarbon, which the article incorrectly assumes are associated with combustion, more likely leached from the plastic container).\n\nI bet if they used GC/MS they would have found many, many more low molecular weight organic contaminants in these samples, as a GC is going to have better chromatographic resolution, and is more suitable for examining compounds present in an aerosolized sample. (Ideally both GC/MS and LC/MS are used.\n\nIt's absolutely not surprising to find a wide variety of organic contaminants in vape aerosols, many are probably very hazardous too; benzene toluene, PAH's, nitrosamines; all of these carcinogenic compounds are likely a product of heating a liquid system in a plastic container. However, dose is what's important here. You inhale all of these molecules when you start your car, or when your manning the grill during a BBQ.

        "body": "While dehydration can cause fatigue, this is usually a symptom of advanced cases. It's very unlikely that you will experience dehydration of severity enough to cause fatigue within one day in a life where you have ready access to water.\n\nAfternoon tiredness is a common and typical phenomenon caused by a combination of factors:\n\n* Humans aren't meant to sleep in one big 8 hour block, then stay awake for 16. We're meant to nap. We did nap for generations before the industrial revolution and later reinforced after WW2\n\n* After eating, your parasympathetic nervous system becomes more active, suppressing your sympathetic nervous system. In essence, fight or flight is suppressed by \"rest and digest\". So you feel sleepy after lunch.\n\n* Extensive concentration, especially at a computer screen, leads to fatigue and eye strain, both of which can make naps more tempting.\n\n* Many people do not get enough sleep. When endogenous steroids are high in the morning, it keeps you awake despite your lack of sleep. As corticosteroid levels dip in the afternoon, you start to feel how tired you actually are, and become sleepy as a result.\n\nI am kinda sick of Reddit paroting this \"hydro homie\" psuedoscience - bro science, if you will.\n\nWater is great, but it's not the cure to everything that so many people seem to think it is.\n\nThe beat advice anyone can give about water consumption is:\n\n>Drink if you are thirsty.",

    "body": "Making a long story short here: the day after Christmas, my 16 year old niece, Emma, called me sobbing, begging to come live with me. She said her house was a prison and her parents wouldn’t let her be happy anymore. We talked for a while and what she told me was confirmed as true by my sister when I talked to her.\n\nEmma has always had lopsided grades, with As in English and history but Cs and Ds in math and science. This time last year, she was diagnosed with ADHD, which I knew because I was diagnosed a few years ago and my sister called me to ask my opinion on how well non-medication treatments worked, since her husband was adamantly opposed to letting Emma take what her doctor prescribed for fear of her becoming addicted. Medication and intuitive living has always worked best for me, but when I was pregnant with my kids and couldn’t take meds I got by with the recommended ADHD diet and exercise regime and a good routine.\n\nIt turns out my BIL has taken that into hyperdrive and gone full prison guard on Emma’s life in order to get her grades up. She has a strict routine that only includes school/studying, exercise, and family meal times. She is not allowed any contact with friends outside of school, and eats a special diet that doesn’t include dairy, caffeine, or sweets of any kind. Everything “distracting” has been taken out of her room, including ALL of her books and beloved paintings by my late mother. Her science and math grades have come up to Bs, which my BIL insists means the routine is working but still can’t be eased up on yet, since she hasn’t come to her “full potential”. The incident that triggered her phone call (she stole her brother’s phone while he was sleeping because she’s not allowed a phone or unsupervised computer time) was her being banned from celebrating Christmas with the family, since it would be a deviation from her routine.\n\nI feel like this has fallen into awful territory and has only gone on so long due to the current craziness. I got my sister on the phone, and she broke down crying, saying that she’s begged her husband to ease up but that openly instituting a lighter set of rules or telling Emma to ignore him will absolutely lead to a divorce. She says she’s weighed the options and since her husband would definitely get 50-50 custody of the kids, spurring a divorce to get Emma out of BIL’s rules ½ the time for the next 2.5 years of highschool isn’t worth the kids being in a broken home and losing her kids ½ the time, especially with the other two still just 13 and 10. She said she'd \"work on him\", but according to my nephew, my BIL has been even harder on Emma since he found out we talked. I think CPS and the school need to be aware of this, but my dad says \"it's not against the law to be strict\" and my husband says I would be wasting resources calling them since it's \"not serious enough\" for the courts to get involved. I just don't know what else to do. I feel like CPS could at least get Emma real treatment.",

He can’t take away her basic necessities (food, water, clothing, shelter), or he would be squarely be in the abuse/neglect category and would be more actionable by CPS. The reason he’s so forceful is because it’s working, so he feels justified and empowered to do more to push her to perform. If she takes that from him, he has no power and no results to hide behind. \n\nAnother option is to anonymously call CPS for isolation abuse and have it documented. CPS will investigate and interview both your sister and BIL as well as the kids, at which point your sister and niece can voice their concerns openly to the case worker and see what the case worker can do to help. At the very least, maybe it will lay the groundwork in case BIL does go for a divorce. Your sister should talk to a lawyer before convincing herself to stay because she feels he would “definitely get 50/50 custody”. With your niblings being older, they would likely get a say in where they live and how often they visit, so 50/50 custody is not guaranteed. \n\nI wish your family the best of luck in this.

Having 2 reports will make CPS even more concerned about Emma. Emphasize that they're isolating her. Isolating a human being is abusive. It is abuse, no matter what anyone says. To prevent your BIL from using COVID as an excuse for isolating her, point out that she can't even contact people, and that the only way she contacted you was when she stole her brother's phone to call you. Push for an intervention. The school might even call CPS for you, and they might be able to start an intervention. CPS won't be able to charge your BIL with abuse obviously, but they can definitely require him and the entire household to get psychological help. You REALLY need to emphasize the isolation part and the strict diets, because your brother in law is going to end up killing Emma one way or another. Whether that's her taking her own life, or him abusing her so much that it kills her motivation and chances of success. Please update us. I hope you can help Emma!\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add that the strict diets might lead to eating disorders in the future, and you should say that when you call CPS on your own.",

        "body": "Your brain knows when it needs to sleep by measuring a chemical which builds up during the day. When you sleep, this chemical, adenosine, gets cleared out - and then once you're awake, it builds up again, slowly. The more of it you have in your brain, the tireder you become. Then eventually you fall asleep, and your brain clears the adenosine out and resets it to zero for the next day.\n\nCaffeine basically blocks your brain's ability to measure this chemical. There isn't an easy way to ELI5 this part, but your brain has these things called \"receptors\" which this chemical connects with, and that's how the brain knows how much of it there is - caffeine gets in between the chemical and the receptors, preventing them from connecting together. So even though you have a bunch of this chemical in your brain because you've been awake for a long time (or you didn't get enough sleep last night), caffeine falsely tricks your brain into thinking \"wow, there's basically no adenosine here at all, I must be properly well rested and not have any need for sleep right now!\" This leads to a clear-headed and alert state of mind, as your brain isn't trying to get you to wind down for sleep because it thinks you don't need any. Think of the receptors like smoke detectors - caffeine stops them from detecting the smoke.\n\nThe reason you get a headache from withdrawal is because unfortunately, eventually your brain cottons on to the trick caffeine is playing, and it creates new receptors to measure the levels of adenosine. So it's like \"Ah, you're blocking my receptors to stop me measuring it! No problem, I'll make new ones, and there won't be enough caffeine to block *all* of them\". This is why, over time, you need more caffeine in order to feel the same effects. The brain simply adjusts to the caffeine and tries to return your sleep cycle to normal. The headache arises because when you *don't* drink caffeine, your brain falsely believes you're a lot *more* tired than you are, because these receptors are measuring all of the adenosine in your brain - but your brain had become used to not measuring much of it at all, because the caffeine was blocking it. So now, it thinks you're suddenly absolutely *wrecked*, because out of nowhere, it's detecting a whole bunch of adenosine that it wasn't detecting before.\n\nAs regards permanent changes, we don't really know. Abstaining from caffeine for several weeks causes a \"reset\" of sorts - after a few weeks, your brain realises that most of the extra receptors it created are surplus to the amount of adenosine you actually have, and it starts getting rid of them again. In theory, there's no reason why this would change over time, but it's not fully understood or known right now, so nobody can say for sure.\n \n \n \n**EDIT**: Holy *shit*, I did NOT expect this level of interest when I posted this! Thanks for all the precious metals, kind caffeinators!\n\nA lot of people have written some incredibly interesting questions and replies in response to this, I'll hopefully be able to answer a lot of them tomorrow!\n\nTwo things:\n\n1: You're absolutely correct, caffeine also has a vasoconstrictive (narrowing blood vessels) effect, but this effect itself isn't what causes the headache - it's actually caused by the blood vessels rapidly *dilating* when the caffeine wears off. This is an important aspect of the caffeine-related headache which I forgot to mention, as I was thinking purely of the effects on brain chemistry - which also play a role in adding to and triggering headaches. Thanks to everyone who pointed this out!\n\n2: \"Tireder\" may indeed not be a word in most English speaking countries, but I can assure ye that it is used extensively in Ireland 😂 The Irish dialect of English has a lot of leftover quirks, because a lot of our grammar is derived from the original Irish language and then transposed on top of English, which we started speaking because our lovely ancestral neighbours obnoxiously objected to us speaking Irish whilst they were pillaging the place and generally getting up to all kinds of mischief. I blame whatever primordial substitute we had for Guinness all those hundreds of years ago. And this comment is of course meant in jest, I adore our present-day English neighbours and can be immediately and helplessly hypnotised by a woman speaking in an English accent 😂\n\nFinally, the rambling nature of the above comment most likely came about because while caffeine can keep us physically awake, it cannot stem the inevitable descent into madness and moronity which accompanies staying up all night partying two nights in a row. Ergo, I will continue answering everyone's questions tomorrow morning 😉",

This is my attempt at ELI5ing it. \n\nImagine that your brain has a lot of workers (receptors) that count the number of a certain enemy (adenosine) and the brain sums up those readings to calculate the total number of enemies. Now imagine that there are thugs (caffeine molecules) that strike the workers and leave them unconscious for some time. More the thugs, less is the number of workers that come back and report the numbers, and so lesser is the total. Hence the brain is tricked into thinking that everything is alright, Enemy isn't that strong and there's no need to fight back (sleep). Hence the alertness for some time when you take caffeine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut over time the brain realises that some of it's workers aren't coming back, so in order to compensate for that it sends out more workers for counting.

        "body": "There are two types of drugs; stimulants (which increase certain chemical reactions which essentiallymake you feel more alert, and can increase heart rate, reaction time etc.) and depressants (the opposite of stimulants- make you feel less alert). They react with your brain cells in several ways; they can either block one effect (i.e., tiredness) or mimic another (i.e., alertness) or both. Like with any drug, your brain tries to \"undo\" the effect by producing chemicals that do the opposite of what the drug does.  \n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and therefore makes you feel more alert, and your brain reacts to this by producing more depressing chemicals, to attempt to maintain a balance of chemicals (\"equilibrium\"). (Think like your mixing hot and cold water to maintain lukewarm water) So the caffeine heightens your awareness, thins the blood, and increases your reaction time among other things. The brain tries to lower this effect. Once an individual habitually consumes caffeine, or is caffinated a high percentage of time, thr brain is ready for it and produces more and more of the opposite effect. This can cause the headaches in those people who get headaches without caffeine. One of the reasons is because the blood in your veins is no longer being thinned and puts strain on your blood vessels in the head. Another is that it has too much of the natural depressants there, this can lead to the extra tiredness people experience as a crash. Once the caffeine is gone, the natural depressants stick around for a little while later. Your brain then also notices the other chemicals that the caffeine blocks to make you feel tired, so there are extra depressants in the brain. Like most drugs, the brain will realize when usage goes down and will stop artificially inflating the other natural chemicals. Where caffeine isn't as \"drastic\" as more heavy drugs, there aren't really any known long-term effects. \n\nAlthough caffeine is mostly harmless, if you consume too much for long periods of time you can have negative side-effects such as constipation or heart attacks.

The reason why most people get the boost is because caffeine inhibits the receptors for the hormone that makes you tired. Throughout the day this builds up in your barin, making you more tired, and goes away as you sleep. As you use caffiene, you can stay awake longer. But if you use too much, your brain will compensate by making more receptors, so you need more coffee to get the same effect. This is why people get groggy and have headaches when they don't have their coffee. The good news is this process is completely reversible. After about 2 weeks of not drinking coffee, your receptors should return to a natural level. The experience of dropping caffiene has a similar effect on your body to something like quitting smoking, but the effects are much more mild and managable.",

I’m currently very early into a wanted pregnancy but like anyone, am worrying about the caffeine I had a few weeks ago, or the fact that I didn’t take folic acid leading up to the pregnancy test. I want to see whether my lil embryo is developing correctly, but nowhere around me will see me for an ultrasound before 7 weeks, and even then the nurse said they wouldn’t be able to detect congenital defects or deformities since the embryo would be so little. I hate the 6-week abortion ban, but I figured I was being proactive and would be able to terminate if something was horribly wrong - like the neural tube didn’t close or the fetus wasn’t viable or something. The nurse I spoke to told me that a fetus is considered “viable” if there is a heartbeat (which, shockingly, happens around 6 weeks). When I said “so *anything* could be wrong but as long as it’s got a heartbeat it’s considered viable?” She said YES, y’all! FUCK that. \n\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re proactive. It doesn’t matter if you request earlier tests. They didn’t make an abortion ban to keep fetuses safe. They made the 6-week ban in order to trap us. They literally just want to force us to have babies, which may or may not be compatible with life, at any cost. I am so frustrated and I’m hoping SO much that everything is fine (and it probably will be!) but I’m just mad.\n\nEDIT: YES!! The ever-anticipated Reddit Cares report came through! I won the bet, and now my husband owes me a nice dinner and a foot rub. Thanks, pathetic redditor - you’ve made me very giddy this morning. Perhaps ditching caffeine will be easier if I simply replace my morning cuppa with a nice tall glass of bitter men’s tears?\n\nAlso, thank you so much to everyone who has helped educate me, reassure me, and contribute meaningfully to the discussion. For those asserting: “just move” or “sorry you live in a fascist state.” Well 1) have we already forgotten than GA went blue for Biden? I’ve lived in Georgia a long time and I’ve seen it’s politics changing recently. I’m proud to be part of that change, and perhaps it’s naiive but I truly believe my party’s work here is not done yet. 2) Shortly after we saw this very encouraging swing toward the left, we had the opportunity to buy a home, which makes more sense financially than renting. We were very fortunate that everything fell into place. We are now financially tied to Georgia for at least a few more years. Literally days after we made it official, the Supreme Court documents leaked. I’m not going to apologize for not having preternatural visions of this horrible event, and if in your mind I “deserve whatever’s coming” because of my inability to move, or that I’m stupid for living in the south where we can afford to live, then perhaps you should take a look in the mirror and work on *gestures at all of you* that.",

Doctors say that what starts at around 6 weeks is actually not a heartbeat (blood flowing through valves of the heart) as a heart does not even have valves at that stage of development. The valves can't be heard until around 10 weeks of development. Both the electrical activity and an actual 'heartbeat' are not medically indicative of odds of the pregnancy surviving to term.\n* at 6 weeks, medically speaking, the correct term would still be 'embryo'. It's not even a fetus yet. But when we picture a 'fetus' we see a little person, not a a 1/2 inch long clump of developing cells, which is what it is at this point. They do choose their words carefully for impact but not truthfulness, don't they?\n* If they wanted to do this scientifically, we could.

They don't care if it grows up to be 9 years old and murdered by a gun. They don't care if that child's family can't afford to buy their child lunch at school.  \n\nStates are telling women that are high risk for ectopic pregnancies that they cannot do anything to help them until 12 weeks. The average Fallopian tube ruptures 8 to 10 weeks into an ectopic pregnancy. Women have to be going into sepsis and at significant risk of death or destruction of their reproductive system to receive help.\n\nIt's about putting women in where they perceive their place is. The cruelty and destructive implementation of all of these new rules illustrate that quite well. It was entirely possible to enforce more \"reasonable\" abortion restrictions that 90% of people would be fine with tolerating. \n  \nThey want you to feel powerless and scared. And we were gaslit for decades for fearing this.",

In the UK the 20 week scan is called the anomaly scan for this reason. \n\nSo no - at 6 weeks or so they can only check that development is on track for the gestation and that the embryo is in the uterus. That’s it. Even a molar pregnancy may not be detectable until 7 or 8 weeks.

Original post by u/reddithrowawa45 in r/amitheasshole**\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**AITA for insisting my brother’s girlfriend proves she’s pregnant or she has to move out?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/prvv8r/aita_for_insisting_my_brothers_girlfriend_proves/) - 20 September 2021\n\nMy (f20) brother (24) has been on and off with his girlfriend (27) for a couple of years now. It’s been the same song and dance, they’re happy for a few weeks, then something small happens, they argue, it gets really nasty, and they make up and back to a loving couple. When i learned my brother got kicked out of his apartment and needed a place to stay i offered him the extra room in my apartment and my brother agreed to pay rent, help with bills, and pitch in with food. \n\nFor three months now, she’s been announcing she’s pregnant. She alone will eat a snack box with 50 small bags of chips in a week. i tried to reason with her and get her to cut back (not only from overeating but she was running us low on food) but she insists she and the baby are healthy and it’s just cravings blah blah blah. \n\nSince last month, most of what my parents sends to my house (my mom is a couponer so she bulk shops and give away what she has too much of) my brother’s girlfriend is the first to get into it and a large portion of it is gone by a few days to a week. From a 24 case of monster (the energy drink if you’re not familiar) 8 will be gone in a week from just her.\n\nShe eats a hell of a lot of food too, most of which no pregnant woman should be consuming so much of and yes i know all pregnancies are different but words can’t explain how much she eats in one sitting.\n\nSo, today i had seen her drinking coffee and after her 2nd cup i asked her if she should be drinking so much and she said her doctor told her it was fine and she had no worries. When i suggested she take on a healthier diet for the baby she just scoffed and walked out. \n\nI went and asked my brother if he’s been to any of her doctor appointments or even seen a positive pregnancy test and he said he didn’t. I confronted her about it and she said she didn’t have to prove anything and started to get defensive. I told her she needed to show a test or some proof of going to the doctor or she needs to move out as she doesn’t help at all.\n\nMy brother started defending her and changed his answer from not seeing any proof to seeing her pregnancy test. My parents got word of what i said and my mom says i was in no place to say anything and every woman’s body is different and i wouldn’t know since i’ve never been pregnant. AITA?\n\nVerdict: NTA\n\nEdit: i did talk to her a while ago about getting a job as well as helping out financially and she said she’d start and never has.\n\nRight so based on majority of the comments i overstepped yes but i’m going to go with my gut on this one and give them their 30 days notice and call it a day.\n\nI’ll for sure update you guys in a month (when they’re to be gone) and let you all (who’s interested) know what’s happened by then!\n\nI keep repeating myself let me add my brother knows everything i’ve said (the excessive caffeine, no ultrasound etc).\nYes my brother still buys her tampons monthly and i know this because he goes with me when i buy mine. \nNo i was not faking concern by the coffee comment. She drinks 2 cups of coffee a day along with a monster that’s a ton of caffeine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**UPDATE: AITA for insisting my brother’s girlfriend proves she’s pregnant or she has to move out?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/qbxz93/update_aita_for_insisting_my_brothers_girlfriend/) - 20 October 2021 \n\nOk so i gave my brother and his girlfriend the 30 days notice and they were to leave this Friday but as of last Friday, i have my place to myself again. \n\nBasically they fed me a bunch of lies since i gave them the 30 days notice. First, it was “she cant get an appointment or an ultrasound because of all of the covid patients”. Then, brother’s gf shows me a sonogram picture from her phone (that i later found on google images). I asked why it was on her phone she said it was emailed to her after her doctors appointment (that she couldn’t get?) \n\nThen my brother brought home baby clothes last week (to sell the lie i guess?) but they weren’t clothes for a newborn, It was a lot of 9-12mo and 2t. When i asked him why none were proper clothes for newborns he said “so he can grow into them” (was told she was pregnant with a girl)\n\nI didn’t bother to ask anymore questions because i knew it was going to be lies on top of lies. Then Friday, i got home to them arguing and at each other’s throats.  Eventually i called the cops because they weren’t letting up. At this point they both had come clean with the “truth”. \n\nBrother’s “truth”: His Gf is the reason he was kicked out of his place then she needed a place to stay because her parents kicked her out so she forced him to let her stay in my house by faking being pregnant . He said after the first month he knew she wasn’t pregnant because she got her period but she forced him to keep up the lie so i’d let her stay. \n\nGF’s “truth”: Brother invited her to stay at my place and to make sure i wouldn’t say no he told her to fake a pregnancy and i’d be sympathetic (won’t go into detail but i’m 100% certain that part she said was true) and i wouldn’t question her using tampons as he’ll make up a lie for her. She said he told her to eat up all of the food because it’ll make it all seem legit. \n\nSo, that’s about all, i’m still unsure who’s telling the truth but they both got all of their belongings and went their own way (i assume) so it’s not my problem anymore.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Reminder - I am not the original poster.**",

        "body": "The smoke/coffee smell is actually the chemicals that addict. It's why the smell is so strong to humans even when the air is full of other scents: the chemicals that cause the smell-sensation also have a huge effect on our brain chemistry.\n\nTo detail this a bit more: these chemicals are called heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs for short), a subgroup of which are called beta-carbolines. The \"typical\" beta-carboline is norharman; some others are called harman, harmalol, harmaline, harmine, tetrahydroharmine, etc.\n\nThe thing with these so-called Harmala alkaloids is that they tend to inhibit the activity of certain human enzymes called monoamine oxidases (MAOs for short). There are two types of MAOs, MAO-A and MAO-B. Both are very important in breaking down brain neurotransmitters, and inhibiting their activity causes brain neurotransmitter levels to rise.\n\nThis directly increases the addictiveness of all kinds of drugs, even nicotine and caffeine. In fact, tobacco smoke and coffee are the two most significant sources of these alkaloids in the human diet. To some people, they are very addictive in themselves when administered regularly, owing to genetic differences in MAO activity – there are several genetic variants of both types, with greatly varying activity, but I digress.\n\nI know this is a lot to take in without any sources, so here are some:\n\n---\n\nHuman monoamine oxidase is inhibited by tobacco smoke: beta-carboline alkaloids act as potent and reversible inhibitors.  \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15582589\n\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibition Dramatically Increases the Motivation to Self-Administer Nicotine in Rats  \nhttp://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/38/8593.abstract\n\nTransient behavioral sensitization to nicotine becomes long-lasting with monoamine oxidases inhibitors.  \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14592678\n\nHuman monoamine oxidase enzyme inhibition by coffee and ß-carbolines norharman and harman isolated from coffee  \nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320505007514\n\nNorharman and harman in instant coffee and coffee substitutes  \nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814609013806\n\nIdentification and occurrence of the bioactive ß-carbolines norharman and harman in coffee brews  \nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02652030210145892\n\nExposure to ß-carbolines norharman and harman  \nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570023203008742\n\nHarman and norharman in alcoholism: correlations with psychopathology and long-term changes.  \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8651457\n\nThe role of beta-carbolines (harman/norharman) in heroin addicts  \nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0767399X96800769\n\nFactors That Affect the Content of Heterocyclic Aromatic Amines in Foods  \nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2010.00141.x/pdf\n\nRegarding MAOA and MAOB genetic variability:  \nhttp://omim.org/entry/309850  \nhttp://omim.org/entry/309860",

It's side-effects aren't as severe and oftentimes require serious overdose to start to show. It's also a dependency that is much easier to break and long-term moderate use rarely correlates directly to medical issues due to low body accumulation and rapid break down in the liver. \n\nCompare caffeine to nicotine, which is a stimulant that is very addictive and a large portion of our population uses it. Only in the last 10-15 years have they really started to reduce the number of new cigarette smokers. And now with vaping and e-cigs the number of nicotine users is probably even higher. The reason nicotine was targeted was because it's primary delivery route was smoking versus caffeine which is water-soluble and easily consumed orally. The most common sources of nicotine have bad odors associated with them, whereas caffeine sources are fragrant like coffee or low volatility like soda, energy drinks, etc. Also, you drinking caffeine doesn't run the risk of someone getting second-hand consumption, unlike smoking. \n\nTL;DR:\nCaffeine consumption is generally less unhealthy than other stimulants and less impactful on those around the person. There aren't many reasons to restrict caffeine for people, adults should have the ability to self-evaluate and recognize if they are too dependent on caffeine.",

The creature blocking my exit is the only known terrestrial hermit crab in Western Africa. It is pretty rare. It is the only way to get out of my house. Please send coffee.**\n\n**Originally posted to** r/Wellthatsucks\n\n**Trigger warning:** none\n\n**Mood spoiler:** >!wholesome!<\n\n[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/1hr1ngg/this_is_my_front_gate_the_creature_blocking_my/) 1 January 2025\n\nPost is a [photo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/1hr1ngg/this_is_my_front_gate_the_creature_blocking_my/#lightbox) of a hermit crab stuck in the locking mechanism of a gate\n\n**Comments**\n\n**Commenter:** Try some bait to get it to move.\n\n>**OOP:** Thought about that, but they are mostly nocturnal. In my caffeine-deprived, hangover-induced haze, I poured water over it, hoping it would budge—then it hit me: it’s a crab. Water isn’t going to do anything.\n\n>These little terrors roam the streets with evil intent, hell-bent on ruining the start of a new year before scuttling back to the sea to do whatever unholy crab business they do.\n\nOther commenters suggest various ways to remove the crab, but nothing works, and OOP refuses to do anything that might harm the crab.\n\n*Then we learn a little about where OOP lives*\n\n**Commenter:** Well it’s gonna have to move before the postie arrives\n\n>**OOP:** We have no addresses, trust me we don’t have a postman\n\n**Commenter:** Where do you live and what is your government or lack of like? It sounds interesting. Not even a drink and drive law? No post? Is it a small island? Are there even police? Is it just locally claimed? I have so many questions\n\n>**OOP:** The island is called Sao Tome and Principe, it's right on the equator in the Gulf of Guinea. It is the most beautiful place I've ever visited in my life. It's about 1000 km2,. It's an independent country and the second smallest in Africa.\n\n**Commenter:** Had anyone climbed that vertical looking mountain? I looked up pictures. It sure is gorgeous\n\n>**OOP:** It’s a volcano with the outside worn away [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico\\_C%C3%A3o\\_Grande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_C%C3%A3o_Grande)\n\n**OOP:** Believe it or not, Sao Tome grows the finest chocolate and coffee in the world. However it is impossible to get an iced coffee in any shop that's not in one of the few hotels. I crave them.\n\n*Some redditors look up the critter in question*\n\n**Commenter:** In Googling your crab, I found an international site, GBIF, that has a map with geo-referenced sightings of it. There are only 35 marked! They'd probably love to record your sighting. Looks like you can do it online. [https://www.gbif.org/species/5716734](https://www.gbif.org/species/5716734)\n\nThere is also have a photo of one in the exact same shell as yours!\n\n**Commenter:** iNaturalist is pretty good too\n\n[https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/787900-Coenobita-rubescens](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/787900-Coenobita-rubescens)\n\n**Commenter:** Dang! He’s been in that shell since at least 2021. No wonder he’s looking for a bigger place.\n\n***OOP posts a*** [**banana for scale**](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fthis-is-my-front-gate-the-creature-blocking-my-exit-is-the-v0-ce53tdyw5gae1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D3024%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Df4de31e5217a1a4e73f47f714b3e688ffceda079) Photo of the same hermit crab with a banana held next to it.\n\n**OOP:** Update.\n\nNight is falling, and my nemesis remains steadfast, its head jammed in the locking mechanism like it’s solving a puzzle only crabs understand.\n\nI tried luring it out with a piece of fish. it remained immobile and then went back to whatever evil plan it’s cooking up in that tiny crustacean brain.\n\nAt this point, I’m half-convinced it’s not stuck at all—it’s just trolling me. My options are dwindling, and I’m starting to wonder if this is how my life plays out: held hostage by a crab with zero respect for my hangover or basic human need to leave the house.\n\n[Update:](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/1hres3r/for_everyone_whos_been_messaging_me_about_my_epic/) about 14 hours later\n\n**For everyone who's been messaging me about my epic battle with the hermit crab that had me trapped in my own home—here’s the long-awaited update!**\n\n[Photo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/1hres3r/for_everyone_whos_been_messaging_me_about_my_epic/#lightbox) of OOP holding the hermit crab. Both are inside OOP's home.\n\nAfter a grueling standoff that tested my patience, ingenuity, and caffeine levels, I have finally emerged triumphant. Gandalf the Crab has been safely removed from his self-appointed post as Gatekeeper of Doom. A photo of the defeated (but unharmed) adversary is included for your viewing pleasure. Let it be known: I did pass.\n\n**Comments**\n\n**Commenter:** How'd you get him out?\n\n>**OOP:** I managed to evict Gandalf by patiently waiting for him to reveal his claws, then gently pulling him free from the mechanism. Like Frodo with the One Ring, it required equal parts courage, timing, and sheer stubbornness. Thankfully, no eagles were needed for the rescue.\n\n**Commenter:** Did you legit just stand at your fence staring at him for hours until he moved? 😂\n\n>**OOP:** Pretty much, however I quickly worked out he was sensitive to light and vibration which caused him to pull into his lair. So I used a redlight filter on my headlamp and stood very quietly waiting for his pincers to emerge, at which point I gently pulled him out.\n\n**Commenter:** How long did your legendary standoff last, and what happens now to gandalf the crab?\n\n>**OOP:** The legendary standoff lasted a grueling 14 hours—a true test of wills between man and crustacean. As for Gandalf, he’s now enjoying a peaceful retirement in the garden, complete with a piece of coconut by his side in case he’s hungry after the battle. I’ve also sealed off his regular haunt with paper, ensuring he doesn’t re-enact The Two Towers by staging a comeback.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP**\n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

    "body": "We have built a culture of urgency, and therefore anxiety, around our daily lives. Everything has to be more efficient. We must be more productive, or else we are not worthwhile. It has become a religion to outdo each other's forever exaggerated techniques for \"optimising my performance.\" This has bled out of the corporate world, via sophisticated marketing strategies and social contagion, and into our daily lives, habits, and internal philosophies.\n\n\\> Podcasts have to be listened to at 2x speed;  \n\\> We insist on multitasking while on the phone to our parents;  \n\\> We take our coffee to go. \n\nWe build evermore \"productivity\" into the way we consume the things we like. The faulty logic is if I do more things I like faster, I'll be happier. But **this creates a complete disconnect from the actual satisfaction we could derive from these things**, and forces us to run ever faster on the hedonic treadmill towards satiety. The more productive we are about our social, internal, emotional and intellectual lives, the less satisfied we are, and so the harder we feel we need to work to chase them. This creates a cycle of dissatisfaction. The dopamine hits can't come fast enough.\n\nI implore you, for your own sanity, try the following things (even though the pandemic has made some of this harder, you can take away the **core** **meaning** of each one. Many of us are in lockdowns, working or studying from home, are no longer working, or businesses are closed for health reasons - some of these tips work even better under these circumstances, and we will appreciate the others  more when we are able to access them):  \n\n\n* Don't get your next coffee takeaway. Sit down and turn your phone off and savour it out of a porcelain mug instead of a paper cup on your way to work. Leave a few minutes earlier, or arrive at work late. Watch the barista steaming your milk for you, filling your cup, making a little pattern on top and dusting it with chocolate - just for you. Watch the other customers talking amongst themselves. Study the tablecloths. Don't just drink your coffee, taste it. Life has lost all meaning if we can't sit down and enjoy coffee or tea or hot chocolate, but rather cram it into our bodies as a caffeine-injection system. If that's the only way you consume these beverages, **you're missing the point.** And if you can't get to a café these days? Make something yourself at home, for yourself, and even for someone you live with, and pay attention to every step. Pick which mug you want to use carefully. Measure the coffee. Do it slowly. And when it's ready, sip it and look out the window. Take in the complete act of what you're doing. \n* Go to the pub with your friends, turn off your phones, and put them into somebody's backpack. Drink pints and talk shit. Repeat.\n* Leave your house to go and walk. Do not plan a route or have a destination in mind. Walk, be conscious, and observe. You will need to come along with yourself. Get comfortable with that fact, and learn to love it.\n* Literally stop and smell flowers.\n* Try listening to podcasts at 1x speed and appreciating the level of technical effort that goes into producing a high-quality piece of audio journalism.\n* Don't rush to finish your book by the end of December! If it's good enough for you to be reading it, read it slowly, and enjoy every single word the author crafted in just such a way as to convey their meaning to you. If you don't enjoy the book enough to read it slowly, stop reading it and start a new one. Life is too short to read books you don't like and won't remember anyway.\n* Next time you feel thirsty, pull a glass of water from the tap and watch it fizz. Keep watching until the bubbles wrap themselves around each other and disintegrate on the surface. This water will become your lifeblood. Don't take it for granted. Taste the water until the glass is empty. Appreciate that glass of water and project a feeling of gratefulness onto it.\n* Art is meant to be consumed **slowly.** Otherwise, why are you bothering?\n* When was the last time you listened to music? No, no. I mean: when was the last time you listened to music?\n* Whether you're on the phone to a friend, family member, secret lover or restauranteur, close your laptop and close your eyes. Give that person five minutes of your undivided attention. Let them feel how valuable you think their time is. \n* Write a letter to your friend and post it instead of writing them a Facebook or WhatsApp message. \n\nEfficiency and productivity are means to some ends and they have vastly improved our financial lives in many ways. But they are neither the means nor the ends to social, intellectual, creative or emotional satisfaction. **You are worthy of your own time. Spend it with yourself savoringly.**",

Talk about things your IRL friends don't know/care much about.   Read web articles about circus freaks from the 1850s.

    "body": "This TIFU happened this week, but I just discovered it now.\n\nSo, for context - my husband and I are pretty opposite when it comes to socializing. I’m super extroverted, love family gatherings, I love my in-laws, if it were up to me we’d all live on one giant commune growing our own food and singing kumbaya every night. \n\nHe’s *very* introverted and usually dislikes the holidays and family gatherings in general. He’ll go for me and his parents, but he’s usually super quiet and is pretty bad at faking it. He almost *always* says he’s not feeling well in order to excuse his quietness and to try to leave early.\n\nAt his parents’ Christmas gathering, he was super quiet again. It’s worth noting we all had negative Covid tests. He complained all day he wasn’t feeling well, and actually went to nap in his childhood bedroom for a few hours. His energy was 0%. When we took family photos he could barely even muster a smile, he genuinely looked miserable. It was only us, his parents, and his brother + wife and kids, so his absence was noticed. His parents seemed a little hurt but understood.\n\nIt’s fine, I’m used to it, I hung out with my in-laws watching hallmark movies and eating TONS of great food. I had a blast. \n\nWhen we got home, he asked if I had a good time. I did, but pointed out that he has a tendency to be really avoidant during gatherings. I mentioned that he always conveniently feels under the weather and disappears to his room and leaves me to socialize alone. It’s becoming a trend and he should examine why he suddenly feels so unwell every time we visit his parents. He was pretty upset and said he was trying, but he really did feel exhausted.\n\nWell, this morning I woke up, made some coffee, but could NOT wake up. I felt so tired and I just wanted to go back to bed. I went to go make a second cup, and realized… I had bought decaf coffee by mistake. I didn’t notice because I also get Starbucks when we go out- my husband usually only drinks coffee from home. \n\nNow I have to go apologize to my husband…\n\nTL;DR Bought decaf coffee, blamed my husband for being a Christmas zombie\n\nETA: So according to Reddit I am a horrible wife, my husband is either severely depressed or has aspergers, and we have a crippling caffeine addiction and need to re-evaluate our lives.\n\nGuys, it’s not that deep. He’s introverted, we joke that I do the talking for the both of us. It works really well for us - I pull him out of his shell when he needs it, and he reels me back into mine when I need it. The holidays are exhausting and we had a humorous misunderstanding. We chuckled about it and moved on - after drinking lots full strength coffee ;)",

I read this 30 fucking 4 page government document PDF. Why? You all know why. We all crave a wrinkle or two in this ape brain now and then. Also my life is GME. Moving on.\n\nAll you need, is to read these quotes from the filing. That's it. That's all you need to know how I am feeling rn:\n\n\"**The R&W Plan** sets forth the plan to be used by the Board and NSCC management in the event NSCC encounters scenarios that could potentially prevent it from being able to provide its critical services as a going concern. The R&W Plan is structured as a roadmap that defines **the strategy and identifies the tools available to NSCC to either (i) recover, in the event it experiences losses that exceed its prefunded resources (such strategies and tools referred to herein as the “Recovery Plan”) or (ii) wind-down its business in a manner designed to permit the continuation of NSCC’s critical services in the event that such recovery efforts are not successful** (such strategies and tools referred to herein as the “Wind-down Plan”). The recovery tools available to NSCC are **intended to address the risks of (a) uncovered losses or liquidity shortfalls resulting from the default of one or more of its Members**, and (b) losses arising from non-default events, such as damage to NSCC’s physical assets, a cyber-attack, or custody and investment losses, and the strategy for implementation of such tools...\n\nThe proposed rule change is designed to update and enhance the clarity of the Plan **to ensure it is current in the event it is ever necessary to be implemented.** \"\n\n**\"Section 5.3 (Liquidity Shortfalls) of the Plan identifies tools that may be used to address foreseeable shortfalls of NSCC’s liquidity resources following a Member default.** The goal in managing NSCC’s qualified liquidity resources is to maximize resource availability *in an evolving stress situation*, to maintain flexibility in the order and use of sources of liquidity, and to repay any third-party lenders of liquidity in a timely manner...\n\nFirst, the proposed rule change would revise the entries for “3. Obligation Warehouse” and “10. CNS/Prime Broker Interface” to delete the check mark denoting the lack of alternative providers and products as one of the determinants for its classification as a critical service.” *(DAYUM DAT WAS A BURN DOE)*\n\n\"Also, the proposed rule change would update Table 3-B (NSCC Critical Services) to add “Account Information Transmission” (“AIT”). This new entry would include in the description of AIT18 that it is being enhanced in support of the bulk transfer initiative, which is an industry effort **designed to prepare carrying broker-dealers for an emergency mass transfer of large quantities of customer accounts and assets from a distressed broker to a financially secure broker.**\n\n**2. Member Default Losses through the Crisis Continuum Section 5** (Member Default Losses through the Crisis Continuum) of the Plan is comprised of multiple subsections that identify the risk management surveillance, tools, and governance that NSCC may employ across an increasing stress environment, referred to as the “Crisis Continuum.” **This section currently identifies, among other things, the tools that can be employed by NSCC to mitigate losses, and mitigate or minimize liquidity needs, as the market environment becomes increasingly stressed.** As more fully described below, the proposed rule change would clarify certain language. Section 5.2.1 (Stable Market Phase) describes NSCC’s risk management activities in the normal course of business. **These activities include (i) the routine monitoring of margin adequacy through daily evaluation of backtesting and stress testing results that review the adequacy of NSCC’s margin calculations, and escalation of those results to internal and Board committees and (ii) routine monitoring of liquidity adequacy through review of daily liquidity studies that measure sufficiency of available liquidity resources to meet cash settlement obligations** of the Member that would generate the largest aggregate payment obligation.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGUYS, THIS IS ONLY UP TO PAGE 13. I COULD GO ON BUT HERE I WILL LINK THE PDF WITH JOY:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc/2021/34-91428.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc/2021/34-91428.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**APE TL;DR**  The NSCC (National Securities Clearing Corporation) (a subsidiary of DTCC), has filed this document TODAY. The NSCC and DTCC are Clearing corporations, so basically, they are the ones who are stuck with the bag of dogshit when the HFs come to them and say \"ummmmm we fuked\". So they filed this document today. Many parts to this document, but one part for example was, to clarify **\"the plan\"** of what would happen if shit hits the fan basically.\n\nIn their words:\n\n1. The plan \"is intended to address the risks of (a) uncovered losses or liquidity shortfalls resulting from the default of one or more of its Members,\"\n2. The Plan \"identifies tools that may be used to address foreseeable shortfalls of NSCC’s liquidity resources following a Member default\"\n3. The plans goal \"is to maximize resource availability ***in an evolving stress situation***, to maintain flexibility in the order and use of sources of liquidity, **and to repay any third-party lenders of liquidity in a timely manner.**..\"\n4. The plan supports \"an industry effort designed to prepare carrying broker-dealers **for an emergency mass transfer of large quantities of customer accounts and assets from a distressed broker to a financially secure broker.**\n5. Next section is on \"**the tools that can be employed by NSCC to mitigate losses, and mitigate or minimize liquidity needs, as the market environment becomes increasingly stressed.** \"\n\nI could go on but then it wouldn't be a TLDR, but I will just say there is NO way I can cover this entire doc in a TLDR, if you want the full perspective its worth the read tomorrow maybe when you guys are less high and have more caffeine pumping through your blood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  Does this legal document specifically mention GME? No. Do I know if this document is in reference to GME? No. Should we check ourselves, and say hm this COULD be totally unrelated? Yes. We should consider that possibility. But we should also take ALL of our data into account, all of the context. I am only posting information, so I encourage everyone to interpret this how they please.",

So you split them up, have one drink it, the other not and check the results.\n\nWhat this test isn't the above, rather it tests two groups of people who aren't random, but pre-disposed. One group which is prone to drink caffeine, and the other not. \n\nBut you may of course find that the group prone to drinking caffeine is one who do so because they need to get up at 7 to go to work all day. i.e. coffee becomes a proxy for living a busy and engaged life, full of mental challenges at work, during social contact, sports and hobbies. Whereas those who drink less coffee may (on average) be more dormant, home alone more often etc... and it may be that this difference in lifestyle, or difference in stimulation of the brain, is the difference in dementia.\n\nOf course I'm making a bunch of assumptions here, but you catch my drift. Did anyone look into the study more to see if they considered such things? I hope to get back to the study later, got a date to get to (without coffee!)",

I had insomnia my entire life, took perscribed Ambien from 15 to till I got pregnant with my daughter at 20. Since I am a single mom, I can't be incapacitated by Ambien so I get around 3-4 hours a night and exist on coffee and the idea that I can sleep when she's 18. Unfortunately she's inherited my sleep issues. I've tried everything, she doesn't have screen time, has never had caffeine, limit sugar (even natural like fruit) after 5 pm, use lavender, and a sleep routine. No luck. I talk to her pediatrician who says I should try a small amount of melatonin. Since I started giving her melatonin she's been getting 9 hours versus 4 hours before. My 5 year old doesn't have dark circles under her eyes and her behavior and performance in preschool has improved. \n\nProblem is her father (29M), he lost all physical and legal custody but still has visitation. Her bedroom at her dad's has a TV, she shares it with her 2 year old sister who screams and stays up till 2 am and sleeps in till noon, and her dad and I don't have a stellar co-parenting relationship. He blames me for losing custody but in reality he let her insurance lapse 3 times and she developed stage 1 bedsores on his watch due to neglect. \n\nDaughter told him she takes her sleep gummy at mommy's and then she can sleep. He calls me screaming that I had no right to drug his child. I said I do since I have legal custody and it was in her best interest.. he opened a CPS case against me and says is making a play for legal custody. Doesn't want physical or even more visitation just wants the right to make decisions I'll pay for. He's over $8k in arrears and wants to eat that away. I followed the pediatrician and gave an OTC vitamin. AITA?\n\nEdit: Apologies for those that think I'm gloryposting. Honestly went through a lot of self-doubt after a series of angry texts and phone calls.\n\n\nUpdate: Hey, I'm not sure if anyone will ever see this but I wanted to say thanks for all the support. I forgot about this super dark time until I saw my shitty parenting argument on a podcast, wild! The CPS case was closed, obvi and thank God. We worked it out, we being me and his girlfriend, ya know the adults in the room. She still does have a different sleep routine at her dad's but not wildly different now. He caught up on his child support and all in all, we are amazing now. This truly was a dark and low point that we are now so far away from. 😊 All the best, reddit fam! ",

I can't tell you how difficult my life has been without getting quality sleep.

It must be miserable for her to be at her dad's house. And it sounds like he doesn't want to establish a bedtime for the two year old because it takes work. Best thing is to get him on the side of your daughter and her sleep issue.\n\nIf you can establish a solid medical record with her pediatrician, that will be a great start. Make an appointment just for the sleep issue. Then, have pediatrician refer your daughter to a sleep clinic. These doctors specialize in sleep issues. They are experts. Have them do a full evaluation and recommendations. This is going to have an impact on her whole future. School performance goes into the toilet when a bright kid doesn't get enough sleep.\n\nHere's a suggestion. Tell ex that there's an issue and you both need to help her. His input is important because if he doesn't get on board, she will suffer for it. Tell him you KNOW he has her best interests at heart. If she were diabetic, he'd be important to her overall health. Ask him to go to the sleep clinic with you and your child.

If what you’re saying is completely accurate, you are obviously NTA, doing the right thing as a parent and your ex is endangering the child’s welfare by challenging you and disturbing your kid’s routine. As a fellow insomniac I know how much it can alter one’s life, and forming healthy sleep habits Is not only difficult and delicate, but crucial for a growing child in their overall quality of life. More than that, the father vying for powers of custody over something like this is a sign of need for control and emotional abuse, not at all having to do with concern for your child. Don’t worry about whether or not you are the asshole. Seek legal counsel ASAP. If finances are a concern maybe try this link, hopefully it is helpful. I can’t vouch for it, just did a quick search.\n[free child custody lawyers](https://lawguideline.org/free-child-custody-lawyers-for-mothers/) \n\nAside from that, you should be looking at reddit threads for legal advice if this is where you want to start. r/legaladvice",

It must be miserable for her to be at her dad's house. And it sounds like he doesn't want to establish a bedtime for the two year old because it takes work. Best thing is to get him on the side of your daughter and her sleep issue.\n\nIf you can establish a solid medical record with her pediatrician, that will be a great start. Make an appointment just for the sleep issue. Then, have pediatrician refer your daughter to a sleep clinic. These doctors specialize in sleep issues. They are experts. Have them do a full evaluation and recommendations. This is going to have an impact on her whole future. School performance goes into the toilet when a bright kid doesn't get enough sleep.\n\nHere's a suggestion. Tell ex that there's an issue and you both need to help her. His input is important because if he doesn't get on board, she will suffer for it. Tell him you KNOW he has her best interests at heart. If she were diabetic, he'd be important to her overall health. Ask him to go to the sleep clinic with you and your child. This may help him understand that low doses of melatonin now, with good sleep hygiene, will help her be the happy and healthy child you both want.",

With that logic, everyone should have been perfectly happy serving their feudal lords. \n\nAnyone who thinks that our modern society is good needs to remember that there are children starving on the streets and slaves mining up the materials that are used to build the computers we rely on everyday.

I saw they had lemonade refreshers- some with strawberries and some with acai. She got super excited, so I thought I’d get her a large strawberry lemonade refresher. She loved it and chugged the whole thing before I finished my coffee.\n\n Well about 20-30 minutes later she is sprinting up and down the aisles, not listening to me and being generally difficult. She is a strong-willed child and what 4-year-old doesn’t have tons of energy… so I didn’t think much beyond it. I was getting frustrated though.\n\n My wife showed up a few minutes later and immediately noticed the wild child squeezing every stuffie she could fit into her tiny arms. She also noticed immediately the 2 drinks in the cart. She quizzed me on what I got her. Her face pretty much summed it up. She knew right away that we had a child hopped up on caffeine.\n\n Apparently, Starbucks refreshers have about 45-55 mg of caffeine in them. I had no idea. Through my ignorance she got her first boost.\n\n Well, suffice it to say, one tantrum later, we were headed home.\n\n  \nTLDR; Starbucks puts caffeine in Lemonade and I gave it to a small child.",

    "body": "I feel like many of us are going through the spring blues and feeling stressed about summer so I wanted to create a big ass post about my top tips as a trainer because tbh, I see lots of sketchy and not great advice in this community. Take it or leave it but as we are all bitches with taste, I care about you and want you to be healthy and happy this summer.\n\n**Get your freaking steps in**\n\nYou don't need to start running or HIIT or whatever if you don't enjoy them. Simply look at your current step count and start increasing it by 1500 - 2000 steps per day. 10K is an arbitrary number. If you're only getting 4K steps per day, getting 6K will start making a dramatic difference. Walking is so underrated and one of the most sustainable ways to increase your energy expenditure without revving up a crazy big appetite.\n\n**More water**\n\nDrink your body weight in ounces every day... and maybe a little more if you're a big sweater or drink more than 1 cup of caffeine. If you're not good at hydrating, get a straw... weird but it helps you sip better throughout the day.\n\n**Before you give up gluten/dairy/etc. GIVE UP ALCOHOL FIRST**\n\nUnless you have a legitimate allergy like celiac or lactose intolerance, you don't need to avoid entire food groups. Yes, eat everything in moderation but instead of trying to give up bread, give up or drastically reduce your alcohol consumption from now until Memorial Day Weekend and you'll be shocked at how much less bloated and sluggish you feel.\n\n**ADD DON'T SUBTRACT**\n\nAnd on that note... instead of giving up xyz foods, try adding more vegetables, protein, and whole foods to your diet. These are going to be higher in fiber and help you feel more satiated. You can have pizza! You can have a burger! You can have a cookie! Just make sure you're also getting in quality whole foods too.\n\n**And on the subject of protein...**\n\nTry to eat at least 1g per pound of ideal bodyweight. (i.e. if your goal weight is 140 pounds, eat 140g of protein). If that seems crazzzzzzzzy to what you do now, aim for at least 100g per day.\n\n**Do workouts you love**\n\nI've done so many phases of fitness with different types of workouts. Stop worrying if yours are the \"best thing to do\" and focus on whether or not you enjoy it. Enjoying your workout will let you stick with it. Tune out toxic Instagram accounts who tell you Pilates isn't good enough/strength training will wreck your cortisol/HIIT classes are bad for you etc. Just do what you like!\n\n**SLEEP LIKE A CHAMP**\n\nBitches with taste need their beauty rest. Get your 8 hours in! And if you struggle with sleeping, try the 3-2-1 rule: no eating three hours before bed, no liquids 2 hours before bed, no screens 1 hour before bed.\n\nSending love to all my bitches with taste xoxo\n\n**omg edit.... DID NOT EXPECT THIS TO BLOW UP LIKE THIS!** I will try to respond as many threads as I can over the weekend ",

I keep seeing this lately and earnestly do not understand where this guidance stems from. I am not a scientist or  doctor or a dietician. I am not claiming to know better. I am curious and confused.

If none of this rings a bell and you liked pop music sung by teenage boys in the 2000's, you might remember me from a band I was in with my brothers.\n\nI’m a songwriter, taco fan, caffeine aficionado, former Pokemon trainer, connoisseur of popular television, and I work out sometimes. My band DNCE recently won a VMA for Best New Artist and I’ve gotten my ass kicked by Mickey Mouse on South Park. \n\nStoked to be here answering your questions - ask me anything!\n\nProof: https://twitter.com/joejonas/status/785899495544369152\n\nEdit: \nThat was fun! I hope you enjoyed reading all about my man crushes and my days with my brothers. Hopefully, we can do this again sometime!\n\nAnd I'm going to take this moment to self-promote myself :) If you guys want, check out my new video for Body Moves and hopefully you guys will buy our album November 18th.

    "body": "Why YSK: We tend to forget that caffeine is a psychoactive drug. \n\n\n\n\n\nJust like anything in life, there’s always a good side and a bad side. However, the problem is that using drugs such as caffeine that have the ability to affect the brain, we mess up our natural brain functions. This becomes a serious issue when we consume it daily. \n\nBy doing that, we reach a level of dependence that legitimately makes us forget how we used to operate naturally before we abused them.\n\n\n\nOne of the worst side effects is sleep problems and that’s what I’m going to focus on in this post. \n\nTo understand how caffeine makes us alert we need to understand how it affects adenosine.\n\nAdenosine is a powerful type of molecule in our bodies and the build up of adenosine causes drowsiness which makes us sleep at night. \n\nCaffeine on the other hand is a stimulant and it works by inhibiting adenosine receptors which helps keep us alert. \n\n\n\nWe should keep in mind that a lot of food and drinks contain caffeine. For example, coffee, tea, carbonated drinks such as coke, chocolate, energy drinks etc…\n\nModeration is key. Start by decreasing caffeine intake to a point where you can function normally without it. Then, consume it only when necessary. \nYou’ll be shocked when you realize that you can live without using it daily :)\n\nOh and absolutely no caffeine at least 6 hours before bed!!!! \n\nBest of luck!\n\nAll about caffeine: \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223808/\n\n\n———\n\nEDIT 1: I’m so glad to hear other people’s experiences and how they are doing well with caffeine. Just to clarify though, I did mention that moderation is key. I did not dismiss the benefits of caffeine. I’m just reminding people that it is a drug after all. But we don’t think of it like that as much anymore since it’s the most used drug worldwide.\n\nI am a caffeine consumer myself tried to quit but found that cycling works best for me. I just wanted to help people who got stuck like me and didn’t know why and share some science behind it. \n\nBut if you find yourself happier and sleeping well with consuming caffeine daily then by all means listen to your body :)",

It sounds melodramatic, but I tell people it’s one of the best decisions of my life. \n\nI don’t have boundless natural energy like some people claim I would eventually have, but I have way less headaches, my skin looks better and I just have this vague feeling of just feeling better. \n\nIt was also a catalyst to make other better lifestyle choices. I started eventually eating better (less sugar, less junk food) and started working out. None of those things happened overnight, over the course of about a year. \n\nSmall changes here and there can make a huge impact and if you’re trying to get healthy, just try this one thing to start off with then go from there.",

Not everyone is in a position where they can risk reduced job performance or excessive drowsiness for a week or two. \n\n\n\nMake it a point to record all of your drinks for a week. How many cups of coffee, soda, hot cocoa, tea, etc. are you drinking each day? If you drink 6 cups of coffee every day, replace one of those with decaf. If you drink two cups of green tea in the morning, try making one of those herbal. Do that for a week or two before cutting back more. Take it slow and make sustainable changes; you can avoid the vast majority of the suck if you're deliberate and pace yourself!",

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment involving habitual coffee drinkers, researchers found that ingesting decaffeinated coffee produced many of the same physiological and cognitive responses as caffeinated coffee**. These findings suggest that regular coffee consumers may react to the experience of drinking coffee in ways that are independent of its caffeine content.\n\nTaken together, these results paint a nuanced picture. While caffeine had measurable effects on brain activity and reaction time, many of the physiological and psychological responses traditionally attributed to caffeine were also present in the placebo group. This suggests that habitual coffee drinkers may be responding not just to the drug itself but also to the context and ritual of coffee consumption.",

Sorry for the loooooong ass post, there’s a lot to unpack.\n\nBackstory first. So around 2 years ago, my ex fiancé, who I’d been in a relationship with for almost 10 years unceremoniously just left me. \n\nIt never fully made sense to me as there were no warning signs, we were actively planning our wedding and finally agreed to try for a baby, as we were both in our 30’s and time was ticking. Then one day, he just started acting sort of off, wasn’t saying I love you before he left for work for the day, was spending more time out drinking with his friends than he was at home. He’d been struggling with his mental health since Covid lockdowns so I assumed he was having a bit of a downward spiral. So I sat down with him one day and just asked him if everything was okay with him, he tried to brush it off initially and kept saying he was fine, so I changed the question and asked if we were okay, he looked like he really didn’t want to answer, so I asked again, he paused and in that moment, I knew, it was over. I asked if he still loved me, he said he loved me but wasn’t in love with me anymore. And that was it, within a week, he had moved out, leaving 90% of his belongings to be collected at a later date and to serve as a constant reminder that he was just gone.\n\nTo say it hit me hard was an understatement, I spiralled massively, I was at the lowest point I had ever been in my life, so I tried to end it all, it just hurt too much feeling like there was something so wrong with me that he had to just leave.\n\nFortunately a friend managed to get me to a hospital before I did any serious damage to myself and while I still felt awful about myself most of the time, it got a little easier.\n\nI ended up dating that friend a few months later. A lot of people said it was too soon to move on, but honestly I never set out to have another relationship at all, but his constant support, presence and reassurance that there was nothing wrong me made me want to spend time with those who truly gave a shit about me, and in time we developed feelings for each other. We had a beautiful relationship filled with love and laughter, and much to our surprise I ended up pregnant 9 months into our relationship, we decided to keep the baby even though our relationship was still in its early stages and 9 months later our beautiful daughter was born. We are still as strong as ever today and continuing to build an amazing life together as a family.\n\nNow onto present day, I guess my ex has been reflecting on the past recently due to a lot of deaths in his family and his mother (who I’m still close with today) reached out to me to asked whether I’d be willing to meet up with him as he had something to get off his chest, she didn’t know what he wanted to talk to me about as it was something he could only discuss with me, but she would understand if I said no.\n\nI decided to think about it for a few days before I agreed that I would meet up with him at a local coffee shop. I got there early because you know, mama needs her caffeine fix with these early morning wake ups and night feeds. I was already sat down when he came in and he gave me the saddest looking smile while I merely just nodded to him and motioned for him to sit down and get out whatever he needed to tell me.\n\nI was a little bit speechless at what he had to say. He said that when we started trying for a baby and nothing was happening even though we were closely tracking my ovulation cycle and testing every day for that sweet spot, he realised something wasn’t right, so he secretly took a day off work to see a fertility doctor l, they found that due to an undiagnosed issue in one of his testicles, the likelihood of him ever being able to conceive a biological child of his own was incredibly low. He knew that I loved him so deeply that I would’ve given up my dream of having children, just for him and he said he couldn’t live with that on his conscience, that I deserved to have the life and family I’d always wanted, only with someone else. He kept apologising profusely for hurting me so much in the process but tried to rationalise that I had got what I’d wanted in the end, so his plan ultimately worked.\n\nI ultimately sat there silent for a few minutes and just looked at him dead in the eyes and said that that was never his decision to make, he took away my choice and nearly destroyed me in the process. And I got up and left.\n\nIt’s been a few days and I’m still processing, my partner knew I was meeting up with my ex and he knows something is up but is giving me space until I feel ready to talk about it, but honestly I’m shook. Like did my ex honestly think I’d be like okay thanks for letting me know and then we’d all be friends again.\n\nEDIT: Tried to add an update post, however it was removed by the mods. Will post to my profile if anyone is interested.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**6017LN**\n\n>He was having an affair that is now over and is reflecting. He used a lie to try to make himself seem like a martyr.\n\n**OOP**\n\n>>I did suspect that for quite some time, there was a girl in our friend group he had become oddly close to over the last year of our relationship, she was one of the main people he was going out drinking with when I started realising something wasn’t quite right, so my mind did go there for a while. He ended up moving in with her as housemates after he moved out. She tried coming over to collect the remainder of his things, I was pretty mad and said I didn’t consent to her being there and if she didn’t leave my property, I’d call the police on her for trespassing. I don’t believe anything was ever actually going on there though as I heard through the grapevine that she was seeing some drug dealer shortly after my ex moved in with her.\n\n**~**\n\n**Ride-Sea-3607**\n\n>Absolutely. Your ex-boyfriend had no right to take away your choice in this matter. Did he know about your failed attempt at suicide? Why did he not come back then and admit that it was all a mistake? Because you couldn't have babies if you are dead, right. I think it is either he is an absolute moron or he is trying to give you some bs reason so that you think of him in a better light going forward.\n\n**OOP**\n\n>>Yes, he was aware of the attempt, we had a pretty close knit group of friends, some of whom were really supportive afterwards, they made him aware. I got a “I hope you’re okay, sorry for everything” message after he found out. I never responded and it was at that point that I blocked and deleted his number and all his socials because I couldn’t trust myself not to drunk message him begging for him to come back.\n\n**~**\n\n**inkypinkyblinkyclyde**\n\n>There were other ways to deal with his infertility. Donor sperm. Adoption. The fact that he would rather have taken this decision from you than discuss options with you proves that he was not a suitable long term partner for you. There are lots of hard decisions couples need to make together, and he demonstrated that he was unwilling to give you any real agency in your life together. You are better off now with your new partner.\n\n**OOP**\n\n>>Oh I know I’m absolutely so much better off. My current partner is pretty much the opposite of my ex, which was why it was such a surprise that I developed feelings for him, he’s extremely different from my usual “type”, but he’s such a good egg. We had chance to talk about everything late last night (our daughter is going through a bit of a sleep regression, so late nights are pretty common for us at the minute 😭), and he was super empathetic and equally as pissed. I got my first period since having the baby this morning and he ran me a bath and told me to go sulk for as long as I need to, bless him.\n\n[Update on the situation with my ex.](https://www.reddit.com/u/Fair_Satisfaction709/s/6I8aYbQFnH)  **May 8, 2025 (5 days later)**\n\n\nIf youd like a recap of the story please see my original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/FdkTrGPEEt)\n\nFirst off, thank you all for your lovely comments and messages of support! I was not expecting my post to blow up like it did.\n\nSo I wasn’t really expecting to make an update to my previous post, and definitely not this soon, but boy does it get interesting.\n\nSo of course I planned to leave this situation alone at this point and completely put it behind me, however my former mother-in-law reached out to me as I hadn’t spoken to her in a few days which is quite unlike me. \n\nA few people said in a few comments that I should cut her off as well as the ex, but this woman was like a mother to me for almost 10 years, when I was going through difficulties with my own family, this woman opened her home to me gave me a safe place to stay if I needed. She had been more of a parent to me than my own parents and basically adopted me as the daughter that she had always wanted so when I say we are incredibly close I genuinely mean it regardless of anything that’s happened with her son, we have a really strong relationship outside of that. We typically have a good catchup once a week and message in between, nothing I say to her gets passed on to her son, from what I can gather, the trickles of information he gets is through the grapevine of the group of friends we mutually share. So when she reached out to see if I was okay yesterday, I decided I’d pop over and catch up with her.\n\nTurns out he came clean to her when she asked exactly what had gone on as she hadn’t heard off me in a few days and she was worried, she went absolutely ballistic at him and currently is not speaking to him at all. Then she told me something I did not know and something she assumed I’d known all along. It turns out that when he was born he had undescended testicles, he had the surgery to correct it but there was always going to be the chance that he would have fertility issues in adulthood, he was meant to go for check ups once he passed puberty age to see whether there was any lasting damage and he claimed to his mother that he had gone to these and everything was fine, but neither of us actually believe this.\n\nSo the entire time we discussed having children, he knew there was a possibility that all he was shooting was blanks, but neglected to actually let me know this, FOR TEN FREAKING YEARS.\n\nBear in mind we were probably having unprotected sex for 2 years of our relationship, not actively trying but we had agreed that if something happened, we’d be happy about it, so I think when we were actively trying to have a baby and nothing was happening it sort of gave him the mental tip off that all was not well and he finally decided to get that check up he’d been putting off.\n\nIm flabbergasted guys.\n\nIn regard to my partner and I’s relationship, we are absolutely fine, he’s used to my sulky episodes haha. I did eventually fill him in after a few days of being mildly annoyed and he agreed that it was super fucked up and agreed with a lot of the comments that his timing for telling me all this was absolutely comical. We did suspect for a while that the real reason he decided to leave was cheating initially, because he’d gotten strangely close to one of the girls in our friend group (the majority of which dropped me like hot shit once we split), turns out there’s nothing going on there, but a another lil tidbit off my ex’s mum that she found out also, guys he’s dating this girls 60 YEAR OLD MOTHER!!\n\nGood lord his life is a dumpster fire. \nI don’t even think I’m mad anymore, just mildly amused.\n\n\nAbsolutely done with that.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

    "body": "This is a follow up to this post, which was pretty well received: https://m.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/4xk3d1/text_10_years_ago_i_was_deeply_depressed_and/\n\nI had requests for more detail on the specifics of how I turned my life around so this post will focus on the strategies and tactics I used. \n\n**First I want to clarify, I'm not hiking the AT to help with depression or anything. I'm hiking because it's what I want to do. I'm hiking because I'm finally not held back by fears. I'm hiking because I'm finally LIVING after years and years of hiding in my room. I see this hike as a capstone on over a decade of self improvement.**\n\nVery briefly I'll recount my past(my other post has more detail). I grew up as an anxious and depressed Chinese kid. I was adopted from China at 8 and my father died when I was 13. This created a lot of problems that took me many many years to come to grips with. As a consequence I went through cyclical depression and anxiety for my teens and most of my twenties(im 29 now). I've had serious suicidal ideation and many points in life where I felt I couldn't possibly continue on. Despite it all I was able to push through and apply these practices that slowly, bit by bit, changed my inner being and as a consequence changed my outer world. \n\nThrough the years I've had MANY relapses where it felt like everything I'd learned and gained was lost. But each time I fell I was able to come back a stronger, wiser, and with less fear.\n\n**Cornerstone Habits**\n\nFitness changed my life. I was 100lbs going into highschool. Scrawny with zero confidence. I asked for a weight set for Christmas when I was 15 and started doing random lifts. Benching a whopping 25lbs. Curling 8lb dumbbells. But I stuck with it and by the age of 21 I'd built up to 189lbs and 8% body fat. Here's a old post I wrote up on /r/fitness talking about that transformation: https://m.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/18w30k/so_i_heard_rfitness_liked_asian_transformations/\n\nFitness gave me a sense of control over my life. It gave me confidence. It gave me the belief that I could accomplish anything that I set my mind to - a belief that was completely foreign to my younger self. Without this confidence I would never have taken any of my actions later in life because I wouldn't have believed myself capable of achieving any of those goals.\n\nSo I think it's vital to start the process of change with a cornerstone habit. It doesn't have to be fitness. But I think fitness makes a great one. You can measure your progress. It will make you feel better and improve your cognition. You'll receive external validation as you make progress and gain confidence and an improved self image.\n\nI think meditation makes for another great cornerstone habit.\n\nI recommend focusing on one simple habit and building your new life around it. Don't make it complicated. Start with a 15 minute walk everyday. Focus only on this habit. Then after a month build upon it. Add 25 push-ups to the end of your walk. Then a 5 minute meditation session. And so on. But not everything at once. Just build one simple habit that you don't skip no matter what. A simple habit that's not overly complicated or difficult to maintain. Changing a life starts as one simple change which will build unstoppable momentum given time \n\n**The mind is everything**\n\nTruly our attitudes and perceptions are everything.\n\nYou see it on the trail all the time. Two people can be hiking the same trail and have completely different experiences. \n\nOne is worried about what they'll do when they get home. They're worried about rain. Worried about the upcoming mountains.\n\nThe other is enjoying the sunshine. They're lookimg forward to cooking a warm dinner. They're happy that they get to spend a few months in nature.\n\nSame trail. Same hike. Two totally different experiences. \n\nBecause of their attitudes. Because of their perceptions. \n\nWhen I'm depressed I think of how unfair it was that I had to leave everyone I knew at the age of 8. How much easier life would be if I didn't grow up being so screwed up psychologically from my early childhood experiences. If I had a normal family. If I connected with my parents like most of my friends.\n\nBut I can't change the past. I can only change my attitude and reactions today. And it's when I take responsibility for my attitude that I can fight the darkness. I can look at my childhood as a curse or a gift. I KNOW I'm much stronger mentally and emotionally today because of my early life experiences. All my many periods of depression has forged an inner core of strength that others don't have. I'm much more resilient for the experiences.\n\nSo I can choose to wallow in self pity or I can choose to take advantage of the opportunity afforded to me and make the best of it. \n\nAnd that is **powerful.** We all have an incredible core of power within us. To claim it we need to have the courage to stop being a victim. To claim full responsibility over our life. To see our tribulations as a trial by fire. \n\nWe are only victims of life if we **allow ourselves to be victims.** You can be great. It's there within you. Let go of the self-pitying narrative. It's only a story. Choose a new path. Choose the path of life. Choose to accept what happened in your past as a inevitable and necessary stepping stone to becoming the fully actualized and fully vibrant human being that you know you're meant to be.\n\nAnd this change happens again with the smallest steps. It happens by choosing, on a daily basis, on an hourly basis, to change your attitudes and beliefs. Day after day. It's hard work. You've had years and decades of negative thoughts. They won't go away in a day or even a year. But they can and will be changed with perseverance.\n\n**Everything you need to know has been written about by someone else.**\n\nI started the path reading a Tony Robbins book. Now I think the guy is kinda cheesy and long winded but at the time his book helped a lot.\n\nI don't have many specifics to recommend. Everyone is different. You will find your own authors who speak to you.  But I firmly believe that once you set an intent to find the books and people that you need, that they will them materialize in your life almost as if by magic.\n\nSo open yourself to learning. Seek out authors. Seek out audio books. Open yourself to learning. Everything you're struggling with someone else has overcome and they've written books and given talks that will help you achieve similar outcomes.\n\n**Get a handle on your addictions.**\n\nUntil you master your addictions you cannot master yourself. For me my big addictions were video games, porn, and caffeine. \n\nMastering these was less a matter of actively trying to suppress them than a process of filling my life with more positive activities.\n\nHere's a video I made talking about getting off caffeine: https://youtu.be/_kXq8na6Q9w\n\nAnd my marker for positive/negative is simply what makes me fulfilled and happy at the end of the day. For me video games, porn, and stimulants gave me a temporary boost but always left me empty and depressed at the end of the day. And as I've removed the addictions with things like meditation, exercise, building my business, hiking the AT, socializing, being with my girlfriend i end the days happy and fulfilled. \n\nAnd it depends on how you're approaching a thing. When I used games as a tool to escape life they left me unfulfilled and unhappy. Now I play hearthstone a few hours a week, for fun, and it's great! Again it comes down to attitude and perspective.\n\nSo that's my simple yardstick. I get rid of that which leaves me empty and add that which makes me fulfilled.\n\n**Change in the end is actually very simple.**\n\nIt really is. Focus on positive habits. Add to them. When you inevitably fall then start back small and build again.\n\nTry new things. I try everything i come across. Crazy stuff. Astral projection. Lucid dreaming. Chakra crap. Most of it is BS and not useful but there are some really helpful nuggets that I never would have found if I hadn't tried. I've read a bunch of really useless self help books but most have had at least one tiny piece of useful info and thus weren't a waste of time.\n\nLike Bruce Lee said, \"Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless and add what is specifically your own.\"\n\nIn the end what gives me peace is that all we need to do is try. Given a long enough time horizon improvement always happens, if you try. \n\nSo don't stress. Just try. Do what you can. If what you can means taking a shower and walking around your house - awesome! That's all it takes! Now do that again tomorrow. And soon you'll build unstoppable momentum. It truly is amazing.\n\nI've hiked about 1,300 miles now and have about 850 to go. Here's some photos from Maine(just finished hiking Maine). Now on to the White mountains. https://imgur.com/gallery/sdUjG\n\nGoodluck everyone and happy trails.

It was great fun, during the day. Then feel lonely/sad/want to die when going to sleep at night, or long walks back from university to my room.\n\nI started gym. I started forcing myself to go out and socialize, when I didn't want to. I REALLY didn't want to. It felt good to be out but it was hard to do it. I had lots of times falling back into the darkness and isolation again. Can't miss those raids in World of Warcraft! But I would eventually move forward again.\n\nRepeat the backwards-forwards loop enough times to make my lizard brain realise what works and now I've never been happier. I wake up with energy and dance to the radio alone.  I go out at every opportunity because I've learned to feel a high from being social and seeing my lovely friends and meeting new people.\n\nOne evening out meeting new people turns into a chain reaction of events and getting invited to new places, discovering new ideas or even making new hobbies.\n\nNow I'm a learning Violinist. I discovered gender fluidity and having tons of fun with blurring gender lines. I still do weight lifting every week but no longer do upper body since I learned that I don't give a fuck about being masculine. Squats are so fun. I'm the first person dancing at a party, acting silly without a care in the world while the old me would be sat on the side lines crippled by anxiety.\n\nI also learned not to be so crippled about thinking about romantic interests or a lack thereof.

I would just kind of deal with it because caffeine has a profound positive effect on my mood during the day.\n\nWhat kind of bothers me though is that that I'm on day 11 and for the last two night I have been getting that mild depression feeling returning again. I've never had this problem in my life, and it's making me think it could be an after effects of the gabapentin I was on 5 months ago for the Bell's Palsy residue facial pain. (I am completely drug free now though)\n\nI am having very deep cravings for a coffee or chocolate, because I know it will immediately turn my day around and give me some much needed energy. It works every time, but the side effects from my stupid sensitive nervous system just aren't worth it, and I will pay for it for days. I get headaches for the next 2 days after a single coffee if I don't have one either those following days to top it off w/ the twitching.\n\nAnyways thanks for the post and extra motivation I needed. \n\nQuick question, Do you still eat chocolate, drink alcohol, or sugar sometimes?  I have been trying to go for runs lately and it seems to help some, but I cannot kick this *deep* craving for a dopamine pickup, it never seems to go away and I am so fatigued all the time. I know chocolate has caffeine in it though so can't do that.\n\nAt night when the mild depression feeling hits I almost just want to say \"screw it!\" and make a run to starbucks, but I know it will mess my nervous system up for days, and it's funny because we are talking caffeine here, not some sort of hardcore drug. I don't know why I am having such a hard time with this and my nervous system can't just be normal like other people. I can't handle alcohol either.\n\nWhat even more confusing is all the the websites like Mayo Clinic say caffeine withdrawals should only last 4 days, so it has me wondering if something else is actually going on.",

I was getting bullied by classmates and upperclassmen on a semi regular basis, strictly because I was tiny and an easy target. One day, I got home, after a particularly rough day and stared at the \"weight set\" in my room that I got for Christmas. It was a triangle of 3,5,10 pound dumbbells. I picked up the 5's and curled, because all I knew to do was curl. Fast forward to the age of 23, when I enlisted, and I was rock solid. Got even more fit in the Marines. Got out, and was in the best shape of my life for a few years. Then, depression hit, and over the last 30 months or so I've been a shell of myself; but, everything you've said is right on: set small goals. Forget the negative shit, and focus on the positives. Cut out the stuff that gives you instant gratification (gaming, weed, etc) and focus on what will make you happy at the end of the day. It's been a battle for me, as it was for you OP, but this is the type of success story ive literally been scouring for. I'm glad you've made all these positive changes in your life and it gives me that much more hope that before long, as long as I work on myself, I'll be the person I want to be. Awesome stuff man, genuinely happy for you!\n\nEdit: this would be a great fit in r/depression",

        "body": "*7 Habits of Highly Effective People* offers a few good pieces of info and mental models. I recommend it. \n\nIf you can get past the fact that his audience seems to be male fathers trying to succeed in business, and that the book largely shaped 80s and 90s yuppie business culture, you'll actually find that his description of \"character ethic\", choices, his \"Time Management Matrix\", and his \"upward spiral\" ideas are super insightful and useful.\n\nThe upward spiral is one of the most critical ideas. Many people self-criticize or talk themselves down constantly, or are afraid of being judged as a fake or whatever. The upward spiral says no to that. It says that the \"downward spiral\" gets too much press.  At any moment in time, you can grab your life's reigns and nudge it toward something intentionally. You can do your future self favors.  Coupled with the character ethic, this is powerful because it says not only that you're worthy of good stuff, but that your focus on your underlying character can see you through self-doubt and worries about negative judgment. Planning and doing right by people go a long way, and a lot of the rest really is superficial stories people tell themselves about how they ought to act or portray themselves.\n\nThat also fits with the idea of \"Growth Mentality\". If you believe it's possible to grow and improve, you now have the space to do it. But if you're feel you're trapped by your own circumstances, then you might be trapping yourself *arbitrarily*.\n\nThat ties in with the  idea that EVERYTHING YOU DO IS A CHOICE. He says a lot people think of life \"happening to them\", perhaps as a means of shirking responsibility for choices that led to bad or uneventful outcomes.\n\nThe Time Management Matrix does a good job of putting things like video games into a larger perspective, without automatically demonizing them.\n\nOverall, worth it.",

My doc actually suggested I keep drinking coffee (in limited quantities) to keep migraines at bay. Yes, the second coffee was free, since my first was tossed in the trash. No, no one said anything to her, but I'm not surprised. People don't get involved in stuff anymore. \n\nEdit 2 - Y'all I'm not naturally clever enough for the pun in the title 🤣 I can't take credit. Someone else pointed it out to me before I saw what I'd done. \n\nTLDR: Crazy lady wanted to take away my coffee because I'm pregnant, and I yelled at her. \n\nLet me start by saying I'm 36w - and it's very obvious I'm pregnant. I'm huge. Massive. Uncomfortable. Tired and grumpy.\n\nI am currently at my local chain coffee shop, sitting now, with my effing cup of coffee that had to be remade, because some random grandmother decided that, as I'm pregnant, I shouldn't be allowed to have caffeine. Full story:\n\nI've ordered the coffee (just a grande cold brew, nothing crazy), and am standing at the end of the counter waiting. The barista calls my name and drink order. I go to take it.\n\nGrandma (GM) - You can't have that.\n\nI didn't know she was talking to me, so I continue to reach for my cup.\n\nGM - YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT YOU'RE PREGNANT\n\nMe - It's one cup, it's fine.\n\nGM - NO YOU CAN'T HAVE IT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED (takes cup *from my hand* and drops it, full, into the trash next to the counter)\n\nMe - You cannot be serious. It's fine. My doctor even says it's fine. (I looked at the barista, who is just standing there, mouth agape. She let's me know she'll make me another).\n\nMe, to GM - Please leave me alone. I'm tired, and want my coffee. I get one cup a day, this is it. Please go away.\n\nGM, banshee screaming at this point - NO YOU CAN'T HAVE IT YOU'RE PREGNANT IT WILL MAKE YOU HAVE THE BABY NOW YOU CAN'T DO IT I WON'T LET MY DAUGHTER DO IT EITHER BUT SHE DRINKS IT ANYWAY AND IF I CAN'T SAVE HER I'LL SAVE YOU INSTEAD (I don't think she breathed during this at all. Also, what? Save me?)\n\nMe, looking around for help because I'm not good at confrontation and she's making me panic - Please stop. *looking at barista, pleading for help with my every thought* I'll just take that directly when you're done.\n\nBarista hands me my cup directly, and this insane woman *GOES TO TAKE IT FROM ME AGAIN*\n\nSo I yelled. For her to stop trying to come near me. I literally, loudly (and even now have a bit of a shake from doing it), shouted PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE. YOU'RE MAKING ME UNCOMFORTABLE AND I DON'T WANT YOU THIS CLOSE.\n\nShe stopped, did this fish mouth gaping thing, went \"UGH FINE\" and left. The barista gave me a drink coupon and apologized for the stress, but goodness. How can someone think that's OK?",

Mild-to-moderate substance abuse !<\n\nGather 'round, friends, and let me tell you a story of ill-advised mixology, daring bluffs, and a host of glamorous and not-so-glamorous exploits.  I'd like to apologize in advance for amy typos; my hands are rather shaky at the moment, for reasons that will soon become apparent.\n\n        ~    ~    ~\n\nThe time was 7:00 pm today.  I was sitting in a lecture hall, struggling to stay awake.  I still had two hours of class to get through, and the teacher's droning, soporific voice was doing a grave disservice to what should have been a fascinating topic.  \n\nI wasn't concerned, though; I had a secret weapon.  I reached into my bag, and retreived the vial of *Captain Cow's Particularly Potent Pick-me-up Potion* I had prepared this morning.  I uncorked the bottle and took a small sip of the cloudy red liquid inside.  It burned my throat, and the acrid, bitter taste clung to my lips.  It took half a bottle of water to purge the evil flavors from my mouth.  But then, this stuff wasn't supposed to taste good; it was supposed to get *results*.  I sat and waited eagerly for it to take effect.\n\nHalf an hour later, the temptation to drift off to sleep was still there, clouding my mind and weighing down my eyelids.  I decided I needed a little more juice.  This time I took a hearty mouthful, forcing it down my throat despite my body's protests.\n\nThat, dear reader, was a mistake.\n\n        ~    ~    ~\n\nAt this point, we should rewind a few years for some much-needed context.  This is the part of the story with the daring bluff and the glamorous exploits.\n\nI graduated high school with the help of prescription stimulants, which were only prescribed for a short time.  I took them on an as-needed basis, and squirreled the excess away for a rainy day.  \n\nFast forward a few years, to the rainiest rainy day in recent history:  the pandemic.  The collective mental health of the world took a nosedive, and I was right there with everyone else, plummeting toward rock-bottom.  I remembered how well prescription stimulants had worked for me in the past, but I didn't want to exhaust my dwindling stash or pay exorbitant prices for street adderall, so I started looking into alternatives.\n\nDear reader... did you know you can just go on the internet and buy a canister of pure, laboratory-grade caffeine?  I didn't, until one fateful night in December of last year.  I sat staring at my computer screen, my mind awash with new hope and anticipation.  I added the canister to my cart, and pressed the big green button.\n\nAs it turns out, ordering stimulants - even legal ones - from an industrial biochemical supply company isn't as simple as \"just push the big green button.\"  They wanted to know that I was a responsible scientist working with a reputable research institution, and not, for example, a burned-out college student trying to impulse-buy enough caffeine to kill a horse.  I sat staring at the form for a while, wondering if I was the kind of person who would try to bluff their way through a background check to order soft drugs from a chemical supply company.  The bottle of single-malt on my desk cast the deciding vote.\n\nI woke up the next morning feeling bright and chipper.  (My brain was designed to be alcoholic.  I get anti-hangovers.)  I sat down at my computer and checked my email:  one new message, from a contact at a biochemical supply company.  The events of the previous night came flooding back to me.\n\n*Oh fucking hell ass balls,* I thought.  *They must have followed up with the school.  I'm probably about to be expelled.  Son of a ass, why did I think this would work?*\n\nHeart pounding, I opened the email.\n\n\"Dear Cow,\" it read.  \"We're writing to inform you that your recent request to be added to the list of authorized purchasers for Cow College has been approved.  Click this link to complete your order.\"\n\nI stared at the screen, dumbfounded.  I clicked the link, still dumbfounded.  I placed my order.  I spent the rest of the year adding carefully-measured portions of semi-legally-obtained caffeine to my tea, making each cup of chamomile the equivalent of eight cups of coffee.  \n\nI was *back,* baby!  \n\nI got back into cooking.  I took up hobbies.  I went on dates.  I pulled all-nighters.  I went from nocturnal to diurnal to nocturnal again.  I did all my homework on the roof (students weren't supposed to have roof access, but I was an exception because I was good at picking locks.)  I saved my declining grades.  I graduated.\n\nI decided to take more classes.\n\n        ~    ~    ~\n\n...which brings us to today, when I decided a swig of *Mama Moo's Probably-Potable Pep Potation* was exactly what I needed to make it through my evening class.\n\n\"So, Cow,\" I hear you ask, \"what was in this mysterious mixture?\"\n\nEverything, I reply with a shameful grimace.  Everything was in it.  It was half espresso and half tobasco sauce, fortified with pure caffeine, amphetamine, nicotine and methylphenidate.  One sip is the equivalent of washing down a ritalin and half an adderall with twelve cups of coffee.  A shot glass of the stuff would send an adult into ventricular fibrillation.  It's an unholy blend of stimulants and capsaicin in an acid bath.  It's an ill-advised, irresponsible and most-certainly-illegal elixer of inexorable anxious energy.  It should never be imbibed.  It should be sealed in a lead-lined box to protect future generations.  It's a crime against nature.  I should be locked up for creating it.\n\nSo now I lie here in my bed, taking long deep breaths, trying to keep my mind and body under control while the concoction slowly drains from my system.  My muscles are trembling, my resting heartrate is 90bpm, and I can feel the adrenaline and cortisol pumping through my veins.  It's a good thing I have prior practice preventing panic attacks, or else I'd surely be curled into a fetal ball of suffering by now.\n\nDon't worry, internet friends, I've learned my lesson.\n\nNext time, I'll only take one swig.\n\n        ~    ~    ~\n\nTL;DR - Today, I mixed up a bottle of *Sergeant Steer's Suspiciously-Strong Stay-awake Sauce* to help me stay awake through my evening class.  It was an unholy mixture of espresso, tobasco, laboratory-grade caffeine, amphetamine, nicotine and methylphenidate.  I underestimated its potency and imbibed far more than I should have.  Now I'm suffering through the after-effects of my satanic swill, trying to keep my mind and body under control until the evil brew has run its course.  Lesson learned:  one. sip. only.\n\n\n        ~    ~    ~\n\nEDIT:  I'm kind of floored by how much people have engaged with this, both to appreciate and condemn it, and I'd like to address a thing or two.\n\n1:  Everything I've described is a terrible idea, that nobody should imitate.  I'm playing up the chaos goblin undergrad character to make for an entertaining read, but the truth is all of these decisions were bad ones.  In hindsight, a couple honest conversations with a psychiatrist would have been a much *much* better way to address my mental health struggles during the pandemic.  Oh well, better late than never, which brings me to point 2:\n\n2:  The concern and support from y'all has been heartwarming and eye-opening for me.  I've written a lot of comments in the past few hours telling people not to follow my example, and I'm realizing I really needed someone to tell me that too.  I'm going to email my psychiatrist tomorrow and set up an appointment.  It's long overdue.  If you or someone you know is struggling with depression / ADHD / feeling unable to function, know that you're not alone, and there are a lot of great people you can turn to for support ♥ \n\n3:  omg you guys really like my writing that much?  Aw shucks...     y'know... I recently wrote a short story as a comment in another sub... and I was sad that nobody saw it... I think it's much more well-written than this post, so like... I dunno, if anyone is looking for something short and silly to read, y'know 👉👈",

    "body": "This happened a few days ago now and I'm bored enough in ICU to type this up for your amusement. I was driving home the other day when I had the sudden urge for Wendy's nuggets. I wasn't hungry but I had meds that required food, so might as well eat something good. The drink of choice for these particular nugs was a nice strawberry lemonade. \n\nFlash back to years ago and I'm choking on the most delicious prime rib I've ever had. It was just so good I kept shoveling it in and may have been overly lax on the chewing. Since that choking incident food tends to get stuck at the bottom of my throat. Usually I can just drink something and it'll politely move along. I finished that prime rib.\n\nPresent time. Half of the first chicken nugget has been chewed and swallowed as I merge into the interstate. There are no issues, nothing feels abnormal. I happily drink my lemonade and life is good. Wait, it's still in my throat. Oh no, lungs hate lemonade but this shit isn't moving so I start drowning while driving. I put on my turn signal like a civilized fucking person and move over the three lanes to the side and put on hazards. Now covered in my delicious lemonade I make it out of the vehicle and over to the side to choke that shit out of my throat. Success. I finish the meal out of spite and forget my pills.\n\nYou wish I was done, we're on to the bonus round. I'm feeling tired, whatever I didn't sleep well the day before. I drink all the caffeine I can find for the remaining two hour drive back. Make it to the office, clock out, make it home. Stairs are a thing and they suck but normally I don't have to crawl up them. Alright something might be wrong. Take a shit that's straight black... that's a new one. I really want to sleep at this point (which likely would have made me dead) but I Google the tar shit because why not. Google basically tells me I'm going to die so a ride to the ER seems in order.\n\nGet wheeled in to wait, no shocker there. Things are moving slowly. Yay I have to shit again. More black gold but wait there's more, I grab the trash can and throw up an additional liter of blood while shitting it. I now have a team of nurses watching some Exorcist level shit but none of them offers to grab a priest. On the bright side that made a room open instantly. Shortly after that I'm wheeled to what I assume is the organ harvesting room and get quickly KOed. Wake up with four staples in my esophagus and an all liquid diet. Still losing blood so I'm volunteered for a second endoscopy that gets me another staple and a cauterized ulcer.\n\nTL;DR Chew your fucking food or you'll drown going 70mph then shit and vomit blood at the same time",

That sucks.\n\nWord of medical advice: the choking and \"food getting stuck in your throat\" you describe can be a severe symptom of an underlying problem. It's Severe Acid Reflux Disease and/or GERD. Your esophagus is probably inflamed, and is causing food to occasionally catch. This can be stress related, diet related, related to secondary/primary illnesses, etc.\n\nMy suggestion is to suggest to your doctor (\"I choked on a chicken nugget\" is more common than GERD/SARD, and if you started with that and didn't mention to your doctor that \"Hey, this happens every so often and I'm worried\", they may not investigate further), that you may have GERD or SARD. Ask for a gastroenterologist referral. \n\nMight just save your life bro, having GERD or SARD untreated can cause esophogial cancer. Hope I'm wrong, homie, best wishes.",

The reason your poop is black is because you're bleeding so far up the digestive tract that your body has digested its own blood, which turns it a black color. If you have a lower GI bleed your poop will have fresh red blood in it and this is usually less serious, and can be a result of ruptured hemorrhoids which can be benign and even totally unpainful.\n\nTL;DR.

    "body": "Alright fellow appreciators of absurdity and pettiness, here's a satisfying medium length read to get you that much closer to the weekend as you grind away at the hampster wheel that is the American work week.\n\nSo I recently transitioned from Active Duty Army to the National Guard, which as my fellow former service members know comes with a metric buttload of paperwork and medical records. (This will be relevant later)\n\nSo I got out last December, got accepted to grad school in February, and just started class a few weeks ago. As you all know, there is some sort of pandemic virus-y thing going on, and many institutions require a vaccine to attend in person classes, which the program I am enrolled in falls under. Like a good little boy I got my vaccine as soon as I could last March, posted the obligatory nobody-gives-a-shit picture of my vaccine card, and then moved on with my life. \n\nFast forward to June, and I am hopping through the endless admin hoops of going back to school, and of course, submitting immunization records is on the to-do list. Since I got my shot through the National Guard, they actually already had the box checked for the COVID vaccine. Cool! Maybe that's because I am attending a public university in the state I am in the guard for, so maybe they share a medical database? I dont know, doesn't matter... And for those of you who cry HIPAA, news flash, when you join the military, you give a few things up, get stuff in return blah blah, not what the story is about. Although I dont think that a COVID shot can do anything to me that Anthrax, Typhoid, and Smallpox shots, 3 pinched nerves, and 5 years of running on pure hate and caffeine hasn't done to me already. But hey , I'm still kicking ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nON TO THE MALICIOUS COMPLIANCE PART!!!\n\nNow to submit the rest of my immunization shot records. I have to upload a PDF into the school's medical portal. So I go through the shot record in my medical out-processing packet, snip the page so it's just the immunizations - thinking \"no need to include extraneous military stuff that may confuse them\" - and hit submit. Its literally just one page. \n\nA few days later, low and behold, I get a notice saying my medical records are incomplete/incorrect, and action is required on my behalf. I have to upload more info....ok, will do. I just want to get this done.\n\nSo I submit the whole shot record/historical record/testing portion, about 30 pages. Oh, what do you know, deja vu!!  A few days later, I get an email saying \"Dear Mr Student, this is to inform you that additional action is required...\" Yeesh. So I log into the medical portal, because of course this cant be done through email (HIPAA, I know, I just like to complain because we're all human, sue me) and see that whoever reviewed the longer PDF I uploaded  wasn't satisfied, saying my submission of proof of immunization was \"incomplete.\" Ok, fine. You know what? WE'LL PLAY THAT GAME.\n\nI go dig through a closet and find the folder that has my out-processing stuff from active duty. The thing is, when you get out, they give you a physical, hard copy of your medical records on CD's in addition to all the digital stuff, as well as what they send to the VA. My medical records were long enough to require 2 CDs. So copy them to my laptop, then upload them to the school's medical portal. All 745 pages of CD 1, and 300 pages of CD 2. Before I hit upload, I respond to the previous message explaining that this is the entirety of my service medical records, and if this isn't sufficient documentation, please let me know. This was in maybe late July/early August.\n\nFast forward to mid-September, and today I received an email confirming the acknowledgment of my proof of vaccination status. Hooray! Solely out of curiosity, I decide to check the documents part. Low and behold, IT'S THE ORIGINAL 1 PAGER I MADE!!! \n\nNow to be fair, I have no idea if someone read thorugh that whole thing, or said \"fuck this guy\" and went back the first one, but either way, due to the 6+ week wait, I like to think some poor sap actually tried to dig through that. But hey, if you really want to waste my time, I'll return the favor.\n\nTL;DR - some turd burglar medical processor says my military shot records aren't good enough to prove I'm vaccinated, so I dump my whole VA medical record on them.\n\nHave a great Thursday, people!!",

Then you sent the second file and they still didn't see what they needed (though at that point it was probably included) so they wanted more detail.  Then you sent the huge third file.

        "body": "OP.. thats awesome.. Heh I had a similar situation when I went back to school back aruond 2012.    I had to submit shot records that showed chicken pox vaccine to go to college.  I contracted chicken pox as a child because we didnt have vaccine for it back then.  When I joined the AF I avoided getting the shot by telling them this and they tested me for an immune response and documented that I had positive titer to chickenpox.  This was enough for the AF and they documented it on my shot record.   When I gave my shot record to the college they said they needed to see documentation that I received the shot.  I explained how my shot recorded showed I have positive titer to chickenpox but admissions person insisted that wasnt enough.  I asked to talk to someone higher up and she said well you can send it to some state health secretaries office and she gave me the email.  So I emailed this state secretary with my situation including the original email I received from admissions telling me to email them.  A week later I received a reply back where I was the CC and the admissions person was the recipient.  This state secretary ripped that admissions person a new one.  First she pointed out that I proved positive titer and that per some regulation that was enough and that if she was a proper admissions person she should know that.  Then she went on to rip her for saying that there was no other person who could approve my record than the state secretary her self as there was basically a whole slew of waivers that could be done if anyone didnt meet the vaccination requirements.  Finally she thanked me for my service and apologized to me that this admissions person had treated me so poorly.   Needless to say I never had another problem with my admission into that college.\n\nEdit: Correction to chicken pox instead of smallpox and some spelling mistakes.  Sorry it was 9 years ago.. simple mistake.",

I was getting ready to do my first deployment to Iraq in 2004.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, if you weren't attached to a unit that was deploying, you had to go down to Ft. Benning in Georgia for \"CRC\" (I forget what that stands for).\n\nIt was a week of mind-numbing standing in line to do all of the things that you needed to do: get some basic gear, get qualified on whatever weapons you were going to be carrying (easily the highlight of the week -- getting to shoot for 15 minutes), get a living will together, all of that stuff.  It was probably 2-3 hours of actual activity stretched into one long, long boring-as-fuck-and-it's-100*-outside week of suffering.\n\nOne of the things, of course, is a medical screening.  We were told, numerous times, to be sure to bring our vaccine records with us.  Sure, no problem.  Get all my records and pack them in my bag.  I double-check this at least 20 times because I don't want to forget them.\n\nI get down there, and the day for medical screening comes.  Go to get my vaccine records.  They are not there.  Search everywhere. Nope.  (When I got back home, I found them on my bed.)\n\nThe Army, of course, had a very, very simple solution to this: assume that I had never had a vaccination in my entire life and get me up to speed.\n\nThey took me to a screened off area, and 4 orderlies wheeled in two trays stacked with needles.  I got innoculated against DTAP, chicken pox, MMR, polio, menengitis, Hepatitis A, B, and C, tetanus, cholera, Japanese Encyphalitis, typhoid, yellow fever, smallpox, and anthrax.\n\nNeedless to say, I was absolutely fucked after that.

I turn off most of the lights in the entertainment room and turn the TV on, and leave to make the coffee.\n\n\nI ended up making it in the espresso machine, and fill a small glass with the night prolonging caffeine. Deciding to get a little creative, I dump a hot chocolate mix pouch into a pint glass and give it a glance in case there's anything in the drink mix. Looks fine.\n\nThis is where it would be appropriate to mention that with the coming of winter, the ants have decided to move into the kitchen and have learned how to eat into cereal bags, granola bars, you name it. In order for the dry goods to survive while the baits do their work, most of them were moved into various airtight containers last week, including the hot cocoa mix. \n\nThat being said, I dump the hot espresso over the drink mix, give it a stir and add some milk for volume, and proceed to watch the entirety of the TV show. Literally as the credits were rolling, I pick at something between my teeth, only to realize its a crushed cluster of sugar ants. Realizing immediately what happened, I turn on the overhead lights and look into the mostly emptied glass, and notice a *disturbing* number of ants strewn across the sides of the glass and littered about the bottom. Gargling with water confirms just how many of the buggers ended up in my teeth (at least 2 dozen) with many more undoubtedly in my gut. \n\nThe ants most likely were actively raiding the drink mix baggy when they got packed into the \"ant proof\" containers and died inside, only to become protein mix a week later.\n\ntl;dr Ants that ate their way into a baggy of hot cocoa mix a week ago ended up in my pre-exam mocha which I unsuspectingly drank in the dark while watching Brooklyn 99. \n\nedit: Hey sorry for the comments getting locked?

It’s been the same song and dance, they’re happy for a few weeks, then something small happens, they argue, it gets really nasty, and they make up and back to a loving couple. When i learned my brother got kicked out of his apartment and needed a place to stay i offered him the extra room in my apartment and my brother agreed to pay rent, help with bills, and pitch in with food. \n\nFor three months now, she’s been announcing she’s pregnant. She alone will eat a snack box with 50 small bags of chips in a week. i tried to reason with her and get her to cut back (not only from overeating but she was running us low on food) but she insists she and the baby are healthy and it’s just cravings blah blah blah. \n\nSince last month, most of what my parents sends to my house (my mom is a couponer so she bulk shops and give away what she has too much of) my brother’s girlfriend is the first to get into it and a large portion of it is gone by a few days to a week. From a 24 case of monster (the energy drink if you’re not familiar) 8 will be gone in a week from just her.\n\nShe eats a hell of a lot of food too, most of which no pregnant woman should be consuming so much of and yes i know all pregnancies are different but words can’t explain how much she eats in one sitting.\n\nSo, today i had seen her drinking coffee and after her 2nd cup i asked her if she should be drinking so much and she said her doctor told her it was fine and she had no worries. When i suggested she take on a healthier diet for the baby she just scoffed and walked out. \n\nI went and asked my brother if he’s been to any of her doctor appointments or even seen a positive pregnancy test and he said he didn’t. I confronted her about it and she said she didn’t have to prove anything and started to get defensive. I told her she needed to show a test or some proof of going to the doctor or she needs to move out as she doesn’t help at all.\n\nMy brother started defending her and changed his answer from not seeing any proof to seeing her pregnancy test. My parents got word of what i said and my mom says i was in no place to say anything and every woman’s body is different and i wouldn’t know since i’ve never been pregnant. AITA?\n\nEdit: i did talk to her a while ago about getting a job as well as helping out financially and she said she’d start and never has.\n\nRight so based on majority of the comments i overstepped yes but i’m going to go with my gut on this one and give them their 30 days notice and call it a day.\n\nI’ll for sure update you guys in a month (when they’re to be gone) and let you all (who’s interested) know what’s happened by then!\n\nI keep repeating myself let me add my brother knows everything i’ve said (the excessive caffeine, no ultrasound etc).\nYes my brother still buys her tampons monthly and i know this because he goes with me when i buy mine. \nNo i was not faking concern by the coffee comment. She drinks 2 cups of coffee a day along with a monster that’s a ton of caffeine.",

That being said, it is still contraindicated in some people, and others are liable to be more sensitive to it. However, it really cannot realistically be compared to other stimulant recreational drugs.\n\n\n\n2. On the other hand, the benefits associated with caffeine are extensive, and the introduction of caffeine into the daily lives of people in the northern hemisphere is viewed by historians as a key turning-point leading to the Age of Enlightenment. It's clinically proven to be a cognitive enhancer, unlike other CNS stimulants like amphetamine (except in those with ADHD), and cocaine.\n\n\n\n3. Naturally occurring caffeine is almost inescapable, anyway. Two of the three most popular beverages globally, tea and coffee, [typically] have caffeine.",

Especially young people I reckon. Energy drinks are quite devious in this regard, and is consumed in large quantities by younger people as soft drinks; The caffeine amount in some of the newer ones are insane (300 MG's), especially if you decide to treat it as a regular soft drink and drink two of them. You can basically intake 600 MGs of caffeine in as short of a time as it takes you to drink two energy drinks, which is the equivalent of around 6 cups of coffee.\n\nThere's not enough awareness on which quantities you should intake over the course of a day and at a time, how close to bedtime and the possible side effects.\n\nTry to NOT have caffeine for two days if you're a regular user.

Beautiful morning, it's 7am, I'm ahead of schedule so things are going ok. \n\nOnce in my car I remember some coffee left from the previous evening. Oh good! Cold coffee! It's 7-eleven coffee, and I'm pretty sure their milk products could survive the apocalypse unspoiled, so I'm not worried and willing to take a few sips. Ugh, dregs. But I need the caffeine. At this point I notice a little bit of extra... texture in there though. Did some crumbs from my granola bar get in last night? I swirl the nearly empty cup and drain it.\n\nWeird... kind of crunchy. I'm still not worried about spoiled milk at this point. The crunchiness is too crumb-feeling, too *healthy* sounding to be a curdle. I swallow a few more crunchy bits before thinking to spit one out and look at it. If this sounds naive, please undrestand I was (and am) very tired, and I was *really convinced* they were just crumbs.\n\nThey weren't crumbs. They were bugs.

Also, OOP adds a lot of details in comments - buckle up.\n\nAll of this started because I accidentally deleted his meal when ordered food on an app yesterday morning. All of our 3 kids (and us) are very sick with croup and ear infections. My husband woke up in a rage from being sick, hungover and not having smoked any pot because I told him he has to stop smoking in front of the kids. He wanted “caffeine and food” so he could “function.” He put his order on the app and I then did my order and placed it for priority delivery. Unfortunately when I was deleting a meal that I decided I did not want- I deleted his meal off of the app. I didn't realize this had happened until the order had already been placed with priority delivery. \n\nI worked up the courage to go and tell him. I said \"I am so sorry please don't hate me but I accidentally removed your meal. I can go get in the car and drive to get you the food that didn't get on the order.\" He starts getting in a rage about the situation. Takes a look at the app and says \"why is this so fucking expensive!? You are making us bleed money!\" Again I say \"I can go get you the order from the actual store, I have some cash in my wallet.\" He responds \"oh YOU have cash in YOUR wallet?!\" And laughs at me. He is getting more and more in a rage saying that all he fuckin needed was some caffeine and a stupid fucking broccoli cheddar bread bowl to make him able to function. \n\nI have recently asked him to stop smoking pot and drinking in the morning so he can be more present so I'm sure this is partially my fault but also I recognize that this is his addiction issue and not mine to solve.. I have tried everything. I notice his signs of aggression setting in so I take the kids in another room. They're all screaming and crying clinging to me and he rips the baby gate off of the master bedroom door and throws it across the hallway. The master door is already ripped off halfway from him slamming it so many times. I'm in the room with the kids and I decide that croup and all we are not going to stay here with him acting like this. I pack 3 bags with the kids clothes and mine and plenty of diapers since all 3 are still in diapers. The order arrives- bell rings he doesn’t answer. Rings again. He says “GODDAMNNIT” opens door, says thanks, slams door and throws the food on table spilling the drinks. \n\nHe comes in and says \"where are you going? You aren't leaving with my kids.\" Then he sees I'm packing the bags and says \"oh you're packing day bags?! No fucking way.\" And goes to rip them out of my arms. He twists my wrist while pulling then gives up and drops the bag, and he grabs his keys, rips the car seats out of my Tahoe and throws them in the garage, parks his long bed truck in front of my Tahoe so I can't leave. When he left the house to do this I grabbed my phone and pressed record on voice memo because this is the 100th argument like this over his rage and he always says the worst shit to me about how he will ruin me and take the kids from me. I tell him if he does not move his truck I am calling the police and I have a right to leave. I dial 911 and say \"Go move your truck and go put those car seats back in my car right now or I am calling the police. I have a right to leave with my children.\" He refused and said I am not going anywhere and we can sit here and work this out like adults. I tell him I am done, I want a divorce and I cannot live like this any more. \n\nHe said that if I divorce him he is going to take everything from me, I will have nobody, I will have no where to go, I will have no kids and I'll never see them again. He claimed to me good luck getting child support because he makes $250k but only claims $70k on his taxes. He said he has evidence against me to take my kids from me and I'll never see them again. He said he is allowed to smoke pot because it's decriminalized. He couldn't remember the last time he had been sober from alcohol just one fucking day when I inquired about it when stating that I want a divorce I've tried everything, I've shed every single piece of myself to make him happy instead of angry and help him be sober and it's never worked. I said \"I do not want you. I used to want you, I used to think I could do it but I can't. I said I want an amicable divorce and he can have the kids as much as he wants. He has to be sober when he has them and if he isn't I'll document it. He said that is not how this is going to play out. I said well I don't know what to do but I'm done I cannot live in fear and anxiety any longer. He looked at me, said the typical \"well this is a huge wake up call, I'm gonna throw away all the pot, I'll move the beers to the fridge and I'll get sober.\" \n\nI don't remember what I said but I just stopped there and went back to my care tasks. I said I have to breastfeed the baby, she needs a nap please leave me alone. I shut the kids door and got her down for a nap and I didn't see him around, I think he was in the driveway putting the car seats back, but left his truck there. He took a hot bath and read a book called \"Man in the Mirror\" some Christian men's book I guess. He said it's helping him already. He got on the phone with his sober friend while rolling a joint for \"a rainy day\" he tried to give all the weed to the other dad across the street who smokes but he didn't want it because he's trying to quit. He left the house to \"go buy paintbrushes\" and came back intoxicated or high after 2 hrs gone. He started love bombing me, hugging me, touching me, kissing me wouldn't leave me alone I wanted to throw up from anxiety. He forced me to put the ring back on my finger. He drank beer and smoked before bed. I just want someone in my life to love me enough to be sober and kind. To love my kids enough to be sober. I don't want to ruin him, I don't want to destroy him. I just want some peace in my life because I deserve that. I am a mom who does EVERYTHING. if I don't- it won't get done. we have an autistic 4 year old, 2.5 year old and a one year old (today is her birthday). \n\nI don't know what to do at this point. I'm broken, I have no job, $200 to my name, tons of bills and no degree. My parents aren't in my life because he made me think they were the problem and I shouldn’t be close with them. We have a beautiful, modest home in the best neighborhood within walking distance to the elementary school. I live on a cul-de-sac with 5 of the best neighbors I've ever had. I've invested so much time into this life with him that I'm thinking I can just stick around and hope for the best but maybe I'm just stressed and emotionally drained. Please help me because I don't know where to turn.\n\n>>Relevant comments from OOP and others:\n\nu/human-foi-gras gives their perspective\n\n> I grew up in a house just like this. Word for word you described my early childhood. The alcohol, drugs, uncontrollable rage and then weeping apologies and broken promises. My mom left just after my 4th birthday. All I remember is screaming, thrown plates and glasses and my dad beating my mother as she cowered over me to take it in my place. I am 35 years old and still in therapy. You need to get your children out. It is your job to put their needs first, and they need to be safe. They are not safe in this environment.\n\nWhen asked if she can stay elsewhere, OOP replied\n\n> I can go stay with his mom about 4.5-5hrs away. It’s spring break but my son has to be back in school on Monday.\n\n> Well my son is actually truant and for 45 days he cannot miss any more school I recently also had to hire an autism advocate and get my son switched out of his class and into another class because of some laws regarding disability being not upheld. I’m really trying and at a bit of a breaking point\n\nTo which another redditor said\n\n> Part of the reason your son is doing badly is because he’s in a abusive, alcoholic, addict home. He won’t get better until he is out of this dire situation. You need to put your love for your kids first or they will end up as addicts in abusive relationships.\n\nOOP seemed to be in denial about the situation:\n\n> * It just really sucks because I am sitting here feeling defensive over the entire situation and scanning my post for exaggerations but there just aren’t any. It’s really hard to hear my husband is abusive to me.\n\n> * I truly love him and honestly want a family life with him but I can’t do any more than I have done at this point I am broken and tired, empty\n\n> * He does not go to church but it’s part of his image\n\n> * Maybe I’m just used to it by now and he’s always gone. He’s home for a few hrs in the evening and leaves first thing every morning. I really really don’t want to change things for my oldest and we are all so so sick right now too. Maybe I can ask him to go leave and find somewhere to go until he is in a drug/alcohol program.\n\n> * I am not leaving my house. I am a primary caregiver to my 3 children who are 4, 2 and 1. I will not lose this residency and I have documented everything. I am pretending I am ok with his current resolutions, telling him to get into AA and stop the substances. If he has another outburst I am calling the police.\n\n> * I grew up with my dad choking my mom, slamming me against cabinets and pulling my hair out. This isn’t physical\n\n> * He’s always been angry when things don’t go right. This is the worst event we have had in our relationship I would say. Usually it’s just muttering under his breath and slamming doors really hard and screaming at me. But he’s always been able to go smoke or drink and uses that to calm down. He doesn’t have that any more and that is because of me putting my foot down and saying no more substances in the home.\n\n**Mini-updates from OOP's comments in the original post**\n\n> * I called a neighbor and told her what’s going on. I called my brother and he’s removing the guns from the house. I called his mom and she knows what’s going on and is on my side. I called a domestic violence shelter and set up a place to go. I packed a bag ready to leave. I threw away all the pot and poured the beers down the sink. I told my husband that if he ever comes home high or drunk or smokes or drinks again to not come home and find somewhere else to live. I have documentation, I will call the police, people know what’s going on and I won’t back down. I am not going to let him act like that I will call the police and he will be arrested. Today is my last baby’s first birthday- I just want some peace today, to eat some cake and put them to sleep in their own beds. I’m not going to stay if things escalate.\n\n> * He did it again. He took all the car seats in his truck, shut off my phone and left me alone at the house. I called the police. I’m at my brothers. I have an appointment on Thursday with the shelter to get help. I am at a loss and I feel so so so guilty right now.\n\n> * I left. He took the car seats, put them in his truck k and left to fix a mistake I made on our daughters documents. He was so angry with me leaving because I told him to stop slamming things and screaming. He was searching frantically for my keys. He couldn’t find them so he took the car seats, turned my phone off, shut off the WiFi and then he left. I called the police. It took them an hour to show up. When they did show up he had already busted through the screen on a window and got back in the house. I told him I called the police and they were on the way. He became so so calm and went to try and get the car seats out of his truck and back into my car before they got here. I went to video record him and he stopped and pretended to take the trash out. They arrived- got me with the shelter on the phone, took a statement for today and Sunday’s event. The woman cop was so so so nice and helped me without telling me what to do but just giving me “the eyes”. She didn’t say “get the fuck out” verbally but I knew she meant it with the looks she gave me. I packed bags, went to my brothers. As soon as I left he cancelled all my card, drained the bank account and turned my phone off permanently. He’s been texting me to come back with his wife and kids. I got a notification he bought marijuana and had it delivered. I am broken. I have no money but just $200 but that doesn’t matter. The shelter people are gonna help me get food stamps and Medicaid and my kids will be ok. I am an idiot for thinking he was different. The people on the phone at the shelter said this is all typical and exactly what abusers do. I am numb and don’t know what the next chapter is but for now I am not being yelled at and my kids aren’t crying and screaming upset.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**1st Update Post** - [**I left my husband after he took the car seats in his truck.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/11rm751/i_left_my_husband_after_he_took_the_car_seats_in/) in r/twoxchromosomes - **March 15, 2023**\n\n>>Editor's note: I tried to organize this information roughly in the order it was posted. \n\nI know that I updated in a comment on my last post. But I just wanted to let everyone know that I am safe and away from my home. My husband again entrapped me. This time he took the car seats and put them in his truck and left the house. Then he shut off my cards, turned my phone off and shut down the WiFi. I called the police. After an hour and a half waiting for the cops- he showed up and I had locked the doors. He busted through the unlocked window screen and came inside the house that way. When I told him the cops were on the way he looked shockingly calm. Tried to go get the seats out of the truck but I was videoing him outside so he pretended to take trash out. The female officer took my statement and was so sweet and understanding. She didn’t tell me what to do but her eyes said it all. She got her phone so I could call the shelter and they got me scheduled for an appointment with the advocacy group on Thursday. I was able to pack my belongings, as much food as possible and get the fuck out of there. I forgot so much stuff. I was so anxious. \n\nHe came back inside because he asked to say goodbye to the kids. He was so dramatic and acting like I was psycho making comments like “why are you staring at me” and “dang that’s a lot of food to take for such a short trip.” I stayed calm and asked him not to shut my phone off again and not shut the cards down in front of the cops he agreed not to. As soon as I packed kids and left he drained our checking, made a new checking account, cancelled all of our cards, turned my phone off and texted me through iMessage saying he loves me and this will be a great reset button. About an hour later he had pot delivered to the house. I am so broken, so sad, I feel so stupid. I love this man so much but I have to divorce him. I cannot let him continue to treat me this way. I want some peace and happiness so badly that it hurts. Someone please comfort me with some resources and tips because I can’t sleep sitting here watching bluey way past when the kids went to bed. I am so sick to my stomach and my entire body is feeling the shock of todays happenings. Thank you so much to this community. I couldn’t have done it without y’all. I wouldn’t even be calling this abuse if I hadn’t made that post and heard from each of you. I want y’all to know i read each and every single comment and took it all to heart. Blessings to each of you women from the bottom of my heart. In 20 min it will be a new day here in Texas and my new life will begin.\n\n>>Relevant comments from OOP\n\nIn response to a comment with steps on how to proceed safely, OOP replied\n\n> This is the best comment that I could’ve read right now. The actionable steps are helping me stay calm. I see a light on the other side of this comment. I will be ok. He is the one who is doing wrong right now.. not me. I took screenshots of our bank accounts emptied and how he made himself a new card and shut off all my cards and resources to money. It’s so sad that he would let our kids have no money and punish me rather than be a normal person and want me to have resources. I’m realizing he only wanted me to have these things if I was with him.\n\n**Mini-update from OOP in comments**\n\nCan everyone please help me? My husband just sent me this text and I am utterly confused at this point. He is such a smooth talker. I have absolutely no idea how he knows about the neighbors helping me. :/ “I saw that you brought by your mother and the neighbors yesterday afternoon… sorry that the house was a mess as I left early around 7:30 for work and really wasn’t in a mindset to pick up after everything the day before. I’m genuinely happy to see that this has brought you closer with your parents, it’s a silver lining out of this whole situation.\n\nIt is disappointing though to see you escalate this whole situation well beyond what is truly necessary with the cops and all of this drama when Marriage Counseling, Church and short term separation are logical progressions that we could’ve pursued. We always said that the best marriages handle their problems with eachother directly - so I really don’t understand why you have the desire to continually “air out dirty laundry” with the whole neighborhood/family when I only speak highly of you to others… some of the twisted truths that I’ve heard you tell people are just flat out lies, dark fabrications or embellished stories to portray the victim when we could all just be honest, forth coming in order to grow from the situation! There is so much potential in our relationship if we just joined together to grow emotionally, mentally and spiritually - but it seems like our growth has stalled by us not seeing eye to eye and carrying hurt from words that have been said in the past in difficult, trying moments. For that I really am sorry. I know that while I have never gotten even remotely physical and hardly raise my voice or call names - arguing or just having a conversation with me can be incredibly exhausting and tiresome. I love how you are emotionally the heart of the home - I really feel that you are my own pulse! But know that when you are frantically anxious, juggling the world on our plates feeling like it’s all going to collapse - I am here in the same boat as your copilot, I feel the same way and really just want to cling to you while trying to be the rock for this family (trying to keep the boat from sinking). As we both continue our paths to TRUE sobriety, I really feel like we will become more in tune with eachother, the kids and God. Daily I feel more present and in tune with my own needs and the needs of our family!\n\nWith no possibility of erasing the past, I am going to give you and the kids space and time while still providing in any way I can and working on myself…\n\nI will maintain a clean house and pour myself into projects to make a real suitable home for our family, leaving an open door and always leaving a light on for any time you want to come and go as long as nothing vindictively gets stolen or goes missing. I will reconnect your phone as long as there are no further attempts to hack into our accounts, and as long as I receive at least a photo of each child every morning and night and at least one FaceTime call with just the children for ten minutes or more every day. I will provide payments, insurance and maintenance on you and the children’s main source of transportation in the Tahoe. I will establish your own separate checking account where I deposit $500 weekly specifically to be used for the children’s needs.\n\nThis is above and beyond the Texas MAXIMUM Child Support Limit of $2750 a month for three kids, but more than the money - I just don’t ever want any of you to suffer or be without.\n\nI know that with this being a new thing and everything still being raw, that seeing eachother might be difficult at first - but please consider letting me see the children at least twice a week on Sunday’s and Wednesdays… I not only want to (and have the right to) maintain the relationship as their father but I really would like for you to start getting a break.\n\nSo disappointing that it seems like right when we were all on the cusp of things being great, I just seem to find a way to fuck things up - but I hope you know how much I want the best for you as I’m just hoping and praying that all of this is temporary…\n\nYou are my best friend, my wife and my life partner - I will always love you!\n\nI will and I am going to be better.”\n\nLike what the actual fuck man. :/\n\n\n>>Other relevant comments from OOP\n\nOOP finds that her husband has been tracking her\n\n>HELP I HAVE TWO APPLE AIR TAGS THAT JUST STARTED BEEPING HOW TO I DISABLE THESE\n\n> * Right now is the first moment I’m having today to calm down and center myself. I’m breastfeeding my last baby. I keep reminding myself that he’s the one who did this- not me. My kids are struggling to adjust. Lots of tears and my autistic son isn’t doing well right now coping without his routine and his space. Thank god for his favorite show SpongeBob and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I made sure to bring his special plate he always eats on. Today I waited for my family to come by and go with me to get a protective order, then a police escort to my house. While waiting for my family- I heard a beeping and realized an air tag was going off in my wallet. He located me. He immediately texted me saying the address where I am. Said he’s coming here if I don’t send pictures of the kids. I didn’t respond. Waves of panic and anxiety entire body trembling crying so scared.. I called the police. They showed up. Nothing he could do. He was looking at me like I was insane and just kept saying “I don’t know what you expect me to do.” He left. Family came and we went to courthouse to file order. They told me i can fill out 1.5 hrs of paperwork for a 2 year restraining order that is very difficult to obtain but encouraged me to take it to my meeting tomorrow with the shelter and they know what to do to help me get my safety in order. Immediately after leaving he texted me “what were you doing at the courthouse.” I called the shelter and they helped me disable any location services on my phone. I debated for hours if I should go get my stuff. I knew it was my last chance. He gets off at 7. At 2pm I showed up to my house- knocked on every door and told all my neighbors to please call the police if he pulls up. Two neighbors helped me grab every single stitch of my kids clothing, remove the magazine from the gun and get all my documents, clothes, food, toiletries and my VERY personal journals with my thoughts and feelings from the past years. I’m so numb. I’m so drained. But as I took the last load of dirty clothes in a hamper to my car and shut the door, I started laughing. I felt more proud of myself than anything I had ever done. I am safe- I won’t go back. I’m filing for divorce tomorrow.\n\n> * He must be a psychopath because I don’t know how what he did is legal whatsoever. I didn’t file a protective order and I’m regretting it because he can become so unhinged so quickly.\n\n> *  I am really tough and have been through so much adversity in my life but I feel like this is absolutely crushing. Nothing has ever hurt like this. Thank God I come from a long line of really strong freaking women and had the power to just say “enough is enough” and go get the life I deserve. I’m leaving behind everything I’ve known- trapped inside 4 walls. I’m so attached to my house because it’s been my prison. But I’ll find roots somewhere new again soon.\n\nAfter speaking with the DV shelter, OOP adds\n\n> * I spent 2 hrs giving my account of his abuse. They said in 3-5 business days I’ll get an advocate to help me get my life put back together, find a lawyer, file for divorce with full custody. They also gave me tons of pull ups and toiletries. I am so thankful. It’s so weird not paying for the stuff I felt really guilty because I used to have lots of money. I shouldn’t be here. He shouldn’t have done this to us.\n\n> * I do have enough food because I am staying with my brother. I have 1/4 a tank of fuel and now I’m down to $170 left. I am so hopeful for the future right now. My brothers girlfriend put me on their phone plan but I’m not giving him this new number because there’s gonna be a protective order\n\n> * Thank you! Luckily I have a HUGE support system about 20 people deep. My neighbors bought diapers, my best friend got me a bra and she’s bringing groceries. I’m utilizing the services of the shelter too. I have my kids, shelter, clothes, food and peace. He only THOUGHT I didn’t have anyone. He said I would be fucked, poor and alone if I left him. I’m feeling happier and lighter than I have in a very very long time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2nd Update Post** - [**My husband put an air tag in my vehicle.

The kids are safe. My resources and support are here helping in anyway they can. Today CPS showed up to my place of shelter. They said my husband told them where I was when they could not contact me because he shut my phone off. They told me he put an air tag on my vehicle. I just did an entire interview with them. I was so scared when the process started - but after they left I felt so supported. They validated that everything he is doing is abuse- he is in the wrong. They told me DO NOT GIVE HIM THE CHILDREN. They said do not answer the door, do not go anywhere until your car has the air tag removed. My brothers girlfriend is taking it right now to the police station. I still haven’t got a protective order. I don’t know what the hold up is but I am so so scared. I listened to the recording of the Sunday fight again (it was so traumatizing all over again to relive that) in the recording when I said I want a divorce he said he is going to end my life. I’m picking up my new phone today with an entire new number. I am really scared everyone. He knows where I am, he knows now that I told CPS he is abusive. The principal of my child’s school is my husbands bosses wife. CPS said the domestic abuse advocates will have to use their attorneys to get my son in a new school right now. Everyone pray, send good vibes, cast a spell, whatever it is that you do… please do it for me right now. I am terrified and I don’t know how much more I can do than I have done. Let this be a lesson to all of the people with abusive partners- turn the “find my iPhone” off BEFORE you leave. Stash money back. Call the shelter. Make a plan. They will try to destroy you and any kids you have together when their image is threatened.\n\n>>Relevant comments from OOP:\n\n> * We just found the air tag. It has his initials on it. We took a photo of where we found it. Crazy. I am in shock honestly.\n\n> * The person who took my car to the police station used an app to alert her. It did not alert her until she was back home. We found it, she pulled up the application and it showed a map of everywhere she went in my vehicle. One of those places was the police station - she took a screenshot of the map showing the locations being tracked. I hope this is enough evidence for court.\n\n> * He has no idea at all [about my Reddit username] and has no access to my email this is linked to. If he did- I think of this as just another way of documenting what’s happening on top of screenshots and written records.\n\n> * The second I got to my shelter I changed all passwords for socials like Snapchat and Reddit. (I deactivated my Facebook and instagram last year) I changed my email address password to a completely new one, made a new iCloud account, took the family iCloud off of my iPhone. When I got a new phone I made a new iCloud again that isn’t linked to him whatsoever. I’m hoping I covered all my bases. I’ve ran safety check like 10 times and I’m still paranoid he’s somehow able to know where I am. I hope all of this tracking and stalking stops soon. It’s sad to be cooped up in the house with the kids instead of going to the park and playing outside.\n\n> * But yes I do need protective order. I have no idea why they won’t get it to me ASAP and I have to keep waiting\n\n> * [My son] won’t go back to school until the protective order is in place. They are using attorneys to quickly help switching him schools\n\n> * I totally understand your question and I don’t think you are being insensitive. I’ve dealt with lots of insensitivity for the past 7 years. I think the most extreme is he would rip the kids from me somehow or physically harm me. But at the least he would come get all the car seats out of my car or steal my vehicle because he is on the title. I’m not sure how I can protect myself more than I have. I am really tired of being afraid though and my body needs a rest from the anxieties soon.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**3rd Update Summary** - **March 19, 2023**\n\nOOP states that she is exhausted, but relieved to have left and that she is getting help from family and the DV shelter.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**4th Update Summary** - **March 21, 2023** \n\nOOP was concerned that her husband's wealth would leave her helpless in the divorce and was feeling homesick. She also states she has a recording of **her husband threatening to kill her if she called the police or tried to divorce him.**\n\n>>Relevant comments from OOP:\n\n> * I’m just scared I won’t find somewhere I can afford and I will displace the kids beyond repair. I keep feeling so guilty for leaving!! It’s so dumb to feel this way\n\n> * I have been out for 6 days. All the adrenaline has worn off and I’m just.. like really empty feeling besides my kids spot in my heart. He took up so much room.\n\n> * He didn’t threaten to kill himself he threatened to “end your life” as in my life.\n\n> * I talked to the detective today and I’m hopeful. He admitted to bugging my car and I have the recording of him threatening to end my life so hopefully it’s enough. For now I just feel scared and helpless to even file the divorce.\n\n> * That hits home so hard. I did come from an abusive home where I was a caretaker of my brothers and sometimes my parents. I think that I learned how to survive then and I’ve been surviving since. I hope to give my kids a better life\n\n> * And I am trying to be so kind to myself and figure out how to care for myself because I definitely didn’t have time or energy to care for me while taking care of him.\n\nWhen someone asked how things are going otherwise, OOP replied\n\n> It went well. I have access to a ton of resources like therapy for myself and my kids, communications between CPS, my advocate and the police being streamlined so I don’t have to handle it all myself, food, clothes, shelter all that. Next week I meet to find a low cost or free attorney who can help me save my future. I also talked to the detectives today about assault and criminal stalking. I’m praying tomorrow the judge will approve the warrant and he will go to jail and I’ll get the protective order so my kids can be back in their own home and back to a routine. Can’t even take my oldest to school until this order is in place. It’s sad because he’s stopped making my Tahoe payments, going out and spending all his money on weird stuff that’s $500-$1,000. I believe he’s gonna hire the best attorney he can and try to say I’m mentally unstable. Which I’ve never been diagnosed with anything, never on medications nor had an “episode” of any sort.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**5th Update Post** - [**I’m here to update everyone who helped me last week!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/120rmbe/im_here_to_update_everyone_who_helped_me_last_week/) - **March 24, 2023**\n\nY’all. What a crazy week. There were many moments I wanted to give up, throw in the towel and go back to life with my husband. I decided to stay strong, celebrate the small wins I made for my kids and I and ultimately hand every bit of evidence over to the police, CPS and detectives. My husband was arrested yesterday for stalking. The kids and I have a 61 day protective order. My husband has to wear a GPS monitor. He was arrested AT WORK in front of everyone!! Of course he’s telling everyone I’m crazy… doesn’t even matter to me right now. I’m back home! (SUPER YAY!) My son got to go back to school, my little two are so much happier and I have a pantry/fridge full of food, plenty of diapers and more clothes than I had before because I ASKED FOR HELP. I didn’t “play the victim” like he said I am. I just told the truth, took care of myself and the kids and celebrated the small moments of happiness. My husband is telling police I’m bipolar, I physically abused him, I was stalking HIM (lol), I set up booby traps and planned this and that I only did all this because I was on my period. huge sigh This has been so insane and I keep telling myself “he did this, not me. He gave me no choice.” A quote that’s helped me a ton right now is “Women are not rehabilitation centers for broken men.”\n\nThank you thank you thank you to all of y’all!! Couldn’t have done it without this community!\n\n>>Relevant comments from OOP:\n\n> * I am seeking a 1-2 year protective order with specific requirements for the kids and I and how we communicate. Right now I’m taking a little breather because it’s been a stressful week!\n\n> * Gotta do the most and hope for the best ya know. I have security at the home and I’m watching over my shoulder everywhere I go. I don’t think I’ll ever stop being scared but I have to try and be brave, cautious and calm right now.\n\n> * The police were doing the most they could. I took it to an officer, he made an hours worth of notes documenting all the stalking and threats, he made a report, two detectives took the case and they got a judge to sign off on an arrest warrant for stalking and PO for me and the kids. Any other women going through this- document EVERYTHING, get out, call the police, call the DA’s office. They WANT to arrest these people for breaking the law and they want to keep YOU safe.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**6th Update Post** - [**Hi, it’s been 2 months.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/13kjx20/hi_its_been_2_months/) - **May 18, 2023**\n\nI’m not sure if many of y’all remember me. I was in an abusive marriage (technically still married) to a man and have 3 small children. This sub helped me to 1) identify I was being abused and in a toxic relationship. 2) figure out how to get out safely and securely\n3) navigate the legal system for my safety.\n\nBecause this group helped me so much I wanted to give a small update and say that the EPO was issued 61 days. Before that expired I was assisted with a 2 year protective order from the DA’s office and he signed the order this week. The judge granted a restraining order for the kids and I until we can go through divorce and custody court. He has still not given me one cent, he is apparently in AA, going to battering prevention courses, going to church and “wants his family back.” Despite all of these things he “is doing.” I don’t care. I’m done with the relationship. I have never been more calm and less “crazy” as he loved to call me. My kids are ok and don’t seem really to have even noticed. This is really only super hard right now because I have no money and my parents have had to provide all my groceries and gas.\n\nI worked with the women’s shelter and I’ve had so much help it’s really mind blowing. They assisted me in retaining an attorney, food stamps, food bank, diapers and wipes, therapy, childcare, crime victims compensation, police, getting in contact with the DA and many more things.\n\nFor anybody who needs help getting out of an abusive relationship, don’t be afraid to call the hotline, let someone know or research (safely) what you can do to get out and be secure after leaving. I have my first court date where I will see him in less than 48 hrs so I just wanted to update and remember how I have a whole army of strong women who helped me get here that believe in me! Thank you again to everyone. I will always be so grateful that I got out at the very first point of wondering “is this a normal relationship?”\n\n>>Relevant comment from OOP:\n\n> When I reconnected with my parents my mom had 6 months of therapy under her belt and they both have been sober for about 9 months now! I called my dad on the day we went in to shelter and my mom and grandmother came the very next day to help me with whatever I needed. I spend every weekend at my parent’s house and our relationship has never been better! It’s crazy how when you’re in a toxic relationship you sometimes think everyone else is the problem and can’t change just because your partner refuses to change and is the main problem in your life! I had lots of apologies and owning up to isolating myself from family that I had to do. I’m so much better with a support system of about 20 family members and 10 close friends than I was with one small, angry and abusive man as my “everything.”\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>>Editor's note: Ever since her escape, OOP has been encouraging other women to seek help.\n\n### **Reminder - I am not the original poster.

If you don’t believe what I am going through- I would really appreciate if you just keep that to yourself. I am going through an extremely hard time right now. My husband got a continuance for the court date and my kids have a horrible stomach virus right now and I’m just pretty stressed out and tired of this battle right now. I have just over a week more until the moved court date and 7 more days until I get food stamps. I’m hanging on for dear life here. I said y’all because I’m southern. I had access to our email to see what he purchased until he changed the password 48 hrs after separation and I could no longer see what he was up to. I could receive iMessage and texts with Wi-Fi. The reason he knew where I was is because he had my car bugged with an air tag so I would come back to my place of shelter and have a message from him waiting for me on the iPhone through Wi-Fi. I’ve been through so much and the system moved quickly for me because I was SO proactive and determined to not become a statistic. I utilized every single resource that came my way and have worked tirelessly day in and day out to make a better life for myself and my children. If you have your doubts about whether this is real- I ask you to please not say this is made up or fake. There may be another woman with small children out there who needs to read this story and find her own fire inside of her. Thank you for all the sweet comments and uplifting stories.

        "body": "I’m so glad for OOP that she got out and I hope she is able to cut the ties and thrive.\n\nI just want to add, as a retired police officer, when you call the police in situations like this, it’s great if you have evidence and documentation. I always found that super helpful.\n\nTwo suggestions: I freely admit a lot of cops SUCK. Taking a DV report can be complicated and it’s extra work to document everything correctly. Some cops are abusive themselves and/or bitter about their own divorces and will have a bias. Some get jaded because they put in all the work on these cases and a month later get called out to the same house and same situation. Even with training, a lot don’t get the whole cycle of abuse and issues of addiction. \n\nIf you get an officer who isn’t taking your call seriously, ask for a supervisor. And if they blow you off too, ask for the watch commander. It’s important to get a decent report done because that’s your route to the person who is really supposed to be on your team, the detective. \n\nDetectives can also be lazy. But in my experience a lot of the ones doing family violence get jaded because of the whole cycle thing. Unlike some of the street cops, a victim who is highly motivated, collecting evidence, and doing all the things they tell them to is a breath of fresh air and very energizing. If you don’t get a detective who is responding positively to you like that, again, talk to a supervisor. If your case goes to the DAs office find out if there is a victim advocate and stay in touch with that person. If you are having trouble with the detective or followup or just negative attitude from the PD, bring it up with the VA because they can pass it along. The district attorney and victim advocate offices get to know the officers and esp detectives and know which ones suck. And sometimes they can reach out to the supervisor or the chief and get your case reassigned. \n\nInclude in your documentation every police contact you have, who it is with, their contact info, times and dates, what you said and what they said. If it’s a one party state voice record it so you have a record for your notes later.\n\nGet copies of your incident reports and check them over. Make sure the info is accurate, both the data (if they put a phone number in wrong the detective isn’t gonna be able to contact you) and what they wrote in the narrative. If the narrative doesn’t include everything you told them, ask to meet with an officer and tell them you have additional info for the report you made and ask them to do a supplement. Do the same if you find out any additional information between when you make the report and when you hear from the detective to follow up. \n\nEven if the original officer doesn’t detail the evidence and documentation you collected, make sure the report at least says that you have documentation, recordings etc. The detectives get a stack of cases assigned to them each day and kind of triage and prioritize the ones that look the most workable. When a report says there is evidence and documentation, it’s a message to the detectives that there is meat to this case. \n\nFinally, here is a friend on TikTok who escaped with her son from a very abusive relationship and had a long battle for custody and protective orders. Someone asked about the binder she used to document everything during the process and she did a quick video showing what she collected and how she organized it, which might be helpful:\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTREtF4ve/",

The claim is that they will cleanse the womb and remove toxins. The “successful result” pictures are essentially bloody and discharged covered pearls that the company will use to say the woman has “detoxed.” In reality, it’s a foreign object that is probably comparable to a tampon in terms of be absorbent thus dangerous if inserted for too long. I’m honestly surprised that in 2018 people still believe this works. \n\nIt’s kinda like how Summers Eve products are still massively produced and consumed. It’s because women think they smell. Most gynecologists recommend water and perhaps, light soap to clean the external parts of the vagina. Internally, it’s self cleaning and will regulate itself. The smell depends on diet, exercise, yeast or bacteria overgrowth and a plethora of other things. Scented tampons exist which I’d imagine is A) painful to use and B) is useless once blood touches it. Why does a vagina has to smell like roses? Who decides this shit? \n\nHave you ever heard of the company GOOP? It’s actress Gwyneth Paltrow’s women’s “health” company that has a lifestyle kinda Cosmopolitan vibe but also sells a variety of weird vagina centered things. For example, she sells a jade egg vaginal suppository that is potential porous. It may hold bacteria and cause an issue for the wearer. GOOP also advertised a caffeine enema so..to say the least the website is devoid of any true women’s health intellect and is potentially dangerous. Again, why is this okay and why isn’t it questioned? Is it a lack of sex Ed or just society telling women they “stink down there”?",

The \"Because I'm worth it\" campaign catapulted L'Oreal above Clairol.  https://jezebel.com/5859579/do-we-still-need-a-makeup-company-to-tell-us-were-worth-it .  So this means that marketing women's products to women is a guaranteed way to make money.

Nobody's made laws that things like this that you're told to put in your vagina need to be safe.  So anything you make that can fit in this silo is quick to market, easy to slip past regulators and laws, and won't require any followup. \n\n* There's no need for salaries for people doing the R&D, or Testing, or Paperwork, or the FDA fees or anything else.  All you have to pay for is manufacturing, advertising, and shipping.  This means massive, massive, massive profit margins: Profit goes from 8% of gross income... to 60%. \n\n* Sure it's not safe, and sure it's mocked, but if you sell even fifty or a thousand of these little bastards then you clear your investment and everything else is profit.",

Say you're driving through a small, simple town with one street light at that town's rush hour: all the traffic will come up, pause, then go with a regular rhythm.  That would be a high degree of order (the opposite of entropy).  Not much communication or flexibility needed, and its the mental equivalent of a deep sleep.  If you compare that to downtown tokyo, there are people everywhere, going in all directions on foot and in cars and bikes, etc.  That's a lot of information flowing in many directions, and if we turn them in to brain cells they are busy, active, and adaptable.  Chaotic systems have more energy and more going on than simple systems, and we measure this in terms of entropy (which is honestly a misnomer, it's all meaningful, but the math for entropy works as a best model).  \n\n  \nAll of this is fueled by blood flow to get oxygen to the cells, but it's not a 1:1 correlation.  Having said that, the main measure they used is a measurement of where water/blood goes in the brain (fMRI).  The study said that since caffine restricts blood flow, it should slow the brain down, but the chemical makes the cells all over the brain fire more easily, so lower blood flow but higher levels of cross-talk and entropy.  \n  \nSo is it good or bad?  Yes.  It's good for the short term, making thinking more efficient and clear, but it's not good for the long term because you're making the cells work harder with less fuel.  \n  \nThat also explain why withdrawal from caffine causes headaches, btw.  Withdrawal from a chemical causes the opposite of the chemical's effect, so when you don't drink coffee after getting addicted, the blood flow in the head increases, causing higher pressure, which leads to pain.",

The first bit of the discussion is the clearest explanation:\n\n> Complexity of temporal activity provides a unique window to study human brain, which is the most complex organism known to us. Temporal complexity indicates the capacity of brain for information processing and action exertions, and has been widely assessed with entropy though these two measures don’t always align with each other - complexity doesn’t increase monotonically with entropy but rather decreases with entropy after the system reaches the maximal point of irregularity.\n\nIn a previous section, they also describe:\n\n> The overall picture of a complex regime for neuronal dynamics–that lies somewhere between a low entropy coherent regime (such as coma or slow wave sleep) and a high entropy chaotic regime\n\nMy interpretation: optimal brain function requires *complexity* which lies somewhere between a low entropy ordered state and a high entropy chaotic state. I'm not sure what the best analogy for this is, but it seems to make sense - if the brain is too 'ordered' then it can't do many different things at the same time, but at the other extreme a highly chaotic state just becomes white noise and it can't make meaningful patterns.\n\nThe authors of this paper suggest that by increasing BEN, caffeine increases complexity - i.e. before the caffeine the brain is below the optimal level of entropy. This would therefore be associated with an increase in function - although the authors didn't test this here. \n\nIt's possible that diseases such as alzheimers increase entropy even further and go past the optimal peak and decend into chaos - although I'm not familiar with that topic at all.",

It's like checking if your car is in good shape by assessing wheel pressure, gas level, oil level etc. Putting together these different kinds of information for your car is simple (I have a full tank, pressure ok, oil in range, I'm good to go for another long trip), but at the biological level you can't just add up everything (I can't say, well GABAergic interneurons are firing regularly in the gyrus dentatus of the hyppocapus and the EEG looks normal, so the patient is ok), so you first need to estimate \"complexity\". What's that? Intuitively, some signals will vary a lot during your observation (EEG recorded from a patient with dementia), some others not (action potentials are an all-or none phenomenon, and some cells have a very regular firing pattern). Fundamentally you might see some patterns that repeat themselves, accompanied by some absolute randomness. Back to your car, you know that filling up the tank will give you more journey time, but you can't predict when you'll get a flat tire (this analogy is a bit off topic, but is just to get the idea). \n\nSo, what about \"entropy\"? Entropy gives you an idea of the complexity of your system. Entropy measures the *uncertainty* of an event at a given time *t*: the lower the entropy, the more you are sure of what will come next. In a brain with high entropy you cannot predict what will come next (signal flow from one part of the brain does not result in a desired outcome in another part, again, rough example), in a brain with a too low entropy you have a fixed outcome for any action, and you don't want that also, because you cannot have remodeling necessary for, among others, learning. So the brain must lie in an intermediate state of entropy (Note that you cannot measure entropy *per se*, but only relative to another state), in that it must be capable of performing its function with a desired outcome. Finally, if caffeine causes an increase in brain entropy, now it should be clear that this means more \"disorder\" between brain signals (rawness alert), which translates into more capacity to adapt in response to inputs, more \"flexibility\" as a whole. in Alzheimer's disease this is taken to another level: structural destruction leads to too much chaos, and unpredictability on what will be the downstream effects.",

This might seem like a very different context. Maybe it is. Entropy is just a very broadly applicable idea. I think you'll be able to see how the ideas transfer to the context of cognition.\n\nThe entropy of a piece of information, is roughly the minimum possible size of a program that could generate that information. In other words, the entropy of a piece of information is the size of a complete description of it.\n\nFor example. The following two sequences have very different entropy, despite being the same length:\n\n000010000100001000010000100001000010000100001000010000100001\n\n011101010001011000010110010111110001010111111101010110001111\n\nThe first could be generated by a program like `loop 12 times { emit('00001') }`, a program that just says '00001' 12 times.\n\nThe second, as far as I can tell, can only be described with `emit('011101010001011000010110010111110001010111111101010110001111')`. It has the longer minimum generating-program, so it has higher entropy.\n\nIt's possible that a general purpose compression algorithm, or a hyperintelligent being, might be able to find a shorter description of the second sequence than we could, but there are always going to be sequences that even God could not compress.\n\nIt might now be intuitive to you, why low-entropy in thought might be a bad sign. A person who just thought '00001' over and over would be, what might be well described as a smooth-brain, no more sophisticated than a program that says the same thing again and again.\n\nHigh entropy, too, is clearly not always a good thing.

We hypothesize that intelligence will be positively associated with entropy in a sample of 892 healthy adults, using resting-state fMRI. Intelligence is measured with the Shipley Vocabulary and WASI Matrix Reasoning tests. Brain entropy was positively associated with intelligence. This relation was most strongly observed in the prefrontal cortex, inferior temporal lobes, and cerebellum. This relationship between high brain entropy and high intelligence indicates an essential role for entropy in brain functioning. It demonstrates that access to variable neural states predicts complex behavioral performance, and specifically shows that entropy derived from neuroimaging signals at rest carries information about intellectual capacity. \"",

There could very well be something wrong - or you could have a deficiency in your diet. Might be as simple as eating a little differently.\n\n2. If caffeine doesn't keep you awake, you could very well have ADHD. I do, and coffee physically mellows me out. Puts me to sleep if I have enough of it. The only benefit for me is that it provides a little bit of focus when my brain starts getting frazzled.\n\nAnother thing - I've been constantly drowsy since I stopped working out at the beginning of the pandemic. I only put it together when I started again a couple of weeks ago, but it seems that regular exercise actually boosts your energy and keeps you more alert. When I start to lose focus, a quick jog or a few sets of pushups gets me right back in gear. Might be an ADHD thing, might be a Human Being thing, not sure.",

    "body": "Edit 5: this is already in r/antiwork but I appreciate the recommendation\n\nStrap in it's a ride 🤣 worth the read imo  (tl;Dr at the bottom)\n\nI worked for a trucking company, they made sucrose for different food plants in the area, Turkey Hill, Pepsi etc. My job was to wash the inside of the liquid sucrose trailers so they could be reloaded, this was done by hooking them up to an automated wash system. I drove the lot, picked up an empty trailer, took it to the 2 trailer wash bay building, hooked it up and ran the cycle, then parked the washed trailer in the loading staged area. I was hired as a temp to replace the previous 1st shift guy who injured his knee, when I was hired him and a guy who kinda knew the job taught me how to do it, but there was the only one official 1st shift person who knew the job, the other guy just could kinda fumble his way through it. Then there was a second shift guy who knew the job as well.The job required you to be extremely active, you worked in a room that would sometimes seem like it rained from all the steam condensing on the ceiling because you were washing 2 at a time with 190+ degree water for a 20 minute session. I ended up being hired full time from the temp agency (the company actually bought out my contract because I was doing so well and the 1st shift guy ended up retiring due to his injury)\n\n\nAbout a year later the second shift guy quits out of nowhere, so they hire a new guy, and now I have to train him. This guy is, less than good at the job I keep telling management that but you know, they're management. Eventually he ends up dropping a trailer off the lift truck before putting the lift down, bending the landing gear and doing $11,000 in damage. Anytime there's an accident, they require a drug test, he tested positive for cocaine and was fired. I ended up having to do 1st and 2nd shift by myself since I was the only person who knew the job. It wasnt that bad because 2nd shift didn't have as many trailers, so a 10 hour day and I'd usually be done.  Eventually they hired a new guy, very very big fellow and this... didn't seem like a fit for him. About 3 months in the loaders come over cuz there's no clean trailers staged, they found him passed out on top of a trailer. They honestly thought he had a heart attack or something, but it turned out he was just drunk, so he got fired. Guess who's back to working both shifts?\n\n\nAt first it wasn't too bad, I could get 4 trailers done in an hour, so 32 in an 8 hour shift if I'm busting ass. There was literally no way to do it any faster since there's a 20 minute wash cycle and you still have to pull 2 trailers in, and hook them up. Normally there were about 25 trailers for 1st shift and 8 to 10 for 2nd shift. But then a company that took 5+ dry trailers a shift for 1st and 3 to 5 a shift for 2nd, tripled their order for wet trailers due to these onsite processing plant going down.  I went from 10 hour days to working from 6am to 11pm for like a month straight, in the summer, in a building that got about 10+ degrees hotter than the ambient air was... I kept telling my supervisor, my plant manager and the company manager that I couldn't keep this up, I kept being told I had to do my job, \"do as you're told.\" Well time I worked from 6am to 1am Thursday and back in at 530am Friday... That was the day I caused $5000 in damages. I backed a trailer out without unhooking it first, ruining the hoses, and pulling a pump off the mounts. So now I had to get drug tested and since the last two guys failed, on the drive there my manager asked me if I was going to fail. I said it depends *what* they test for. He said they test for everything, I asked if that included caffeine and exhaustion. He just kinda blankly looked at me then turned back to the road. \n\n\nDrug test passed, taken back to work, now I only have 1 wash bay to use due to the damage I caused, and I have to back into it because it's the first bay that's broken in a pull through set up and maintenance is there repairing it... I ended up being there till almost 1 again. Monday I come in, having almost fell asleep on the drive, I pulled my manager aside, the plant manager aside, and the owners son aside... They all said, just gotta do \"do the job I was hired to do, do what I'm told.\" They said they're working to find a new person so I just need to keep doing \"*my* trailers.\"  So Tuesday, that's what I did. When I was hired I was told my schedule was 7am to 3pm and they trailers in that timeslots we're mine, along with the first two 2nd shift trailers *if they were there by 2:30pm.\" So I got there at 7, did only the 1st shift trailers and 2 second shift trailers as I \"*was told*\" when I got hired, and clocked out at 3pm. I shut my phone off and took my girlfriend to the fair. \n\n\nThe next morning I went in at 7 once again, and got to work. The supervisor and plant manager get in at 9, and 9:05 they're in my office. I get escorted to the office of the owner's son where he proceeded to chew me out for a solid 45 minutes. I just sat there and let him rant. Turns out once I left my supervisor and plant manager had to do my job, and you know since they were supervisors and plant managers obviously they were trained in the position and knew exactly what to do! /s They managed to do 4 trailers from 5pm when they realized I left, until midnight... This is the same amount I could do in 1 hour 🤣\n\n\nSo once his rant was over I said, \"well, clearly you're not going to fire me.\" He was taken aback. I continued, \"you have no one who can do my job, you didn't take me seriously when I said I couldn't do it alone anymore and so I decided I'd show you how important I was. I've got a kid, and a life outside this job, the pay is great but I'm not going to kill myself to get it and put in 90-110 hour weeks in the dead of summer. You said 7am to 3pm when I got hired, that was \"*what I was told*\" so that's what I did. Here's what's going to happen, you're going to give me a raise and 3 weeks paid vacation, you're going to let me pick the guy who takes 2nd shift, if you can't find someone willing to take 2nd I will train them on first and transfer to 2nd when they're fully trained, but I'll get the shift differential on top of my raise if I do that.\"\n\n\nHe looked at me like I just robbed him, but then after a solid 5 silent minutes, he agreed. See each trailer that didn't get washed the night before, was assessed a late fee by the company who it went to, anywhere from $500 to $5000 and just last night I had cost them $21,000 in fees. I think he realized that would quickly be a problem if they had no one to wash any trailers 🤷‍♂️\n\n\nWe ended up pulling over the guy who kinda knew how to do the job from first shift that helped train me when I started there, he took first shift and I went to second. I ended up being the highest paid employee the wet department (and any department that wasn't management or QC actually) in only 2 years of being there, when there were guys who had been loaders for 15+ years. I stayed another year or so but eventually it was more nonsense and I had my fill.\n\nEdit: fixed some spelling and grammatical errors. There's likely more but got what I saw lol\n\nEdit 2: was told I need a tl;Dr\n\nTl;Dr  Company somehow thought only having 1 person per shift trained to properly do a labor intensive job in a closed, humid building pumping 190° water through liquid truck trailers. They then hired not one but 2 different substance abusing poor physical fits for the second shift position. After the second hire was fired for passing out drunk on top of a trailer, I was again forced to work both first and second shift. One of the companies we delivered to tripled their order and the job worked me to the absolute bone with 90-110 hour weeks during hot summer months. Multiple complaints did nothing but tell me to \"do as I'm told.\" When I was hired I was *told* 7am to 3pm was my shift and my job was to do all the trailers for my shift plus 2 for second shift.  Since complaints fell on deaf ears, I decided to *do as I was told* clocked out at 3pm after finishing first shift trailers plus two. Shut my phone off and had a good time at the fair that night. Next day I'm taken into the office, yelled at for 45 minutes and told they only got 4 trailers done after I left (an amount I could do in 1 hour.)\n\nTold them that sucked and since they weren't firing me they could give me a raise and paid vacation, or I'd quit. Facing a $500-$5000 fine per late delivery, they agreed to my terms.\n\nEdit 3: was told my Tl;Dr needs a tl;Dr so \n\nTl;dr's tl;Dr: companies suck your soul out via blood sweat and tears if you let them, so don't. And reading is fundamental lmfao\n\nEdit 4: **Thank you everyone! I really didn't expect this to blow up as it did!! I hope anyone who ever finds themselves in a similar situation now is more aware that it may not be as bad as it looks on paper. Whatever rope they give you, use it to hang them with if you can.**",

Figured I'd start here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack in early December (the 7th or 8th) I had a heart attack, which lead to cardiac arrest. I was really overworked and stressed myself out. I was hardly sleeping or eating, and I was pounding tons of energy drinks. I know that was stupid. Working so much was also stupid. I’m young and relatively healthy all things considered. I was sort of alone when it happened, and a co-worker found me sometime after I had passed out.\n\nWhile I was in the hospital, no one came to see me. Friends or family. That really hurt, but I was only in the hospital for 4 or 5 days. A few friends said they would come see me, but never did. One friend even offered to take me to one of my follow up appointments, but blew me off to hang out with her friends. We ended up getting into a huge argument over it and don’t talk anymore. I’ve told most of my friends and family. Excluding my parents (who are biologically required to care) no one really seems to care or be concerned. I hate saying this cause it sounds super dramatic, but I actually could have died. I’ve been dealing with memory issues ever sense, and my doctor says the longer it goes on the more likely it is to be permanent.\n\nI feel like I’m all alone now. I’m angry and upset at everyone, and I don’t know what to do from here? Do I just need to get over it?  I’m still dealing with memory issues which are super scary and I feel like I have no one to talk to.\n\nTL:DR: I had a heart attack that has lead to some possibly life long issues and none of my friends or family cared.\n\nEDIT: I wanna add a little more context around the actual heart attack. Basically, I have a day job (I work IT at my local school district) I was asked/offered to come help my father's company set up a brand new office. I 100% should have said no as it was way to much work on top of my already packed schedule, but I had just broken up with a girl and needed something to focus on (and it was just a super cool opportunity I didn't wanna pass up). Between my day job and this project I had no free time, was getting like 4 hours of sleep if I was lucky, and just drinking tons of caffeine/energy drinks and not eating. 3ish weeks of this was too much for my body to handle. I'm generally not crazy overworked. I just took on a 2nd job/project that I really shouldn't have. Had I not done that, I'm positive I wouldn't be in this situation. The project was meant to last about 2 months, maybe less. ",

It feels like you've been ignored,  left all alone in a serious moment where you could really use some people there having your back.   \n\nI hate waking up in the ER,  transferred to a bed,  calling some friends to ask if they'd come by.   Some do say they will,  no one showed up,  not once,  a few times,  5 or 6 hospitalizations.  But sometimes they do.   What I find is that they don't realize the seriousness of how I feel when I am there.   Visiting a hospital is also stressful. I know I was under a lot of stress,  they should do it no matter how much a pain in the ass it is.   But they didn't.   It wasn't until my buddy was in the hospital after a surgery I realized how easy it is to say,  maybe tomorrow when I have less shit going on,  maybe later tonight after I work.   maybe on friday before I go out with some friends,  shit he's been in their almost 2 weeks,  I need to go now.   It is easy to put it off,  the parking,  the cost of parking,  walking through a hospital with draw similar looking doors,  the sound of people who likely won't make it a few more weeks, some who will go home,  watching the forlorn looks on people passing you after leaving the room of their loved ones.   \n\nReally shouldn't make excuses,  but I can.  I have been on both sides of the this.  A lot.   Don't hold this particular one against your friends too much.

And my mom stayed with me as I was in an 18f in a different state several hundred miles away. I wasn't long for that team, or those friends. They even forgot to give me my get well card until several weeks after I was back, end of the term of I remember correctly. They showed you that they don't care about you, which is perfect because now you get the chance to meet new people who will actually care about your well-being. \n\nI'm sorry that your family is so inconsiderate, I was grateful that my mom was willing to drop everything, take a week off of work and fly to the Midwest to see me. So far, it's the only time my parents have visited me at college, but it was in my time of need so that made up for it (they also warned me that I was going to school too far away for them to visit regularly so I was prepared). Truthfully I have no advice in the family sense, but I do think you learned something very important about them that you should reflect about. How often has your family shown you that they care? If this is a one time thing, maybe talk to them and tell them how their indifference has affected you. If this is a repeat issue, is this the last straw? I'm not on board of cutting family off on a whim, but if they've shown you they don't care, why should you care about them?",

I will say that none of the flaky ex friends have been able to hold down jobs or achieve other markers of a stable adult life, while my current friends are definitely more well rounded and responsible people in general.

People who exercise regularly have lower cholesterol and resting blood pressure, which have been proven to improve mortality and morbidity rates. Many hypotheses exist why this is the case, and I can list many myself that may all make sense, but the point here is this is all *backed up by research*. Doctors do not make random and wild recommendations as suggested by whoever MD replied to OP. It's all evidence based medicine. That's literally the second thing we're taught, the first being \"do no harm\". \n\nSource: (almost) MD",

    "body": "I'm getting ready to wrap up my 5-year PhD in STEM, and I'm moving on to bigger and better things in the world of medical research. Something you need to know about STEM folks is that we tend to be caffeine addicts. Coffee, tea, energy drinks, the works. However, for about the first 3 years of my program, I was the only coffee drinker on my team. Everyone else drank tea or soda. I'm a coffee addict, so I own 2-3 coffee makers at any given time (I keep crappy ones from thrift shops on standby in case my nice one gives out). I brought one said crappy coffee maker to my work so I'd have access to fresh coffee. For 3 years, I was the only one to use it.\n\nIn year 4, enter a new postdoctoral associate. Let's call her Anne.\n\nAnne is...a nice person. Friendly. The kind of person you'd take your lunch breaks with or chat with at a company outing. But she's difficult to work with. I don't know if it's because she has her PhD and I don't yet, or if it's because she's 10 years older than me, but her superiority complex got to me quickly. She's always right, and my input is irrelevant (even though I'm more experienced in our field). She sees the good in everyone, which is great except that she never believes me or any of our colleagues when we say another employee has been rude or negligent in their work. And she's very distracting, always wanting to make small talk and refusing to listen when I say I'm too busy to chat. She will literally insert herself into my personal space, hovering around my desk until I agree to chat with her about usually total nonsense (for example, one time she wanted to have a whole conversation about dishwashers...). It's gotten bad enough that I've primarily moved to a remote/hybrid work setting just to get things done.\n\nAnne is also a coffee addict. For the first time in over 4 years, my crappy little coffee maker had a second user. And I was happy to share the machine. Now, she uses it every day, sometimes more than once per day. She's admitted that she's stopped making coffee at her home because she knows she can make it at work. I am her source of caffeine.\n\nExcept now I'm graduating. I'm leaving for good. Thus begs the question: would I be the asshole if I took my coffee maker with me? On one hand, I'm a nice person, and I know Anne will get lots of use out of the machine. I also own a nice coffee maker don't technically NEED the crappy little machine, and won't need to bring my own coffee maker to my new job becausse they provide free coffee to employees. On the other hand, Anne hasn't exactly been a great coworker. She's made it hard for me to feel productive and intelligent in my position, and I'm petty. So, would I be the asshole?\n\nEDIT: I've decided to leave it. Being petty is swell and all but people are right that I don't need this machine and you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. \nAdditionally, I find it funny how many people assume I'm a sexist man, when in fact I'm just an irritated woman. 😅",

    "body": "Look, I get it. Your bed is comfy, mornings are evil, and anyone who says they're a \"morning person\" is either lying or psychotic. But here's the thing - your 4AM gaming sessions and Reddit doom-scrolling aren't doing you any favors. And no, being a \"night owl\" isn't a personality trait, it's just what happens when you've convinced your body that 2AM is actually dinner time.\n\nWant to know how I know this shit works? The Navy taught me - by force. See, when you get to boot camp, the first thing they do is keep you up for over 24 hours. They feed you some bullshit about \"Just grab your gear, stencil it, go through these basic instructions, and then you can go to bed!\" But by the time they walk you through getting your clothes and marching you to your first berthing, it's already morning and they're dragging your sleep-deprived ass to breakfast.\n\nHere's the genius part - they keep you up for about 36 hours for two reasons:\n\n1. To put you in a room where Master Chiefs can yell at you about whether your recruiter told you to lie about smoking weed\n2. To completely reset your fucked up sleep cycle\n\nThat second part? That's what we're going to do. Well, minus the screaming Master Chiefs.\n\n**The Science Behind Your Shitty Sleep:** Here's something they didn't teach you in high school: The way your body wakes up is your brain sends a signal to your hypothalamus to raise your body temperature. Heat means wakey-wakey time. This isn't some wellness influencer bullshit - it's actual biology.\n\n**Step 1: The Morning Reset** First thing you need to do? Go outside for 15 minutes. Yes, OUTSIDE. I don't care if it's raining. I don't care if you're tired. I don't care if you look like a shambling corpse. Get your ass outside before you do anything else - before coffee, before phone, before whatever the hell else you think you need to do.\n\nWhy? Because sunlight tells your body \"oh shit, it really is time to wake up!\" More importantly, it starts a **16-hour timer**. Once that timer starts, your body will naturally want to crash when it's actually bedtime, instead of at 4AM when you're halfway through your tenth YouTube video about why dolphins are actually aliens. (Which, by the way spoiler alert: they are.)\n\n**The Actual Steps:**\n\n1. Wake up at the same time **EVERY day** (yes, even weekends, you degenerate)\n2. Go outside for 15 minutes **IMMEDIATELY**\n3. No screens for the first hour (your TikTok feed can wait)\n4. No caffeine until **AFTER** your morning sunlight\n5. Keep your room cool at night but **LET IT WARM UP** in the morning\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n\n* If you're struggling to wake up, turn off your AC or turn on a heater. Your body will get the message.\n* Walk around the block if you want, but do it in silence. No podcasts, no music. Just you and your thoughts (scary, I know).\n* If you live in a city where morning sounds include some asshat blasting music through their garbage-bag window repair, then yeah, put on headphones.\n\n**The Actual Science (For You Nerds Who Want Proof):** Look, I actually did my homework on this shit. Your eyes have these special cells called ipRGCs (yeah I'm not typing out that full name, fuck that) that basically act like your body's light sensors. When morning sunlight hits these bad boys, they send a signal to your brain's master clock - the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN if you're not trying to sound like a pretentious dickhead.\n\nThis SCN thing? It's like your body's DJ - dropping hormone beats to keep you awake during the day and sleepy at night. Morning light tells it \"Yo, start the party,\" and about 12 to 16 hours later it's like \"Last call, motherfuckers!\" That's when it starts pumping out melatonin - the hormone that makes you sleepy.\n\nThis isn't some bro-science bullshit. There are actual studies showing this works. But I'm not here to make you read scientific papers - I'm here to get your ass out of bed before noon.\n\n**The Reality Check:** This is going to suck for the first week. You're going to hate it. You're going to hate me. You're going to hate whoever showed you this post. But you know what sucks more? Being 35 and still having the sleep schedule of a college freshman during finals week.\n\n**TL;DR:** Get your ass outside first thing in the morning, keep a consistent schedule, and stop pretending your 3AM bedtime makes you special. Your body knows how to sleep - you just need to stop fighting it. Also, dolphins are definitely aliens.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**EDIT: Want to address a couple of things:**\n\n**\"What if I wake up before the sun?\"**\n\nWell first off, please pat yourself on the shoulder cause you're a trooper my friend! Not everyone wakes up at the crack of noon like some of us degenerates. If you're up before the sun, the same rules apply - just fake it 'til you make it. Bright indoor lighting is your next best bet. Hit yourself with as much light as possible (overhead lights, lamps, hell, even your fridge light if you're desperate). The goal is to trick your body into thinking it’s daytime, even if you need to turn your living room into a Vegas strip... Hmm.. Know what? Party lights! Yeah! Party lights!\n\n**\"What if I live in a place like Fargo, or Alaska, or somewhere where even the Sun as Social Anxiety and won't show up?\"**\n\nBro I got you! Get yourself a therapy lamp. 10,000 lux. That means super bright light, like daylight indoors. And **get it in blue! Blue light is easiest on the skin and eyes!** So, what is a therapy lamp? These bad boys mimic natural sunlight and can help keep your body's sleep-wake cycle in check, even if it's pitch black outside. Just park yourself in front of one for 15-30 minutes in the morning - pretend you’re basking on a tropical beach. Go make yourself a Mai Thai. You can't be drunk all day if you don't start in the morning, so 2 birds, one cup!\n\nAnd once the sun *does* come up? Get your ass outside and soak it in like your life depends on it. Because, well... it kind of does.\n\n(Note: I do not endorse alcoholism or morning/day drinking, despite me having a career as a Sailor in the US Navy. Not openly at least.)",

That small win will not only give you confidence throughout the day, but you will notice your day will go a lot smoother, and you'll have a lot more small wins. \n\nFor example, my shift starts at 8AM. I wake up at 5AM (BOOM. You already ate the frog) Then what i do is i get ready for the gym, get to the gym at 6, finish at 7 and at 7:45 I'm on my jobsite with a shit ton of confidence sipping my coffee while other employees come shuffling through with their bed hair and unwashed face showing trying to organize their tools for the day and I'm just chilling cause I already did that.  \n\nOnce you start doing this for a week or two, you feel like a completely different person. You start standing taller, walking and talking differently because you can see just by \"eating the frog\" you are levels ahead of everyone else.

    "body": "Hey, first time poster here. This happened to me a while ago, and I thought you folks would get a kick out of it. \n\nI had reported to work on this particular Monday where I am the Site Supervisor for an armed security account, only to discover that the blasted idjits that work the night shift had not only left me an empty coffee pot (a mortal sin) but had entirely cleaned me out of coffee, leaving me naught but an empty container devoid of my much needed morning caffeine, the inconsiderate so-and-so’s.\n\nGrumbling, I go off to the local market to buy some caffeinated goodness so to keep my heart beating through my busy day. Mind you, I am in uniform, which means black pants, dress shirt with my badge and various security emblems, my duty belt with firearm, baton, handcuffs, etc. etc. For the sake of those squeamish folk out there that go all white in the face when they see a firearm, I have also donned a windbreaker with SECURITY written across the back in 6” high Day-Glo yellow letters. In other words, I looked NOTHING like any of the folk who worked at this market, whose uniform consisted entirely of a green apron. \n\nNow mind you, I probably could have handled this better, but I was grumpy. It was a Monday morning without coffee after all. \n \nSo, I am standing just inside the door of the market reading the chalkboard where they have written their menu for the small café they run when this Entitled Wench (hereafter referred to as EW) on her cell phone, walks up to me, and tries to hand me a slip of paper… Ok, I’m a bit confused, but I take it and give it a look. But as soon as I do EW makes a little shooing motion and walks away and sits down at a bench by the door. Never says a word to me, doesn’t even really look at me, barely acknowledges my existence and just walks off. So I’m kinda annoyed you might say. Look at this piece of paper and it’s a list of, you guessed it, groceries. Uhmm… WTF? So I wander over and politely enquire as to what exactly this is and why she had seen fit to hand it to me?  \n\nEM: My grocery list of course, fetch them for me, I’m in a hurry and can’t be bothered. I’m on a Very Important phone call.”  \n\nAnd again with the shooing motion. Now, I’ve been going to this market for nigh unto 5 years, and I can assure you, they don’t “fetch” your groceries for you. So, after some consideration, I very carefully rolled her list into a tight little ball, dropped it on her lap, and loudly growled at her to get off her lazy ass and do her own damn shopping, turn around and walk off. I hear her screeching out something behind me but I just ignore her and keep walking. Now at this point I am seriously thinking that EW will take the hint, see the Day-Glo letters on my jacket and buy a clue. But oh no, EW is just not that smart, she instead chases me down and starts yelling about how she’s going to get me fired and I need to fetch her damn groceries right now!! Trying to remain calm, I politely (honest) but forcefully tell her again, very clearly, I don’t work here, do your own damn shopping lady, and leave. \n\nThinking that’s the end of it, off I go to get a cup of wonderful hot coffee at the café and then move on to the aisle of heaven, where I am busily perusing their fine selection of lovely roasted goodness, when who should appear but EW with a gentleman in tow. She’s loudly berating him about his lazy workers, and demanding I be fired on the spot. The poor gentleman looks confusedly at me, then at her and informs her “He doesn’t work here, we don’t employ security ma’am.” Being a bit of a jerk, I wave at her, give her a big smile, and agree with him. EW absolutely loses it, goes completely insane. Starts screaming that I need to fetch her damn groceries right now or she is going to get us all fired, and she is an important person, and how we will regret treating her this way, blah, blah, blah. The gentleman finally gets a word in edgewise and again informs her I don’t work there, and I don’t have to do anything for her. \n\nThat is when I can see a dim little bulb go off in her head, and can see a glimmer, tiny but there, of understanding begin to dawn in her eyes. This dim light is however quickly squashed by her over-inflated sense of entitlement as she promptly replies in the snottiest voice possible, I kid you not, with; \n\nEW: Well, he’s obviously a menial of some sort, make him. \n\nToo say this got me a tad riled up is perhaps an understatement. I So I shoved a one-finger salute into her face and told her emphatically to go screw herself. The gentleman quickly got between us and loudly told her, in no uncertain terms that One; Again I did not work there, and Two; that she needed to get the hell out of his store. Right now. EW literally screamed at the top of her lungs, no words, just rage, and started demanded to see someone in charge so she could get us all fired and someone better get her her damn groceries, and how she was going to sue us all, damn it didn’t we know how important she was? The gentleman, who I had naturally assumed was the manager, promptly got right back in her face and yelled over her that he was the owner, his family had owned the place for 20 years, and they had never in all that time done someone’s shopping for them, ever. He then grabbed her by the arm and literally dragged her off towards the front of the store.  \n\nAt that point I was just shaking my head in disbelief, but I just went ahead, made my selection of fine coffees, and wandered over to stand in line to pay for it. As I’m there at the register the owner came up to me and actually apologized for EW’s behavior, and we shared a WTF moment. Actually ended up just laughing at how stupid EW was. Or crazy, either way. He even tried to let me have the coffee for free, but I thanked him and told him it wasn’t his fault that EW was a nut, and I was fine with paying for it. \n\nNow, you would think that that was the end of it, I mean, it was crazy, but weird stuff happens, people are idiots, whatever. But oh no, dear readers, it would appear that we had both underestimated the depths of EW’s craziness, because as we walked through the door to the outside world, who to our astonishment was there waiting for us? EW it turns out had actually called the police on us and the dumb bitch was out there screaming at the officer demanding that we be arrested for not serving her, and how she wanted us both fired, and she was going to sue, and that someone had better get her her damn groceries right now damn it!!!  My jaw dropped, I don’t mind saying it, and I was beyond shocked. I honestly started laughing at that point. This lady was certifiably nuts.  \n\nBecause of my job we happen to work closely with the local PD, so I actually recognized the Officer that had responded to the call and gave Officer Betsy a wave when she looked at me. She gave me a grin and walked over asking me about exactly what the hell was going on. We both gave our side of the story and the owner asked that she be removed from the property, please, as she was at this point causing a scene. Betsy just rolled her eyes, walked over and told EW that she needed to leave right now, immediately, or she would be charged with trespassing. \n\nNow, you ever have that moment when you can see something bad start to happen, but you’re mind just can’t quite believe it’s actually occurring? Well, I saw it start, clear as day, as EW reared back and started to go off again and yup, there it was, she actually jammed her finger into Officer Betsy’s sternum, not once, but twice. Might have been a third time, but Officer Betsy had at that point picked her up, flipped her over, and dropped EW on her head. Landed on top of her, had her handcuffed in record time, got back up, opened her door, slid EW into the back of her patrol car and slammed the door on her. And we all just stood there shaking our heads in total disbelief as EW started to scream and thrash about and kick at the windows of the squad car. She was still doing it as Officer Betsy drove off to the station too. \n\nSaw Officer Betsy later on that day, and she told me that EW was still throwing a fit when they got to the station, and fought the officer’s there like hell, until they ended up stuffing her into a control chair. She was later transported to the hospital for a psych eval. No idea what happened to her after that. \n\nSo that’s my “I Don’t Work Here Lady.” Hope you enjoyed. \n\nWow folks, I am completely blown away at the response this has gotten and thanks for the Gold. \n",

    "body": "I need to wake up gradually with plenty of coffee if I’m going to have a good day.  One day, in a strange city, I overslept and had to make the airport IMMEDIATELY.  Through superpowers that I didn’t even know I had, I managed to pack, get the rental to the right place after fueling it, grab a shuttle to the airport, get through security and made it to the gate with ten or so minutes to spare.  Although I had squeezed in a shower, I hadn’t had any food or, more importantly, caffeine, since the day before. \n\nWith my few leftover minutes I went scavaging for food and although I was looking for a coffee and hopefully a pastry or something, but at 6am not everything was open and all I could get was a Diet Pepsi and a hot dog.   I find that Diet Pepsi has just a little too much fizz for my liking and I have this habit of taking a slug and then putting the cap back on, giving it a good shake to fill the space I made with my drink with fizz and then slowly bleed the fizz off by cracking the cap.  This reduces the fizz to the perfect amount for me.  So I was in a strange airport at 6am after an hour and a half of frantic scurrying without caffeine, completely discombobulated, and I take the slug, give the bottle a good shake, and then completely uncap the bottle, spraying Diet Pepsi in about a ten foot radius.\n\nEven though the airport was only half open, the gate was completely packed.  Everyone was in fresh, clean clothes on their way to meetings far away.  I completely drenched at least 8 people, getting Diet Pepsi all over the front of them, soaking their faces and hair.\n\nAnd all I could say was sorry.\n\nEDIT: One of the best and most comforting things about Reddit is that no matter how weird you are, no matter how sick and twisted your porn, no matter how disgusting your favorite recipes, no matter how strange your habits, there's someone out there that does EXACTLY the same, or, worse than you.  Except this little Diet Pepsi habit of mine... no one else does this - I thought for sure all kinds of people would relate.  But it works!\n\nTL;DR My weird technique of tweaking the carbonation in my soda resulted in me drenching strangers at the beginning of their very important days.\n",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nLong time lurker and was 48k in student debt last December. Made a commitment last year to get out of debt. First, off I went the opposite direction and took a $3,500 digital marketing course. That allowed me though to land a higher paying job as a marketing manager for a professional services firm. \n\nI already had an emergency fund of 5k and my new job didn't let us get in the 401k plan until a year in (since has been changed). I put everything I made into my loans, besides rent & utility, cheap food and didn't buy anything like new clothes or luxury items. I then got a gig doing private security at events like Pax East, Comic Con, Apple and at hospitals that paid any where from $20-30hr. Would do these sporadically for anywhere from 10-40 extra hrs a week and huck it am my loans. I also signed up for Rover.com and took care of about 40 different types of dogs. \n\nThe final push is when I started driving Uber. I work in Boston right next to a college so after work it would often be surging and I'd drive for hours after work. I got addicted and would try to bring in an extra $500-800 week driving. Lots of caffeine and not going out on weekends. Kept track of mileage, driving expenses and expected taxes. I also made and extra $1600 referring four drivers\n\nI was making quick headway, but was getting really burnt out. I would occasionally take a weekend off to recharge and then get back at it I would fantasize about hitting a scratch ticket for the last 10k or a gift from a long lost relative. Then fate intervened. At my old job we had a pension program I never paid attention to because they said it was going away. Well one day I get a call from my  old CFO the plan was frozen and I was being paid out a little over 10k. I could either take it as cash and pay 3k in taxes & fines, or roll it over. I was extremely tempted to take it and run, but after talking to my CPA coworkers, decided to suck it up and roll it over into an IRA at Wealthfront. \n\nI drove a shit ton of uber the last two months, put my whole work bonus and all my Rover funds towards the last 10k. I was down to 3k last night and used 3gs from my emergency fund to finish it off. It was a very long process, but I'm glad I'm done. Now have to replenish the emergency fund and save up for taxes (saved a bunch, but got greedy towards the end putting it all at the loan). \n\nI'm done and am looking forward to having more free time for fun, learning more skills to get a better job and getting back into fitness. I also made my first post loans splurge purchase..new Retro Jordan 9's..don't know why I wanted them, but I did. 😎\n\nEdit: thank you to everyone for their kind words. I'm done replying for a while, please search the thread if you have questions, I think I answered most of them somewhere. Have a great day and let's go Pats!",

That is $160 per work day, at $1.24 per Mile, in a 4 hour stretch, average of 32 Miles in a hour.\n\n\nShit son, if you were able to earn $40 per hour, you would have left your first job already, and be working for uber 12 hours a day.\n\nI am sorry but reality of working for Uber is that most trips are $10/8 Mile Range, and that with plenty of other Drivers competing, wait times in between trips can be 30 minutes easily.\n\n\nFurthermore he does not talk about the costs of replacing his Tires each year, learning how to clean up vomit after drunk customers soil his car, nor even the financing cost of his vehicle.\n\nThis post leads me to believe that he is just advertising for Uber, leading people to beleive they too can earn 100 grand per year if they sign up to his referral scheeme.",

One of my jobs was to buy the coffee and load the coffee machine each morning and afternoon as necessary.\n\nRevenge was simple - for an entire week I loaded de-caf coffee and watched them slump, get snappy with caffeine withdrawal and generally suffer a little bit. The next week, I loaded \"lava java\" by Taylors instead and watched them run around like monkeys on crack.\n\nIt was joyous.\n\nEDIT - I've since learned that some people have quite the digestive reaction to caffeine. I imagine some were constipated in week 1, and some had the world fall out of their arse in week 2.",

Lets meet the wonderful and not so wonderful cast.\n\nMe- Me\n\nBB- Daughter\n\nEM- Entitled mom beast\n\nEB-Entitled mom beasts spawn (5 ish?)\n\nSetting: Local Coffee Shop\n\nOne afternoon after our mommy and me Yoga class (I know sounds dumb, but a great way to meet mommy friends), Me and BB decided to get a coffee and catch up. Well I would get coffee, she would get that sweet sweet booby milk. Well BB, lightweight that she is, passes out after that boob milk. I decide to be wild and get that second cup of coffee. Im drinking my second cup of coffee when a wild EK and EM appear.\n\nEK: AWWWWW a babayy.\n\nI smile but go back to reading the news and sipping my coffee. When I look up EK is trying to pick up my sleeping baby!!! I Panicked, obviously.\n\nMe: *yelling No no no no*\n\nEM: oh she wasnt hurting her.\n\nEK: *whining* I want to hold the babbaaayyyy\n\nMe: Shes Sleeping, and your too little to hold her honey, shes heavy\n\nEM: oh just let her hold her. EK is very mature.\n\nMe: Shes not a baby doll. No\n\nEM: You dont have to be a b\\*tch.\n\nMe: Excuse me?!?!\n\nDuring this time EK tried to pick up BB and woke her up. So BB starts crying. I pick her up and start hushing her.\n\nMe: now see what you did? Leave us alone.EM: She just wants my daughter to hold her tries to grab BB\n\nMe: WTF get awf *turns to keep BB away*\n\nBB: *Cries*\n\nEM: Just let her hold her *Keeps trying to steal baby*\n\nMe: Help open hand punches her in the nose\n\nAt this point the coffee shop employees jump in, and pull her away. One of them says that they called the police. EMs nose is bleeding. EK is sobbing. I kinda feel bad for the kid, shes pretty little, but her mom should teach her better. The employees \"ask\" us to stay and wait for police\n\nEM: good, she assauuulted me and traumatized my child\n\nBB is still crying so I give her that boob.\n\nEM: SHEESSS EXPOSSING HERSELF TO A CHILD! PEDOPHILE!!\n\nI ignore her, and BB finally calms down. The Police came. and asked us each what happen.\n\nEM: She EXPOSED HerSeLf to my daughter, and ASsaulted ME!\n\nMe: *Scared that I'm going to jail* That isn't true, she tried to steal my baby. I just was protecting her.\n\nLuckily the coffee place had cameras, She got arrested for attempted kidnapping. I have to go to court for it next month.\n\n​ edit: thanks for the silver.\n\n[**UPDATE - 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/b2c55o/em_tried_to_steal_my_baby_im_getting_sued_update/) (posted march 18, 2019)\n\nWe go to court on April 14th for the criminal charges against EM for attempted kidnapping. I didnt expect to update before then, but then this happened.\n\nMe: its-a-me. DG: deliveryman/ disguised guy EM: entitled mom EK: entitled kid\n\nMe and BB went to the park this morning, we got back around 11 am. There was a man standing on our porch, looking lost. BB was in her stroller sleeping, i put my hand in my purse, and onto my mace.\n\nMe: Can I help you?\n\nDG: I'm looking for a \\[first name\\] \\[last name\\]. I have a package for her. *he pulls out an thick envelope, it was Cardi B level thicccc*\n\nMe: Im her, I can take it. takes the Cardi B envelope. *As soon as it is in my hands, and i sign for it, DG rips off his fake mustache and delivery guy hat. Revealing his REAL identity- a legal intern*\n\nDG: cool cool cool. Your being sued by the way... good luck.\n\nYup thats right, I'm being sued by EM. Why would the woman who tried to snatch my baby be suing me? How much damage could I have inflicted? Well... apparently I did 25 thousand USD in damage. In this poor envelope was about 10 million pages detailing how she is suing me for everything that is wrong in her life. Apparently I had broken her nose so shes suing me for not only related medical bills, but she also wants me to pay for them to fix her pre existing toad nose. Oh and of course \"emotional\" damages to her and her child. Apparently EM has anxiety and depression because of ME. EK has PTSD from the indecent. Finally I'm also being sued for \"slander and character assassination\" because how dare I say she tried to steal my baby... Ofcourse at the end she said she would be \"willing to settle out of court if I would drop the criminal charges\"\n\nWell I took that letter to my lawyer and he said the judge would laugh her out of court, especially if the criminal trial goes in our favor, which is basically guaranteed. So I WILL be seeing her in court on April 14th, and I will see her again in July for the civil case!\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold my dude\n\n[**UPDATE - 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/bf3ng1/em_tried_to_steal_my_baby_goes_to_court_update/)  (posted april 20, 2019)\n\nFirstly, thanks everyone for the support and love. I can't wait to tell BB about all of this when she gets older. Wednesday we found out the verdict on EM. TLDR at end. So lets meet the cast:\n\nJ: Judge\n\nEM: entitled mom\n\nED: Entitled Dad\n\nEK: Entitled Kid\n\nJury: the Jury\n\nP: ProsecutorEL: EMs lawyer\n\nMe: me\n\nMr: My darling husband\n\nScene: This chapter opens April 15, 2019, Approximately 9:30 am. We are at our local court house. Me and Mr had dropped of bb at his mothers. I had considered bringing her and breast feeding while EM was on the stand, just to irritate her, But I didn't think a 8 month old would be able to sit quietly for that long. Instead I brought my 384 month old husband.\n\nWe went to the courthouse, and I will admit I was nervous. We took our seats behind the prosecutor, and we were chatting with her. EM enters with the her lawyer, and if looks could kill, I would be dead. The judge and jury enter, and we are ready to get started. As we are getting started the judge is interrupted by ED and EK entering the courtroom, in possibly the nosiest way to enter a room. Disclaimer: these were 3 very long, very stressful days, so I will be paraphrasing a lot.\n\nJ: EM you are charged with attempted kidnapping, first degree assault, disturbing the peace, and disorderly conduct. how do you plead?\n\nEM: Your honor, I am one hundreeeddd percent innocent, In fact I am outraged that i stand accused of wrong doing. I am a proud american and the biggest supporter of these proud, fair and just...\n\nJ: *looking already done with her shit* Please sit down\n\nEM: *shocked* B-But\n\nJ: now\n\nEM: *sits*\n\nJ: We will now proceed to opening statements, Prosecutor?\n\nP: *lays out the case. Succinctly explaining that EM was a dangerous woman, who attempted to rip a small baby from its mothers arms.*\n\nEM: *screaming* No NO no ThAt iSnT TRuE\n\nJ: EL tell EM to be quiet, P continue\n\nP: there is clear, indisputable evidence that EM is guilty on all counts....\n\nThe Prosecutor wraps up his opening statement in under about 5 minutes, explaining that the whole situation was caught on tape, and that the evidence will speak for itself\n\nThe defenses opening statement was about 40 minutes long. He gave this creatures whole life story. She couldn't **possibly** be guilty! She was your typical suburban soccer mom, president of her HOA, active in her church. BLAH BLAH BLAH. Apparently because the statements established character they weren't off topic enough to make the judge tell EL to shut up and sit down. EL talked so long that after they concluded, the judge dismissed us for the day.\n\nWe come back the second day, and before the trial start my husband goes and grabs us a cup of pure caffeine from a booth in the courthouse. He's putting his creme and sugar in it, when ED approaches.\n\nED: hey man, how are you doing?\n\nMr: Fine...\n\nED: This whole mess is crazy\n\nMr: Yup...\n\nED: look man, what will happen to my daughter if her mom goes to jail. Its not good for a kid.\n\nMr: Yeah thats rough, Sorry\n\nED: well you **could** tell your wife to drop the charges, you know, do whats best for the kids.\n\nMr: yeah, I'm not gonna do that.\n\nED: c'mon man be reasonable\n\nMr: If your wife was reasonable, we wouldn't even be here.\n\nED: fuck you n\\*\\*\\*\\*er\n\nMr: get out of here man walks away\n\nthe second day of court starts. Prosecution lays out the evidence, including the tape, calls witnesses, and all that prosecution stuff. When the prosecution calls witnesses the the defense also gets to ask them questions. They were trying to cast doubt on all of the witnesses, i guess to make it seem like it was all a witch hunt against entitled mom. Finally it was my turn to testify, and be questioned. I told my story for the prosecution, then this foolishness ensued...\n\nEL: It seems like you were the first to raise your voice, would you say that is accurate?\n\nMe: I suppose so\n\nEL: So that would make you the instigator\n\nMe: I dont thin-\n\nEL: *cuts me off* You claim that EM assaulted you\n\nMe: Yes\n\nEL: Did EM strike you at any point during this altercation?\n\nMe: well not exactly \"strike\"\n\nEL: did you strike EM at any point?\n\nMe: Yes,but it was to-\n\nEL: the jury will notice that this woman has admitted to not only being the instigator, but also the aggressor in this situation.\n\nAfter the prosecution lays out their evidence, it is the defenses turn. It is at this point EM takes the stand. EM tells her twisted version of events. According to her, her daughter had seen my baby and had approached me to tell me how beautiful BB was. In response to this totally innocent interaction, I began verbally **abusing** EK. She attempted to calm me, but this back fired. When I violently snatched up BB, she **couldn't help but notice that it was** \"very unlikely\" that BB was mine. Seeing an unstable woman, snatching up an innocent, probably kidnapped BB, EM just had to intervene. When she did I viciously attacked her.\n\nSo day three is verdict and sentencing. On the charge of attempted kidnapping, the jury decided that there was not enough evidence to conclude that she wanted to kidnap BB - not guilty. On the charge of assault, the jury was not convinced by her lawyers attempts to demonize me- Guilty. Disturbing the peace, and disorderly conduct, the tapes and witnesses lead to a guilty verdict. Now we get to the part you all have been waiting for SENTENCING! EM was sentenced to 18 months of probation, 40 hours of community service, 30 hours of anger management, and $730 in fines. This all goes on her criminal record and if she violates her probation, or does not do what is required, she will spend those 18 months in prison. While I know many of us were hoping for jail time, I am satisfied with this outcome, and I think it is fair. We left feeling pretty good, we have to go back to court in a few months for the civil case.\n\n[**UPDATE - 3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/d1j1go/em_terrorizes_me_for_months/) (posted september 9, 2019)\n\nPreviously on how did my life become so bat-sh\\*t INSANE (yes this is an update): i took my infant daughter out for our weekly coffee date, while there an EM with her daughter appeared, and tried to grab my baby. She left with a broken nose and some criminal charges. I left with BB (my daughter) and a ridiculous lawsuit. Me and my husband go to her criminal court trial and her husband says some racist BS to my husband. Shes is found not guilty on most of her charges, and is sentenced to probation and some therapy.\n\nEpisode whatever in this melodrama (this is the new stuff):\n\nThe civil case was supposed to be on July 9th, but the case was dropped. I was so happy! After months of this crap, I was ready to put all of this behind me and move on with our lives. I don't know why I was so naive. I should have known that a crazy EM like that would not give up so easily.\n\nOne Evening on my way back from our mommy and me Yoga class, I noticed a woman parked across the street from my house. I thought it was EM but I brushed it off, thinking that I was paranoid because all of this started after one if our classes. I took BB inside and got her settled. When I looked out the window, the car was gone. I went about my business, until Saturday. The weather on this particular Saturday morning was gorgeous, So i decided to take BB to the park. It was still early, about 9 am. That car was parked on my street again, but this time it was empty. We walked to the park, and were there for about 30 mins before I noticed the same car, again empty. I know it was the same car because of the hideous seat covers (pink leopard print). I was a little on edge, so i gathered up BB and started to leave. Then I seen her, she was about 15 feet away from us, and it was definitely EM. EM was there but her daughter was no where in sight. I was starting to worry that she had moved on to my street. When I got home, it was empty, which is normal, because my husband likes to go to the gym a little later on Saturday. I got BB a snack, and called my neighbor/ friend. I asked her if she knows if anyone moved on to the street lately. She didn't think anyone did. Neither of us had noticed any sign of a move in either, not that we pay especially close attention. I told her about seeing EM, we both decided that it was probably a coincidence. We chatted for a little while, until it was time for BBs nap. As soon as I finished putting her down, and went down the stairs, my husband came in. It calmed my nerves to see him. Atleast until we had this conversation. Husband: Were you expecting someone this morning? Me: No, why? H: I thought I heard someone knocking on the door this morning, but by the time i got downstairs, they were already gone.\n\nRight away I was on edge. I thought about that empty car. Even if it wasnt EM, why would someone just knock and leave like that? I told my husband about seeing EM, and decided that it could be a coincidence, or it might not, so we will keep an eye out and the police on speed dial.\n\nEvery thing was normal for a few days, but then I seen the car again. This continued for about a week to two weeks. I would see the car, and then it would be back a few days later. It would be at different times, and places. I began to feel paranoid, like I was being watched all the time. One day I tried to confront her, but she drove away. At the two week mark, I decided that I had had enough and would go to the police station the next morning. And that is exactly what I did. The police handled everything just like I thought they would. By that I mean that they treated me like a crazy person and told me that a car being on a public street is not a crime, and since no threats had been made there was not much that they could (or would) do. It was a great waste of time for everyone.\n\nAbout two days later I was leaving for work when I noticed that all 4 of my tires had been slashed.\n\nThe next weekend I was working in the garden while BB played next to me. I noticed a little blue green pellet that I immediately recognized. It was Rat Poison. I was outraged that the city would just throw poison into people's lawns. What if BB would have eaten it, I also have a cat who could die if they ate a poisoned rat. (luckily hes an indoor cat) I was bitching to my neighbor, ready to turn into a Karen myself, when he told me two things that turned my stomach and left me gagging. 1. No one else has, or has ever found Rat poison pellets in their yard. 2. When the city does rat control, they only but poison in the rat burrows. I wouldn't have them just randomly in the yard. I was horrified. My daughter could have eaten one of those. I called the police non emergency line, and told them what was happening, and again I was dismissed. My daughter could have died and they acted like NBD. I was told they would \"look into it\" and that was that.\n\nIm just going to list some of the things that happened over the next few weeks:\n\nMy garden was torn up,by a person, who literally just ripped up handfuls of flowers.\n\nI saw that car 15 times.\n\n\"Someone\" set up an automatic \"wakeup call\" for my phone at 3 am\n\nOnce i figured out how to get the Auto calls to stop someone would call me and hang up, up to 3 times a day. I would block the number and a new number would call.\n\nWe went away for a few days, while we were gone I received a photo text from outside of my house with the message \"see you soon\". I immediately rushed us home, and when we got there,\" someone\" had thrown a rock through my window.\n\nThis was the last straw for me, i rushed into momma bear mode. I took my daughter to my mother's, and my husband went to the store and picked up some security cameras. We called the police, took photos, and looked for our cat (he was hiding under our porch). My husband set up the cameras, and I filed for a emergency protection order. In my state when you file for one of those they go into effect immediately, and there is a hearing later to determine if it will be permanent and all that.\n\nThings calmed down for a few days, and I brought BB home. I thought maybe the order would keep EM away, because if she broke it, she would violate her parole, and spend time in jail. AGAIN I underestimated crazy. Im gonna put a **TRIGGER WARNING** for the rest of this paragraph, because this is so fucked up, so just be warned. If you arent ready, skip to the next paragraph. One evening I came home from work and picking up BB, and I walked up to the door. One my porch there is a black, mostly empty garbage bag. BB was still sleeping from the car ride, so i put her inside the house, and came back out. I thought it may have been my husband, being careless. I thought it could have been trash, or dirty gym clothes, or something that he was going to donate, or whatever. So I looked inside. Before any conscious thought registered, I was gagging from the smell of decomposition. Inside that bag was a dismembered cat. It was warm, possibly from the summer heat. I immediately panicked. I went back inside, crying, calling and searching for our cat. In my emotional state I had woken BB and she was screaming and crying too. Our cat was up in our bedroom, taking a nap, and very much alive. I was so overwhelmed by emotions. I was happy that our cat was ok, but that didn't stop the panic attack that followed. I called my husband, hyperventilating as our BB continued to cry, and told him to get home, NOW. Luckily he was already on the way.\n\nMy husband called the police on his way home, and they arrived soon after he did. They took photos and watched the security camera footage. The cameras clearly showed EM leaving the bag on my porch. We gave the police the footage, and the bag. I took BB to my moms again, I was going to stay too, but I had to clean up my house. The bag leaked on the porch, and in my panic i tracked it through the house. Me and husband returned home, cleaned up. I also had to have another melt down. We stayed at my moms overnight. In the morning I had a meeting with the police so my Mom stayed with BB, and Husband went to work. The police took my statement, and let me know that they were already working with a judge, and expected to pick up EM by tonight or tomorrow. I was just ready for this all to be over, I felt powerless. While I was in the meeting, my mother texted me to pick up some teething gel for BB, and some toys. So I stopped by the house. I grabbed an extra change of clothes for everyone, and the stuff for BB. While Im in BBs room I look out the window, it faces the back yard, I see EM in out shed, rummaging around. I flew into an immediate rage, and was already half way down the stairs before i stopped myself. I went back into BBs room and called the police. I told them that someone was breaking in. While i was on the phone EM walked up and tried to open my backdoor. It was locked so idk what she thought turning the handle would do. I crept downstairs. I went into my kitchen. I looked out the window and EM was walking towards my back door again. So i moved over and stood against the wall and the back door. I thought she was going to try the door again, but instead she broke my window. Instinctively, i grabbed the closest thing off the counter. She looked into the door, and I hit her with it. She fell back and her nose was bleeding again. Apparently I hit her with a dirty baking tray. She got up and i raised the tray again, but she started to run the other way, around to the front of the house.\n\nJust as she made it to the front yard the police were getting out of their cars. I opened the front door, tray in hand, just in time to hear this:\n\nEM: Thank god you got here in time, some one broke into my home and attacked me. Get in there and shoot her. There she is now, and shes armed! SHOOooT her!!!\n\nWhen she screams and pointed at me the cop immediately pulled his gun at me. I immediately dropped the tray and freeze up, I really thought he was going to shoot me. The cop lowers his gun. Another Squad car pulls up and two more officers start getting out of the car. There are a total of 4 cops in my yard, and I'm still frozen.\n\nEM: wHaT ARe yOu dOIng? sHOoOt HeR!!\n\nCop 1:Ma'am I need you to calm down.\n\nAnother cop walks up and goes to (grab?) My arm. I pull away on reflex.\n\nMe: This is my house.\n\nEM: Shes lying. Look at me, she clearly attacked me.\n\nMe : because you broke my window and were coming in!\n\nEM: HoW DaRE YoU, I hAVe liVed Here for YeArs!!\n\nMe: You lying bitch.\n\nI must have moved towards her because the cop next to me grabs me by the arm. Ill be honest, i wasn't thinking really clear.\n\nMe: let me go, this is my house!\n\nEM: (starts crying) See SHes Crazy, thank god you came when you did.\n\nCop 1: its ok, ma'am, follow me to the squad car so I can take your statement.\n\nTwo cops go with her to the car, and two stand with me on the porch. Im shocked, and freaking out, but I start to think clearly again.\n\nMe:This is my house.\n\nCop 2: Ok?\n\nMe: I can prove it (finally not being an idiot)\n\nCop 2: Ok?\n\nMe: My purse is inside by the stairs, my license is in there.\n\nCop 2 nods at cop 3, and cop 3 goed inside and comes back out with my purse. She goes through it and pulls out my license. Cop 2 and 3 nod at each other. Cop 3 walks down into the yard, and waves cop 4 over. They talk for a moment and cop 4 goes back over to 1 and Em, 3 returns over to me.\n\nCop 3: were sorry miss, cop 4 pulled up the police report from yesterday, I'm sorry about the stress, at least she was caught in the act \\[blah blah blah\\]\n\nWhile cop 3 was talking to me, cop 4 was talking to EM I'm not sure what was said, but EM turned even paler than she is, and tried to run away. She didn't get far, and ended up eating pavement.\n\nA few minutes later I was giving ANOTHER statement, and EM was glaring at me as she was driven away. After I gave my statement, and the cops took a few photos, the cops left. I called my husband home again. He stayed and cleaned up, and had to board up our window. We stayed at my moms for another 2 days. We didn't go home until we found out EM was denied bail.\n\nIn the end she was found to have violated her parole, so she must spend the rest of her sentence in jail. They also added a stalking charge, animal cruelty, and breaking and Entering. I expect that she will be in Jail for a few years at least. I really hope that this is my last update. I am also really grateful that so many people showed concern after my last post.\n\nTLDR: This post is an update for a previous post. EM tried to grab my baby, went to court, got probation. She also tried (and failed) to sue me. After all this she proceeded to stalk and terrorize me and my family for several weeks, and will likely spend several years in jail.\n\n**REMINDER: i am not the original poster**",

All these are expected symptoms of the deadly poison extracted from the excretions of the sac fungi found on the plains of Straka III.\n\nThe shaking expected afterwards is supposed to be a series of uncontrollable spasms as a being’s organs shut down one by one. No living being in all of Union space had ever survived more than a single hour. Many died in seconds as their insides dissolved.\n\nBut the shaking was different this time. It was a quick right, left, right, left of the accursed human’s head, followed by an amazed “Wow!”\n\nThe human looked at the glass he was holding. In it was enough of the liquid to kill a Carmellian Bisax. It seemed to be calculating. It knew what I had tried to do.\n\nIt looked me dead in the eye, it’s predatory eyes locked unblinking on mine, and it showed its fangs and teeth in an aggressive display of dominance.\n\nAnd then it _drank the rest of the poison_.\n\nThen it laughed.\n\n“That is some seriously good booze you have there, Squishy.”\n\nMy name is Squis’shi. The callous disregard for my honour and name is one of the reasons I agreed to this assassination mission. \n\nIt looked at the empty glass, and ran its tongue tentacle over the terrifying teeth.\n\n“You got any more of this? I know people that would pay good money for this stuff.”\n\n—— \n_much later_\n——\n\nHuman Damien was staggering a bit, and slurring his words, “I thought you were a bit of an idiot, Squis’shi. You’re alright, you are.”\n\nHe hadn’t drunk this much since he left Mars University over ten years ago. He was probably going to have a hangover, but this stuff was pure liquid gold.\n\n——\n\nI have regained my honour. The human at last uses my given name, full of deference and respect. He obviously recognises my assassination attempt and thinks it worthy of a competitor.\n\nHe has signed a trade deal which will keep my family and crèche in good standing for many revolutions. Not only can I show my face there again, but I can hold my head high, even next to nestling Shrim’pii.\n\nHe was jubilant as well, and kept saying that he couldn’t wait till his trading partner Jack Daniels tried this one.\n\nI am a little concerned that he has consumed enough of the poison to take out an entire city. I will have to be watchful around him now. He will no doubt feel the need to honour me with an assassination attempt.\n\nI think this trade deal means I can call off our current invasion plans.\n\nTruly, the humans only send their best.",

        "body": "A deafening silence enveloped the conference room as soon as I stepped through the door. My two assistants froze behind me in terror, but I carried on like nothing was wrong, forcing them to follow my lead. Even the species that were telepathic fell quiet as I walked past them, immediately noticeable by their stiffening antennae and wide-eyed stares. It seemed my would-be assassins had already gossiped about their victory. \n\nMost of these diplomats had written off humanity as an upstart race. We accomplished warp travel only fifty years prior, a blink of an eye for some of these cultures, and quickly developed close diplomatic relationships with some of the bigger players in the galactic stage, to the point where humans were mostly free to roam any corner of the Milky Way without risking a war. The fact that we stuck to our corner of the galaxy, despite being capable of expanding, had left some of these people skeptical of our motives. \n\nI didn't blame them, really. History had shown that space-faring cultures rarely played nice with each other. It would be incredibly easy for humans to dismantle entire empires with sleeper agents due to how widespread we were becoming. Our scientists, artists, and bounty hunters gained notoriety through honest use of their skills, which meant several star systems already relied on us to function smoothly. Unfortunately, some people just couldn't believe a species was *that* content with mere exploration, not without being secretly evil. These aliens were too used to their own technological advancements to see it from our perspective. Now that human aging had been mitigated and food was no longer scarce, most of us just wanted to do our own thing and hopefully learn something valuable along the way. \n\nThere was plenty of room for everyone in the galaxy. That was our biggest epiphany when we first left the solar system. Furthermore, a whole universe waited for us beyond the galactic rim. Squabbling over territory just felt silly after getting this far. I knew most people wouldn't buy that, though. Some of our allies were even starting to doubt our intentions. My job at this summit was to make sure our current treaties held true. Anything else would be a bonus. \n\nEveryone expected me to sit next to the Tros-Teeng, one of humanity's first friends. That may have been adequate in a normal scenario but not after an assassination attempt. Looking for sympathy from our allies would make us seem weak, almost like we needed an older species to protect us. That wasn't the message I wanted to send. In order to maintain our standing, proactive measures had to be taken, which is why I chose to sit between the Bhul'ees and the Kouwerds, the two groups that had just tried to kill me.\n\n\n\"Ambassador Clark!\" gurgled the Bhul'ee representative, twitching her tentacles. \"How... are you feeling?\"\n\n\n\"Great!\" I smiled, making myself comfortable. \"Something wrong? You look nervous.\"\n\n\n\"Do I?\" The Bhul'ee shifted in her seat. The retinue around her hadn't moved an inch since I sat down. \"Maybe it looks that way to a human, but I couldn't be more calm.\"\n\n\n\"Of course, sorry for assuming. I could've sworn you looked a lot more relaxed during our meal, but I guess that's just my silly monkey brain acting up. We have a lot to learn from each other, don't we?\"\n\n\n\"Yes...\" muttered the Bhul'ee. \"Your biology astounds me.\"\n\n\n\"I'm sure it does. If you're ever up for another dinner, just let me know. Your delicacies were scrumptious! Especially that drink you gave me!\"\n\n\n\"I... can't take credit for all of it.\" The Bhul'ee glanced at the Kouwerd ambassador. \"Our friend here promised to bring the best ingredients he could find.\"\n\n\nThe Kouwerd rippled his gelatinous body with an uncomfortable noise, making himself as small as possible. \"I... I tried my best!\"\n\n\n\"Nobody said otherwise,\" I replied. \"Say, where *did* you find those beans? I haven't found good ones in years.\"\n\n\n\"Erm...\" The Kouwerd struggled to answer me. \"Well...\"\n\n\n\"Years?\" said the Bhul'ee, hoping to change the subject. \"You mean you've tried it before?\"\n\n\n\"Of course! We call it coffee where I'm from. Humans often fraternize over a cup of it, especially after a meal. Don't your people do it too?\"\n\n\nThe two ambassadors stayed quiet, sharing a quick glance.\n\n\n\"Wait, a minute...\" I scratched my chin. \"You mean to tell me... that isn't the case?\" \n\n\n\"N-no!\" said the Kouwerd, sweating droplets of purple ooze. \"We definitely use it a lot...\"\n\n\n\"But it's really expensive\" added the Bhul'ee, glaring at her ally. \"I've found it's not worth the cost.\"\n\n\n\"As a coffee junkie, I have to disagree. We have it available on our replicators but nothing beats the taste of freshly ground, organically grown beans.\"\n\n\n\"Right...\" said the Kouwerd. \"Our people have selectively bred the plant for centuries. We've found many applications for it...\"\n\n\n\"Fascinating. I'd love to see your farms! Perhaps we could share notes. Heck, there's a lot of demand for it in our worlds, if you're interested in discussing a trade deal.\"\n\n\nThe Bhul'ee frowned.\n\n\n\"T-that won't be possible\" said the Kouwerd, intimidated. He actually looked tempted for a second. \"We're very secretive when it comes to our growing operations. Sorry.\"\n\n\n\"What a shame.\"\n\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Bhul'ee. \"A shame. I'm surprised you love it that much. Some... can't handle it.\"\n\n\n\"I can see how that might be the case. Some humans aren't very good at tolerating it, but most find the buzz is usually worth it. Then again, that's our lot in life. We embrace discomfort to get what we want. Some species value the opposite, so I suppose it would be easy to never try anything difficult, when they don't have to. Now that I think about it, the same applies to our friendships.\" I started laughing. \"We often tolerate the most crap from those we love.\" I gave them both a dead-eyed stare. \"Otherwise, why put up with it?\"\n\n\nThe Kouwerd ambassador shrieked and rolled away in a ball, grabbing the attention of everyone else in the conference room.\n\n\nThe Bhul'ee tensed up, unable to speak. She seemed like she wanted to do the same as her ally, but couldn't afford to look weak in front of this many people.\n\n\nI didn't have to say anything else. My threat had been clear. The rest of the summit went smoothly from then on. Our allies saw that humanity wouldn't back down from a challenge, but that we also wouldn't be savages about it. That earned us a lot more respect going forward. As I was leaving the conference room, one of my assistants went on to ask me why I dealt with them so kindly. If we had reported them instead, they would've been in clear violation of several treaties, something that would've crippled them with sanctions and tariffs. I shrugged off their concern, saying:\n\n\n\"Sure, we could've messed with them even more, but something tells me they wouldn't have learned their lesson otherwise. Remember, cooperation and endurance got humanity this far. Show them that the rising tide lifts all boats, and they'll discover it can drown them if they don't get onboard. Besides...\" I chuckled. \"I'm pretty grateful. Do you know how hard it is to find good coffee around here?\"\n\n---------\n\n\n>If you enjoyed this, check out my other stories over at /r/WeirdEmoKidStories! Thanks for reading!",

A drink, supposedly a local delicacy. Yet it felt so much like an espresso that I could have sworn that Andromorph was from New Jersey. He even had the accent. Or maybe that was just the universal translator.\n\nThe looks he gave me after I finished it without blinking was, to say the least, unnerving. As if he didn't expect me to enjoy it as much.\n\nNext was the Flagellians. They offered me a golden brown liquid that looked, smelled and tasted like a good Malt Whisky. Those guys quickly became my fastest friends. Especially after I quickly organised a trade deal for a few million units of the stuff. They were awful concerned about openly discussing it, but I made sure they knew I understood. Earth had its own prohibitions, after all.\n\nThe Andorians and Belvitiands were less welcoming. They offered me a platter of meats that, while appearing entirely vile, actually turned out to be perfectly seasoned strips of what they called \"Interfectorem Cibum\". When I coughed and hacked at the first bite, yet still went in for seconds, exclaiming \"That's sone killer seasoning!\" I swear they nearly attacked me on the spot.\n\nIt was the Pandorians, though, that nearly killed me. They, at least, had the decency to be apologetic when my throat swelled and bulged, blocking my breathing. In my defence, they did share the dish with me, the bread the delicious, and I savoured every bite.\n\nUntil, that is, they mentioned that we had a similar dish on earth.\n\nNever had I cursed the invention of pecan bread more than I had in that moment.",

Ever since I was old enough for the job, I've been carrying out hits on people.\n\n  This one was no different. Surprisingly easy too. The security was quite lax for such an important meeting, and I managed to sneak into the staffroom and grabbed myself a uniform. It doesn't fit me that well, but whatever. Nobody's going to notice.\n\n  The lunch break was ticking closer by the minute.\n\n  I stood in the corner of the room, observing the quite plain meeting hall. 9 chairs, each with an ambassador of every galactic species and a woman at the head of the table, droning on, and on.. and on..\n\n  When she announces : \"Refreshments and food will be served shortly.\"\n\n  Obviously I'm already holding the platter, each filled with delicacies from every corner of the galaxy with a special little ingredient for our little homo sapien friend here.\n\n  Capsaicin is said to be deadly. It's known as the 'killer chemical' for a reason. Only a fool would dare willingly ingest such a potent poison. It stiffens the muscles and sends the target into anaphylactic shock, restricting respiration before slowly asphyxiating its unfortunate victim in a matter of minutes. It takes a drop of this stuff to kill.\n\n  I sneaked an entire vial of the stuff into the ambassador's food, as a special 'thank you'. Now here I am, serving his food to him. I hope he enjoys his unexpected last meal. A monotone \"Thanks.\" from him, and I make my exit.\n\n  I leave the room, leaving the door open just a crack so I can peer in and watch him die.\n\n  The first, and last bite, before his face displays surprise, fanning his mouth like crazy and panting like a mutt.\n\n  \"Water! Milk!\" he shouts.\n\n  \"Too hot! Goodness!\"\n\n  The rest of the members look at him in confusion, and they all mumble. The woman leading the meeting goes over to check what's going on. I smirk, knowing these would be these last words.\n\n  He downs his entire glass of water, swishing it around in his mouth and swallowing, coughing.\n\n  \"Why, how unexpected.\" he says, before.. taking.. another.. bite?\n\n  Huh? This fool just came face to face with one of the most potent toxins, and shrugged it off like nothing? Is this man invincible? Don't tell me, something as harmless as cyanide will kill him, instead of *that*?\n\n  What now? How do I dispose of him? Gosh, my client will *kill* me!",

And this Trennovian had followed her here, making small talk and offering to buy her a drink as they discussed the law that would come to pass.\n\nA law that the Trennovians did not like.\n\n\"Seriously. What does killing me *now* accomplish? The law's been passed.\" She shook her head, her hand reaching into her bag for the handheld impact cannon and feeling the comforting cold metal of it.\n\nThe alien's look of shock slowly vanished and a blank expression replaced it.\n\n\"No future transgressions. You'll be an example.\"\n\n\"I'll be a martyr. There are a million different ways you can have gone about this. Killing me to set an example is the worst way you could have thought of.\"\n\n\"Your kind has them all in your pockets.

The force of it pushed them both away from each other. They both fell, crashing to the smooth, polished floor as the sound of the discharge filled the area.\n\nShe slowly got to her feet, her arms numb from the recoil. The Trennovian lay, trying to gather itself and rise back up. But it was too winded, too shaken. The woman collapsed back to her seat, eying the poison. The taste had resembled gingered coffee, to an extent. It reminded her of the spiced coffee her mother used to make.

        "body": "My face hurts from smiling.  This is my first formal diplomatic dinner, and it’s already wearing on me.  Ever since human expansion exploded and we found and joined the Federation of Intelligent Sentient Humanoids, relations have been a struggle.  The other members act cordial, but everyone still looks at us like the teen who just moved up from the kids’ table.  We thought that pinching the fabric of space and time to move throughout the cosmos would be the toughest part; who would have guessed that it would actually be the slog to curry favor with a bunch of F.I.S.H.? I look around the room at all of the unfamiliar faces. Me and my bodyguard are the only Terrans in a houseful of Murkan elite. Our host this evening is the head of Murkan diplomatic relations, who I have been trying to negotiate a trade deal with for months. I'm not going to try to spell his name. I call him Sam. This seems to perturb him, but in exchange I let him call me something easier on his tongue than “Councilman Rebecca,” which appears to be something close to “Reba” if you replaced the R sound with a noise similar to ripping paper. Whatever. It works.  \n\nI approach Sam and try my pitch one last time before dinner.  He seems disinterested and gives me only perfunctory responses before excusing himself you speak to other guests.  I go for a last ditch effort with a bit of light humor as I say “seems a shame to invite me all this way if you didn’t want to talk shop.”  \n\nHe stops and grins at me. “I am sure that there will be plenty of discussion after dinner. One mustn’t rush such things. Negotiations have a way of working themselves out on a full stomach.”  \nWith that, he disappears into his other guests.  \n\nBefore long we are all ushered into the dining room and take our seats at a long and elegant table.  The last seat before the head has a placard with my name on it, so I pull out the chair and sit down.  Someone pulls out the chair next to me at the head for Sam. Conversation dulls to a murmur while a number of servants bring out entrees on opulently decorated plates.  I’m used to people gawking at the new alien, but it seems to be coming to a head as everyone gets their food.  The number of eyes on me is heavy and uncomfortable, and no one seems to want to meet my gaze as I look around the table.  I notice that I have a different dish than everyone else.\nSam sees me notice this and says “Tonight I am serving a Murkan delicacy, but I have been told that Terrans such as yourself tend to not care for it. They say the taste is similar to one of your… what were they called… squirrels?”  \n\nAll at once I am extremely glad that my meal is different. “You are a kind and generous host, and I apologize that you felt the need to make additional accommodations for me.”  \n\nSam says “nonsense. I believe that this meal is exactly what you deserve. Go on, try it.”  \n\nIf any eyes from around the long table weren’t on me, they are now.  Hesitantly, I bring the fork to my mouth and take a bite. Sam looks at me with bated breath. As I chew, a familiar sensation washes over me, along with something... new.  \nI drop my fork and slap my hand over my mouth. Sam bares his grotesque teeth in a delighted smile.  \n\n\"Oh my god,\" I utter with a mouthful of food.  \n\nSam looks around the table at a room full of people who host a mixture of expressions ranging from concern to equal amounts of delight.  \n\n\"Oh my god,\" I say again.  \n\nSam raises his glass and says to his company \"you see? These things have a way of working themselves out.\" He turns to me and says \"enjoying the meal?\"\n  \n\"How did you know?\" I ask him as I slump back in my seat, bewildered.  \n\n\"Research, my dear. Research.  All of these compounds are synthesized from organic matter on your planet to be far more potent than anything you could find naturally.\" His smug expression grows.  \n\nI sit up, and greedily take another bite. Sam's expression falters as he watches me. I look back at him, and through another bite of food I say \"yeah, but I mean how did you know that *mole poblano* was my favorite dish? I haven't had it since my mother made it for me *years* ago.”  \nI roll my eyes. “Duh. It’s my country of origin’s national dish.” I take another bite, “but still, that is some crack research team you guys have.”  \nAll of a sudden I freeze and stop chewing. The guests, who have been strangely quiet up until now, seem to somehow get even more captivated by my culinary reunion. I say “wait, there’s something… different…”  \n\nSam leans in, his concern fading and a bit of confidence returning to his expression. “Yes?” he asks.  \n\nI gasp and turn to him. “Did you add *coffee?!*” I turn and playfully slap him on the shoulder. Or, his general shoulder region, I guess. “What, did you travel to Earth to personally steal a recipe from my abuela’s notebook? That was her secret ingredient: espresso powder in the cocoa!”  \n\nHe quickly looks around nervously “No! I assure you that we have stolen no secrets from the any of the Terran planets!”  \n\n“Relax, I’m just giving you a hard time.” I look around the room at the shocked patrons. “Eat! Please! I feel like a pig eating by myself.”  \nThe spectacle seemingly over, everyone tentatively begins eating their meals.  \n\n***\n\nTensions gradually ease and the rest of the meal goes smoothly. Light talks of trade and policy are brought up and quickly dismissed in favor of more casual conversation.  As the night comes to a close, I signal to my guard and we approach Sam as he finishes saying goodbye to the last of his guests.  I don’t know what the Murkan equivalent of “nervously pulling on your collar to let steam out” is, but I imagine it’s similar to the little fidget dance he is doing now.  \n\n“I was wondering if we might have a word with you in private,” I ask him.  \n\n“But of course,” he replies. He nods to two large Murks by the door and the five of us enter some kind of study. Sam takes a seat behind a large desk and gestures for me to sit as well. Our bodyguards stoically loom behind both of us.  \nNo one speaks. The only sound is the gentle clink of ice as I absently jostle a glass of whisky.  \n\n“I have a bit of a confession to make,” I admit while casually looking at my fingernails, “and I imagine that you do as well.”  \nSam shifts uneasily in his seat.  \n“You are right to assume that humans are all too willing to turn on other humans. We kill each other constantly. We’re actually really good at it,” I brag as I pause to take a sip of my drink. “Unfortunately, we are frustratingly clever and occasionally extremely lucky. Like me for instance. Out of all the dirty, vile, rotten scumbags on my planet that should see your black market request for poisons, your contract landed in the hands of my brother.”  \n\n“Hey!” your bodyguard exclaims.  \n\n“You know you’re a scumbag, Diego.” I turn to look at him and say “now be quiet, I’m having a moment.”  \nMy gaze returns to Sam and I chuckle lightheartedly. “That actually *was* my abuela’s recipe. My shock was genuine. Your chef did a fantastic job preparing it.”  \n\nSam sits in silence as I continue to sip my beverage. Finally, in a low voice, he says “what do you want?”  \n\nI place my drink down on his desk hard enough that the sound of ice cubes clinking against the sides of the glass hangs in the silence of the room.",

        "body": "\"*Again it is just splendid to have you here with us, creation knows we need more with your kind's ambition here!*\" the alien diplomat symphonically curdled before gliding away to greet another dignitary.\n\nNole exhaled heavily through his nostrils and, after a brief tuck of the shirt, began to look around the auditorium. He could still barely believe it, and he was literally standing there with his own eyeballs watching it happen; cosmic life, mingling among each other like a long-awaited family reunion. \n\nHe could still barely believe things were going so *smoothly*, but perhaps that was just the soldier in him. His thoughts were interrupted by a familiar voice:\n\n\"*How are you feeling captain?*\"\n\nNole turned and was immediately grateful for the interruption. \"*Mrs. Lanter, I was wondering where you sauntered off to.*\"\n\nNataly Angelique Roderiguez-Lanter was the representative from Earth, specifically from the Gilead-Republican Conservative party. The GRC insisted that they would not be left out of any extraterrestrial negotiations now or in the future, but they didn't listen when the U.N.S.N. tried to tell them this was the intergalactic equivalent to an office cocktail party and that no such negotiations would be taking place. Go figure.\n\n\"*Oh I was trapped in a rather one sided conversation with the Keplerite ambassador, but I just think he's nervous about being here.*\" She sipped water from a strange looking glass, keeping her eyes on him all the while. \"*They don't have anything stronger here if you're wondering, something about different biochemistries, so they just serve water. It's good water though.*\"\n\n\nNole nodded thoughtfully. The Keplerites made contact with the outer galaxy almost at the same time as Earth did, so they were kind of in the same boat. He internally chuckled when he realized that they actually came to the convention on the same ship. \"*I think I understand what he's feeling, the Keplerite. On some base level this just feels, I don't know.* ***Unnerving.****\"*\n\nNataly smiled her perfect smile. \"*Well Nole just look around! There are predators and prey here, organics and machines, how can you not feel like this is a bomb waiting to go off!*\"\n\nMrs. Lanter wearing a red silk dress with a tastefully low neckline, with crimson highlights in her jet-black hair. Even the non-simian species present took note of her beauty; It was almost comedic when she walked past the group of plant-like aliens that were literally just gigantic eyeballs on stalks.\n\nThe sight of her slender frame yanked Nole's thoughts away and forcefully made him think on his own appearance; Mrs. Lanter might be considered underweight on Earth, the high-gravity homeworld of the Human species, but Captain Nole McGowan was not from Earth. He lifted his long, lean arm, and straightened out his shirt cuff, which gave him the brief few seconds to think on the origins of his people, and the bizarre circumstances which brought him here.\n\nWhereas the members of the wealthy Lanter family were tried and true Earthers, the McGowans of Ganymede were proud denizens of the outer system reclamation zones, what his ancestors called the \"outer planets\", as well as the countless asteroids in the belt. Generations of life in zero gravity had irrevocably altered the bone density of the people inhabiting the reclamation zones, and as such Nole McGowan bore the trademark features of an Outer Human: he was extremely slender, and almost three meters tall. There were countless conflicts between Inner Humans and Outer Humans over labor rights, and those conflicts continued for centuries as Humanity spread through the Sol System. \n\nNole internally shrugged. Those events were in the past, and he was standing in unison with an Inner on the greatest frontier Humanity had ever faced.\n\nPerhaps Humans don't need an enemy anymore. Inners and Outers demonized each other because it gave purpose, meaning, and unity. Maybe, just maybe, this could end that sort of destructive thinking once and for all.\n\nDragging his thoughts back to the present, Nole answered his companion. \"*I've had my fill of blood and bombs if you don't mind me saying Ma'am...I suppose it's just the shock of suddenly knowing Humans aren't so special in the grand scheme of things.*\"\n\nNataly's smile somewhat shortened, but didn't fully vanish. She took another sip before answering: \n\n\"*Perhaps you're right Captain. It may be uncouth for me to say this, but there are many on Earth who don't want things to go back to the way they were. I feel comfortable enough telling you this as I feel the same way.*\"\n\nNole smiled, genuinely, for the first time tonight.\n\nStill, he felt on edge. He had seen hundreds of combat missions and had seen some of the worst battle scenarios come to pass. He had seen young and bright-eyed men and women blown to bits by railgun slugs, he had almost lost an arm rescuing hostages on one of the Neptune gas refineries, and he had narrowly escaped a U.N.S.N. vessel that was about to be blown into atomic dust by nuclear torpedoes.\n\nHe tried to convince himself this was just his natural reaction to a singularly *unnatural* environment, but something in his bones told him to be on guard.\n\nHe was eager to continue the conversation with Nataly until the room blared with an extraordinarily loud voice asking all for their attention.\n\nThe event was organized by the alien race known as the Hegemites, an insect-like species that was apparently very well respected by the galactic community. Other big players were present, but none looked really antagonistic towards each other. Nole pondered how such complex systems were able to co-exist without conflict or even the tension of conflict.\n\nAs the Hegemite Ambassador took its place addressing the massive congregation of lifeforms, it gave special thanks to a delegation of crystalline aliens for providing the venue before rather suddenly giving special thanks to the Human ambassadors.\n\nThe voice of the Hegemite Ambassador was flute-like and extremely pleasing to the ears, which Nole, and Nataly by the curious look on her face, didn't really expect, considering the Ambassador's face was an extremely large collection of mandibles and harsh-looking proboscises. \n\n\n\"***We wish to give special consideration to the newly discovered fledgling sentients known as the Humans.***\"\n\nThe Ambassador lifted one of its chitin-plated arms out to the area where Nole and Nataly stood. He felt the many eyes of the hundreds of races of beings on him, and he felt another nervous pang in the pit of his stomach. He darted his eyes at Nataly, and saw that she was as cool as the water she was drinking.\n\n\"***When our probes first penetrated the outer edge of their system, we found them in vicious battle betwixt one another.***\"\n\n\"*Jesus Christ*\", Nole thought. We're going to look like monsters.\n\n \"***Brother slaying brother? We could not conceive of it. It was a conflict of resources, and discrimination among their own.\"***\n\nTo his surprise, the room suddenly filled with the short chortles of what appeared to be laughter. Even the Ambassador had a few small whistles of amusement.\n\n\"***A common occurrence when one thinks they are alone in the world. What made us truly inspired was what happened when our presence was discovered.***\"\n\n\"***How quick it was when your kind regained unity, and now you stand before creation, and know now your tree of life stands amidst a vast forest.***\"\n\nA choir of clapping sounded across the room, and Nole found himself slowly becoming at ease. \"*They're just ribbing us*\", he thought to himself. \"*Phew.*\"\n\n\"***We wish to toast to the sentients known as the Humans of Sol, those who so eagerly wish to ascend beyond their nature. This one asks all present to please raise your cups and drink full, if you're able, to newfound brotherhood, to creation's endless bounty!***\n\nNole again smiled, and look to to find Nataly also smiling deeply. He began to raise his arm to toast, but realized he didn't have a cup. Nataly saw this and quietly asked a server to bring him a cup of something, and the small creature zipped away and returned as quickly as he left with a rather enticing glass of water.\n\nThe room began to fill with the sounds of the different species' toasting rituals; a race of mean-looking aliens clashed their cups together like a gang of drunken bikers, and the group of gazelle-looking creatures next to them daintily tipped their glasses together while entwining their necks together in what reminded Nole of certain ancient Earth animals mating rituals.\n\n\"*To the Humans of Sol.*\", Nataly said as she raised her cup to Nole's, smiling.\n\n\"*To newfound brotherhood.*\", Nole replied. Nataly's smile almost completely disappeared as they drank.\n\nThe next moment Nole had no idea what had transpired, but he felt as if he had swallowed a chunk of molten lava. He dropped his glass, he remembered hearing it shatter on the floor as he dropped to his knees. He felt the adrenaline rushing through his bloodstream, and as he forced himself up he felt as though he was a dragon breathing fire, like one of the old Earth legends. He looked and saw Nataly and a crowd of concerned looking aliens helping raise him from the ground. He brushed off the crowd and stood up.\n\nWhat he saw when he stood up would haunt him for the rest of his days. The Hegemite Ambassador was writhing on the floor, gibbering in a singsong and frantically grasping at the silken robes on its insectoid frame.

VIPs, diplomats, politicians, you name it, give me the cash and I'll do it. I became known as the number 1 hitman soon enough, and no target ever survived an encounter with me. Today's target? A \"homo sapien\" by the name of Benjamin Miller, an ugly fellow what with his head fur and merely two beady eyes. Apparently his peace negotiations with the Flirghov made him quite the unpopular one.  \n\nI arranged to have dinner with him, a classy high end restaurant, and also the front for the most dangerous mafia for light years. A friend of mine bribed the chefs to lace his food with horrid chemicals, while mine remained harmless and delicious. Asbestos seasoned rigloc salad vs one laced with caffeine, or a classic loaf of yizlu bread with a pinch of theobromine, while mine had the homey taste of nitroglycerine.  \n\n*\"Thanks for having me over! It was a pain sitting in a conference room for 4 hours, I'm famished!\"* The soon to be damned buffoon was giggling and leaving an irritating smile, I can't wait to watch him die.

That's no good.\"* He reached for a glass of Hujix juice, that fool had no idea it had capsaicin in it, the slightest microgram can cause a regular silicon-based organism to melt into a puddle seconds after ingestion. His face flared up, red as liquid poured from the top of his head, see you in hell.\n\n*\"Woah woah woah! That's a little spicy!\"* What. *\"Caught me off guard, although the spice adds a little to it, reminds me of my sister's cocktails.\"* This was absurd, how did he survive not one, but two of the galaxy's most potent poisons!

        "body": "I was working as a body guard at the Galactic Summit for Fredrick, the human species representative for all things galactic and non-galactic, when we were informed of the attempt that had been made on his life. We rushed to gather as much information as we could, seized whatever evidence we could find, and rushed him to safety. After we secured our client we sent what evidence we found to a lab to be tested, we then monitored Fredrick for the next 24 hours to see if any major changes occurred before we got the results back.  \n\n\nFollowing the assassination attempt we had a meeting to discuss plans going forward involving ways to stop any further close calls. During the debriefing we were informed as to what exactly had been slipped to our client. Caffeine, theobromine, and capsaicin were all found in the remainder of his drink. Had Fredrick been a Sparneick, Lixua, or even a Tauxin he would've died immediately. After our meeting I went home and thought about how we very much could've been out of a job, about how his death could've been a smear on our name as a protective agency. But I had left thinking more about the substances more than the death we so narrowly avoided.  \n\n\nCaffeine, a playful substance that I had learned to require after working long days in my 20's as a data entry clerk. There were many times where I would ingest caffeine only to find myself on the crapper shortly after. I mean, was there like a special slide or path or some bullshit that made caffeine go directly to my ass?? Did my body just have a special talent of immediately absorbing caffeine just to make me shit as soon as possible? Had I been in Fredrick's position I'm sure I would've shit myself silly right on the spot. Granted, had that hypothetical situation really occurred, it would've only strengthened our relations with about 15 of the alien races present, seeing as to how I would've proposed to each of them or had showed extreme attraction and arousal. The poorly informed assassin had simply given our dignitary regular coffee, given how Fredrick was drinking a decaf latte.  \n\n\nCapsaicin was also present, a special substance that I have developed a love-hate relationship with. I learned early on that I have a \"weak tongue\" when it comes to capsaicin, seeing as how I would immediately start sweating and panting like a man standing out in a desert with no water. While I do enjoy the occasional spicy meal I have to ensure my schedule is free for the next day. After digesting whatever I ate the day prior I would be stuck on the toilet, my asshole becoming the gates of hell with the only things coming through being pain and fire. Fredrick had proven himself to be a man of tolerance, he didn't even blink upon realizing his drink had not only been recaffeinated but also filled with a hefty amount of spice.  \n\n\nNow for the last substance that was added to Fredrick's drink, a substance that everyone in the room seemed to know... except for me. Honestly once I heard the word \"theobromine\" I nodded, waited for an explanation as to what that meant, and then got nothing. From nobody. I even tried to find out from other coworkers by bringing it up after the meeting.  \n\n\n\"So, all that shit was found in his drink huh? Capsaicin, caffeine...\"  \n\"Yeah, it was kind of crazy that they got all of those in his drink.\"  \n\"... yeah, especially that last one...\"  \n\"Yup, must've been a real professional. I mean, how professional can you be to have your one chance and not have done the research to know you just gave him everything he liked! Haha!\"  \n\"Yeah, ha ha… So then you're saying he liked spicy coffee with...?\"  \n\"Actually what's funny is he was already drinking coffee! Anyways I'm going to go ahead and take off.\"  \n\n\nSo afterwards I left, drove home, picked up some fast food on the way, got home, ate, laid down, and whipped out my phone to look up that word. \"Bitter alkaloid of the cacao plant... found in chocolate\" had been all I gleaned from my search. A part of me was so tired I didn't fucking care. Another part of me was so disappointed in the fact that they had, from my understanding, given him spicy chocolate coffee. Talk about lucky, and Fredrick sure was lucky. Especially considering that every dignitary at the summit EXCEPT for Fredrick had died.  \n\n\nWe fucking made bank being the only protective agency that didn't lose their client that day. Not only did our boss ham it up saying he took protective measures knowing something would happen but also Fredrick had spoken about how professional we were!! I'd give that man a kiss on the lips if he hadn't been shot through the chest two days later. But hey, he wasn't our client anymore and *that* only made us look better.",

Not the flavour, the colour. An orange semi-transparent liquid whose contents could not be explained using any human language. \n\n\"Bloody hell, that's good,\" Lexi whispered to herself.

Like she was dreaming. \n\n\"Poisoned, I would say,\" Lukas said. His and Tom's eyes met, and they looked to Lexi. \n\nShe looked down at herself. \"I don't feel ill.\" She actually felt quite good.

After checking for traps or hazards, he looked at the pad. \"I'm still learning the Galvanian language,\" he said, \"but this looks to me like an atmospheric pressure warning.\" He read the message, his eyes slowly widening, his mouth dropping.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Pressure loss.\" He looked to her, his face pale and his hands trembling. \"To the entire station.\"",

        "body": "Kai’s 3 hearts were racing, but on the outside he was as calm and collected as ever. His antennae didn’t even twitch.\r  \n\r  \nHe was the best of the best; a true professional, which is why the Tripodiferons didn’t hesitate to give him his full payment upfront. They knew there was no risk to him leaving a mess or not finishing the job.\r  \n\r  \nMost of the in the Galactic Alliance looked down on humans as naïve, smug, and over-entitled. Although Kai agreed that it was a little embarrassing how long it took them to make first contact with another galactic race after achieving space travel, the Opditromicors doing the galactic equivalent of landing on their nose before figuring out that they weren’t the only ones in the galaxy, he didn’t have anything against them personally. But Kai was always careful to keep emotions and business separate.\r  \n\r  \nIt was risky, but Kai liked to keep close to the target to make sure the job was complete. The plan this time was simple, pose as a server during the dinner before the first day of the Galactic Summit, administer the poison into the human ambassador’s meal, and when the job was done use the intergalactic teleportation device he smuggled in to make his escape.\r  \n\r  \nCarrying the human ambassador’s requested dish to his seat, Kai couldn’t help but notice the quantity and strange appearance of the human food. The ambassador had requested his first course to consist of “two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish, and a large chocolate shake”. \r  \n\r  \nKai had thought the human ambassador was strange looking when he had seen him in the past on the Galactic News Network holograms, but seeing him in person he looked even more unique. He was large in the stomach region, like many of the humans, but the fur on his head is what really drew Kai’s attention. Though he clearly had no fur on the top of his head, the fur on the side of his head had been molded and shaped with what must have been many chemicals and the labor of several humans to appear as if there were fur growing on top, and closely resembled the pelt of a small Brumachrofon. And although Kai knew that humans had a variety of skin tones in their species, the bright orange hue of the ambassador’s was something that Kai hadn’t seen in another human.\r  \n\r  \n“I don’t know what kind of food you usually eat in this shithole, but you have to try this sometime. Human food is fantastic, the greatest in the galaxy, actually. Like everything we make, just terrific. Don’t listen to what the liberals tell you, with the global warming and the poverty and the yada-yada, we really are tremendous.” Kai overheard the human ambassador saying to the Opditromicorian ambassador sitting next to him, who was already obviously uncomfortable and annoyed. The human didn’t waste any time digging into his meal, peeling away the wrapping from his human dish and taking the first bites when Kai was only a few steps away from his seat. \r  \n\r  \nThe poison that Kai chose was fast-acting, mimicked the symptoms of heart-failure, and was impossible to trace. Usually the victim dies in under 30-minutes, silently slumping over to meet their fate. Which is why Kai was very surprised with what he heard behind him as he was walking back towards the kitchen.\r  \n\r  \n“Holy SHIT! Where did you get this Big Mac from, Mexico?!”, the human ambassador screamed through labored breathing and intense coughing. “They steal our jobs, won’t pay for my wall (which is also tremendous, by the way) and now you’re making me eat their spicy Mexican Big Macs?!?! I’m going to need two more chocolate shakes over here!”\r  \n\r  \nOk, onto plan-B, thought Kai as he continued making his way to the kitchen to get the human his additional “chocolate shakes”. Luckily he had a few more poisons that he could try, and it was clear to him that the human was going to be having many courses in which to administer them.\r  \n\r  \nWhen he was about to open the door Kai heard a huge commotion behind him. He quickly turned around and noticed waves of dozens of humans overwhelming the Galactic Summit security. Like the human ambassador, they were all also very large in the stomach region, but much paler and with a lot more fur on their faces. \r  \n\r  \n“Make the Milky Way great again! Trump for Galactic Emperor!” Kai could hear them screaming as the human mob continued swarming their way into the dining area. “Get the commies out of our galaxy!”\r  \n\r  \nAlthough the situation for the other members of the Galactic Summit looked precarious at the moment, Kai knew that the human mob currently overtaking the Galactic Summit security would shortly be taken care of. They would likely sentenced to 3,000 Earth-years of time-dilated solitary confinement in the prison within Sagittarius A, the human ambassador will be expelled from the summit, and the Tripodiferons will be happy even though (for the first time ever) he didn’t finish the job.\r  \n\r  \nWho knows, maybe in another 300,000 Earth-years the humans will be evolved enough to peacefully join the Summit.",

I experienced shaking 5 years ago, now only feel slightest jitter if drank really a lot. \n\nAbout the mechanism: I don't know exactly, but assume that there are several receptors that caffeine binds to (Adenosine A1 and Adenosine A2 as well as other minor targets). These receptors are located in various areas of the brain/nervous system and/so their response to habitual caffeine exposure may be different. For example Adenosine A1 will still cause exactly the same heart palpitation, tremor effect, while A2 waking effects will dissappear. It's because Adenosine A2 receptors antagonism (blockade) will cause changes which in turn will cause number of A2 receptors to increase (which is called downregulation) which in turn will decrease actions of caffeine to this area of the brain. So A2 tolerance may develop much faster than A1 tolerance or something like that. Btw A2 is not so directly mentally stimulating itself. A2 antagonism causes striatal dopamine release (which we call \"want\" chemical, but it's more complicated, it causes some mental arousal as well), acetylcholine release, etc. Dopamine release may be decreased independently from the above mechanism too. You see, brain is quite complicated as a system and it's research is limited in measures and difficult. BTW I may be wrong in my statements.",

    "body": "So there I (39N) was in a rural Shaws. For those not in an area with a Shaws, it's a standard supermarket with a \"club\" that makes things \"cheaper\" which is their way of hiding their markup. Stuff is just cheaper a few miles down the road. Unfortunately there were a few things I could only get there like my flavor of ~~lifeblood~~ caffeine and food for the dogs.\n\nI was using my power chair, which back then I needed more often. It's an Eagle HD foldable deal, and it works great. I had been hit pretty hard by post-covid and was very sedentary at that time in my life, along with a preexisting joint problem.\n\nSo I'm leaning forward to get a flat of Monster and stick it under my seat on the rack when a woman pushes on my back and says, \"I need that, you don't, you're younger.\" As I was belted in, nothing happened. It was only luck that I was belted in, usually I would've undone it to pick up something heavy.\n\nI sat up and pushed her hands off of me saying, \"what the fuck?!\" And she *shakes the back of my chair* like it's a dinner chair or something, and goes, \"You can use the scooter, the chair is better and I'm old.\" and she points at the shitty supermarket scooter she's using. I stare at her in total shock for a moment and say, \"...this is *my* wheelchair. Get away from me.\"\n\n\"You can't use personal stuff in supermarkets! Give. Me. The chair!\" She started like, shaking it with each statement. So at that point I just hit the maximum speed on my power chair and took off, ripping it out of her hands. It was either let go or be dragged on her face because she clearly wasn't super steady and needed a scooter herself.\n\nAnd we're off on the dumbest chase in creation mostly because supermarket scooters go slower than any other mobility device. I buzzed over to the service desk and cut the line and said, \"I'm sorry, I'm really sorry but there's a woman following me trying to push me out of my chair and take it.\" And from behind me they can hear, \"GIIIIIT BAAAACK HEEEEEERRE\" and the most wheezy buzzzzzz of the slow scooter.\n\nIn the moment it was really enraging that she was being so entitled and frustrating and I just wanted to get my dog food and leave. But in memory it was the funniest thing I've ever seen. They let me in to the little back office area, and they and the whole line of people waiting just sort of watched as she came over.\n\nAnd it took SO LONG. The scooter was SO SLOW and she's yelling about how I don't need the chair and how she should get it because she's older and more disabled. It takes like a full 20 seconds for her to get from one end of the store to the other and everyone is just staring as she rides full of glory at .00001 mi per hour with her face red and her glasses hanging off one ear.\n\nSo she finally gets to the desk, and they calmly explain that the wheelchair isn't store property, and if she tries to steal from another customer they'll have to call the police. She starts shouting at the employees that she knows full well you can't bring personal equipment into the supermarket, so they're lying. And the other woman behind the counter says with a bit more attitude, \"Lady, why do you think we care if you bring a wheelchair into the supermarket?\"\n\nAt this point I think like... Something either clicked, or she just realized that an entire line of people were staring at her, and not kindly. She suddenly asked where to find the artichokes. I almost coughed on my own spit. The worker just stared back and pointed back where the woman had come and said, \"...produce?\" And the woman left. I admit that for the rest of my visit I avoided any aisle she was in because I didn't want her close enough to grab me again.\n\nNow I can laugh about it for the absurdist comedy moment it was. In retrospect I feel there's a reason here - like her husband told her they shouldn't buy a thing like I had because they're not allowed to be in the supermarket. That's the best answer I can possibly come up with for that wild nonsense. Wherever you are, crazy lady, I hope you bought your own Eagle HD.\n\n\\--\n\nCommonly asked questions:\n\n*How could you fit a flat of Monster energy drink on your wheelchair?* \n\nCheck out the Eagle HD on Discover My Mobility ([https://www.discovermymobility.com/](https://www.discovermymobility.com/)). It has a rack underneath the seat and while the flat doesn't fit IN the basket, it sits on top of the arms of the basket evenly. To add to that, I usually hang bags from the arms I can put things into. Also, *please some of you* consider that disabled people need to carry stuff too when you say it's impossible? How do you think we shop? \n\n*You should call to get the video!*\n\nInterestingly someone on the post is connecting me with a regional person who might have any ability to get it. We'll see. It's very likely been recorded over since it was three years ago.\n\n*What is 39N?*\n\nI was thirty-nine when the story took place, and I'm nonbinary. My license says X under gender, but X is a social media platform so I put N. I'm not sure how y'all expect me to do it. Should I say 39 Alien Freak next time to make people happier? ;) Lots of mouth-breathing comments on this but I don't care. I am what I am and that's okay with me. \n\n*Why didn't you immediately call the cops and have her arrested?!*\n\nHave you ever lived in a rural town? It's actually really hard to get the cops to do ANYTHING about ANYthing in a rural town for a variety of reasons. Getting cops to arrest an old lady in a small town would be nigh impossible and stupid. They'd be crucified by the public no matter WHAT she was doing. Also, I'm trans. I know a lot of folks aren't, and they don't get it, but being trans means not wanting to deal with cops. There's very few narratives where the disabled trans person comes out better than the old lady who will probably immediately turn sweet and start weeping and sobbing the second someone calls her out. \n\nPeople like to jump to \"the cops\" as if they're a blanket solution for problems, but in the VAST amount of interpersonal situations, the cops say, \"That's a civil matter\" and walk away. I can almost promise you that since she had **not** actually **stolen** my chair, they'd just have talked to her and left. Even with footage, yes. Because that was a funny video, not an actual danger. I didn't call them because that would've been potentially hours around cops and there were hungry dogs at home.\n\n*You should stand up for yourself.*\n\nThank you, I did, by going and taking the best legal and socially acceptable way out. It's very easy to armchair quarterback someone else's life from the sidelines but you know, most situations don't end with a verbal or physical confrontation that has swelling orchestral moments and a drop beat on the big punch. Most of them end with annoyance and a sense that my day was disrupted with no resolution. It would be great to give you that resolution with some badass story of me standing up to a bully, but that's not what actually happened. Instead it was a really unthinking old lady who just needed to be kept at a distance until she could understand reality.\n\nAnd finally, a giant thank you to everyone who gave compliments to the story and narrative. In case I miss replying to any individual comments, I appreciate them all. Next time I'll share the story of why I ended up hiding from eight toddlers under a table.",

For what?!\n\n-Coffee shouldn’t be used to wake yourself up. As per studies, you’re supposed to let your cortisol rise naturally in the morning and then have coffee, and you experience the benefits without allowing coffee to hijack your receptors. Ample studies on this.\n\nI drink one single cup every morning, an hour or two after I wake up and stretch/walk. I sleep perfectly fine, never use it for energy. Nor do I drink it later in the day as it’s half life is too long and will disrupt my sleep. It’s just a meditative thing for me/enjoyment.\n\nCoffee is incredibly healthy for people.
